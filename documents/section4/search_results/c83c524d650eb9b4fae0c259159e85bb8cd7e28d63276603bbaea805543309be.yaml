    \ economy. Pressure on the agricultural system will\nincrease with the continuing\
    \ expansion of the human population. Agri-technology and precision\nfarming, now\
    \ also termed digital agriculture, have arisen as new scientiﬁc ﬁelds that use\
    \ data\nintense approaches to drive agricultural productivity while minimizing\
    \ its environmental impact.\nThe data generated in modern agricultural operations\
    \ is provided by a variety of different sensors that\nenable a better understanding\
    \ of the operational environment (an interaction of dynamic crop, soil,\nand weather\
    \ conditions) and the operation itself (machinery data), leading to more accurate\
    \ and faster\ndecision making.\nMachine learning (ML) has emerged together with\
    \ big data technologies and high-performance\ncomputing to create new opportunities\
    \ to unravel, quantify, and understand data intensive processes\nin agricultural\
    \ operational environments. Among other deﬁnitions, ML is deﬁned as the scientiﬁc\
    \ ﬁeld\nthat gives machines the ability to learn without being strictly programmed\
    \ [1]. Year by year, ML applies\nin more and more scientiﬁc ﬁelds including, for\
    \ example, bioinformatics [2,3], biochemistry [4,5],\nSensors 2018, 18, 2674;\

    In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the application of ML in agriculture.\n\
    A number of relevant papers are presented that emphasise key and unique features\
    \ of popular\nML models. The structure of the present work is as follows: the\

    \ Learning\n2.1. Machine Learning Terminology and Deﬁnitions\nTypically, ML methodologies\
    \ involves a learning process with the objective to learn from\n“experience” (training\
    \ data) to perform a task. Data in ML consists of a set of examples. Usually,\n\
    an individual example is described by a set of attributes, also known as features\
    \ or variables. A feature\ncan be nominal (enumeration), binary (i.e., 0 or 1),\
    \ ordinal (e.g., A+ or B−), or numeric (integer, real\nSensors 2018, 18, 2674\n\
    4 of 29\nnumber, etc.). The performance of the ML model in a speciﬁc task is measured\
    \ by a performance\nmetric that is improved with experience over time. To calculate\
    \ the performance of ML models and\nalgorithms, various statistical and mathematical\
    \ models are used. After the end of the learning process,\nthe trained model can\
    \ be used to classify, predict, or cluster new examples (testing data) using the\n\
    experience obtained during the training process. Figure 1 shows a typical ML approach.\n\

    \ \nFigure 1. A typical machine learning approach. \nML tasks are typically classified into different broad categories depending on the learning type \n\
    (supervised/unsupervised), \nlearning \nmodels \n(classification, \nregression, \n\
    clustering, \nand \ndimensionality reduction), or the learning models employed to implement the selected task. \n\
    2.2. Tasks of Learning \nML tasks are classified into two main categories, that is, supervised and unsupervised learning, \n\
    depending on the learning signal of the learning system. In supervised learning, data are presented \n\
    with example inputs and the corresponding outputs, and the objective is to construct a general rule \n\
    that maps inputs to outputs. In some cases, inputs can be only partially available with some of the \n\
    target  outputs  missing  or  given  only  as  feedback  to  the  actions  in \
    \ a  dynamic  environment \n(reinforcement learning). In the supervised setting, the acquired expertise (trained model) is used to \n\
    predict the missing outputs (labels) for the test data. In unsupervised learning, however, there is no \n\
    distinction between training and test sets with data being unlabeled. The learner processes input data \n\
    with the goal of discovering hidden patterns. \n2.3. Analysis of Learning \nDimensionality reduction (DR) is an analysis that is executed in both families of supervised and \n\
    unsupervised  learning  types,  with  the  aim  of  providing  a  more  compact, \
    \ lower‐dimensional \nrepresentation of a dataset to preserve as much information as possible from the original data. It is \n\
    usually performed prior to applying a classification or regression model in order to avoid the effects \n\
    of dimensionality. Some of the most common DR algorithms are the following: (i) principal component \n\
    analysis [22], (ii) partial least squares regression [23], and (iii) linear discriminant analysis [24]. \n\
    2.4. Learning Models \nThe presentation of the learning models in ML is limited to the ones that have been implemented \n\
    in works presented in this review. \n2.4.1. Regression \nRegression constitutes a supervised learning model, which aims to provide the prediction of an \n\
    output variable according to the input variables, which are known. Most known algorithms include \n\
    linear regression and logistic regression [25], as well as stepwise regression [26]. Also, more complex \n\
    regression  algorithms  have  been  developed,  such  as  ordinary  least  squares \
    \ regression  [27], \nmultivariate  adaptive  regression  splines  [28],  multiple \
    \ linear  regression,  cubist  [29],  and  locally \nestimated scatterplot smoothing [30]. \n\
    Figure 1. A typical machine learning approach.\nML tasks are typically classiﬁed\
    \ into different broad categories depending on the learning type\n(supervised/unsupervised),\
    \ learning models (classiﬁcation, regression, clustering, and dimensionality\n\
    reduction), or the learning models employed to implement the selected task.\n\
    2.2. Tasks of Learning\nML tasks are classiﬁed into two main categories, that\
    \ is, supervised and unsupervised learning,\ndepending on the learning signal\
    \ of the learning system. In supervised learning, data are presented\nwith example\
    \ inputs and the corresponding outputs, and the objective is to construct a general\
    \ rule that\nmaps inputs to outputs. In some cases, inputs can be only partially\
    \ available with some of the target\noutputs missing or given only as feedback\
    \ to the actions in a dynamic environment (reinforcement\nlearning). In the supervised\
    \ setting, the acquired expertise (trained model) is used to predict the\nmissing\
    \ outputs (labels) for the test data. In unsupervised learning, however, there\
    \ is no distinction\nbetween training and test sets with data being unlabeled.\
    \ The learner processes input data with the\ngoal of discovering hidden patterns.\n\
    2.3. Analysis of Learning\nDimensionality reduction (DR) is an analysis that is\
    \ executed in both families of supervised\nand unsupervised learning types, with\
    \ the aim of providing a more compact, lower-dimensional\nrepresentation of a\
    \ dataset to preserve as much information as possible from the original data.\
    \ It is\nusually performed prior to applying a classiﬁcation or regression model\
    \ in order to avoid the effects of\ndimensionality. Some of the most common DR\
    \ algorithms are the following: (i) principal component\nanalysis [22], (ii) partial\
    \ least squares regression [23], and (iii) linear discriminant analysis [24].\n\
    2.4. Learning Models\nThe presentation of the learning models in ML is limited\
    \ to the ones that have been implemented\nin works presented in this review.\n\
    2.4.1. Regression\nRegression constitutes a supervised learning model, which aims\
    \ to provide the prediction of an\noutput variable according to the input variables,\
    \ which are known. Most known algorithms include\nlinear regression and logistic\
    \ regression [25], as well as stepwise regression [26]. Also, more complex\nregression\
    \ algorithms have been developed, such as ordinary least squares regression [27],\
    \ multivariate\nSensors 2018, 18, 2674\n5 of 29\nadaptive regression splines [28],\
    \ multiple linear regression, cubist [29], and locally estimated scatterplot\n\
    smoothing [30].\n2.4.2. Clustering\nClustering [31] is a typical application of\
    \ unsupervised learning model, typically used to\nﬁnd natural groupings of data\
    \ (clusters). Well established clustering techniques are the k-means\ntechnique\
    \ [32], the hierarchical technique [33], and the expectation maximisation technique\
    \ [34].\n2.4.3. Bayesian Models\nBayesian models (BM) are a family of probabilistic\
    \ graphical models in which the analysis is\nundertaken within the context of\
    \ Bayesian inference. This type of model belongs to the supervised\nlearning category\
    \ and can be employed for solving either classiﬁcation or regression problems.\n\
    Naive bayes [35], gaussian naive bayes, multinomial naive bayes, bayesian network\
    \ [36], mixture\nof gaussians [37], and bayesian belief network [38] are some\
    \ of the most prominent algorithms in\nthe literature.\n2.4.4. Instance Based\
    \ Models\nInstance based models (IBM) are memory-based models that learn by comparing\
    \ new examples\nwith instances in the training database. They construct hypotheses\
    \ directly from the data available,\nwhile they do not maintain a set of abstractions,\
    \ and generate classiﬁcation or regression predictions\nusing only speciﬁc instances.\
    \ The disadvantage of these models is that their complexity grows with\ndata.\
    \ The most common learning algorithms in this category are the k-nearest neighbor\
    \ [39], locally\nweighted learning [40], and learning vector quantization [41].\n\
    2.4.5. Decision Trees\nDecision trees (DT) are classiﬁcation or regression models\
    \ formulated in a tree-like\narchitecture [42]. With DT, the dataset is progressively\
    \ organized in smaller homogeneous subsets\n(sub-populations), while at the same\
    \ time, an associated tree graph is generated. Each internal node\nof the tree\
    \ structure represents a different pairwise comparison on a selected feature,\
    \ whereas each\nbranch represents the outcome of this comparison. Leaf nodes represent\
    \ the ﬁnal decision or prediction\ntaken after following the path from root to\
    \ leaf (expressed as a classiﬁcation rule). The most common\nlearning algorithms\
    \ in this category are the classiﬁcation and regression trees [43], the chi-square\n\
    automatic interaction detector [44], and the iterative dichotomiser [45].\n2.4.6.\
    \ Artiﬁcial Neural Networks\nArtiﬁcial neural networks (ANNs) are divided into\
    \ two categories; “Traditional ANNs” and\n“Deep ANNs”.\nANNs are inspired by the\
    \ human brain functionality, emulating complex functions such as\npattern generation,\
    \ cognition, learning, and decision making [46]. The human brain consists of billions\n\
    of neurons that inter-communicate and process any information provided. Similarly,\
    \ an ANN as a\nsimpliﬁed model of the structure of the biological neural network,\
    \ consists of interconnected processing\nunits organized in a speciﬁc topology.\
    \ A number of nodes are arranged in multiple layers including\nthe following:\n\
    1.\nAn input layer where the data is fed into the system,\n2.\nOne or more hidden\
    \ layers where the learning takes place, and\n3.\nAn output layer where the decision/prediction\
    \ is given.\nSensors 2018, 18, 2674\n6 of 29\nANNs are supervised models that\
    \ are typically used for regression and classiﬁcation problems.\nThe learning\
    \ algorithms commonly used in ANNs include the radial basis function networks\
    \ [47],\nperceptron algorithms [48], back-propagation [49], and resilient back-propagation\
    \ [50]. Also, a large\nnumber of ANN-based learning algorithms have been reported,\
    \ such as counter propagation\nalgorithms [51], adaptive-neuro fuzzy inference\
    \ systems [52], autoencoder, XY-Fusion, and supervised\nKohonen networks [53],\
    \ as well as Hopﬁeld networks [54], multilayer perceptron [55], self-organising\n\
    maps [56], extreme learning machines [57], generalized regression neural network\
    \ [58], ensemble neural\nnetworks or ensemble averaging, and self-adaptive evolutionary\
    \ extreme learning machines [59].\nDeep ANNs are most widely referred to as deep\
    \ learning (DL) or deep neural networks\n(DNNs) [60]. They are a relatively new\
    \ area of ML research allowing computational models that\nare composed of multiple\
    \ processing layers to learn complex data representations using multiple\nlevels\
    \ of abstraction. One of the main advantages of DL is that in some cases, the\
    \ step of feature\nextraction is performed by the model itself. DL models have\
    \ dramatically improved the state-of-the-art\nin many different sectors and industries,\
    \ including agriculture. DNN’s are simply an ANN with\nmultiple hidden layers\
    \ between the input and output layers and can be either supervised, partially\n\
    supervised, or even unsupervised. A common DL model is the convolutional neural\
    \ network (CNN),\nwhere feature maps are extracted by performing convolutions\
    \ in the image domain. A comprehensive\nintroduction on CNNs is given in the literature\
    \ [61]. Other typical DL architectures include deep\nBoltzmann machine, deep belief\
    \ network [62], and auto-encoders [63].\n2.4.7. Support Vector Machines\nSupport\
    \ vector machines (SVMs) were ﬁrst introduced in the work of [64] on the foundation\
    \ of\nstatistical learning theory. SVM is intrinsically a binary classiﬁer that\
    \ constructs a linear separating\nhyperplane to classify data instances. The classiﬁcation\
    \ capabilities of traditional SVMs can be\nsubstantially enhanced through transformation\
    \ of the original feature space into a feature space of\na higher dimension by\
    \ using the “kernel trick”. SVMs have been used for classiﬁcation, regression,\n\
    and clustering. Based on global optimization, SVMs deal with overﬁtting problems,\
    \ which appear\nin high-dimensional spaces, making them appealing in various applications\
    \ [65,66]. Most used SVM\nalgorithms include the support vector regression [67],\
    \ least squares support vector machine [68],\nand successive projection algorithm-support\
    \ vector machine [69].\n2.4.8. Ensemble Learning\nEnsemble learning (EL) models\
    \ aim at improving the predictive performance of a given statistical\nlearning\
    \ or model ﬁtting technique by constructing a linear combination of simpler base\
    \ learner.\nConsidering that each trained ensemble represents a single hypothesis,\
    \ these multiple-classiﬁer systems\nenable hybridization of hypotheses not induced\
    \ by the same base learner, thus yielding better results in\nthe case of signiﬁcant\
    \ diversity among the single models. Decision trees have been typically used as\
    \ the\nbase learner in EL models, for example, random forest [70], whereas a large\
    \ number of boosting and\nbagging implementations have been also proposed, for\
    \ example, boosting technique [71], adaboost [72],\nand bootstrap aggregating\
    \ or bagging algorithm [73].\n3. Review\nThe reviewed articles have been, on a\
    \ ﬁrst level, classiﬁed in four generic categories; namely, crop\nmanagement,\
    \ livestock management, water management, and soil management. The applications\
    \ of\nML in the crop section were divided into sub-categories including yield\
    \ prediction, disease detection,\nweed detection crop quality, and species recognition.\
    \ The applications of ML in the livestock section\nwere divided into two sub-categories;\
    \ animal welfare and livestock production.\nSensors 2018, 18, 2674\n7 of 29\n\
    The search engines implemented were Scopus, ScienceDirect and PubMed. The selected\
    \ articles\nregard works presented solely in journal papers. Climate prediction,\
    \ although very important for\nagricultural production, has not been included\
    \ in the presented review, considering the fact that ML\napplications for climate\
    \ prediction is a complete area by itself. Finally, all articles presented here\
    \ regard\nthe period from 2004 up to the present.\n3.1. Crop Management\n3.1.1.\
    \ Yield Prediction\nYield prediction, one of the most signiﬁcant topics in precision\
    \ agriculture, is of high importance\nfor yield mapping, yield estimation, matching\
    \ of crop supply with demand, and crop management to\nincrease productivity. Examples\
    \ of ML applications include in those in the works of [74]; an efﬁcient,\nlow-cost,\
    \ and non-destructive method that automatically counted coffee fruits on a branch.\
    \ The method\ncalculates the coffee fruits in three categories: harvestable, not\
    \ harvestable, and fruits with disregarded\nmaturation stage. In addition, the\
    \ method estimated the weight and the maturation percentage of the\ncoffee fruits.\
    \ The aim of this work was to provide information to coffee growers to optimise\
    \ economic\nbeneﬁts and plan their agricultural work. Another study that used\
    \ for yield prediction is that by\nthe authors of [75], in which they developed\
    \ a machine vision system for automating shaking and\ncatching cherries during\
    \ harvest. The system segments and detects occluded cherry branches with\nfull\
    \ foliage even when these are inconspicuous. The main aim of the system was to\
    \ reduce labor\nrequirements in manual harvesting and handling operations. In\
    \ another study [76], authors developed\nan early yield mapping system for the\
    \ identiﬁcation of immature green citrus in a citrus grove under\noutdoor conditions.\
    \ As all other relative studies, the aim of the study was to provide growers with\n\
    yield-speciﬁc information to assist them to optimise their grove in terms of proﬁt\
    \ and increased yield.\nIn another study [77], the authors developed a model for\
    \ the estimation of grassland biomass (kg dry\nmatter/ha/day) based on ANNs and\
    \ multitemporal remote sensing data. Another study dedicated\nto yield prediction,\
    \ and speciﬁcally to wheat yield prediction, was presented in another study [78].\n\
    The developed method used satellite imagery and received crop growth characteristics\
    \ fused with\nsoil data for a more accurate prediction. The authors of [79] presented\
    \ a method for the detection of\ntomatoes based on EM and remotely sensed red\
    \ green blue (RGB) images, which were captured by an\nunmanned aerial vehicle\
    \ (UAV). Also, in the work of [80], authors developed a method for the rice\n\
    development stage prediction based on SVM and basic geographic information obtained\
    \ from weather\nstations in China. Finally, a generalized method for agricultural\
    \ yield predictions, was presented in\nanother study [81]. The method is based\

    \ Detection\nDisease detection and yield prediction are the sub-categories with\
    \ the higher number of articles\npresented in this review. One of the most signiﬁcant\
    \ concerns in agriculture is pest and disease\ncontrol in open-air (arable farming)\
    \ and greenhouse conditions. The most widely used practice\nin pest and disease\
    \ control is to uniformly spray pesticides over the cropping area. This practice,\n\
    although effective, has a high ﬁnancial and signiﬁcant environmental cost. Environmental\
    \ impacts\ncan be residues in crop products, side effects on ground water contamination,\
    \ impacts on local\nwildlife and eco-systems, and so on. ML is an integrated part\
    \ of precision agriculture management,\nwhere agro-chemicals input is targeted\
    \ in terms of time and place. In the literature [82], a tool\nis presented for\
    \ the detection and discrimination of healthy Silybum marianum plants and those\n\
    infected by smut fungus Microbotyum silybum during vegetative growth. In the work\
    \ of [83], authors\ndeveloped a new method based on image processing procedure\
    \ for the classiﬁcation of parasites\nand the automatic detection of thrips in\
    \ strawberry greenhouse environment, for real-time control.\nThe authos of [84]\
    \ presented a method for detection and screening of Bakanae disease in rice seedlings.\n\
    More speciﬁcally, the aim of the study was the accurate detection of pathogen\
    \ Fusarium fujikuroi for\ntwo rice cultivars. The automated detection of infected\
    \ plants increased grain yield and was less\ntime-consuming compared with naked\
    \ eye examination.\nWheat is one of the most economically signiﬁcant crops worldwide.\
    \ The last ﬁve studies presented\nin this sub-category are dedicated to the detection\
    \ and discrimination between diseased and healthy\nwheat crops. The authors of\
    \ [85] developed a new system for the detection of nitrogen stressed,\nand yellow\
    \ rust infected and healthy winter wheat canopies based on hierarchical self-organizing\n\
    classiﬁer and hyperspectral reﬂectance imaging data. The study aimed at the accurate\
    \ detection of these\ncategories for a more effective usage of fungicides and\
    \ fertilizers according to the plant’s needs. In the\nnext case study [86], the\
    \ development of a system was presented that automatically discriminated\nbetween\
    \ water stressed Septoria tritici infected and healthy winter wheat canopies.\
    \ The approach used\nan least squares (LS)-SVM classiﬁer with optical multisensor\
    \ fusion. The authors of [87] presented a\nmethod to detect either yellow rust\
    \ infected or healthy wheat, based on ANN models and spectral\nreﬂectance features.\
    \ The accurate detection of either infected or healthy plants enables the precise\n\
    targeting of pesticides in the ﬁeld. In the work of [88], a real time remote sensing\
    \ system is presented\nfor the detection of yellow rust infected and healthy wheat.\
    \ The system is based on a self-organising\nmap (SOM) neural network and data\
    \ fusion of hyper-spectral reﬂection and multi-spectral ﬂuorescence\nimaging.\
    \ The goal of the study was the accurate detection, before it can visibly detected,\
    \ of yellow\nrust infected winter wheat cultivar “Madrigal”. Finally, the authors\
    \ of [89] presented a method for\nthe simultaneous identiﬁcation and discrimination\
    \ of yellow rust infected, and nitrogen stressed and\nhealthy wheat plants of\
    \ cultivar “Madrigal”. The approach is based on an SOM neural network and\nhyperspectral\
    \ reﬂectance imaging. The aim of the study was the accurate discrimination between\n\
    the plant stress, which is caused by disease and nutrient deﬁciency stress under\
    \ ﬁeld conditions.\nFinally, the author of [90] presented a CNN-based method for\
    \ the disease detection diagnosis based\non simple leaves images with sufﬁcient\
    \ accuracy to classify between healthy and diseased leaves in\nvarious plants.\n\

    Weed detection and management is another signiﬁcant problem in agriculture. Many\
    \ producers\nindicate weeds as the most important threat to crop production. The\
    \ accurate detection of weeds is\nof high importance to sustainable agriculture,\
    \ because weeds are difﬁcult to detect and discriminate\nfrom crops. Again, ML\
    \ algorithms in conjunction with sensors can lead to accurate detection and\n\
    discrimination of weeds with low cost and with no environmental issues and side\
    \ effects. ML for\nweed detection can enable the development of tools and robots\
    \ to destroy weeds, which minimise\nthe need for herbicides. Two studies on ML\
    \ applications for weed detection issues in agriculture\nhave been presented.\
    \ In the ﬁrst study [91], authors presented a new method based on counter\npropagation\
    \ (CP)-ANN and multispectral images captured by unmanned aircraft systems (UAS)\
    \ for\nthe identiﬁcation of Silybum marianum, a weed that is hard to eradicate\
    \ and causes major loss on\ncrop yield. In the second study [92], the authors\
    \ developed a new method based on ML techniques\nand hyperspectral imaging, for\
    \ crop and weed species recognition. More speciﬁcally, the authors\ncreated an\
    \ active learning system for the recognition of Maize (Zea mayas), as crop plant\
    \ species\nand Ranunculus repens, Cirsium arvense, Sinapis arvensis, Stellaria\
    \ media, Tarraxacum ofﬁcinale,\nPoa annua, Polygonum persicaria, Urtica dioica,\
    \ Oxalis europaea, and Medicago lupulina as weed\nspecies. The main goal was the\
    \ accurate recognition and discrimination of these species for economic\nand environmental\
    \ purposes. In another study [93], the authors developed a weed detection method\n\
    based on SVN in grassland cropping.\nTable 7 summarizes the above papers for the\

    \ crop category is studies developed for the identiﬁcation\nof features connected\
    \ with the crop quality. The accurate detection and classiﬁcation of crop quality\n\
    characteristics can increase product price and reduce waste. In the ﬁrst study\
    \ [94], the authors presented\nand developed a new method for the detection and\
    \ classiﬁcation of botanical and non-botanical\nforeign matter embedded inside\
    \ cotton lint during harvesting. The aim of the study was quality\nimprovement\
    \ while the minimising ﬁber damage. Another study [95] regards pears production\
    \ and,\nmore speciﬁcally, a method was presented for the identiﬁcation and differentiation\
    \ of Korla fragrant\npears into deciduous-calyx or persistent-calyx categories.\
    \ The approach applied ML methods with\nhyperspectral reﬂectance imaging. The\
    \ ﬁnal study for this sub-category was by the authors of [96],\nin which a method\
    \ was presented for the prediction and classiﬁcation of the geographical origin\
    \ for\nSensors 2018, 18, 2674\n14 of 29\nrice samples. The method was based on\
    \ ML techniques applied on chemical components of samples.\nMore speciﬁcally,\
    \ the main goal was the classiﬁcation of the geographical origin of rice, for\
    \ two\ndifferent climate regions in Brazil; Goias and Rio Grande do Sul. The results\
    \ showed that Cd, Rb, Mg,\nand K are the four most relevant chemical components\
    \ for the classiﬁcation of samples.\nTable 8 summarizes the above presented articles.\n\

    \ The main goal is the automatic\nidentiﬁcation and classiﬁcation of plant species\
    \ in order to avoid the use of human experts, as well as\nto reduce the classiﬁcation\
    \ time. A method for the identiﬁcation and classiﬁcation of three legume\nspecies,\
    \ namely, white beans, red beans, and soybean, via leaf vein patterns has been\
    \ presented in [97].\nVein morphology carries accurate information about the properties\
    \ of the leaf. It is an ideal tool for\nplant identiﬁcation in comparison with\
    \ color and shape.\nTable 9 summarizes the above study for the case of species\

    \ consists of two sub-categories, namely, animal welfare and livestock\nproduction.\
    \ Animal welfare deals with the health and wellbeing of animals, with the main\
    \ application\nof ML in monitoring animal behaviour for the early detection of\
    \ diseases. On the other hand, livestock\nproduction deals with issues in the\
    \ production system, where the main scope of ML applications is the\naccurate\
    \ estimation of economic balances for the producers based on production line monitoring.\n\
    Sensors 2018, 18, 2674\n15 of 29\n3.2.1. Animal Welfare\nSeveral articles are\
    \ reported to belong to the animal welfare sub-category. In the ﬁrst article [98],\n\
    a method is presented for the classiﬁcation of cattle behaviour based on ML models\
    \ using data collected\nby collar sensors with magnetometers and three-axis accelerometers.\
    \ The aim of the study was the\nprediction of events such as the oestrus and the\
    \ recognition of dietary changes on cattle. In the second\narticle [99], a system\
    \ was presented for the automatic identiﬁcation and classiﬁcation of chewing\n\
    patterns in calves. The authors created a system based on ML applying data from\
    \ chewing signals of\ndietary supplements, such as hay and ryegrass, combined\
    \ with behaviour data, such as rumination\nand idleness. Data was collected by\
    \ optical FBG sensors. In another study [100], an automated\nmonitoring system\
    \ based on ML was presented for animal behavior tracking, including tracking of\n\
    animal movements by depth video cameras, for monitoring various activities of\
    \ the animal (standing,\nmoving, feeding, and drinking).\nTable 10 summarizes\
    \ the features of the above presented articles.\n3.2.2. Livestock Production\n\
    The sub-category of livestock production regards studies developed for the accurate\
    \ prediction\nand estimation of farming parameters to optimize the economic efﬁciency\
    \ of the production system.\nThis sub-category consists of the presentation of\
    \ four articles, three with cattle production and one for\nhens’ eggs production.\
    \ In the work of [101], a method for the prediction of the rumen fermentation\n\
    pattern from milk fatty acids was presented. The main aim of the study was to\
    \ achieve the most\naccurate prediction of rumen fermentations, which play a signiﬁcant\
    \ role for the evaluation of diets for\nmilk production. In addition, this work\
    \ showed that milk fatty acids have ideal features to predict\nthe molar proportions\
    \ of volatile fatty acids in the rumen. The next study [102] was related to hen\n\
    production. Speciﬁcally, a method based on SVM model was presented for the early\
    \ detection and\nwarning of problems in the commercial production of eggs. Based\
    \ on SVM methods [103], a method for\nthe accurate estimation of bovine weight\
    \ trajectories over time was presented. The accurate estimation\nof cattle weights\
    \ is very important for breeders. The last article of the section [104] deals\
    \ with the\ndevelopment of a function for the prediction of carcass weight for\
    \ beef cattle of the Asturiana de los\nValles breed based on SVR models and zoometric\
    \ measurements features. The results show that the\npresented method can predict\
    \ carcass weights 150 days prior to the slaughter day. The authors of [105]\n\
    presented a method based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) applied in digital\
    \ images for\npig face recognition. The main aim of the research was the identiﬁcation\
    \ of animals without the need\nfor radio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID) tags,\
    \ which involve a distressing activity for the animal, are\nlimited in their range,\
    \ and are a time-consuming method.\nTable 11 summarizes the features of the above\
    \ presented works.\n3.3. Water Management\nWater management in agricultural production\

    18 of 29\nThis section consists of four studies that were mostly developed for\
    \ the estimation of daily, weekly,\nor monthly evapotranspiration. The accurate\
    \ estimation of evapotranspiration is a complex process\nand is of a high importance\
    \ for resource management in crop production, as well as for the design\nand the\
    \ operation management of irrigation systems. In another study [106], the authors\
    \ developed a\ncomputational method for the estimation of monthly mean evapotranspiration\
    \ for arid and semi-arid\nregions. It used monthly mean climatic data of 44 meteorological\
    \ stations for the period 1951–2010.\nIn another study dedicated to ML applications\
    \ on agricultural water management [107], two scenarios\nwere presented for the\
    \ estimation of the daily evapotranspiration from temperature data collected\n\
    from six meteorological stations of a region during the long period (i.e., 1961–2014).\
    \ Finally, in another\nstudy [108], authors developed a method based on ELM model\
    \ fed with temperature data for the\nweekly estimation of evapotranspiration for\
    \ two meteorological weather stations. The purpose was\nthe accurate estimation\
    \ of weekly evapotranspiration in arid regions of India based on limited data\n\
    scenario for crop water management.\nDaily dew point temperature, on the other\
    \ hand, is a signiﬁcant element for the identiﬁcation of\nexpected weather phenomena,\
    \ as well as for the estimation of evapotranspiration and evaporation.\nIn another\
    \ article [109], a model is presented for the prediction of daily dew point temperature,\
    \ based\non ML. The weather data were collected from two different weather stations.\n\
    Table 12 summarizes the above papers for the case of the water management sub-category.\n\
    3.4. Soil Management\nThe ﬁnal category of this review concerns ML application\
    \ on prediction-identiﬁcation of\nagricultural soil properties, such as the estimation\
    \ of soil drying, condition, temperature, and moisture\ncontent. Soil is a heterogeneous\
    \ natural resource, with complex processes and mechanisms that are\ndifﬁcult to\
    \ understand. Soil properties allow researchers to understand the dynamics of\
    \ ecosystems\nand the impingement in agriculture. The accurate estimation of soil\
    \ conditions can lead to improved\nsoil management. Soil temperature alone plays\
    \ a signiﬁcant role for the accurate analysis of the\nclimate change effects of\
    \ a region and eco-environmental conditions. It is a signiﬁcant meteorological\n\
    parameter controlling the interactive processes between ground and atmosphere.\
    \ In addition, soil\nmoisture has an important role for crop yield variability.\
    \ However, soil measurements are generally\ntime-consuming and expensive, so a\
    \ low cost and reliable solution for the accurate estimation of soil\ncan be achieved\
    \ with the usage of computational analysis based on ML techniques. The ﬁrst study\
    \ for\nthis last sub-category is the work of [110]. More speciﬁcally, this study\
    \ presented a method for the\nevaluation of soil drying for agricultural planning.\
    \ The method accurately evaluates the soil drying,\nwith evapotranspiration and\
    \ precipitation data, in a region located in Urbana, IL of the United States.\n\
    The goal of this method was the provision of remote agricultural management decisions.\
    \ The second\nstudy [111] was developed for the prediction of soil condition.\
    \ In particular, the study presented the\ncomparison of four regression models\
    \ for the prediction of soil organic carbon (OC), moisture content\n(MC), and\
    \ total nitrogen (TN). More speciﬁcally, the authors used a visible-near infrared\
    \ (VIS-NIR)\nspectrophotometer to collect soil spectra from 140 unprocessed and\
    \ wet samples of the top layer of\nLuvisol soil types. The samples were collected\
    \ from an arable ﬁeld in Premslin, Germany in August\n2013, after the harvest\
    \ of wheat crops. They concluded that the accurate prediction of soil properties\n\
    can optimize soil management. In a third study [112], the authors developed a\
    \ new method based on a\nself adaptive evolutionary-extreme learning machine (SaE-ELM)\
    \ model and daily weather data for\nthe estimation of daily soil temperature at\
    \ six different depths of 5, 10, 20, 30, 50, and 100 cm in two\ndifferent in climate\
    \ conditions regions of Iran; Bandar Abbas and Kerman. The aim was the accurate\n\
    estimation of soil temperature for agricultural management. The last study [113]\
    \ presented a novel\nmethod for the estimation of soil moisture, based on ANN\
    \ models using data from force sensors on a\nno-till chisel opener.\nTable 13\
    \ summarizes the above papers for the case of soil management sub-category.\n\

    \ that ML models have been applied in multiple\napplications for crop management\
    \ (61%); mostly yield prediction (20%) and disease detection (22%).\nThis trend\
    \ in the applications distribution reﬂects the data intense applications within\
    \ crop and\nhigh use of images (spectral, hyperspectral, NIR, etc.). Data analysis,\
    \ as a mature scientiﬁc ﬁeld,\nprovides the ground for the development of numerous\
    \ applications related to crop management\nbecause, in most cases, ML-based predictions\
    \ can be extracted without the need for fusion of data from\nother resources.\
    \ In contrast, when data recordings are involved, occasionally at the level of\
    \ big data,\nthe implementations of ML are less in number, mainly because of the\
    \ increased efforts required for\nthe data analysis task and not for the ML models\
    \ per se. This fact partially explains the almost equal\ndistribution of ML applications\
    \ in livestock management (19%), water management (10%), and soil\nmanagement\
    \ (10%). It is also evident from the analysis that most of the studies used ANN\
    \ and SVM\nML models. More speciﬁcally, ANNs were used mostly for implementations\
    \ in crop, water, and soil\nmanagement, while SVMs were used mostly for livestock\
    \ management.\nBy applying machine learning to sensor data, farm management systems\
    \ are evolving into real\nartiﬁcial intelligence systems, providing richer recommendations\
    \ and insights for the subsequent\ndecisions and actions with the ultimate scope\
    \ of production improvement. For this scope, in the future,\nit is expected that\
    \ the usage of ML models will be even more widespread, allowing for the possibility\n\
    of integrated and applicable tools. At the moment, all of the approaches regard\
    \ individual approaches\nand solutions and are not adequately connected with the\
    \ decision-making process, as seen in other\napplication domains. This integration\
    \ of automated data recording, data analysis, ML implementation,\nand decision-making\

    \ The digital transformation of agriculture has evolved various aspects of management\
    \ into\nartiﬁcial intelligent systems for the sake of making value from the ever-increasing\
    \ data originated from\nnumerous sources. A subset of artiﬁcial intelligence,\
    \ namely machine learning, has a considerable\npotential to handle numerous challenges\
    \ in the establishment of knowledge-based farming systems.\nThe present study\
    \ aims at shedding light on machine learning in agriculture by thoroughly reviewing\n\
    the recent scholarly literature based on keywords’ combinations of “machine learning”\
    \ along with\n“crop management”, “water management”, “soil management”, and “livestock\
    \ management”, and\nin accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Only journal papers\
    \ were considered eligible that were\npublished within 2018–2020. The results\
    \ indicated that this topic pertains to different disciplines\nthat favour convergence\
    \ research at the international level. Furthermore, crop management was\nobserved\
    \ to be at the centre of attention. A plethora of machine learning algorithms\
    \ were used,\nwith those belonging to Artiﬁcial Neural Networks being more efﬁcient.\
    \ In addition, maize and\nwheat as well as cattle and sheep were the most investigated\
    \ crops and animals, respectively. Finally,\na variety of sensors, attached on\
    \ satellites and unmanned ground and aerial vehicles, have been\nutilized as a\
    \ means of getting reliable input data for the data analyses. It is anticipated\
    \ that this study\nwill constitute a beneﬁcial guide to all stakeholders towards\
    \ enhancing awareness of the potential\nadvantages of using machine learning in\
    \ agriculture and contributing to a more systematic research\non this topic.\n\
    Keywords: machine learning; crop management; water management; soil management;\
    \ livestock\nmanagement; artiﬁcial intelligence; precision agriculture; precision\
    \ livestock farming\n1. Introduction\n1.1. General Context of Machine Learning\
    \ in Agriculture\nModern agriculture has to cope with several challenges, including\
    \ the increasing call\nfor food, as a consequence of the global explosion of earth’s\
    \ population, climate changes [1],\nnatural resources depletion [2], alteration\
    \ of dietary choices [3], as well as safety and health\nconcerns [4]. As a means\
    \ of addressing the above issues, placing pressure on the agricul-\ntural sector,\
    \ there exists an urgent necessity for optimizing the effectiveness of agricultural\n\
    practices by, simultaneously, lessening the environmental burden. In particular,\
    \ these two\nessentials have driven the transformation of agriculture into precision\
    \ agriculture. This\nmodernization of farming has a great potential to assure\
    \ sustainability, maximal produc-\ntivity, and a safe environment [5]. In general,\
    \ smart farming is based on four key pillars\nin order to deal with the increasing\
    \ needs; (a) optimal natural resources’ management,\n(b) conservation of the ecosystem,\
    \ (c) development of adequate services, and (d) utilization\nSensors 2021, 21,\
    \ 3758. https://doi.org/10.3390/s21113758\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\n\
    Sensors 2021, 21, 3758\n2 of 55\nof modern technologies [6]. An essential prerequisite\
    \ of modern agriculture is, deﬁnitely,\nthe adoption of Information and Communication\
    \ Technology (ICT), which is promoted\nby policy-makers around the world. ICT\
    \ can indicatively include farm management in-\nformation systems, humidity and\
    \ soil sensors, accelerometers, wireless sensor networks,\ncameras, drones, low-cost\
    \ satellites, online services, and automated guided vehicles [7].\nThe large volume\
    \ of data, which is produced by digital technologies and usually\nreferred to\
    \ as “big data”, needs large storage capabilities in addition to editing, analyzing,\n\
    and interpreting. The latter has a considerable potential to add value for society,\
    \ environ-\nment, and decision-makers [8]. Nevertheless, big data encompass challenges\
    \ on account\nof their so-called “5-V” requirements; (a) Volume, (b) Variety,\
    \ (c) Velocity, (d) Veracity,\nand (e) Value [9]. The conventional data processing\
    \ techniques are incapable of meeting\nthe constantly growing demands in the new\
    \ era of smart farming, which is an important\nobstacle for extracting valuable\
    \ information from ﬁeld data [10]. To that end, Machine\nLearning (ML) has emerged,\
    \ which is a subset of artiﬁcial intelligence [11], by taking\nadvantage of the\
    \ exponential computational power capacity growth.\nThere is a plethora of applications\
    \ of ML in agriculture. According to the recent\nliterature survey by Liakos et\
    \ al. [12], regarding the time period of 2004 to 2018, four\ngeneric categories\
    \ were identiﬁed (Figure 1). These categories refer to crop, water, soil,\nand\
    \ livestock management. In particular, as far as crop management is concerned,\
    \ it\nrepresented the majority of the articles amongst all categories (61% of\
    \ the total articles) and\nwas further sub-divided into:\n•\nYield prediction;\n\
    •\nDisease detection;\n•\nWeed detection;\n•\nCrop recognition;\n•\nCrop quality.\n\
    Figure 1. The four generic categories in agriculture exploiting machine learning\
    \ techniques, as presented in [12].\nThe generic categories dealing with the management\
    \ of water and soil were found\nto be less investigated, corresponding cumulatively\
    \ to 20% of the total number of papers\n(10% for each category).\nFinally, two\
    \ main sub-categories were identiﬁed for the livestock-related applications\n\
    corresponding to a total 19% of journal papers:\n•\nLivestock production;\nSensors\
    \ 2021, 21, 3758\n3 of 55\n•\nAnimal welfare.\n1.2. Open Problems Associated with\
    \ Machine Learning in Agriculture\nDue to the broad range of applications of ML\
    \ in agriculture, several reviews have\nbeen published in this research ﬁeld.\
    \ The majority of these review studies have been\ndedicated to crop disease detection\
    \ [13–16], weed detection [17,18], yield prediction [19,20],\ncrop recognition\
    \ [21,22], water management [23,24], animal welfare [25,26], and livestock\nproduction\
    \ [27,28]. Furthermore, other studies were concerned with the implementation of\n\
    ML methods regarding the main grain crops by investigating different aspects including\n\
    quality and disease detection [29]. Finally, focus has been paid on big data analysis\
    \ using\nML, aiming at ﬁnding out real-life problems that originated from smart\
    \ farming [30], or\ndealing with methods to analyze hyperspectral and multispectral\
    \ data [31].\nAlthough ML in agriculture has made considerable progress, several\
    \ open problems\nremain, which have some common points of reference, despite the\
    \ fact that the topic covers\na variety of sub-ﬁelds. According to [23,24,28,32],\
    \ the main problems are associated with\nthe implementation of sensors on farms\
    \ for numerous reasons, including high costs of ICT,\ntraditional practices, and\
    \ lack of information. In addition, the majority of the available\ndatasets do\
    \ not reﬂect realistic cases, since they are normally generated by a few people\n\
    getting images or specimens in a short time period and from a limited area [15,21–23].\n\
    Consequently, more practical datasets coming from ﬁelds are required [18,20].\
    \ Moreover,\nthe need for more efﬁcient ML algorithms and scalable computational\
    \ architectures has\nbeen pointed out, which can lead to rapid information processing\
    \ [18,22,23,31]. The chal-\nlenging background, when it comes to obtaining images,\
    \ video, or audio recordings, has\nalso been mentioned owing to changes in lighting\
    \ [16,29], blind spots of cameras, envi-\nronmental noise, and simultaneous vocalizations\
    \ [25]. Another important open problem\nis that the vast majority of farmers are\
    \ non-experts in ML and, thus, they cannot fully\ncomprehend the underlying patterns\
    \ obtained by ML algorithms. For this reason, more\nuser-friendly systems should\
    \ be developed. In particular, simple systems, being easy to\nunderstand and operate,\
    \ would be valuable, as for example a visualization tool with a user-\nfriendly\
    \ interface for the correct presentation and manipulation of data [25,30,31].\
    \ Taking\ninto account that farmers are getting more and more familiar with smartphones,\
    \ speciﬁc\nsmartphone applications have been proposed as a possible solution to\
    \ address the above\nchallenge [15,16,21]. Last but not least, the development\
    \ of efﬁcient ML techniques by in-\ncorporating expert knowledge from different\
    \ stakeholders should be fostered, particularly\nregarding computing science,\
    \ agriculture, and the private sector, as a means of designing\nrealistic solutions\
    \ [19,22,24,33]. As stated in [12], currently, all of the efforts pertain to\n\
    individual solutions, which are not always connected with the process of decision-making,\n\
    as seen for example in other domains.\n1.3. Aim of the Present Study\nAs pointed\
    \ out above, because of the multiple applications of ML in agriculture,\nseveral\
    \ review studies have been published recently. However, these studies usually\n\
    concentrate purely on one sub-ﬁeld of agricultural production. Motivated by the\
    \ current\ntremendous progress in ML, the increasing interest worldwide, and its\
    \ impact in various\ndo-mains of agriculture, a systematic bibliographic survey\
    \ is presented on the range of the\ncategories proposed in [12], which were summarized\
    \ in Figure 1. In particular, we focus\non reviewing the relevant literature of\
    \ the last three years (2018–2020) for the intention of\nproviding an updated\
    \ view of ML applications in agricultural systems. In fact, this work is\nan updated\
    \ continuation of the work presented at [12]; following, consequently, exactly\n\
    the same framework and inclusion criteria. As a consequence, the scholarly literature\n\
    was screened in order to cover a broad spectrum of important features for capturing\
    \ the\ncurrent progress and trends, including the identiﬁcation of: (a) the research\
    \ areas which\nare interested mostly in ML in agriculture along with the geographical\
    \ distribution of the\nSensors 2021, 21, 3758\n4 of 55\ncontributing organizations,\
    \ (b) the most efﬁcient ML models, (c) the most investigated\ncrops and animals,\
    \ and (d) the most implemented features and technologies.\nAs will be discussed\
    \ next, overall, a 745% increase in the number of journal papers\ntook place in\
    \ the last three years as compared to [12], thus justifying the need for a new\n\
    updated review on the speciﬁc topic. Moreover, crop management remained as the\
    \ most\ninvestigated topic, with a number of ML algorithms having been exploited\
    \ as a means\nof tackling the heterogeneous data that originated from agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds. As compared\nto [12], more crop and animal species have been investigated\
    \ by using an extensive range\nof input parameters coming mainly from remote sensing,\
    \ such as satellites and drones. In\naddition, people from different research\
    \ ﬁelds have dealt with ML in agriculture, hence,\ncontributing to the remarkable\
    \ advancement in this ﬁeld.\n1.4. Outline of the Paper\nThe remainder of this\
    \ paper is structured as follows. The second section brieﬂy\ndescribes the fundamentals\
    \ of ML along with the subject of the four generic categories\nfor the sake of\
    \ better comprehension of the scope of the present study. The implemented\nmethodology,\
    \ along with the inclusive criteria and the search engines, is analyzed in the\n\
    third section. The main performance metrics, which were used in the selected articles,\n\
    are also presented in this section. The main results are shown in the fourth section\
    \ in the\nform of bar and pie charts, while in the ﬁfth section, the main conclusions\
    \ are drawn by\nalso discussing the results from a broader perspective. Finally,\
    \ all the selected journal\npapers are summarized in Tables A1–A9, in accordance\
    \ with their ﬁeld of application, and\npresented in the Appendix A, together with\
    \ Tables A10 and A11 that contain commonly\nused abbreviations, with the intention\
    \ of not disrupting the ﬂow of the main text.\n2. Background\n2.1. Fundamentals\
    \ of Machine Learning: A Brief Overview\nIn general, the objective of ML algorithms\
    \ is to optimize the performance of a task,\nvia exploiting examples or past experience.\
    \ In particular, ML can generate efﬁcient rela-\ntionships regarding data inputs\
    \ and reconstruct a knowledge scheme. In this data-driven\nmethodology, the more\
    \ data are used, the better ML works. This is similar to how well\na human being\
    \ performs a particular task by gaining more experience [34]. The central\noutcome\
    \ of ML is a measure of generalizability; the degree to which the ML algorithm\
    \ has\nthe ability to provide correct predictions, when new data are presented,\
    \ on the basis of\nlearned rules originated from preceding exposure to similar\
    \ data [35]. More speciﬁcally,\ndata involve a set of examples, which are described\
    \ by a group of characteristics, usually\ncalled features. Broadly speaking, ML\
    \ systems operate at two processes, namely the learn-\ning (used for training)\
    \ and testing. In order to facilitate the former process, these features\ncommonly\
    \ form a feature vector that can be binary, numeric, ordinal, or nominal [36].\
    \ This\nvector is utilized as an input within the learning phase. In brief, by\
    \ relying on training data,\nwithin the learning phase, the machine learns to\
    \ perform the task from experience. Once\nthe learning performance reaches a satisfactory\
    \ point (expressed through mathematical\nand statistical relationships), it ends.\
    \ Subsequently, the model that was developed through\nthe training process can\
    \ be used to classify, cluster, or predict.\nAn overview of a typical ML system\
    \ is illustrated in Figure 2. With the intention of\nforming the derived complex\
    \ raw data into a suitable state, a pre-processing effort is re-\nquired. This\
    \ usually includes: (a) data cleaning for removing inconsistent or missing items\n\
    and noise, (b) data integration, when many data sources exist and (c) data transformation,\n\
    such as normalization and discretization [37]. The extraction/selection feature\
    \ aims at\ncreating or/and identifying the most informative subset of features\
    \ in which, subsequently,\nthe learning model is going to be implemented throughout\
    \ the training phase [38]. Regard-\ning the feedback loop, which is depicted in\
    \ Figure 2, it serves for adjustments pertaining to\nthe feature extraction/selection\
    \ unit as well as the pre-processing one that further improves\nthe overall learning\
    \ model’s performance. During the phase of testing, previously unseen\nSensors\
    \ 2021, 21, 3758\n5 of 55\nsamples are imported to the trained model, which are\
    \ usually represented as feature vec-\ntors. Finally, an appropriate decision\
    \ is made by the model (for example, classiﬁcation or\nregression) in reliance\
    \ of the features existing in each sample. Deep learning, a subﬁeld\nof ML, utilizes\
    \ an alternative architecture via shifting the process of converting raw data\n\
    to features (feature engineering) to the corresponding learning system. Consequently,\
    \ the\nfeature extraction/selection unit is absent, resulting in a fully trainable\
    \ system; it starts\nfrom a raw input and ends with the desired output [39,40].\n\
    Figure 2. A graphical illustration of a typical machine learning system.\nBased\
    \ on the learning type, ML can be classiﬁed according to the relative litera-\n\
    ture [41,42] as:\n•\nSupervised learning: The input and output are known and the\
    \ machine tries to ﬁnd\nthe optimal way to reach an output given an input;\n•\n\
    Unsupervised learning: No labels are provided, leaving the learning algorithm\
    \ itself\nto generate structure within its input;\n•\nSemi-supervised learning:\
    \ Input data constitute a mixture of labeled and non-labeled\ndata;\n•\nReinforcement\
    \ learning: Decisions are made towards ﬁnding out actions that can lead\nto the\
    \ more positive outcome, while it is solely determined by trial and error method\n\
    and delayed outcome.\nNowadays, ML is used in facilitating several management\
    \ aspects in agriculture [12]\nand in a plethora of other applications, such as\
    \ image recognition [43], speech recogni-\ntion [44], autonomous driving [45],\
    \ credit card fraud detection [46], stock market forecast-\ning [47], ﬂuid mechanics\
    \ [48], email, spam and malware ﬁltering [49], medical diagno-\nsis [40], contamination\
    \ detection in urban water networks [50], and activity recognition [51],\nto mention\
    \ but a few.\nSensors 2021, 21, 3758\n6 of 55\n2.2. Brief Description of the Four\
    \ Generic Categories\n2.2.1. Crop Management\nThe crop management category involves\
    \ versatile aspects that originated from the\ncombination of farming techniques\
    \ in the direction of managing the biological, chemical\nand physical crop environment\
    \ with the aim of reaching both quantitative and qualitative\ntargets [52]. Using\
    \ advanced approaches to manage crops, such as yield prediction, disease\ndetection,\
    \ weed detection, crop recognition, and crop quality, contributes to the increase\n\
    of productivity and, consequently, the ﬁnancial income. The above aspects constitute\
    \ key\ngoals of precision agriculture.\nYield Prediction\nIn general, yield prediction\
    \ is one of the most important and challenging topics in\nmodern agriculture.\
    \ An accurate model can help, for instance, the farm owners to take\ninformed\
    \ management decisions on what to grow towards matching the crop to the existing\n\
    market’s demands [20]. However, this is not a trivial task; it consists of various\
    \ steps.\nYield prediction can be determined by several factors such as environment,\
    \ management\npractices, crop genotypic and phenotypic characteristics, and their\
    \ interactions. Hence, it\nnecessitates a fundamental comprehension of the relationship\
    \ between these interactive\nfactors and yield. In turn, identifying such kinds\
    \ of relationships mandates comprehensive\ndatasets along with powerful algorithms\
    \ such as ML techniques [53].\nDisease Detection\nCrop diseases constitute a major\
    \ threat in agricultural production systems that deteri-\norate yield quality\
    \ and quantity at production, storage, and transportation level. At farm\nlevel,\
    \ reports on yield losses, due to plant diseases, are very common [54]. Furthermore,\n\
    crop diseases pose signiﬁcant risks to food security at a global scale. Timely\
    \ identiﬁcation\nof plant diseases is a key aspect for efﬁcient management. Plant\
    \ diseases may be provoked\nby various kinds of bacteria, fungi, pests, viruses,\
    \ and other agents. Disease symptoms,\nnamely the physical evidence of the presence\
    \ of pathogens and the changes in the plants’\nphenotype, may consist of leaf\
    \ and fruit spots, wilting and color change [55], curling\nof leaves, etc. Historically,\
    \ disease detection was conducted by expert agronomists, by\nperforming ﬁeld scouting.\
    \ However, this process is time-consuming and solely based on vi-\nsual inspection.\
    \ Recent technological advances have made commercially available sensing\nsystems\
    \ able to identify diseased plants before the symptoms become visible. Furthermore,\n\
    in the past few years, computer vision, especially by employing deep learning,\
    \ has made\nremarkable progress. As highlighted by Zhang et al. [56], who focused\
    \ on identifying\ncucumber leaf diseases by utilizing deep learning, due to the\
    \ complex environmental back-\nground, it is beneﬁcial to eliminate background\
    \ before model training. Moreover, accurate\nimage classiﬁers for disease diagnosis\
    \ need a large dataset of both healthy and diseased\nplant images. In reference\
    \ to large-scale cultivations, such kinds of automated processes\ncan be combined\
    \ with autonomous vehicles, to timely identify phytopathological problems\nby\
    \ implementing regular inspections. Furthermore, maps of the spatial distribution\
    \ of the\nplant disease can be created, depicting the zones in the farm where\
    \ the infection has been\nspread [57].\nWeed Detection\nAs a result of their proliﬁc\
    \ seed production and longevity, weeds usually grow and\nspread invasively over\
    \ large parts of the ﬁeld very fast, competing with crops for the\nresources,\
    \ including space, sunlight, nutrients, and water availability. Besides, weeds\n\
    frequently arise sooner than crops without having to face natural enemies, a fact\
    \ that\nadversely affects crop growth [18]. In order to prevent crop yield reduction,\
    \ weed control is\nan important management task by either mechanical treatment\
    \ or application of herbicides.\nMechanical treatment is, in most cases, difﬁcult\
    \ to be performed and ineffective if not\nproperly performed, making herbicide\
    \ application the most widely used operation. Using\nSensors 2021, 21, 3758\n\
    7 of 55\nlarge quantities of herbicides, however, turns out to be both costly\
    \ and detrimental for the\nenvironment, especially in the case of uniform application\
    \ without taking into account the\nspatial distribution of the weeds. Remarkably,\
    \ long-term herbicide use is very likely to\nmake weeds more resistant, thus,\
    \ resulting in more demanding and expensive weed control.\nIn recent years, considerable\
    \ achievements have been made pertaining to the differentiation\nof weeds from\
    \ crops on the basis of smart agriculture. This discrimination can be accom-\n\
    plished by using remote or proximal sensing with sensors attached on satellites,\
    \ aerial, and\nground vehicles, as well as unmanned vehicles (both ground (UGV)\
    \ and aerial (UAV)). The\ntransformation of data gathered by UAVs into meaningful\
    \ information is, however, still a\nchallenging task, since both data collection\
    \ and classiﬁcation need painstaking effort [58].\nML algorithms coupled with\
    \ imaging technologies or non-imaging spectroscopy can allow\nfor real-time differentiation\
    \ and localization of target weeds, enabling precise application\nof herbicides\
    \ to speciﬁc zones, instead of spraying the entire ﬁelds [59] and planning of\
    \ the\nshortest weeding path [60].\nCrop Recognition\nAutomatic recognition of\
    \ crops has gained considerable attention in several scientiﬁc\nﬁelds, such as\
    \ plant taxonomy, botanical gardens, and new species discovery. Plant species\n\
    can be recognized and classiﬁed via analysis of various organs, including leaves,\
    \ stems,\nfruits, ﬂowers, roots, and seeds [61,62]. Using leaf-based plant recognition\
    \ seems to be the\nmost common approach by examining speciﬁc leaf’s characteristics\
    \ like color, shape, and\ntexture [63]. With the broader use of satellites and\
    \ aerial vehicles as means of sensing crop\nproperties, crop classiﬁcation through\
    \ remote sensing has become particularly popular. As\nin the above sub-categories,\
    \ the advancement on computer software and image processing\ndevices combined\
    \ with ML has led to the automatic recognition and classiﬁcation of crops.\nCrop\
    \ Quality\nCrop quality is very consequential for the market and, in general,\
    \ is related to soil and\nclimate conditions, cultivation practices and crop characteristics,\
    \ to name a few. High qual-\nity agricultural products are typically sold at better\
    \ prices, hence, offering larger earnings\nto farmers. For instance, as regards\
    \ fruit quality, ﬂesh ﬁrmness, soluble solids content, and\nskin color are among\
    \ the most ordinary maturity indices utilized for harvesting [64]. The\ntiming\
    \ of harvesting greatly affects the quality characteristics of the harvested products\n\
    in both high value crops (tree crops, grapes, vegetables, herbs, etc.) and arable\
    \ crops.\nTherefore, developing decision support systems can aid farmers in taking\
    \ appropriate man-\nagement decisions for increased quality of production. For\
    \ example, selective harvesting is\na management practice that may considerably\
    \ increase quality. Furthermore, crop quality\nis closely linked with food waste,\
    \ an additional challenge that modern agriculture has\nto cope with, since if\
    \ the crop deviates from the desired shape, color, or size, it may be\nthrown\
    \ away. Similarly to the above sub-section, ML algorithms combined with imaging\n\
    technologies can provide encouraging results.\n2.2.2. Water Management\nThe agricultural\
    \ sector constitutes the main consumer of available fresh water on\na global scale,\
    \ as plant growth largely relies on water availability. Taking into account\n\
    the rapid depletion rate of a lot of aquifers with negligible recharge, more effective\
    \ water\nmanagement is needed for the purpose of better conserving water in terms\
    \ of accomplishing\na sustainable crop production [65]. Effective water management\
    \ can also lead to the\nimprovement of water quality as well as reduction of pollution\
    \ and health risks [66].\nRecent research on precision agriculture offers the\
    \ potential of variable rate irrigation\nso as to attain water savings. This can\
    \ be realized by implementing irrigation at rates,\nwhich vary according to ﬁeld\
    \ variability on the basis of speciﬁc water requirements of\nseparate management\
    \ zones, instead of using a uniform rate in the entire ﬁeld. The\neffectiveness\
    \ and feasibility of the variable rate irrigation approach depend on agronomic\n\
    Sensors 2021, 21, 3758\n8 of 55\nfactors, including topography, soil properties,\
    \ and their effect on soil water in order\nto accomplish both water savings and\
    \ yield optimization [67]. Carefully monitoring\nthe status of soil water, crop\
    \ growth conditions, and temporal and spatial patterns in\ncombination with weather\
    \ conditions monitoring and forecasting, can help in irrigation\nprogramming and\
    \ efﬁcient management of water. Among the utilized ICTs, remote sensing\ncan provide\
    \ images with spatial and temporal variability associated with the soil moisture\n\
    status and crop growth parameters for precision water management. Interestingly,\
    \ water\nmanagement is challenging enough in arid areas, where groundwater sources\
    \ are used for\nirrigation, with the precipitation providing only part of the\
    \ total crop evapotranspiration\n(ET) demands [68].\n2.2.3. Soil Management\n\
    Soil, a heterogeneous natural resource, involves mechanisms and processes that\
    \ are\nvery complex. Precise information regarding soil on a regional scale is\
    \ vital, as it contributes\ntowards better soil management consistent with land\
    \ potential and, in general, sustainable\nagriculture [5]. Better management of\
    \ soil is also of great interest owing to issues like land\ndegradation (loss\
    \ of the biological productivity), soil-nutrient imbalance (due to fertilizers\n\
    overuse), and soil erosion (as a result of vegetation overcutting, improper crop\
    \ rotations\nrather than balanced ones, livestock overgrazing, and unsustainable\
    \ fallow periods) [69].\nUseful soil properties can entail texture, organic matter,\
    \ and nutrients content, to mention\nbut a few. Traditional soil assessment methods\
    \ include soil sampling and laboratory\nanalysis, which are normally expensive\
    \ and take considerable time and effort. However,\nremote sensing and soil mapping\
    \ sensors can provide low-cost and effortless solution for\nthe study of soil\
    \ spatial variability. Data fusion and handling of such heterogeneous “big\ndata”\
    \ may be important drawbacks, when traditional data analysis methods are used.\
    \ ML\ntechniques can serve as a trustworthy, low-cost solution for such a task.\n\
    2.2.4. Livestock Management\nIt is widely accepted that livestock production systems\
    \ have been intensiﬁed in the\ncontext of productivity per animal. This intensiﬁcation\
    \ involves social concerns that can\ninﬂuence consumer perception of food safety,\
    \ security, and sustainability, based on animal\nwelfare and human health. In\
    \ particular, monitoring both the welfare of animals and overall\nproduction is\
    \ a key aspect so as to improve production systems [70]. The above ﬁelds take\n\
    place in the framework of precision livestock farming, aiming at applying engineering\n\
    techniques to monitor animal health in real time and recognizing warning messages,\
    \ as\nwell as improving the production at the initial stages. The role of precision\
    \ livestock\nfarming is getting more and more signiﬁcant by supporting the decision-making\
    \ processes\nof livestock owners and changing their role. It can also facilitate\
    \ the products’ traceability,\nin addition to monitoring their quality and the\
    \ living conditions of animals, as required\nby policy-makers [71]. Precision\
    \ livestock farming relies on non-invasive sensors, such as\ncameras, accelerometers,\
    \ gyroscopes, radio-frequency identiﬁcation systems, pedometers,\nand optical\
    \ and temperature sensors [25]. IoT sensors leverage variable physical quantities\n\
    (VPQs) as a means of sensing temperature, sound, humidity, etc. For instance,\
    \ IoT sensors\ncan warn if a VPQ falls out of regular limits in real-time, giving\
    \ valuable information\nregarding individual animals. As a result, the cost of\
    \ repetitively and arduously checking\neach animal can be reduced [72]. In order\
    \ to take advantage of the large amounts of data,\nML methodologies have become\
    \ an integral part of modern livestock farming. Models can\nbe developed that\
    \ have the capability of deﬁning the manner a biological system operates,\nrelying\
    \ on causal relationships and exploiting this biological awareness towards generating\n\
    predictions and suggestions.\nAnimal Welfare\nThere is an ongoing concern for\
    \ animal welfare, since the health of animals is strongly\nassociated with product\
    \ quality and, as a consequence, predominantly with the health\nSensors 2021,\
    \ 21, 3758\n9 of 55\nof consumers and, secondarily, with the improvement of economic\
    \ efﬁciency [73]. There\nexist several indexes for animal welfare evaluation,\
    \ including physiological stress and\nbehavioral indicators. The most commonly\
    \ used indicator is animal behavior, which\ncan be affected by diseases, emotions,\
    \ and living conditions, which have the potential to\ndemonstrate physiological\
    \ conditions [25]. Sensors, commonly used to detect behavioral\nchanges (for example,\
    \ changes in water or food consumption, reduced animal activity),\ninclude microphone\
    \ systems, cameras, accelerometers, etc.\nLivestock Production\nThe use of sensor\
    \ technology, along with advanced ML techniques, can increase\nlivestock production\
    \ efﬁciency. Given the impact of practices of animal management on\nproductive\
    \ elements, livestock owners are getting cautious of their asset. However, as\n\
    the livestock holdings get larger, the proper consideration of every single animal\
    \ is very\ndifﬁcult. From this perspective, the support to farmers via precision\
    \ livestock farming,\nmentioned above, is an auspicious step for aspects associated\
    \ with economic efﬁciency\nand establishment of sustainable workplaces with reduced\
    \ environmental footprint [74].\nGenerally, several models have been used in animal\
    \ production, with their intentions\nnormally revolving around growing and feeding\
    \ animals in the best way. However, the\nlarge volumes of data being involved,\
    \ again, call for ML approaches.\n3. Methods\n3.1. Screening of the Relative Literature\n\
    In order to identify the relevant studies concerning ML in respect to different\
    \ aspects\nof management in agriculture, the search engines of Scopus, Google\
    \ Scholar, ScienceDirect,\nPubMed, Web of Science, and MDPI were utilized. In\
    \ addition, keywords’ combinations of\n“machine learning” in conjunction with\
    \ each of the following: “crop management”, “water\nmanagement”, “soil management”,\
    \ and “livestock management” were used. Our intention\nwas to ﬁlter the literature\
    \ on the same framework as [12]; however, focusing solely within\nthe period 2018–2020.\
    \ Once a relevant study was being identiﬁed, the references of the\npaper at hand\
    \ were being scanned to ﬁnd studies that had not been found throughout\nthe initial\
    \ searching procedure. This process was being iterated until no relevant studies\n\
    occurred. In this stage, only journal papers were considered eligible. Thus, non-English\n\
    studies, conferences papers, chapters, reviews, as well as Master and Doctoral\
    \ Theses\nwere excluded. The latest search was conducted on 15 December 2020.\
    \ Subsequently,\nthe abstract of each paper was being reviewed, while, at a next\
    \ stage, the full text was\nbeing read to decide its appropriateness. After a\
    \ discussion between all co-authors with\nreference to the appropriateness of\
    \ the selected papers, some of them were excluded, in\nthe case they did not meet\
    \ the two main inclusion criteria, namely: (a) the paper was\npublished within\
    \ 2018–2020 and (b) the paper referred to one of the categories and sub-\ncategories,\
    \ which were summarized in Figure 1. Finally, the papers were classiﬁed in these\n\
    sub-categories. Overall, 338 journal papers were identiﬁed. The ﬂowchart of the\
    \ present\nreview methodology is depicted in Figure 3, based on the PRISMA guidelines\
    \ [75], along\nwith information about at which stage each exclusive criterion\
    \ was imposed similarly to\nrecent systematic review studies such as [72,76–78].\n\
    3.2. Deﬁnition of the Performance Metrics Commonly Used in the Reviewed Studies\n\
    In this subsection, the most commonly used performance metrics of the reviewed\n\
    papers are brieﬂy described. In general, these metrics are utilized in an effort\
    \ to provide\na common measure to evaluate the ML algorithms. The selection of\
    \ the appropriate\nmetrics is very important, since: (a) how the algorithm’s performance\
    \ is measured relies\non these metrics and (b) the metric itself can inﬂuence\
    \ the way the signiﬁcance of several\ncharacteristics is weighted.\nSensors 2021,\
    \ 21, 3758\n10 of 55\nFigure 3. The ﬂowchart of the methodology of the present\
    \ systematic review along with the ﬂow of information regarding\nthe exclusive\
    \ criteria, based on PRISMA guidelines [75].\nConfusion matrix constitutes one\
    \ of the most intuitive metrics towards ﬁnding the\ncorrectness of a model. It\
    \ is used for classiﬁcation problems, where the result can be of\nat least two\
    \ types of classes. Let us consider a simple example, by giving a label to a\n\
    target variable: for example, “1” when a plant has been infected with a disease\
    \ and “0”\notherwise. In this simpliﬁed case, the confusion matrix (Figure 4)\
    \ is a 2 × 2 table having\ntwo dimensions, namely “Actual” and “Predicted”, while\
    \ its dimensions have the outcome\nof the comparison between the predictions with\
    \ the actual class label. Concerning the\nabove simpliﬁed example, this outcome\
    \ can acquire the following values:\n•\nTrue Positive (TP): The plant has a disease\
    \ (1) and the model classiﬁes this case as\ndiseased (1);\n•\nTrue Negative (TN):\
    \ The plant does not have a disease (0) and the model classiﬁes this\ncase as\
    \ a healthy plant (0);\n•\nFalse Positive (FP): The plant does not have a disease\
    \ (0), but the model classiﬁes this\ncase as diseased (1);\nSensors 2021, 21,\
    \ 3758\n11 of 55\n•\nFalse Negative (FN): The plant has a disease (1), but the\
    \ model classiﬁes this case as a\nhealthy plant (0).\nFigure 4. Representative\
    \ illustration of a simpliﬁed confusion matrix.\nAs can be shown in Table 1, the\
    \ aforementioned values can be implemented in order\nto estimate the performance\
    \ metrics, typically observed in classiﬁcation problems [79].\nTable 1. Summary\

    \ (R), coefﬁcient of\ndetermination (R2; basically, the square of the correlation\
    \ coefﬁcient), Mean Absolute Error\n(MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE),\
    \ and Mean Squared Error (MSE), which\ncan be given via the following relationships\

    \ = 1\nT ·∑\nT\nt=1(Z(t) − X(t))2,\n(4)\nwhere X(t) and Z(t) correspond to the\
    \ predicted and real value, respectively, t stands for\nthe iteration at each\
    \ point, while T for the testing records number. Accordingly, low values\nof MAE,\
    \ MAPE, and MSE values denote a small error and, hence, better performance. In\n\
    contrast, R2 near 1 is desired, which demonstrates better model performance and\
    \ also that\nthe regression curve efﬁciently ﬁts the data.\n4. Results\n4.1. Preliminary\
    \ Data Visualization Analysis\nGraphical representation of data related to the\
    \ reviewed studies, by using maps, bar\nor pie charts, for example, can provide\
    \ an efﬁcient approach to demonstrate and interpret\nthe patterns of data. The\
    \ data visualization analysis, as it usually refers to, can be vital in\nthe context\
    \ of analyzing large amounts of data and has gained remarkable attention in the\n\
    past few years, including review studies. Indicatively, signiﬁcant results can\
    \ be deduced\nSensors 2021, 21, 3758\n12 of 55\nin an effort to identify: (a)\
    \ the most contributing authors and organizations, (b) the most\ncontributing\
    \ international journals (or equivalently which research ﬁelds are interested\
    \ in\nthis topic), and (c) the current trends in this ﬁeld [82].\n4.1.1. Classiﬁcation\
    \ of the Studies in Terms of Application Domain\nAs can be seen in the ﬂowchart\
    \ of the present methodology (Figure 3), the literature\nsurvey on ML in agriculture\
    \ resulted in 338 journal papers. Subsequently, these studies\nwere classiﬁed\
    \ into the four generic categories as well as into their sub-categories, as\n\
    already mentioned above. Figure 5 depicts the aforementioned papers’ distribution.\
    \ In\nparticular, the majority of the studies were intended for crop management\
    \ (68%), while soil\nmanagement (10%), water management (10%), and livestock management\
    \ (12% in total;\nanimal welfare: 7% and livestock production: 5%) had almost\
    \ equal contribution in the\npresent bibliographic survey. Focusing on crop management,\
    \ the most contributing sub-\ncategories were yield prediction (20%) and disease\
    \ detection (19%). The former research\nﬁeld arises as a consequence of the increasing\
    \ interest of farmers in taking decisions based\non efﬁcient management that can\
    \ lead to the desired yield. Disease detection, on the other\nhand, is also very\
    \ important, as diseases constitute a primary menace for food security and\nquality\
    \ assurance. Equal percentages (13%) were observed for weed detection and crop\n\
    recognition, both of which are essential in crop management at farm and agricultural\
    \ policy\nmaking level. Finally, examination of crop quality was relatively scarce\
    \ corresponding to\n3% of all studies. This can be attributed to the complexity\
    \ of monitoring and modeling the\nquality-related parameters.\nFigure 5. The classiﬁcation\
    \ of the reviewed studies according to the ﬁeld of application.\nIn this fashion,\
    \ it should be mentioned again that all the selected journal papers are\nsummarized\
    \ in Tables A1–A9, depending on their ﬁeld of application, and presented in the\n\
    Appendix A. The columns of the tables correspond (from left to right) to the “Reference\n\
    number” (Ref), “Input Data”, “Functionality”, “Models/Algorithms”, and “Best Output”.\n\
    One additional column exists for the sub-categories belonging in crop management,\
    \ namely\n“Crop”, whereas the corresponding column in the sub-categories pertaining\
    \ to livestock\nSensors 2021, 21, 3758\n13 of 55\nmanagement refers to “Animal”.\
    \ The present systematic review deals with a plethora of\ndifferent ML models\
    \ and algorithms. For the sake of brevity, the commonly used abbrevia-\ntions\
    \ are used instead of the entire names, which are summarized in Tables A10 and\
    \ A11\n(presented also in the Appendix A). The list of the aforementioned Tables,\

    \ Distribution of the Contributing Organizations\nThe subject of this sub-section\
    \ is to ﬁnd out the geographical distribution of all the\ncontributing organizations\
    \ in ML applications in agriculture. To that end, the author’s\nafﬁliation was\
    \ taken into account. In case a paper included more than one author, which\nwas\
    \ the most frequent scenario, each country could contribute only once in the ﬁnal\
    \ map\nchart (Figure 6), similarly to [83,84]. As can be gleaned from Figure 6,\
    \ investigating ML in\nagriculture is distributed worldwide, including both developed\
    \ and developing economies.\nRemarkably, out of the 55 contributing countries,\
    \ the least contribution originated from\nAfrican countries (3%), whereas the\
    \ major contribution came from Asian countries (55%).\nThe latter result is attributed\
    \ mainly to the considerable contribution of Chinese (24.9%) as\nwell as Indian\
    \ organizations (10.1%). USA appeared to be the second most contributing\ncountry\
    \ with 20.7% percentage, while Australia (9.5%), Spain (6.8%), Germany (5.9%),\n\
    Brazil, UK, and Iran (5.62%) seem to be particularly interested in ML in agriculture.\
    \ It\nshould be stressed that livestock management, which is a relatively different\
    \ sub-ﬁeld\ncomparing to crop, water, and soil management, was primary examined\
    \ from studies\ncoming from Australia, USA, China, and UK, while all the papers\
    \ regarding Ireland were\nfocused on animals. Finally, another noteworthy observation\
    \ is that a large number of\narticles were a result of international collaboration,\
    \ with the synergy of China and USA\nstanding out.\n4.1.3. Distribution of the\
    \ Most Contributing Journal Papers\nFor the purpose of identifying the research\
    \ areas that are mostly interested in ML\nin agriculture, the most frequently\
    \ appeared international journal papers are depicted in\nFigure 7. In total, there\
    \ were 129 relevant journals. However, in this bar chart, only the\njournals contributing\
    \ with at least 4 papers are presented for brevity. As a general remark,\nremote\
    \ sensing was of particular importance, since reliable data from satellites and\
    \ UAV, for\ninstance, constitute valuable input data for the ML algorithms. In\
    \ addition, smart farming,\nenvironment, and agricultural sustainability were\
    \ of central interest. Journals associated\nwith computational techniques were\
    \ also presented with considerable frequency. A typical\nexample of such type\
    \ of journals, which was presented in the majority of the studies with a\npercentage\
    \ of 19.8%, was “Computers and Electronics in Agriculture”. This journal aims\
    \ at\nproviding the advances in relation to the application of computers and electronic\
    \ systems\nfor solving problems in plant and animal production.\nSensors 2021,\
    \ 21, 3758\n14 of 55\nFigure 6. Geographical distribution of the contribution\
    \ of each country to the research ﬁeld focusing on machine learning\nin agriculture.\n\
    Figure 7. Distribution of the most contributing international journals (published\
    \ at least four articles) concerning applications\nof machine learning in agriculture.\n\
    Sensors 2021, 21, 3758\n15 of 55\nThe “Remote Sensing” and “Sensors” journals\
    \ followed with approximately 11.8% and\n6.5% of the total number of publications,\
    \ respectively. These are cross-sectoral journals\nthat are concentrated on applications\
    \ of science and sensing technologies in various ﬁelds,\nincluding agriculture.\
    \ Other journals, covering this research ﬁeld, were also “IEEE Access”\nand “International\
    \ Journal of Remote Sensing” with approximately 2.1% and 1.2% contribu-\ntion,\
    \ respectively. Moreover, agriculture-oriented journals were also presented in\
    \ Figure 7,\nincluding “Precision Agriculture”, “Frontiers in Plant Science”,\
    \ “Agricultural and Forest Me-\nteorology”, and “Agricultural Water Management”\
    \ with 1–3% percentage. These journals\ndeal with several aspects of agriculture\
    \ ranging from management strategies (so as to\nincorporate spatial and temporal\
    \ data as a means of optimizing productivity, resource use\nefﬁciency, sustainability\
    \ and proﬁtability of agricultural production) up to crop molecular\ngenetics\
    \ and plant pathogens. An interdisciplinary journal concentrating on soil functions\n\
    and processes also appeared with 2.1%, namely “Geoderma”, plausibly covering the\
    \ soil\nmanagement generic category. Finally, several journals focusing on physics\
    \ and applied\nnatural sciences, such as “Applied Sciences” (2.7%), “Scientiﬁc\
    \ Reports” (1.8%), “Biosystems\nEngineering” (1.5%), and “PLOS ONE” (1.5%), had\
    \ a notable contribution to ML studies.\nAs a consequence, ML in agriculture concerns\
    \ several disciplines and constitutes a fun-\ndamental area for developing various\
    \ techniques, which can be beneﬁcial to other ﬁelds\nas well.\n4.2. Synopsis of\
    \ the Main Features Associated with the Relative Literature\n4.2.1. Machine Learning\
    \ Models Providing the Best Results\nA wide range of ML algorithms was implemented\
    \ in the selected studies; their ab-\nbreviations are given in Table A11. The\
    \ ML algorithms that were used by each study\nas well as those that provided the\
    \ best output have been listed in the last two columns\nof Tables A1–A9. These\
    \ algorithms can be classiﬁed into the eight broad families of ML\nmodels, which\
    \ are summarized in Table A10. Figure 8 focuses on the best performed ML\nmodels\
    \ as a means of capturing a broad picture of the current situation and demonstrating\n\
    advancement similarly to [12].\nAs can be demonstrated in Figure 8, the most frequent\
    \ ML model providing the best\noutput was, by far, Artiﬁcial Neural Networks (ANNs),\
    \ which appeared in almost half of\nthe reviewed studies (namely, 51.8%). More\
    \ speciﬁcally, ANN models provided the best re-\nsults in the majority of the\
    \ studies concerning all sub-categories. ANNs have been inspired\nby the biological\
    \ neural networks that comprise human brains [85], while they allow for\nlearning\
    \ via examples from representative data describing a physical phenomenon. A dis-\n\
    tinct characteristic of ANNs is that they can develop relationships between dependent\
    \ and\nindependent variables, and thus extract useful information from representative\
    \ datasets.\nANN models can offer several beneﬁts, such as their ability to handle\
    \ noisy data [86], a sit-\nuation that is very common in agricultural measurements.\
    \ Among the most popular ANNs\nare the Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), which utilize\
    \ multiple hidden layers between\ninput and output layers. DNNs can be unsupervised,\
    \ semi-supervised, or supervised. A\nusual kind of DNNs are the Convolutional\
    \ Neural Networks (CNNs), whose layers, unlike\ncommon neural networks, can set\
    \ up neurons in three dimensions [87]. In fact, CNNs\nwere presented as the algorithms\
    \ that provide the best output in all sub-categories, with\nan almost 50% of the\
    \ individual percentage of ANNs. As stressed in recent studies, such\nas that\
    \ of Yang et al. [88], CNNs are receiving more and more attention because of their\n\
    efﬁcient results when it comes to detection through images’ processing.\nSensors\
    \ 2021, 21, 3758\n16 of 55\nFigure 8. Machine Learning models giving the best\
    \ output.\nRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) followed, representing approximately\
    \ 10% of\nANNs, with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) standing out. They are called\
    \ “recurrent”\nas they carry out the same process for every element, with the\
    \ previous computations\ndetermining the current output, while they have a “memory”\
    \ that stores information\npertaining to what has been calculated so far. RNNs\
    \ can face problems concerning van-\nishing gradients and inability to “memorize”\
    \ many sequential data. Towards addressing\nthese issues, the cell structures\
    \ of LSTM can control which part of information will be\neither stored in long\
    \ memory or discarded, resulting in optimization of the memorizing\nprocess [51].\
    \ Moreover, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Fully Convolutional Networks\n(FCNs),\
    \ and Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFNs) appeared to have the best perfor-\n\
    mance in almost 3–5% of ANNs. Finally, ML algorithms, belonging to ANNs with low\n\
    frequency, were Back-Propagation Neural Networks (BPNNs), Modular Artiﬁcial Neural\n\
    Networks (MANNs), Deep Belief Networks (DBNs), Adaptive-Neuro Fuzzy Inference\n\
    System (ANFIS), Subtractive Clustering Fuzzy Inference System (SCFIS), Takagi-Sugeno\n\
    Fuzzy Neural Networks (TS-FNN), and Feed Forward Neural Networks (FFNNs).\nThe\
    \ second most accurate ML model was Ensemble Learning (EL), contributing to\n\
    the ML models used in agricultural systems with approximately 22.2%. EL is a concise\n\
    term for methods that integrate multiple inducers for the purpose of making a\
    \ decision,\nnormally in supervised ML tasks. An inducer is an algorithm, which\
    \ gets as an input\na number of labeled examples and creates a model that can\
    \ generalize these examples.\nThus, predictions can be made for a set of new unlabeled\
    \ examples. The key feature\nof EL is that via combining various models, the errors\
    \ coming from a single inducer is\nlikely to be compensated from other inducers.\
    \ Accordingly, the prediction of the overall\nSensors 2021, 21, 3758\n17 of 55\n\
    performance would be superior comparing to a single inducer [89]. This type of\
    \ ML\nmodel was presented in all sub-categories, apart from crop quality, perhaps\
    \ owing to the\nsmall number of papers belonging in this subcategory. Support\
    \ Vector Machine (SVM)\nfollowed, contributing in approximately 11.5% of the studies.\
    \ The strength of the SVM\nstems from its capability to accurately learn data\
    \ patterns while showing reproducibility.\nDespite the fact that it can also be\
    \ applied for regression applications, SVM is a commonly\nused methodology for\
    \ classiﬁcation extending across numerous data science settings [90],\nincluding\
    \ agricultural research.\nDecision Trees (DT) and Regression models came next\
    \ with equal percentage, namely\n4.7%. Both these ML models were presented in\
    \ all generic categories. As far as DT are\nconcerned, they are either regression\
    \ or classiﬁcation models structured in a tree-like\narchitecture. Interestingly,\
    \ handling missing data in DT is a well-established problem. By\nimplementing\
    \ DT, the dataset can be gradually organized into smaller subsets, whereas,\n\
    in parallel, a tree graph is created. In particular, each tree’s node denotes\
    \ a dissimilar\npairwise comparison regarding a certain feature, while each branch\
    \ corresponds to the\nresult of this comparison. As regards leaf nodes, they stand\
    \ for the ﬁnal decision/prediction\nprovided after following a certain rule [91,92].\
    \ As for Regression, it is used for supervised\nlearning models intending to model\
    \ a target value on the basis of independent predictors.\nIn particular, the output\
    \ can be any number based on what it predicts. Regression is\ntypically applied\
    \ for time series modeling, prediction, and deﬁning the relationships\nbetween\
    \ the variables.\nFinally, the ML models, leading to optimal performance (although\
    \ with lower contri-\nbution to literature), were those of Instance Based Models\
    \ (IBM) (2.7%), Dimensionality\nReduction (DR) (1.5%), Bayesian Models (BM) (0.9%),\
    \ and Clustering (0.3%). IBM ap-\npeared only in crop, water, and livestock management,\
    \ whereas BM only in crop and\nsoil management. On the other hand, DR and Clustering\
    \ appeared as the best solution\nonly in crop management. In brief, IBM are memory-based\
    \ ML models that can learn\nthrough comparison of the new instances with examples\
    \ within the training database. DR\ncan be executed both in unsupervised and supervised\
    \ learning types, while it is typically\ncarried out in advance of classiﬁcation/regression\
    \ so as to prevent dimensionality effects.\nConcerning the case of BM, they are\
    \ a family of probabilistic models whose analysis is\nperformed within the Bayesian\
    \ inference framework. BM can be implemented in both\nclassiﬁcation and regression\
    \ problems and belong to the broad category of supervised\nlearning. Finally,\
    \ Clustering belongs to unsupervised ML models. It contains automatically\ndiscovering\
    \ of natural grouping of data [12].\n4.2.2. Most Studied Crops and Animals\nIn\
    \ this sub-section, the most examined crops and animals that were used in the\n\
    ML models are discussed as a result of our searching within the four sub-categories\n\
    of crop management similarly to [12]. These sub-categories refer to yield prediction,\n\
    disease detection, crop recognition, and crop quality. Overall, approximately\
    \ 80 different\ncrop species were investigated. The 10 most utilized crops are\
    \ summarized in Figure 9.\nSpeciﬁcally, the remarkable interest on maize (also\
    \ known as corn) can be attributed to\nthe fact that it is cultivated in many\
    \ parts across the globe as well as its versatile usage\n(for example, direct\
    \ consumption by humans, animal feed, producing ethanol, and other\nbiofuels).\
    \ Wheat and rice follow, which are two of the most widely consumed cereal\ngrains.\
    \ According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) [93], the trade in\n\
    wheat worldwide is more than the summation of all other crops. Concerning rice,\
    \ it is the\ncereal grain with the third-highest production and constitutes the\
    \ most consumed staple\nfood in Asia [94]. The large contribution of Asian countries\
    \ presented in Figure 6, like\nChina and India, justiﬁes the interest in this\
    \ crop. In the same vein, soybeans, which are\nbroadly distributed in East Asia,\
    \ USA, Africa, and Australia [95], were presented in many\nstudies. Finally, tomato,\
    \ grape, canola/rapeseed (cultivated primarily for its oil-rich seed),\npotato,\
    \ cotton, and barley complete the top 10 examined crops. All these species are\
    \ widely\nSensors 2021, 21, 3758\n18 of 55\ncultivated all over the world. Some\
    \ other indicative species, which were investigated at\nleast ﬁve times in the\
    \ present reviewed studies, were also alfalfa, citrus, sunﬂower, pepper,\npea,\
    \ apple, squash, sugarcane, and rye.\nFigure 9. The 10 most investigated crops\
    \ using machine learning models; the results refer to crop management.\nAs far\
    \ as livestock management is concerned, the examined animal species can be\nclassiﬁed,\
    \ in descending order of frequency, into the categories of cattle (58.5%), sheep\
    \ and\ngoats (26.8%), swine (14.6%), poultry (4.9%), and sheepdog (2.4%). As can\
    \ be depicted in\nFigure 10, the last animal, which is historically utilized with\
    \ regard to the raising of sheep,\nwas investigated only in one study belonging\
    \ to animal welfare, whereas all the other\nanimals were examined in both categories\
    \ of livestock management. In particular, the most\ninvestigated animal in both\
    \ animal welfare and livestock production was cattle. Sheep and\ngoats came next,\
    \ which included nine studies for sheep and two studies for goats. Cattles\nare\
    \ usually raised as livestock aimed at meat, milk, and hide used for leather.\
    \ Similarly,\nsheep are raised for meat and milk as well as ﬂeece. Finally, swine\
    \ (often called domestic\npigs) and poultry (for example, chicken, turkey, and\
    \ duck), which are used mainly for their\nmeat or eggs (poultry), had equal contribution\
    \ from the two livestock sub-categories.\nSensors 2021, 21, 3758\n19 of 55\nFigure\
    \ 10. Frequency of animal species in studies concerning livestock management by\
    \ using machine learning models.\n4.2.3. Most Studied Features and Technologies\n\
    As mentioned in the beginning of this study, modern agriculture has to incorporate\n\
    large amounts of heterogeneous data, which have originated from a variety of sensors\
    \ over\nlarge areas at various spatial scale and resolution. Subsequently, such\
    \ data are used as\ninput into ML algorithms for their iterative learning up until\
    \ modeling of the process in the\nmost effective way possible. Figure 11 shows\
    \ the features and technologies that were used\nin the reviewed studies, separately\
    \ for each category, for the sake of better comprehending\nthe results of the\
    \ analysis.\nData coming from remote sensing were the most common in the yield\
    \ prediction\nsub-category. Remote sensing, in turn, was primarily based on data\
    \ derived from satellites\n(40.6% of the total studies published in this sub-category)\
    \ and, secondarily, from UAVs\n(23.2% of the total studies published in this sub-category).\
    \ A remarkable observation is\nthe rapid increase of the usage of UAVs versus\
    \ satellites from the year 2018 towards 2020,\nas UAVs seem to be a reliable alternative\
    \ that can give faster and cheaper results, usually\nin higher resolution and\
    \ independent of the weather conditions. Therefore, UAVs allow\nfor discriminating\
    \ details of localized circumscribed regions that the satellites’ lowest\nresolution\
    \ may miss, especially under cloudy conditions. This explosion in the use of UAV\n\
    systems in agriculture is a result of the developing market of drones and sensing\
    \ solutions\nattached to them, rendering them economically affordable. In addition,\
    \ the establishment\nof formal regulations for UAV operations and the simpliﬁcation\
    \ and automatization of the\noperational and analysis processes had a signiﬁcant\
    \ contribution on the increasing popu-\nlarity of these systems. Data pertaining\
    \ to the weather conditions of the investigated area\nwere also of great importance\
    \ as well as soil parameters of the farm at hand. An additional\nway of getting\
    \ the data was via in situ manual measurements, involving measurements\nsuch as\
    \ crop height, plant growth, and crop maturity. Finally, data concerning topographic,\n\
    irrigation, and fertilization aspects were presented with approximately equal\
    \ frequency.\nSensors 2021, 21, 3758\n20 of 55\nFigure 11. Distribution of the\
    \ most usual features implemented as input data in the machine learning algorithms\
    \ for each\ncategory/sub-category.\nAs far as disease detection is concerned,\
    \ Red-Green-Blue (RGB) images appear to be\nthe most usual input data for the\
    \ ML algorithms (in 62% of the publications). Normally,\ndeep learning methods\
    \ like CNNs are implemented with the intention of training a classiﬁer\nto discriminate\
    \ images depicting healthy leaves, for example, from infected ones. CNNs\nSensors\
    \ 2021, 21, 3758\n21 of 55\nuse some particular operations to transform the RGB\
    \ images so that the desired features are\nenhanced. Subsequently, higher weights\
    \ are given to the images having the most suitable\nfeatures. This characteristic\
    \ constitutes a signiﬁcant advantage of CNNs as compared to\nother ML algorithms,\
    \ when it comes to image classiﬁcation [79]. The second most common\ninput data\
    \ came from either multispectral or hyperspectral measurements originated from\n\
    spectroradiometers, UAVs, and satellites. Concerning the investigated diseases,\
    \ fungal\ndiseases were the most common ones with diseases from bacteria following,\
    \ as is illustrated\nin Figure 12a. This kind of disease can cause major problems\
    \ in agriculture with detrimental\neconomic consequences [96]. Other examined\
    \ origins of crop diseases were, in descending\norder of frequency, pests, viruses,\
    \ toxicity, and deﬁciencies.\nFigure 12. Distribution of the most usual output\
    \ features of the machine learning algorithms regarding: (a) Disease detection\n\
    and (b) Crop quality.\nImages were also the most used input data for weed detection\
    \ purposes. These\nimages were RGB images that originated mainly from in situ\
    \ measurements as well as from\nUGVs and UAVs and, secondarily, multispectral\
    \ images from the aforementioned sources.\nFinally, other parameters that were\
    \ observed, although with lower frequency, were satellite\nmultispectral images,\
    \ mainly due to the considerably low resolution they provide, video\nrecordings,\
    \ and hyperspectral and greyscale images. Concerning crop recognition, the\nmajority\
    \ of the studies used data coming mostly from satellites and, secondarily, from\
    \ in\nsitu manual measurements. This is attributed to the fact that most of the\
    \ studies in this\ncategory concern crop classiﬁcation, a sector where satellite\
    \ imaging is the most widely\nused data source owing to its potential for analysis\
    \ of time series of extremely large surfaces\nof cultivated land. Laboratory measurements\
    \ followed, while RGB and greyscale images\nas well as hyperspectral and multispectral\
    \ measurements from UAVs were observed with\nlower incidence.\nThe input data\
    \ pertaining to crop quality consisted mainly of RGB images, while\nX-ray images\
    \ were also utilized (for seed germination monitoring). Additionally, quality\n\
    parameters, such as color, mass, and ﬂesh ﬁrmness, were used. There were also\
    \ two studies\nusing spectral data either from satellites or spectroradiometers.\
    \ In general, the studies\nbelonging in this sub-category dealt with either crop\
    \ quality (80%) or seed germination\npotential (20%) (Figure 12b). The latter\
    \ refers to the seed quality assessment that is essential\nfor the seed production\
    \ industry. Two studies were found about germination that both\ncombined X-ray\
    \ images analysis and ML.\nConcerning soil management, various soil properties\
    \ were taken into account in\n65.7% of the studies. These properties included\
    \ salinity, organic matter content, and\nelectrical conductivity of soil and soil\
    \ organic carbon. Usage of weather data was also\nSensors 2021, 21, 3758\n22 of\
    \ 55\nvery common (in 48.6% of the studies), while topographic and data pertaining\
    \ to the soil\nmoisture content (namely the ratio of the water mass over the dry\
    \ soil) and crop properties\nwere presented with lower frequency. Additionally,\
    \ remote sensing, including satellite\nand UAV multispectral and hyperspectral\
    \ data, as well as proximal sensing, to a lesser\nextent, were very frequent choices\
    \ (in 40% of the studies). Finally, properties associated\nwith soil temperature,\
    \ land type, land cover, root microbial dynamics, and groundwater\nsalinity make\
    \ up the rest of data, which are labeled as “other” in the corresponding graph\n\
    of Figure 11.\nIn water management, weather data stood for the most common input\
    \ data (appeared\nin the 75% of the studies), with ET being used in the vast majority\
    \ of them. In many cases,\naccurate estimation of ET (the summation of the transpiration\
    \ via the plant canopy and the\nevaporation from plant, soil, and open water surface)\
    \ is among the most central elements\nof hydrologic cycle for optimal management\
    \ of water resources [97]. Data from remote\nsensors and measurements of soil\
    \ water content were also broadly used in this category.\nSoil water availability\
    \ has a central impact on crops’ root growth by affecting soil aeration\nand nutrient\
    \ availability [98]. Stem water potential, appearing in three studies, is actually\n\
    a measure of water tension within the xylem of the plant, therefore functioning\
    \ as an\nindicator of the crop’s water status. Furthermore, in situ measurements,\
    \ soil, and other\nparameters related to cumulative water inﬁltration, soil and\
    \ water quality, ﬁeld topography,\nand crop yield were also used, as can be seen\
    \ in Figure 11.\nFinally, in what concerns livestock management, motion capture\
    \ sensors, including\naccelerometers, gyroscopes, and pedometers, were the most\
    \ common devices giving in-\nformation about the daily activities of animals.\
    \ This kind of sensors was used solely in\nthe studies investigating animal welfare.\
    \ Images, audio, and video recordings came next,\nhowever, appearing in both animal\
    \ welfare and livestock production sub-categories. Physi-\ncal and growth characteristics\
    \ followed, with slightly less incidence, by appearing mainly\nin livestock production\
    \ sub-category. These characteristics included the animal’s weight,\ngender, age,\
    \ metabolites, biometric traits, backfat and muscle thickness, and heat stress.\n\
    The ﬁnal characteristic may have detrimental consequences in livestock health\
    \ and product\nquality [99], while through the measurement of backfat and muscle\
    \ thickness, estimations\nof the carcass lean yield can be made [100].\n5. Discussion\
    \ and Main Conclusions\nThe present systematic review study deals with ML in agriculture,\
    \ an ever-increasing\ntopic worldwide. To that end, a comprehensive analysis of\
    \ the present status was conducted\nconcerning the four generic categories that\
    \ had been identiﬁed in the previous review by\nLiakos et al. [12]. These categories\
    \ pertain to crop, water, soil, and livestock management.\nThus, by reviewing\
    \ the relative literature of the last three years (2018–2020), several aspects\n\
    were analyzed on the basis of an integrated approach. In summary, the following\
    \ main\nconclusions can be drawn:\n•\nThe majority of the journal papers focused\
    \ on crop management, whereas the other\nthree generic categories contributed\
    \ almost with equal percentage. Considering the\nreview paper of [12] as a reference\
    \ study, it can be deduced that the above picture\nremains, more or less, the\
    \ same, with the only difference being the decrease of the\npercentage of the\
    \ articles regarding livestock from 19% to 12% in favor of those refer-\nring\
    \ to crop management. Nonetheless, this reveals just one side of the coin. Taking\n\
    into account the tremendous increase in the number of relative papers published\n\
    within the last three years (in particular, 40 articles were identiﬁed in [12]\
    \ comparing\nto the 338 of the present literature survey), approximately 400%\
    \ more publications\nwere found on livestock management. Another important ﬁnding\
    \ was the increasing\nresearch interest on crop recognition.\n•\nSeveral ML algorithms\
    \ have been developed for the purpose of handling the hetero-\ngeneous data coming\
    \ from agricultural ﬁelds. These algorithms can be classiﬁed in\nfamilies of ML\
    \ models. Similar to [12], the most efﬁcient ML models proved to be\nSensors 2021,\
    \ 21, 3758\n23 of 55\nANNs. Nevertheless, in contrast to [12], the interest also\
    \ been shifted towards EL,\nwhich can combine the predictions that originated\
    \ from more than one model. SVM\ncompletes the group with the three most accurate\
    \ ML models in agriculture, due to\nsome advantages, such as its high performance\
    \ when it works with image data [101].\n•\nAs far as the most investigated crops\
    \ are concerned, mainly maize and, secondarily,\nwheat, rice, and soybean were\
    \ widely studied by using ML. In livestock management,\ncattle along with sheep\
    \ and goats stood out constituting almost 85% of the studies.\nComparing to [12],\
    \ more species have been included, while wheat and rice as well as\ncattle, remain\
    \ important specimens for ML applications.\n•\nA very important result of the\
    \ present review study was the demonstration of the\ninput data used in the ML\
    \ algorithms and the corresponding sensors. RGB images\nconstituted the most common\
    \ choice, thus, justifying the broad usage of CNNs due\nto their ability to handle\
    \ this type of data more efﬁciently. Moreover, a wide range\nof parameters pertaining\
    \ to weather as well as soil, water, and crop quality was\nused. The most common\
    \ means of acquiring measurements for ML applications was\nremote sensing, including\
    \ imaging from satellites, UAVs and UGVs, while in situ and\nlaboratory measurements\
    \ were also used. As highlighted above, UAVs are constantly\ngaining ground against\
    \ satellites mainly because of their ﬂexibility and ability to\nprovide images\
    \ with high resolution under any weather conditions. Satellites, on\nthe other\
    \ hand, can supply time-series over large areas [102]. Finally, animal welfare-\n\
    related studies used mainly devices such as accelerometers for activity recognition,\n\
    whereas those ones referring to livestock production utilized primary physical\
    \ and\ngrowth characteristics of the animal.\nAs can be inferred from the geographical\
    \ distribution (illustrated in Figure 6) in\ntandem with the broad spectrum of\
    \ research ﬁelds, ML applications for facilitating various\naspects of management\
    \ in the agricultural sector is an important issue on an international\nscale.\
    \ As a matter of fact, its versatile nature favors convergence research. Convergence\n\
    research is a relatively recently introduced approach that is based on shared\
    \ knowledge\nbetween different research ﬁelds and can have a positive impact on\
    \ the society. This\ncan refer to several aspects, including improvement of the\
    \ environmental footprint and\nassuring human’s health. Towards this direction,\
    \ ML in agriculture has a considerable\npotential to create value.\nAnother noteworthy\
    \ ﬁnding of the present analysis is the capturing of the increasing\ninterest\
    \ on topics concerning ML analyses in agricultural applications. More speciﬁcally,\n\
    as can be shown in Figure 13, an approximately 26% increase was presented in the\
    \ total\nnumber of the relevant studies, if a comparison is made between 2018\
    \ and 2019. The\nnext year (i.e., 2020), the corresponding increase jumped to\
    \ 109% against 2019 ﬁndings;\nthus, resulting in an overall 164% rise comparing\
    \ with 2018. The accelerating rate of the\nresearch interest on ML in agriculture\
    \ is a consequence of various factors, following the\nconsiderable advancements\
    \ of ICT systems in agriculture. Moreover, there exists a vital\nneed for increasing\
    \ the efﬁciency of agricultural practices while reducing the environmental\nburden.\
    \ This calls for both reliable measurements and handling of large volumes of data\
    \ as\na means of providing a wide overview of the processes taking place in agriculture.\
    \ The\ncurrently observed technological outbreak has a great potential to strengthen\
    \ agriculture in\nthe direction of enhancing food security and responding to the\
    \ rising consumers’ demands.\nSensors 2021, 21, 3758\n24 of 55\nFigure 13. Temporal\
    \ distribution of the reviewed studies focusing on machine learning in agriculture,\
    \ which were published\nwithin 2018–2020.\nIn a nutshell, ICT in combination with\
    \ ML, seem to constitute one of our best hopes to\nmeet the emerging challenges.\
    \ Taking into account the rate of today’s data accumulation\nalong with the advancement\
    \ of various technologies, farms will certainly need to advance\ntheir management\
    \ practices by adopting Decision Support Systems (DSSs) tailored to the\nneeds\
    \ of each cultivation system. These DSSs use algorithms, which have the ability\
    \ to\nwork on a wider set of cases by considering a vast amount of data and parameters\
    \ that the\nfarmers would be impossible to handle. However, the majority of ICT\
    \ necessitates upfront\ncosts to be paid, namely the high infrastructure investment\
    \ costs that frequently prevent\nfarmers from adopting these technologies. This\
    \ is going to be a pressing issue, mainly in\ndeveloping economies, where agriculture\
    \ is an essential economic factor. Nevertheless,\nhaving a tangible impact is\
    \ a long-haul game. A different mentality is required by all\nstakeholders so\
    \ as to learn new skills, be aware of the potential proﬁts of handling big data,\n\
    and assert sufﬁcient funding. Overall, considering the constantly increasing recognition\
    \ of\nthe value of artiﬁcial intelligence in agriculture, ML will deﬁnitely become\
    \ a behind-the-\nscenes enabler for the establishment of a sustainable and more\
    \ productive agriculture. It\nis anticipated that the present systematic effort\
    \ is going to constitute a beneﬁcial guide to\nresearchers, manufacturers, engineers,\
    \ ICT system developers, policymakers, and farmers\nand, consequently, contribute\

    \ the most common and comprehensive statistical and machine learning algorithms\
    \ are linear regression. Linear \nregression is used to find a linear relationship\
    \ between one or more predictors. The linear regression has two types: simple\
    \ regression and \nmultiple regression (MLR). This paper discusses various works\
    \ by different researchers on linear regression and polynomial regression \nand\
    \ compares their performance using the best approach to optimize prediction and\
    \ precision. Almost all of the articles analyzed in this \nreview is focused on\
    \ datasets; in order to determine a model's efficiency, it must be correlated\
    \ with the actual values obtained for the \nexplanatory variables. \n \nKeywords:\

    Machine learning [1-5] is commonly used in diverse fields to \nsolve difficult\
    \ problems that cannot be readily solved in based \non computer approaches. The\
    \ linear regression is one of the \nsimplest and most common machine learning\
    \ algorithms. It is a \nmathematical approach used to perform predictive analysis.\
    \ \nLinear regression allows continuous/real or mathematical \nvariables projections.\
    \ Sir Francis Galton first suggested the \nconcept of linear regression in 1894.Linear\
    \ regression [6-8] is \na mathematical test used for evaluating and quantifying\
    \ the \nrelationship between the considered variables. Univariate \nregression\
    \ analyses (Chi-square, exact testing by Fisher and t-\ntesting and variance analysis\
    \ (ANOVA) cannot be used to take \ninto account the outcomes of the other covariates/founders\
    \ in \nthe analysis. Therefore, partial correlation and regression are \ntests\
    \ which enable scientists in understanding the relationship \nbetween two variables\
    \ to assess the impact of confusions [4, 9, \n10].Linear regression [11] is commonly\
    \ used in mathematical \nresearch methods, where it is possible to measure the\
    \ predicted \neffects and model them against multiple input variables. It is a\
    \ \nmethod of data evaluation and modeling that establishes linear \nrelationships\
    \ between variables that are dependent and \nindependent. This method would thus\
    \ model relationships \nbetween dependent variables and independent variables\
    \ from \nthe analysis and learning to the current training results. In this \n\
    article, an inclusive summary of researchers' recent and most \npopular approaches\
    \ in linear regression data processing, various \nstatistics and machine learning\
    \ over the last five years was \nperformed. The particulars of each process are\
    \ often \nsummarized, such as used algorithms, databases, accuracy and \nperformance[12].\
    \ This paper is organized as follows: \nIntroduction is explained in section I.\
    \ Theoretical background \nare presented in section II. Next, A Review and experimental\
    \ \nComparison are explained in section III. Discussion are \nexplained in section\
    \ IV. Section V describes conclusion. \nII. \nTHEORY \nA. Regression \nRegression\
    \ [13] is a technique used for two theories. First, \nregression analyzes are\
    \ usually used for forecasting and \nprediction, in which their application has\
    \ major overlaps with \nthe area of machine learning. Second, regression analysis\
    \ can \nbe used in some cases to determine causal relations between the \nindependent\
    \ and dependent variables. Importantly, regressions \nalone show only relations\
    \ between a dependent variable and a \nfixed dataset collection of different variables.\
    \ \n \nMaulud & Abdulazeez / Journal of Applied Science and Technology Trends\
    \ Vol. 01, No. 02, pp. 140 –147, (2020) \n141 \nB. Regression Models \nAccording\
    \ to the regression models, the independent variables \npredict the dependent\
    \ variables [14]. Regression analysis \nestimates dependent 'y' variable value\
    \ due to the range of \nindependent variable values 'x' [15]. We discuss linear\
    \ \nregression and polynomial regression in this paper that better \nfits the\
    \ predictive model[16]. Regression [17] may either be a \nsimple linear regression\
    \ or multiple regression. \n \n \nSimple Linear Regression  \nSimple Linear Regression\
    \ is a case model with a single \nindependent variable [18]. Simple Linear regression\
    \ defines the \ndependence of the variable. \U0001D466 = β0 + β1\U0001D465 + \U0001D700\
    \ . Simple \nregression distinguishes the influence of independent variables \n\
    from the interaction of dependent variables[19]. \n \n \nMultivariate linear\
    \ regression (MLR) \nMLR is a statistical technique to predict the result of an\
    \ answer \nvariable, using a number of explanatory variables. The object \nof\
    \ (MLR) is to model the linear relationship between the \nindependent variables\
    \ x and dependent variable y that will be \nanalyzed [20].The basic model for\
    \ MLR is: \n \U0001D466 = β0 + β1x1 + ⋯ + β\U0001D45Ax\U0001D45A + \U0001D700\
    \  The formula to determine \nthe formula matrix is:[21] . \n \n \n \n \n \n\
    \ \nPolynomial Regression  \nPolynomial regression [22, 23] is a type of regression\
    \ analyze \nin the nth degree polynomial modeling of the relationship \nbetween\
    \ independent and dependent variables. Polynomial \nregression is a special case\
    \ of MLR in which the polynomial \nequation of data blends in with curvilinear\
    \ interplay of the \ndependent and independent variables [24]. Model of \npolynomial\
    \ [25, 26] is: \U0001D466 = β0 + β1\U0001D465 + β2\U0001D4652 + ⋯ + βℎ\U0001D465\
    ℎ + \U0001D700 \nWhere h is named the polynomial degree [27, 28].  \n \nC. Least\
    \ square method \nThe least square method (LSM) [29, 30] use to find the best\
    \ fit \ncurve or line for one set of data points by reducing the amount \nof the\
    \ squares of the offsets (residual part) of the points of the \ncurve. The LSM\
    \ in the linear regression model use to find \U0001D44F0 \nand \U0001D44F1 predictions\
    \ such that the cumulative squared distance \nfrom the real \U0001D466\U0001D456\

    \U0001D45B\n\U0001D456=1\n \nThe motivation behind the least squares approach\

    \ review are observational \nstudies which used linear regression models through\
    \ (2016 to \n2020). Table 1.    presents  a  summary  of  each  study  selected\
    \ \n(reviewed)  in  this paper , the  summary  includes the dataset of \neach\
    \ paper, technique/ method, pros and cons of the used \nmethod and accuracy of\
    \ the results. As given in Table 1 there \nare three regression models (methods),\
    \   two papers (or 18%) are \nused SLRM, 7 papers (or 63%) are used MLRM and 2\
    \ papers \n(or 18%) are used polynomial regression. About (40%) used \nsimulation\
    \ to generate data to be modeled and (60%) are used \nthe historical data sets,\
    \ Fewer than (20%) of the papers predicted \nof future values, examined collinearity.\
    \   Statistical significance \ntesting or confidence intervals, goodness of fit\
    \ were reported in \nall papers. The best-achieved accuracy of the reviewed papers\
    \ \nand from those who depended on the MLRM algorithms is \nresearch [44] because\
    \ the fitting of the MLRM is very good and \nthe prediction error is small. [11]\
    \ Used SLM method, the \naverage accuracy was 90% or almost 10% of the forecasts\
    \ were \ninaccurate Based on a test run of the regression program, there \nwere\
    \ some drawbacks to the software's predictive results. We \nmay implement advanced\
    \ machine learning algorithms, such as \nhelp vector machine and deep neural network,\
    \ to solve \nproblems. [53] Two methods were proposed for estimating \nenergy\
    \ output from renewables, using the R-square figure for the \ncurve fitting of\
    \ the polynomial method is considerably higher \nthan the one of the linear regression\
    \ method. However, the \nobtained regression equation will be used in the future\
    \ to analyze \nand study the relationship and interactions between demand and\
    \ \nenergy production using machine learning in order to model \nelectrical transport.\
    \ The accuracy value of three reviewed papers \nwere used MLRM method [14, 37,\
    \ 49] is about (82%), fitting a \nmodel with low accuracy can cause by including\
    \ not significant \nvariables, in these situations to identify candidate variables\
    \ the \nstepwise regression can be used, because Specification of the \nappropriate\
    \  model depends on the proper variables. In [37] it is \nconsidered that the\
    \ standard MLRM is applied and the accuracy \nof the data is improved. Early stage\
    \ regression modelling using \nStepwise and Best Subsets Regression can help in\
    \ model \nspecification. The authors in [14] Discrete features (derived \nfrom\
    \ sampled diabetes data) were projected to a new space using \nPCA, after which\
    \ they were analyzed using MLRM. \nV. \nCONCLUSION \nRegression modeling is a\
    \ statistical method commonly used in \nresearch, particularly for observational\
    \ studies. The proper \nchoice of regression model, the choosing and presence\
    \ of model \nvariables are the key actions which should be established and \n\
    properly controlled in order to achieve valid statistical results \nbecause the\
    \ unavailability or misapplication of an appropriate \nregression modeling may\
    \ cause to inaccuracies results. This \nreview utilized (23) papers appeared in\
    \ the last 5 years on three \nregression models: Simple Linear Regression Model\
    \ is suitable \nto data contains a linear relationship between two variables,\
    \ a \nMLR Model is a linear relation between two or more \nindependent variables\
    \ a Polynomial Regression Model would be \nused in case of variables having a\
    \ polynomial relationship. The \nresults of this review illustrate that almost\
    \ all of the provided \nresearch papers estimated the models utilizing data sets,\
    \ the \naccuracy of the models was measured and the predictive ability \nof the\
    \ method is really important, to measure the performance of \na regression method,\
    \ a comparative study has been done \nbetween predicted and sample values.  \n\

    \ worldwide. Development\nof management plans needs a deep understanding of the\
    \ likelihood and magnitude of future ﬂood\nevents. The purpose of this research\
    \ was to estimate ﬂash ﬂood susceptibility in the Tafresh watershed,\nIran, using\
    \ ﬁve machine learning methods, i.e., alternating decision tree (ADT), functional\
    \ tree\n(FT), kernel logistic regression (KLR), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and\
    \ quadratic discriminant\nanalysis (QDA). A geospatial database including 320\
    \ historical ﬂood events was constructed and eight\ngeo-environmental variables—elevation,\
    \ slope, slope aspect, distance from rivers, average annual\nrainfall, land use,\
    \ soil type, and lithology—were used as ﬂood inﬂuencing factors. Based on a variety\n\
    of performance metrics, it is revealed that the ADT method was dominant over the\
    \ other methods.\nThe FT method was ranked as the second-best method, followed\
    \ by the KLR, MLP, and QDA. Given\na few diﬀerences between the goodness-of-ﬁt\
    \ and prediction success of the methods, we concluded\nthat all these ﬁve machine-learning-based\
    \ models are applicable for ﬂood susceptibility mapping in\nother areas to protect\
    \ societies from devastating ﬂoods.\nKeywords: alternating decision tree; data\
    \ mining; spatial modeling; susceptibility mapping; GIS\n1. Introduction\nFloods\
    \ are destructive disasters that endanger human life and cause global economic\
    \ losses\nof about 60 billion USD annually [1]. In general, ﬂoods are divided\
    \ into ﬁve types based on their\nlocations and causes, including riverine ﬂooding,\
    \ urban drainage, ground failures, ﬂuctuating lake\nSustainability 2019, 11, 5426;\
    \ doi:10.3390/su11195426\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\nSustainability\
    \ 2019, 11, 5426\n2 of 19\nlevels and coastal ﬂooding and erosion [2]. Flash ﬂoods\
    \ are common types of riverine ﬂooding that\noccur when a large amount of water\
    \ is discharged within a few minutes or hours (three to six hours) of\nexcessive\
    \ rainfall, the collapse of natural ice, or a dam failure [3]. Identifying the\
    \ areas susceptible\nto ﬂooding supports well-informed ﬂood management and helps\
    \ in reducing risks and losses [4–6].\nDevelopment of ﬂood susceptibility maps\
    \ is also key in comprehensive watershed management.\nHowever, accurate prediction\
    \ of areas susceptible to ﬂooding and production of reliable susceptibility\n\
    maps is multifaceted and time-consuming due to the complexity of ﬂood occurrences,\
    \ interaction of\nvarious geo-environmental and anthropogenic factors, and the\
    \ paucity of accurate data [5–9].\nGlobal advancement of computational techniques\
    \ and geographical information system (GIS) [10]\nhas resulted in development\
    \ of various spatially explicit modeling approaches that rely on the\nphysically-based\
    \ hydraulic models and data-driven methods; these could be used for ﬂood susceptibility\n\
    modeling and mapping [5–9,11]. Hydraulic models have been extensively used to\
    \ simulate ﬂood\ncharacteristics [12–14]. Recently, there has been a growing interest\
    \ in data-driven methods as suitable\nalternatives to hydraulic models. These\
    \ methods are especially advantageous when: (i) relatively large\namount of data\
    \ is available; (ii) the study watershed is not subject to substantial changes\
    \ over the\nanalysis time; and (iii) implementation of complex computational hydraulic\
    \ models is diﬃcult [15].\nCompared to hydraulic models, data-driven methods allow\
    \ for rapid ﬂood modeling as they are less\nsensitive to input data, easier to\
    \ implement and more computationally eﬃcient [16,17]. Some of the\nnotable methods\
    \ include statistical and probabilistic models [7,18], multi-criteria decision\
    \ making [19],\nlogistic regression (LR) [18,20], decision trees [8,21,22], artiﬁcial\
    \ neural network (ANN) [6,23], extreme\nlearning machine [6], support vector machine\
    \ (SVM) [6,22] and low-complexity tools such as AutoRoute\nand height above the\
    \ nearest drainage (HAND) [24,25]. Despite these applications, other data-driven\n\
    techniques have been rarely explored for their capability in ﬂood modeling.\n\
    This study explored the prediction success of ﬁve machine learning techniques—alternating\n\
    decision tree (ADT), functional tree (FT), Kernel logistic regression (KLR), multilayer\
    \ perceptron (MLP)\nand quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA)—for ﬂood susceptibility\
    \ mapping in the Tafresh watershed,\nIran. Our speciﬁc objectives are to: (i)\
    \ explore and compare the eﬃciency of these ﬁve techniques to\nproduce ﬂood susceptibility\
    \ maps; and (ii) generate a ﬂood susceptibility map for the study area.\n2. Study\
    \ Area\nTafresh watershed is located in the Markazi Province, Iran (Figure 1).\
    \ The 1605 km2 watershed is\ncharacterized by a mountainous topography, cold winters\
    \ and relatively moderate summers. Mean\nannual rainfall and evaporation are 304\
    \ and 1921 mm. The average temperatures in summer and\nwinter were recorded as\
    \ 19.2 and 6.4 ◦C, respectively, with 73 freezing days over the year [26]. The\n\
    major rivers of this city are: Abkamer, which originates from the southern highlands\
    \ of Tafresh and\njoins the Qara Chai River, about 4 km northwest of Tafresh;\
    \ Farminin, that originates from Rudbar\nvillage and after irrigating parts of\
    \ the city, ﬂows into the Salt Lake; and Qara Chai, that irrigates parts\nof the\
    \ north of the city and then ﬂows into the Salt Lake of Qom [27]. Due to heavy\
    \ rainfall in winter,\nthe discharge of the rivers increases and causes severe\
    \ overbank ﬂooding [27]. In addition, due to the\nMediterranean climate of the\
    \ province, which causes heavy rainfall during spring and autumn, ﬂash\nﬂoods\
    \ occur frequently during these seasons [26].\nSustainability 2019, 11, 5426\n\
    3 of 19\nFigure 1. Location of the study area.\n3. Methodology\nThe ﬂood susceptibility\
    \ mapping methodology consists of four main steps (Figure 2): (i)\nconstruction\
    \ of a geospatial database for inﬂuential factors and historical ﬂood events;\
    \ (ii) development\nof the machine learning models; (iii) model validation against\
    \ historical ﬂood events; and (iv)\ngeneration of ﬂood susceptibility maps. A\
    \ detailed description of each step is presented in the\nfollowing subsections.\n\

    Tafresh watershed is one of the ﬂood-prone watersheds that is usually aﬀected\
    \ by ﬂoods due\nto topographic and climatic characteristics. Numerous ﬂoods have\
    \ occurred in the past and caused\nsevere damages to the human life and buildings.\
    \ One of the major ﬂoods in the watershed occurred\nin 2017, with a 24-hour rainfall\
    \ depth of 90 mm, resulting in over one million USD damages in the\nwatershed\
    \ (Figure 3).\nFigure 3. Examples of past ﬂood events in the study area.\nHere,\
    \ the geographic locations of 320 historical ﬂoods were obtained from the Regional\
    \ Water\nOrganization of Markazi Province to develop an inventory ﬂood map. These\
    \ ﬂoods were then divided\ninto two groups. The ﬁrst group included 70% of ﬂood\
    \ data, which was then used as the training dataset,\nand the second group included\
    \ 30% of the remaining data, which was used as the validation dataset.\n3.1.2.\
    \ Flood Inﬂuencing Factors\nBased on an extensive review of the literature [3,5–9,11,18–22,28],\
    \ the characteristics of the\nhistorical ﬂoods in the study watershed and multiple\
    \ ﬁeld observations, we selected eight inﬂuential\nfactors—elevation, slope, slope\
    \ aspect, distance from rivers, average annual rainfall, land use, soil type\n\
    and lithology—for ﬂood susceptibility mapping.\nElevation is an important variable\
    \ in ﬂood occurrence [5,6,18]. In general, ﬂooding and elevation\nhave an inverse\
    \ relationship, as low-elevated areas are more prone to ﬂooding [8,11]. Here,\
    \ the elevation\nmap of the study area was extracted from a digital elevation\
    \ model (DEM) with a 12.5 m pixel size that\nwas obtained from the ALOS PALSAR\
    \ sensor (https://earth.esa.int/web/guest/home) (Figure 4a). Slope\nis one of\
    \ the inﬂuential factors in the occurrence of ﬂoods due to its direct impact on\
    \ surface runoﬀ and\ninﬁltration potential [8]. Flood-prone areas are often located\
    \ within ﬂat landscapes [6,22] as ﬂoods likely\nhave long durations, which cause\
    \ water stagnation (long ﬂood duration) that causes environmental\nhazard. The\
    \ slope map was derived from the DEM and classiﬁed into ﬁve classes (Figure 4b).\
    \ Aspect is\nSustainability 2019, 11, 5426\n5 of 19\nanother inﬂuencing factor\
    \ in determining the ﬂood occurrence because it is directly associated with the\n\
    convergence and direction of water ﬂow [18,22,29]. The aspect map of the research\
    \ area was extracted\nfrom the DEM and classiﬁed into nine classes (Figure 4c).\
    \ Distance from rivers has a signiﬁcant eﬀect on\nthe probability and magnitude\
    \ of ﬂooding because the terrestrial water storages are highly associated\nwith\
    \ ﬂood events [6,7,18,22]. The map of this factor was prepared based on the Euclidian\
    \ distance and\ndivided into six classes (Figure 4d). Rainfall depth is a key\
    \ factor that could have the greatest eﬀect on\nﬂooding [6,7,18,22]. The spatial\
    \ distribution of average annual rainfall in the Tafresh watershed was\nprepared\
    \ using the metrological data obtained from the period of 1993–2018 [26] (Figure\
    \ 4e). Land\nuse has a signiﬁcant eﬀect on ﬂood susceptibility [30,31]. The land-use\
    \ map was derived from the\nOLI Landsat satellite imagery (https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/operational-land-imager-oli/)\
    \ of 2017/6/24\nusing the maximum likelihood algorithm and supervised environment\
    \ classiﬁcation in the ENVI\nsoftware [32] (Figure 4f). Soil type was another\
    \ inﬂuencing factor because it controls the inﬁltration\nand runoﬀ [7,21]. The\
    \ soil type map was obtained from the Natural Resources Oﬃce of the Markazi\n\
    Province, Iran (Figure 4g). The last factor was lithology, which represents units\
    \ of rocks and soils that\naﬀect inﬁltration and runoﬀ [6,7,33]. We obtained the\
    \ lithology map from the Administrative Oﬃce of\nthe Natural Resources of Markazi\
    \ Province, Iran (Figure 4h, Table 1).\nTable 1. Lithology units in the Tafresh\

    3.2. Training and Validation Datasets\nThe geospatial database that was constructed\
    \ in the ﬁrst step of the modeling methodology\nwas used to generate training\
    \ and validation datasets for the modeling process. To this end, the\nﬂood inventory\
    \ map was randomly divided into two sets; one set with 70% of historical ﬂood\n\
    locations, was used for training and another set with the remaining 30% of ﬂood\
    \ locations was used\nfor validation [6,7,33]. Similar to the ﬂood locations,\
    \ 360 unﬂooded samples were selected from\nthe unﬂooded portions of the study\
    \ area and used to complete the training and validation datasets.\nFlooded and\
    \ unﬂooded datasets were overlaid to generate the ﬁnal training and validation\
    \ datasets.\nSustainability 2019, 11, 5426\n6 of 19\nFigure 4. Inﬂuencing factors\

    \ and (h) lithology.\nSustainability 2019, 11, 5426\n7 of 19\n3.3. Spatial Relationship\n\
    Using the frequency ratio (FR) method, we investigated the spatial relationship\
    \ between the\ncomponents of the historical ﬂoods and each of the eight inﬂuencing\
    \ factors. For each class of the\ninﬂuencing factors, the FR was calculated using\
    \ the following equation [7,34,35]:\nFR =\n a\nb\nc\nd\n!\n(1)\nwhere a: number\
    \ of ﬂood pixels within the class i of a given factor; b: total number of ﬂood\
    \ pixels in\nthe domain; c: number of pixels in class i of a given factor; d:\
    \ total number of pixels in the domain.\n3.4. Machine Learning Methods\nHere,\
    \ we brieﬂy describe the ﬁve machine learning methods used in this study. A full\
    \ description\nof each method can be found in the literature [36–38].\n3.4.1.\
    \ Alternating Decision Tree (ADT)\nADT is an integration of decision trees and\
    \ boosting procedures proposed to increase the prediction\naccuracy of binary\
    \ classiﬁcation problems [36]. This method alters decision nodes, which indicate\
    \ a\npredicate condition, and prediction nodes, which consist of a single number.\
    \ Decision nodes determine\na predicate condition, while prediction nodes contain\
    \ a single number. ADT is grown using a boosting\nalgorithm for numeric prediction,\
    \ in which a decision node and its two prediction nodes are constructed\nat each\
    \ boosting iteration step [39]. Each prediction node is assigned a weight that\
    \ represents the\ncontribution of the node to the ﬁnal prediction score. The summation\
    \ of all the contribution weights\nyields the ﬁnal prediction probability. This\
    \ procedure diﬀers from other decision tree based methods\nsuch as classiﬁcation\
    \ and regression tree (CART) or C4.5, in which a sample follows only one path\n\
    through the tree [40].\n3.4.2. Functional Tree (FT)\nFT is a multivariate decision\
    \ tree that uses a combination of traits in leaves and/or in internal nodes\n\
    to develop a hierarchical framework for handling classiﬁcation problems [37].\
    \ For these problems, FT\nutilizes a logistic regression function for splitting\
    \ the functional inner nodes and for prediction at the\nfunctional leaves. This\
    \ is the main advantage of the FT model over conventional hierarchical models\n\
    that only use the input data.\n3.4.3. Kernel Logistic Regression (KLR)\nKLR is\
    \ a traditional classiﬁcation method based on minimizing the negative log-likelihood\
    \ function\nthat utilizes the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno algorithm to estimate\
    \ the probabilistic outcomes.\nIn contrast to the LR, KLR has the ability to classify\
    \ inseparable linear problems by transferring input\ncharacteristics to a higher-dimensional\
    \ space through the kernel [41]. KLR that requires only solving\nan unconstrained\
    \ quadratic can provide probabilities and the straightforward extent to multi-class\n\
    classiﬁcation problems. Proper parameter tuning makes KLR a computationally eﬃcient\
    \ method.\nWe used the statistical software R to implement KLR and tuned the parameter\
    \ using a trial and\nerror process.\n3.4.4. Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)\nMLP represents\
    \ a three-layer structure that consists of an input layer, an output layer and\
    \ one or\nmore intermediate layers, which are not directly connected to input\
    \ data and outgoing outputs. The\ninput layer units are only responsible for distributing\
    \ the inputs to the next layer and the output layer\nalso provides the response\
    \ of the output signals. In this tier, the number of neurons is equal to the\n\
    Sustainability 2019, 11, 5426\n8 of 19\nnumber of inputs and outputs and the hidden\
    \ layers of the relationship interact with the input and\noutput layers. In MLP,\
    \ there is no deﬁnite algorithm for determining the number of hidden layers and\n\
    the number of neurons and this is often done by trial and error [42,43].\n3.4.5.\
    \ Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)\nQDA is a conventional classiﬁcation technique\
    \ with a quadratic decision surface to deal with\ndiﬀerent covariance values.\
    \ In the QDA, measurements in each class are assumed to be normal. An\nadvantage\
    \ of this method is that QDA does not assume the same covariance of each class\
    \ and can\ncope with diﬀerent amounts of covariance classes. QDA is an easy-to-use\
    \ and attractive classiﬁcation\ntechnique because it does not ask for parameter\
    \ tuning. This method has been successfully applied in\nvarious modeling practices\
    \ [44,45].\n3.5. Performance Metrics\n3.5.1. Receiver Operating Characteristic\
    \ (ROC) Curve\nROC curve is of the most commonly used procedures for checking\
    \ the performance of the\npredictive models [46,47]. ROC curve is a two-dimensional\
    \ curve that plots the true positive rate (TPR)\non the y-axis and the false positive\
    \ rate (FPR) on the x-axis. The ROC curve quantiﬁes the performance\nof a model\
    \ using the area under the curve (AUC), with values having a range of 0.5–1.0.\
    \ A higher AUC\nindicates a better model performance [48,49].\n3.5.2. Statistical\
    \ Indices\nSeven statistical indices were used for further assessment of the model\
    \ performances: positive\npredictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV),\
    \ sensitivity (SST), speciﬁcity (SPF), accuracy\n(ACC), Kappa and root-mean-square\
    \ error (RMSE). Given the nature of a ﬂood modeling problem,\nwhich is treated\
    \ as a binary pattern recognition problem (0 = unﬂooded, 1= ﬂooded), these indices\
    \ are\ncalculated as [50,51]:\nPPV =\nA\nA + B\n(2)\nNPV =\nC\nC + D\n(3)\nSST\
    \ =\nA\nA + D\n(4)\nSPF =\nC\nC + B\n(5)\nACC =\nA + C\nA + C + B + D\n(6)\nwhere\
    \ A, B, C and D are the numbers of true positives, false positives, true negatives\
    \ and false\nnegatives, respectively.\nK = PO − Pest\n1 − Pest\n(7)\nPo = (A +\
    \ C)\n(8)\nPest = (A + D) × (A + D) + (B + C) × (D + C)\n(9)\nwhere Pa is the\
    \ relative observed agreement among raters and Pest is the hypothetical probability\

    4.1. Spatial Relationship\nSpatial relationship between historical ﬂoods and inﬂuencing\
    \ factors (measured via the FR method)\nrevealed that the most ﬂood-prone portions\
    \ of the Tafresh watershed are located on the orchards (FR\n= 7.8), the lithology\
    \ groups 7 and 11 (FR = 7.2 and 2.62), distance from rivers of 0–200 m (FR = 5.61\n\
    and 2.48), slope degree 0.9–3 (FR = 1.99), the residential areas (FR = 1.79),\
    \ elevation of 1296–1823 m\n(FR = 1.49) and on the northwest slopes (FR = 1.48).\
    \ Conversely, those portions of the study area\nwith an elevation >2500 m and\
    \ permit lithology groups 3, 8, 9, 12, 13 and 16 were identiﬁed as the\nlow-susceptibility\
    \ areas in the watershed (Figure 5).\n4.2. Model Performance\nBased on the performance\
    \ metrics (Section 3.5), all models were found to be powerful for\nrecognizing\
    \ the general pattern of ﬂood susceptibility (i.e., training performance) in the\
    \ study area.\nADT method, with the lowest RMSE (0.247; Figure 6) and the greatest\
    \ PPV (90.4%), NPV (95.2%),\nSST (95%), SPF (90.9%), ACC (92.8%) (Figure 7) and\
    \ Kappa (0.856) (Table 2) indices had the best\nperformance. This method correctly\
    \ classiﬁed 90.4% of the ﬂooded cells and 95.2% of the unﬂooded\ncells, indicating\
    \ an excellent agreement between predicted and observed ﬂood events.\nTable 2.\

    \ however, the performance of the methods was inconsistent. For example,\nwhile\
    \ the QDA model achieved the lowest RMSE (0.28) and the greatest PPV (94.4%),\
    \ SPF (93.8%),\nACC (90.1%) and Kappa (0.803) values, the MLP model had the highest\
    \ NPV (94.6%) and SST (94.2%).\nThe FT model, with the greatest RMSE (0.309) and\
    \ with the lowest NPV (80.3%), SST (82.9%) and ACC\n(88%), was ranked as the least\
    \ eﬀective model, although this model was successful at classifying 95% of\nthe\
    \ unﬂooded cells (SPF) and 95.8% of all pixels in the ﬂooded class (PPV), with\
    \ an excellent agreement\nbetween predictions and observations (Kappa = 0.761).\
    \ The AUC values for the training and validation\nphases (Figure 8) demonstrated\
    \ the superiority of the ADT model (AUCtraining = 0.981; AUCvalidation\n= 0.972)\
    \ for modeling ﬂood susceptibility, followed by the MLP (AUCtraining = 0.963;\
    \ AUCvalidation =\n0.959), QDA (AUCtraining = 0.954; AUCvalidation = 0.956), KLR\
    \ (AUCtraining = 0.953; AUCvalidation = 0.95)\nand FT (AUCtraining = 0.95; AUCvalidation\
    \ = 0.95) models, sequentially.\n4.3. Flood Susceptibility Maps\nWe applied the\
    \ validated models to estimate ﬂood susceptibility values in the study watershed.\n\
    The ﬂood susceptibility values were then reclassiﬁed into ﬁve susceptibility classes—very\
    \ low, low,\nmoderate, high and very high—using the geometrical intervals classiﬁcation\
    \ scheme. This resulted\nin ﬁve ﬂood susceptibility maps (Figure 9), one for each\
    \ machine learning method. Among the ﬁve\nmethods, the QDA predicted the greatest\
    \ portion (26.1%) of the watershed into very high susceptibility,\nSustainability\
    \ 2019, 11, 5426\n10 of 19\nwhereas the ADT predicted the smallest area (12.9%)\
    \ to very high susceptibility (Figure 9a). Despite the\ndiﬀerence in the performance\
    \ of the models, all the models suggested that the low-lying areas along\nthe\
    \ rivers, orchards and the residential areas (western part of the watershed) are\
    \ the most ﬂood-prone\nportions of the study watershed. Overall, nearly 30% of\
    \ the Tafresh watershed is covered by the high\nand very high ﬂood susceptibilities,\
    \ indicating that the mitigation strategies (e.g., warning systems)\nand monitoring\
    \ plans should primarily focus on these portions of the watershed.\nFigure 5.\

    \ the ﬂood-prone areas is one of the important measures for development\nof mitigation\
    \ plans and proper resource allocation in response to future ﬂood events. Despite\
    \ the\nuniversal application of machine learning techniques for prediction of\
    \ ﬂoods, generating a reliable\nﬂood susceptibility map is still a challenging\
    \ task. In this study, we applied ﬁve machine learning\nmethods—ADT, FT, KLR,\
    \ MLP and QDA—and compared their predictive performance in the Tafresh\nwatershed,\
    \ Iran. Nine ﬂood inﬂuencing factors were used in ﬂood susceptibility mapping.\
    \ Our results\nSustainability 2019, 11, 5426\n15 of 19\ndemonstrated that the\
    \ ADT method was dominant over the other four methods in terms of overall\ntraining\
    \ and validation performance. This ﬁnding was in agreement with past ﬂood susceptibility\n\
    mapping studies. For example, Khosravi et al. [52] demonstrated the capability\
    \ of the ADT model\nover the logistic model tree (LMT), reduced error pruning\
    \ tree and Naïve Bayes tree models for\nﬂood prediction in the Haraz watershed,\
    \ Iran. In a recent study, Costache [53] found that the most\naccurate ﬂood susceptibility\
    \ map for the center of Romania is derived from the ADT model, which\noutperformed\
    \ the weights of evidence and LMT models. Further, our results are supported by\
    \ previous\nﬁndings that machine learning methods represent predictive ﬂood models\
    \ with high capability and\nreliability [54]. For example, using the multivariate\
    \ discriminant analysis (MDA), classiﬁcation and\nregression trees (CART), SVM\
    \ [22], genetic algorithm rule-set production (GARP), quick unbiased\neﬃcient\
    \ statistical tree (QUEST) [28], ANN [23], adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system\
    \ (ANFIS) [55]\nand boosted regression trees (BRT) [9] methods, the researchers\
    \ successfully predicted and mapped\nthe distribution of ﬂood susceptibilities\
    \ within diﬀerent regions of Iran. Similar results have also\nbeen reported from\
    \ USA [56], Australia [57], China [58], Vietnam [6] and Romania [59]. Additionally,\n\
    the literature consists of several successful experiments of using machine learning\
    \ methods for the\nprediction of landslide [39], wildﬁre [50] and gully erosion\
    \ [60].\nADT is a robust algorithm against the potential errors of a modeling\
    \ process and provides\nsigniﬁcant improvement in classiﬁcation error [36]. In\
    \ addition to a robust classiﬁcation scheme, ADT\nrepresents a measure of conﬁdence,\
    \ known as the classiﬁcation margin, which helps the model to easily\nlearn alternating\
    \ trees from the training dataset [50]. The overall advantage of the ADT model\
    \ is ease of\nimplementation because this method does not have several hyper-parameters\
    \ to be tuned and modelers\njust deal with the number of boosting iterations [52].\
    \ Nonetheless, in line with the previous works that\nacknowledged the eﬃciency\
    \ of these ﬁve machine learning methods for modeling diﬀerent types of\nnatural\
    \ hazards [39,50,60], we found that all the ﬁve methods are fairly straightforward\
    \ and easy to\nimplement within the open-source WEKA software [61] for ﬂood susceptibility\
    \ mapping. We suggest\nthat these methods could be applied in many diﬀerent landscapes\
    \ for ﬂood susceptibility mapping.\nOur results revealed that the high susceptibility\
    \ classes of ﬂood occurrences are associated with\nthose portions of the research\
    \ area that are characterized by human activities such as orchards and\nresidential\
    \ areas. The extensive levee systems within the study area have signiﬁcantly reduced\
    \ the\nland area for ﬂoodwater storage, suggesting the need for redesigning the\
    \ levee system to increase\nﬂoodwater storage and at the same time provide the\
    \ population and infrastructure with widespread\nﬂood protection. It is noteworthy\
    \ that due to substantial human activities in the Tafresh watershed,\nthe probability\
    \ of ﬂoods in the present study do not seem to be constant over a long period\
    \ of time,\nhighlighting the need for periodic assessments of ﬂood susceptibility\
    \ for adopting better informed\nﬂood mitigation strategies.\nOur results have\
    \ implications for regional ﬂood planning and watershed protection. In the study\n\
    watershed, stream gauges with adequate observations are not available, which makes\
    \ it impossible to\ndevelop reliable hydraulic models. The ﬁve data-mining methods\
    \ could be eﬀective alternatives for\nﬂood susceptibility mapping in these situations\
    \ (limited hydrologic and geomorphologic observations)\nand in ungauged watersheds.\
    \ The ﬂood susceptibility maps generated here could be used to identify\nareas\
    \ that need mitigation actions. In addition to the pre-ﬂood management stage that\
    \ was illustrated\nhere, the computationally eﬃcient data mining methods could\
    \ be applied for ﬂood-related studies\nwhere fast computation is crucial. A potential\
    \ application could be real-time ﬂood forecasting, where\nthe application of hydraulic\
    \ models would require a massive amount of time. The data-driven methods\npresented\
    \ here could be eﬀectively used for emergency management to guide evacuation plans,\
    \ which\nare directly linked to public safety.\n6. Summary\nIn this study, we\
    \ evaluated ﬁve machine learning methods for ﬂash ﬂood susceptibility mapping\n\
    in the Tafresh watershed, Iran. The methods showed a few diﬀerences in performance.\
    \ Therefore, we\nSustainability 2019, 11, 5426\n16 of 19\nfound that all these\
    \ methods are suitable for ﬂood susceptibility mapping. Since the study watershed\n\
    lacks stream gauges with adequate observations, it is not possible to develop\
    \ reliable hydraulic\nmodels. Therefore, the ﬁve data-driven methods used here\
    \ could be eﬀective alternates for ﬂood\nsusceptibility mapping.\nModeling frameworks\
    \ like what is presented here are useful for optimal ﬂood management and for\n\
    sustainable conservation of the human society. They also contribute to improving\
    \ the understanding\nof planners, managers and engineers to review their conservation\
    \ plans in response to future ﬂoods.\nThe results are, however, only valid for\
    \ the study watershed and cannot be extrapolated to other\nareas. Various sources\
    \ of uncertainty also exist in this study. These include selection of inﬂuencing\n\
    factors, subjective classiﬁcation of ﬂood inﬂuencing factors, spatial resolution\
    \ of datasets, training\nand validation datasets and choice of performance metrics.\
    \ Each of these requires further research to\nshow how these uncertainties aﬀect\
    \ the ultimate ﬂood susceptibility maps and subsequent decision\nmaking. Future\
    \ work should investigate the impact of these uncertainties by selection of other\
    \ ﬂood\nfactors such as daily or sub-daily rainfall, HAND, stream power index\
    \ and topographic wetness index,\nclassifying the ﬂood factors together with stakeholders\
    \ [62,63], performing a sensitivity analysis on the\nimpact of classiﬁcation of\
    \ observed dataset (other than 70% and 30% for training and validation) and\n\
    evaluating the eﬃciency of the ﬁve methods via alternate goodness-of-ﬁt measures\

    147 Citations 117 Altmetric Metrics Abstract Climate change, increasing populations,
    competing demands on land for production of biofuels and declining soil quality
    are challenging global food security. Finding sustainable solutions requires bold
    new approaches and integration of knowledge from diverse fields, such as materials
    science and informatics. The convergence of precision agriculture, in which farmers
    respond in real time to changes in crop growth with nanotechnology and artificial
    intelligence, offers exciting opportunities for sustainable food production. Coupling
    existing models for nutrient cycling and crop productivity with nanoinformatics
    approaches to optimize targeting, uptake, delivery, nutrient capture and long-term
    impacts on soil microbial communities will enable design of nanoscale agrochemicals
    that combine optimal safety and functionality profiles. Similar content being

    crop production Article 22 June 2020 Opportunities and challenges for nanotechnology
    in the agri-tech revolution Article 05 June 2019 Nano-enabled strategies to enhance
    crop nutrition and protection Article 05 June 2019 Main The Green Revolution of
    the 1950s and 1960s—also known as the third Agricultural Revolution—markedly increased
    the production yield of global agriculture, thereby avoiding the spread of famine
    and malnutrition. However, the world population has grown by more than 5 billion
    since the beginning of the Green Revolution, which has necessitated a continuous
    growth in crop production. The global agriculture and food security sector is
    facing a wide range of challenges, such as low crop yields, declining soil health
    and fertility, and low use efficiency of agrochemicals mainly due to excessive
    use of fertilizers and pesticides, shrinking arable land per capita and diminishing
    freshwater availability for irrigation1. Moreover, climate change arising from
    increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration leading to rising temperature is likely
    to further affect the resilience of agricultural soils and their ability to sustain
    productivity and ensure food security for an increasing human population. Nanotechnology
    offers great potential to enable precision and sustainable agriculture, the opportunities
    and challenges of which have been discussed in several recent reviews covering
    strategies to enhance crop nutrition and smart plant sensors2,3,4. With the application
    of nanotechnology, the delivery of fertilizer5 can be tailored by targeting to
    specific tissues or organisms and delivered in a controlled manner via stimulus-responsive
    release, potentially improving nutrient-use efficiency (NUE) by releasing the
    nutrient slowly for plant uptake6. Nano-enabled agriculture is also expected to
    target pests more efficiently using smaller amounts of pesticide7, thereby avoiding
    widespread effects on soil health and biodiversity, and improving soil function
    and nutrient cycling by enhancing the soil microbiome (optimization of nitrifying
    and denitrifying bacterial communities). Longer-term applications include development
    of smart ‘sensor’ plants, whereby the plant itself is adapted to sense abiotic
    stress using targeted delivery of nanomaterials8. Figure 1 summarizes four key
    areas in which nanotechnology is improving—and will continue to improve—the precision
    and sustainability of agriculture. Fig. 1: Applications of nanotechnology in agriculture,
    focusing specifically on crop production. Most applications are still at research
    stage, due to uncertainties regarding safety and complex and emerging regulatory
    processes for approval of agricultural chemicals, including plant-protection products,
    biocides and fertilizing products or plant biostimulants. NMs, nanomaterials.
    Full size image As with all new technologies, however, the risks must be evaluated
    in parallel with the benefits, and indeed several nanomaterials have been demonstrated
    to cause negative changes in soil community structure; for example, there were
    cascading negative effects on denitrification enzyme activity and substantial
    modifications of the bacterial community structure after just 90 days of exposure
    to a realistic concentration of TiO2-containing nanoparticles (1 mg kg−1 dry soil)9,
    and studies with silver-containing nanomaterials, which are well known for their
    antimicrobial activity, have shown that the impact on soil community composition
    over 90 days is affected by exposure time and physicochemical composition of soil,
    as well as the type and coating of the nanomaterials10. Thus, an important caveat
    at the outset of this Perspective is that nanomaterials represent a very broad
    range of chemistries, compositions and physicochemical properties, which are dynamic
    and evolving as the nanomaterials interact with their surroundings, and it is
    therefore difficult to generalize their applications in agriculture and challenging
    to predict any long-term effects. However, as previous reviews have noted2,3,4,
    the development of nanotechnology for agricultural applications is still at an
    early stage, although a range of first-generation products such as nanoemulsion
    and nano-encapsulation technologies are on the market (for example, Karate Zeon,
    Seltima and others) alongside commercial formulations of nanoscale silver and
    copper as biocides (for example, Nano Green and Kocide 3000) and nanoporous zeolites
    that stimulate plant growth (for example, Nano-Gro). The nanopesticide market
    was valued at US$410 million in 2019 and is expected to grow at a compound annual
    growth rate of just over 15% during the forecast period from 2020 to 2027, reaching
    US$940 million in 2027 (https://www.credenceresearch.com/report/nanopesticide-market).
    However, much of this market relates to encapsulation technologies for existing
    active ingredients. A recent review by Hofman et al. provides a good overview
    of the status of the field11. Notably, important differences may exist between
    nanotechnology-based pesticides and conventional pesticides, including altered
    bioavailability, sensitivity, dosimetry and pharmacokinetics12,13. Challenges
    and barriers to exploiting the full potential of nanomaterials as sensors, soil
    enhancers and plant growth stimulators, and to enhancing NUE, include a limited
    understanding of plant–nanomaterial interactions, limited methods for efficient
    delivery of nanomaterials to plants and soil, risks of potentially hazardous effects
    of nanomaterials on human health from accumulation of nanomaterials and active
    ingredient residues in edible portions of plants3, and on long-term soil quality
    and soil health from the accumulation of nanomaterials and their degradation products
    in soil, and the resultant potential alterations in microbial biodiversity14.
    There is an urgent need to address these barriers and achieve a true win-win scenario,
    in which improved agricultural production, reduced environmental pollution from
    agriculture and lower costs for farmers can be achieved synergistically. A one-health
    approach to nano-agriculture was proposed by Lombi et al., which requires interdisciplinarity
    and the bridging of human and environmental health research15. In this Perspective,
    we suggest that computational approaches including artificial intelligence (AI)
    and machine learning modelling will have a critical role in driving the progress
    of nano-enabled agriculture; indeed, such approaches are already starting to gain
    regulatory acceptance for safety assessment of nanomaterials, facilitating safe-by-design
    nanomaterials for a range of consumer products and in medicine. We also present
    examples of where the integration of AI and nanotechnology in precision agriculture
    could accelerate development and provide the insights needed to overcome the current
    barriers. Nanoinformatics will have a vital role in probing the design parameters
    of nanomaterials for use in fertilizer and pesticide delivery to ensure minimal
    impacts on soil health coupled with low phytotoxicity and minimal nanomaterial
    residues remaining in the edible tissue portions; in exploring and predicting
    the plant and ecosystem responses to nanomaterials across different climate and
    soil conditions and over multiple growing seasons; and in optimizing the interplay
    of nanomaterials and plant responses for safe and sustainable agriculture. By
    leveraging advances in cheminformatics for de novo design of drugs16 and for multi-objective
    optimization17 to simultaneously optimize numerous or competing objectives, and
    advances in nanoinformatics for prediction of cellular attachment, uptake, toxicity,
    biodistribution and safe-by-design optimization of nanomaterial properties18,19,20,
    it is clear that, despite current limitations in data availability and harmonization,
    the time is ripe for application of AI and machine learning approaches to nano-enabled
    agriculture. For example, AI may predict nanomaterial impacts on the agricultural
    ecosystem and their performance in improving agricultural production (NUE and
    reduction in air and water pollution from key elements) by integrating experimental
    data from across different soil conditions and different plant species or climate
    conditions, and from nanomaterial physicochemical properties to develop predictive
    models to optimize the efficacy of delivery, while minimizing pollution and ensuring
    a high safety profile for the nanomaterials in soil and minimal residues in the
    edible plant parts, as part of an overall approach for safer-by-design development
    of nano-agrochemicals. Current challenges and applications of AI in agriculture
    The application of computers and AI in agriculture is not new—for example, articles
    addressing software for integrated resource management21, image digitization for
    soil and crop science21, and light and temperature monitoring and control for
    plants22 were published 35 years ago. The rise of remote sensing and integration
    of remote sensing data in decision-support tools for contemporary farming systems
    is expected to improve yield production and management while reducing operating
    costs and environmental impact23. Models of agricultural systems have emerged
    over the past 50 years, spanning field, farm, landscape, regional and global spatial
    scales and engaging questions in past, current and future time periods. Integrated
    agricultural systems models combining grasslands and cropping models, livestock
    models, pest and disease models and risk-behaviour models are also emerging, although
    data gaps exist across all aspects, hampering their implementation24. A comparison
    of the capabilities of a random-forest machine-learning-based model and a physics-based
    model (a two-dimensional solver of Richards equation using HYDRUS 2D) to predict
    soil matrix potential in the root zone of a cranberry field over 72 h found that
    although both models can accurately forecast the soil matrix potential in the
    root zone, the machine-learning-based model achieved better performance compared
    with the physics-based model, but its forecasting accuracy decreased rapidly toward
    the end of the 72 h lead time25. The main driver for innovation in agritech is
    the need to optimize productivity to feed the increasing human population with
    the decreasing global per capita agricultural land area while ensuring the conservation
    of soil health and the protection of environmental quality26. The intensification
    of agriculture for enhanced productivity has resulted in extremely poor NUE globally27,28
    (less than 50%), which poses a serious threat to environmental quality as large
    amounts of nutrients are lost to water and air, causing eutrophication and greenhouse
    effects (nearly 11% of global greenhouse gas emissions are from agriculture29).
    Rockström et al. recommended a reduction of reactive nitrogen (N) use in agriculture
    from 150 MtN yr−1 to about 35 MtN yr−1 globally to ensure sustainability30. Such
    a reduction may be achieved through a combination of targeted nano-enabled delivery
    of fertilizer to match plant demands and thus avoid excessive losses, development
    and availability of low-cost in situ nutrient-sensing technology to help farmers
    plan fertilization efficiently, and identification of crop breeds that are efficient
    in nutrient uptake or fixation of atmospheric N2 directly or through enhanced
    symbiosis31. Recent efforts to enhance NUE include the use of biofertilization
    to enhance microbial biodiversity32 and the application of a range of N management
    tools across the growing season, including soil testing, plant tissue testing,
    spectral response, fertilizer placement and timing, and vegetative indexes (leaf
    area index and normalized difference vegetation index) using AI-enabled drones,
    handheld sensors and satellite imagery33. Global agricultural yields are also
    impacted by crop loss due to competition from weeds, insect damage and plant diseases.
    Weed competition causes 34% of crop loss on a global scale, and microbial diseases
    and pest damage cause a further 34% of crop loss34. The application of synthetic
    herbicides and pesticides thus increases yields (reducing crop loss) and, in the
    case of herbicides containing nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, improves food
    quality through enhanced nutrient uptake and retention35; however, these agrochemicals,
    which are designed to kill, also cause severe adverse impacts on the health of
    human and non-targeted organisms and soil fertility, and result in contamination
    of water, soil and air36. Misuse of agrichemicals on poor-quality soils, soil
    degradation as a result of farming intensification, decreasing water availability
    and water quality, and globalization of diseases have led to low resilience of
    agriculture systems37. Moreover, climate change effects, such as increased atmospheric
    CO2 levels and increasing temperatures, will also impact the future of agriculture38.
    Nanotechnology applications in the agricultural sector have great potential to
    improve all aspects of crop production—that is, to increase crop production yields
    and resource-use efficiency while reducing agriculture-related environmental pollution—thereby
    ensuring global food security while ensuring future agricultural sustainability.
    The convergence of AI approaches and nano-enabled agriculture is in its infancy
    and thus this Perspective aims to stimulate the development of this important
    area. Coupling existing models for nutrient cycling and crop productivity with
    AI and machine learning to optimize targeting, uptake, delivery, nutrient capture
    and soil microbial composition will enable design of nanoscale agrochemicals that
    combine optimal safety and functional profiles and implementation of nano-agrichemicals
    into mainstream agricultural systems management. A roadmap to achieve this, and
    the existing components that can be leveraged from nanosafety research more broadly,
    are laid out in the following sections. Leveraging progress in nanosafety and
    nanoinformatics for nano-agrochemicals Before maximizing the use of nanomaterials
    in agriculture and agronomy, some concerns need to be addressed, including the
    potential toxicity of the nanomaterials to target and non-target organisms and
    adverse impacts on ecosystems39,40, their persistence and mobility in the environment
    and those of their breakdown or transformation products. As with all agrochemicals,
    concerns about potential residues in edible portions of plants also need to be
    addressed as part of an overall risk assessment of nano-enabled agrochemicals41.
    Since the use of nanomaterials on farmland will require large quantities of nanomaterials—the
    synthesis of which requires high energy input—evaluating the cost of production
    and the cost–benefit trade-offs should be considered in the development of nanomaterials
    for application in agriculture. The rapid pace of the development of nanotechnologies,
    the enormous diversity of physicochemical properties of nanomaterials and their
    dynamic interactions with, and transformations by, their surroundings (including,
    for example, biomolecule corona formation, dissolution and sulfidation42,43) lead
    to a need for in silico approaches to predict and assess their safety19. Nanoinformatics
    emerged a decade ago in the context of development and implementation of nanotechnology
    in the real world requiring the harnessing of information at the nexus of environmental
    and human safety, risk assessment and management, physiochemical properties and
    function. Through the application of AI and machine learning for in silico risk
    assessment44, nanomaterials grouping and classification45, and safe-by-design46
    nanomaterials design, as well as for prediction of nanomaterials corona formation47
    and consequences of cellular attachment and uptake48,49,50, nanoinformatics has
    had a notable role in the area of nanosafety and nanomedicine. Deep learning approaches
    have been applied, for example, to microscopic images of the aquatic indicator
    species Daphnia magna exposed to nanomaterials in a range of representative waters
    of different ionic strengths and natural organic matter contents, and can automatically
    detect possible malformations—such as effects on the length of the tail, overall
    size and uncommon lipid concentrations and lipid-deposit shapes, which are due
    to direct or parental exposure to nanomaterials—and can classify the nanomaterials
    as toxic or non-toxic20. An early application of Bayesian networks modelled the
    risk of silver nanomaterials exposure in aquatic environments51, which was subsequently
    used for sensitivity analysis52. A Bayesian network combining physicochemical
    properties and exposure potential of nanomaterials was used to perform hazard
    assessment53. Bayesian networks can also underpin the development and quantitative
    analysis of the causal relationships in adverse-outcome pathways (AOPs) and AOP
    networks54. For example, the causal relationships between the building blocks
    of an AOP relating the reproductive failure of Caenorhabditis elegans through
    oxidative stress caused by silver nanomaterials were established using Bayesian
    networks55. This highlights an important difference between Bayesian and machine
    learning approaches, which is that the former requires that causal relationships
    are known or are assumed, whereas the latter does not require any a priori causal
    relationships. A key challenge in the development of nanoinformatics models has
    been the accessibility of datasets, although there are considerable efforts underway
    currently to curate, harmonize and integrate nanosafety data and to enrich them
    with environmental, gene, protein, geospatial and other data. Tools and approaches
    to automate data mining have been developed, including workflows that simplify
    the handling, processing and modelling of cheminformatics and nanoinformatics
    data, including the Enalos toolbox of more than 25 processing modules called Enalos+
    nodes, which extract useful information and analyse experimental and virtual screening
    results in a chemoinformatics or nanoinformatics framework via KNIME56. Other
    approaches applied in the nanosafety area to overcome the limitations of dataset
    size include application of read-across approaches for gap filling57 and enrichment
    of datasets through image analysis58,59 or by generation of computational descriptors60,61,
    for example, which are then correlated with toxicity. The increasing availability
    of nanomaterials models that can make predictions without the need for any experimental
    input, using only knowledge of nanomaterial structure and composition (that is,
    physics-based models62) enables developers to screen nanomaterials in silico before
    actually producing them, thus ensuring that the properties of concern are reduced
    or eliminated, which should make the nanomaterials safe by design63,64. For nanomaterials
    and individual molecules, the starting level of the data is quantum chemical,
    and includes explicit representation of all atoms and valence electrons. To set
    up such simulations, input of the nanomaterial chemical composition, including
    impurities, as well as nanomaterial crystal structure is needed. At this level,
    atomistic and quantum-chemical representation can be used to evaluate the electronic
    structure of the nanomaterial and to parameterize a coarser representation: an
    atomistic model, by development of appropriate force fields and material constants.
    This procedure can combine physics-based multiscale modelling for calculation
    of advanced descriptors and properties of nanomaterials with nanoinformatics methods
    for evaluation of their complex properties and functionalities63. By scanning
    the main groups of engineered nanomaterials, specific properties can be identified
    that might be responsible for causing a particular toxic effect and lead to a
    particular adverse outcome, which needs to be modified or avoided. This provides
    a means of grouping and read-across characterization of nanomaterials and enables
    development of nanomaterials that are safe by design, and is currently an area
    of very intensive research. As the available pool of fully validated nanoinformatics
    models and tools with well-defined domains of applicability grows, the nanosafety
    field is becoming less reliant on animal testing and more targeted towards the
    safe-by-design principles for early stages of nanomaterial development. Integration
    of models into predictive risk assessment frameworks, such as Integrated Approaches
    to Testing and Assessment (IATA) are the next step, combining nanomaterials exposure
    and hazard characterization for complete risk assessment. IATA use existing information
    coupled with the generation of new information in an iterative approach to answer
    a defined question in a specific regulatory context, and can include a combination
    of methodological approaches (such as quantitative structure–activity relationships
    (QSARs), read across in silico, in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo) or omics technologies
    (for example, toxicogenomics). As AI and machine learning models for nanosafety
    emerge, they are increasingly being incorporated into IATA. In these IATA, the
    output from one model can be the input for the next, and predictions from several
    different models can then be integrated in a final machine learning modelling
    and predictive analysis. The analysis can then be applied to generate, for example,
    development of nanomaterial fingerprints—predictive and informative physicochemical,
    biological and computational descriptors that describe a set functionality—that
    is, the minimum set of descriptors required as input to predict specific nanomaterial
    functionalities63. Standard nanoinformatics methods for modelling have thus far
    ignored the multi-objective nature of the problem and have focused on optimizing
    each biological or material property individually as they become available during
    the material design process. Multi-objective optimization (MOOP) methods introduce
    an innovative approach for optimization founded on compromises and trade-offs
    among the various objectives17. The aim of MOOP methods is to discover a set of
    satisfactory compromises and through them, the global optimal solution, by optimizing
    numerous dependent properties simultaneously. The primary benefit of MOOP methods
    is that local optima corresponding to one objective can be avoided by consideration
    of all the objectives simultaneously, thereby escaping single-objective dead ends
    and leading to a more efficient overall process. Several methods have been developed
    for the in silico optimization of small molecules that account for the multi-objective
    aspect of the drug-design process, enabling scientists to optimize in multiple
    spaces simultaneously. Although MOOP models have not yet been explored properly
    in the area of nanomaterials, a pool of well-validated nanoinformatics models
    and tools, assisted by physics-based models, is available, and efforts to integrate
    these and facilitate multi-factor optimization of safety and functionality as
    the basis of safety by design are now beginning63. For example, multi-perspective
    AI- and machine-learning-based modelling techniques can be used to optimally aggregate
    and integrate experimental information and outcomes of the multi-scale modelling
    methods and eventually increase confidence levels concerning evidence of particular
    hazards. The resulting commercial benefits will include improved market access
    for agricultural applications and reduced costs for the exposure, hazard and risk
    assessment of nanomaterials, including safe-by-design screening before production
    to optimize both functionality and safety. The examples highlighted above demonstrate
    that there is ample scope to apply nanoinformatics in nano-enabled agriculture,
    although this has yet to be explored and is thus the rationale for the current
    Perspective to inspire the community to begin to apply the wealth of knowledge
    and existing approaches to the specific challenges of nanomaterials applied to
    agriculture. Areas ripe for application of nanoinformatics and modelling include
    prediction of nanomaterial interactions with and impacts on rhizosphere secretions
    (both proteins and metabolites), nanomaterials transformations before and during
    uptake and translocation, nanomaterials impacts on soil microbial communities
    and for prediction of plant uptake following foliar or soil application. Experimental
    data are emerging in all these areas14,65,66, and a dedicated effort to integrate
    and curate these data and present them in a format suitable for modelling is currently
    underway within the nanoinformatics e-infrastructure projects NanoCommons and
    NanoSolveIT63. Coupling these approaches with existing models for nutrient cycling67,
    NUE68 and crop productivity69, and the aforementioned agricultural systems models
    into overall IATA with MOOP capabilities, will begin to enable co-optimization
    of nanomaterials for use in agricultural systems that combine safety and functionality
    profiles (including enhancing NUE and calorific value of crops) enabling precision
    agriculture, as shown schematically in Fig. 2. Fig. 2: Applications of machine
    learning to nano-enabled agriculture. Application of machine learning in risk
    assessment and safe-by-design nanomaterials design and the potential for extension
    of machine learning approaches to support nano-enabled agriculture, building on
    advances in both nanoinformatics and agricultural systems modelling and emerging
    developments related to MOOP modelling. Integrating a range of different modelling
    and experimental approaches via an IATA will lead to enhanced prediction power
    in terms of optimal nanomaterials properties for safety and functionality across
    the range of potential nano-agriculture applications, and faster and safer implementation
    of precision nano-enabled agriculture. Full size image Experimental studies using
    nanomaterials for agriculture in the laboratory, mesocosms and field are expensive,
    time consuming and complicated, limiting the range of conditions that can be varied
    systematically. Conclusions may be ambiguous, because the interpretation of the
    results is influenced by factors such as experimental procedures, protocols, duration,
    nanomaterials types, doses, soil types and plant species. Integration of the existing
    data—albeit with gaps and limitations—and supplementation with predictive modelling
    and machine learning approaches—including Bayesian networks53,70, which can be
    dynamically updated as new knowledge emerges—into IATA underpinned by MOOP approaches
    offer exciting new directions. Development of a nano-agriculture IATA case study
    using the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development IATA case study
    approach71 seems to be a logical next step as shown schematically in Fig. 2. AI
    and machine learning for nano-enabled agronomy Here we present current and future
    applications of AI and machine learning applications in agriculture. AI and machine
    learning approaches As computational capabilities grow and the value of data as
    knowledge to be exploited is increasingly realized, AI and machine or deep learning
    approaches are emerging as means to identify patterns in large datasets that are
    predictive of future outcomes. One of the most widely used approaches involves
    neural network algorithms, which use an unbiased subset of the total available
    data as the training set to develop a model that makes predictions using the rest
    of the data—the validity of the predictions is evaluated to ensure that they could
    not arise randomly. The size and range of the dataset used to train the model
    provides the limits of its predictive power, or its domain of applicability—models
    cannot predict reliably outside the range of these data. Box 1 describes the various
    types of data-driven machine learning models, which include models that link structure
    or properties (for example, of a chemical or nanomaterial) to specific effects
    or impacts on the environment—QSARs or quantitative property–activity relationship
    models72, and Bayesian networks, which are a powerful tool for incorporating uncertainty
    into decision-support systems73—by providing a basis for probabilistic inference
    and facilitating assessment of changes in probabilistic belief as new evidence
    is entered into the model. The larger the dataset available to train a machine
    learning model, the more powerful it will be—for example, in drug discovery or
    cheminformatics, models typically use data from thousands of different chemicals
    to develop a prediction. Similarly, genomics and related approaches, in which
    hundreds of thousands of data points are available, enable generation of strong
    gene-interaction networks and assessment of effects of specific genetic perturbations;
    these are used, for example, to understand gene-regulation networks in plants74.
    For application of AI and machine learning in nano-enabled agriculture, it will
    be necessary to mine the existing publicly available datasets, including those
    on nanomaterials safety and nanomaterials impacts on plants and soil microbial
    communities, existing plant omics databases such as the Plant Omics Data Center75,
    an integrated web repository for interspecies gene-expression networks incorporating
    information on eight plant species (Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, Solanum
    lycopersicum, Sorghum bicolor, Vitis vinifera, Solanum tuberosum, Medicago truncatula
    and Glycine max) with functional annotation of the genes to facilitate biological
    comprehension, the plant proteome database, the Plant Secretome and Subcellular
    Proteome KnowledgeBase (PlantSecKB76) and similar databases for soil microbiota,
    and integrate these with relevant agricultural databases such as the global gridded
    data of soil physical properties, hydroclimatic and agricultural variables, socio-economic
    metrics, and historical pesticide usage data (for example, table 1 in Maggi et
    al.77). The utility of such an approach of integrating disparate datasets has
    recently been demonstrated with the establishment of PEST-CHEMGRIDS, a comprehensive
    database of the 20 most-used pesticide active ingredients on 6 dominant crops
    and 4 aggregated crop classes at 5 arcmin resolution (about 10 km at the equator)
    projected from 2015 to 2025. The use of automated data extraction, curation and
    integration via the Enalos+ KNIME tools, which has already been demonstrated for
    drug discovery and nanoinformatics56, will facilitate this process, and new nodes
    for specific databases or data clean-up and integration will be developed for
    nano-agriculture datasets as needed. Box 1. The main types of machine learning
    algorithms and examples of their application in agriculture and/or nanomaterials
    design and safety assessment104 Show more Current AI and machine learning in agriculture
    A 2018 review of the use of machine learning in agriculture classified the application
    areas into (1) crop management, including applications in yield prediction, disease
    detection, weed detection crop quality and species recognition; (2) livestock
    management, including applications in animal welfare and livestock production;
    (3) water management (daily, weekly or monthly evapotranspiration rates); and
    (4) soil management such as prediction and identification of agricultural soil
    properties78. However, application of Bayesian networks to agricultural systems
    has remained challenging, as there are often insufficient data to compute the
    prior and conditional probabilities required for the network73. Several other
    machine learning methodologies can be investigated without the need for a priori
    relationships, and numerous models can be linked together to fill gaps in the
    data and predict missing values, as demonstrated successfully for a meta-analysis
    of 216 published articles on cytotoxicity of metal oxide nanomaterials79. In terms
    of the key areas identified for improvements in crop production, process-based
    machine learning models (for example, the SPACSYS model80) for plant growth—incorporating
    assimilation, respiration, water and nitrogen uptake, partitioning of photosynthate
    and nitrogen, nitrogen fixation for legume plants and root growth81—are emerging
    and being constantly improved. With increased understanding of the processes and,
    more importantly, the variables driving them, and the availability of intervention
    strategies such as precision nano-agrochemicals to target specific locations or
    release in response to specific stimuli, the potential of machine learning for
    optimization of agroecosystems has never been greater. Integrating machine learning,
    simulation and portfolio optimization can inform decisions and support selection
    of optimal seed varieties (for example, soybean) to grow, with resolution at the
    level of a specific farm with its individual crop rotation history rather than
    at regional scale based on soil type and quality82. Incorporating such information
    into multi-object optimization modelling of nanomaterial safety, soil management
    and plant yield offers exciting new possibilities. Indeed, a recent review of
    the potential impacts of AI on achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development
    Goals (SDGs) suggested that AI will be an enabler for SDG2 (“improved nutrition
    and promote sustainable agriculture”), but highlights generally that the pace
    of development of AI may have implications in terms of a lack of regulatory oversight
    and insight, which could potentially result in gaps in transparency, safety and
    ethical standards83. Nanoinformatics models applicable to nano-enabled agriculture
    The application of machine learning in nanomaterial risk assessment and for design
    of safe and environmentally friendly nanomaterials has also been an area of intensive
    research over the past few years. For example, nanoQSAR models linking specific
    nanomaterials properties to uptake by, and impacts on, cells or organisms are
    emerging. Models that allow determination of surface functionalizations that enhance
    (or decrease), for example, protein binding and/or cellular association (as a
    pre-requisite for internalization84) are also emerging, and can be applied for
    design of targeting strategies in precision nano-agriculture. Although to date
    no nanoQSARs have been developed for plants, ecotoxicities of plant-protection
    chemicals to target and non-target species have been predicted using QSAR85, and
    as the corpus of data related to nanomaterials in plants and soil species is growing
    exponentially, it is only a matter of time before the first nanoQSARs for plants
    and soil microbiota are developed. Similarly, extending advances in nanomedicine
    to precision nano-agriculture will facilitate the design of optimized controlled-release
    agrochemicals86,87. For example, deep learning using an automatic data-splitting
    algorithm and evaluation criteria suitable for pharmaceutical formulation data
    has been developed for the prediction of optimal pharmaceutical formulations and
    doses88. From an agricultural perspective, understanding the factors (including
    nanomaterial, plant, soil and climate factors) that control the release rate of
    active ingredients, and the factors driving transport of the carrier can influence
    selection of formulation parameters and suitability of application to specific
    locations or climates. Such data-driven models require substantial amounts of
    data to train and validate them, which remains a barrier to their development.
    However, significant work is underway in the wider nanosafety arena to develop
    optimized workflows for generation of data and metadata (for example, using electronic
    laboratory notebooks89 to capture experimental data as it is generated, linking
    them to underlying protocols and calibrations, and facilitating curation and storage
    of the data in databases, thereby accelerating their accessibility and re-usability),
    annotation with relevant ontological terms mapped to the data schema of the receiving
    databases and automated upload to nanosafety knowledge bases90, which in the medium
    term will facilitate the aggregation, integration and reuse of nanosafety- and
    nano-agriculture-related datasets. However, as noted above, there are important
    concerns regarding the safety and risks of nanomaterials that must be addressed
    before their widespread intentional application to the environment can be sanctioned,
    and there are tight regulatory processes for approval of agrochemicals91. A recent
    review assessed the regulation of pesticides and the potential use of computer-based
    chemical modelling technologies to facilitate risk assessment of nano-enabled
    pesticides88, and concluded that quantum chemistry is an appropriate tool for
    characterization of the structure and relative stabilities of organic compounds
    and for studying degradation pathways. However, a re-evaluation is needed to determine
    its suitability for nano-enabled agriculture, using quantum nanomaterials descriptors
    for QSAR development. Among the quantum descriptors for nanomaterials are molecular
    and electronic properties such as band gap, ionization potential, atomic charge,
    electronegativity and adsorption energy, as well as interaction parameters for
    prediction of interactions of proteins and small molecules, such as binding energies,
    binding affinities, Hamaker constants and absorption energies, which can be used
    to predict biomolecule corona formation92. In due course as data emerges, the
    evolution of the adsorbed biomolecule as nanomaterials interact with, and respond
    to, soil and plant secretomes, and are transformed as shown in Fig. 3, will also
    be predictable through modelling, allowing tailoring of nanomterials to acquire
    the desired biomolecule corona. Fig. 3: The complexity of nanomaterial behaviour
    in the soil–plant environment and the potential impacts in soil–plant systems.
    Understanding and predicting nanomaterial translocation and transformation, and
    identifying the optimal nanomaterial forms to retain bioavailable N species in
    the soil, will facilitate design of sustainably functional nanomaterials for agriculture,
    enhancing NUE while simultaneously reducing pollution and the need for fertilizers.
    Coupling this knowledge with enhanced targeting and sustained, controlled release
    of pesticides can be facilitated using AI to design optimal nano-agrichemicals.
    Among the input data for machine learning (ML) models are the nanomaterials characteristics
    and those of the plants and soils exposed to the nanomaterials, as indicated (a
    non-exhaustive list). Gene expression, proteomics and secretomics information,
    global soil quality and other parameters can be mined from existing databases.

    ion. Full size image Challenges and barriers to precision nano-agriculture Although
    nanotechnology has potential in a wide range of applications in agriculture, there
    are many challenges to be overcome to move this area forward and facilitate full
    commercial-scale application of many of the innovative nanomaterials presented
    in Fig. 1. These include a lack of mechanistic understanding of the interactions
    at the nanomaterial–plant–soil interface and nanomaterial uptake and translocation
    in plant vascular structure and organelles; insufficient understanding of the
    environmental safety and human health risks of intentional nanomaterial application;
    a lack of soil and large-scale field studies to demonstrate the efficacy of nanomaterials
    under realistic scenarios; balancing the adoption of new technology and the low
    profit margins in agriculture; and the challenges in collection and harmonization
    of the datasets needed for development of AI models. Long-term studies at ecosystem
    level under environmentally relevant conditions and at realistic nanomaterials
    exposure concentrations are currently lacking. For example, silver, zinc and copper-based
    nanomaterials have demonstrated potential to be applied as efficient pesticides
    or fungicides; however, the potential impact on non-target organisms (for example,
    beneficial plant rhizosphere bacteria and worms) and long-term impacts on soil
    quality are not known. While there remain challenges for the detection of nanomaterials
    in complex matrices, particularly at low concentrations, and access to state-of-the
    art facilities with sufficient resolution such as synchrotrons is limited, application
    of deep learning tools to plant spectral images (for example STXM. XRF etc.) is
    expected to enable advances in terms of determining and predicting nanomaterials
    localization and in situ transformations even with relatively limited datasets
    and against a background of naturally occurring particles. Indeed, as models are
    trained using existing high-resolution datasets for specific nanomaterial–plant
    combinations, they can be coupled with more generalized QSARs or physical models
    of nanomaterials transformations under specific environmental conditions, and
    supplemented with the development of functional assays that can provide the input
    data needed for models but under simplified conditions93,94. For example, surface
    affinity and dissolution rate have been identified as two critical functional
    assays for characterizing nanomaterial behaviour in soil systems. A range of functional
    assays for nanomaterials transformations, including binding of secreted proteins
    and small molecules or uptake using simpler hydroponic systems could be envisaged
    to begin parameterizing more complex predictive machine learning models. Although
    nanofertilizers may enhance the NUE, effects of nanomaterials on the nutritional
    quality of food (for example, alteration of the content of carbohydrates and macro-
    or micronutrients) have been reported95 and need to be assessed systematically,
    and predictive models need to be established. Nanomaterials may accumulate in
    seeds and their potential to cause transgenerational effects96,97 are largely
    unknown. The presence of nanomaterials may cause enhanced uptake of contaminants
    by plants—for example, through binding to the nanomaterial surface and co-transport—and
    may amplify their adverse effects98,99. Such effects need to be fully understood
    and the use of nanoQSAR, multi-object optimization and other machine learning
    approaches will support this understanding and prediction. Nanomaterials undergo
    numerous transformations (physical, chemical or biological) in soils and plants.
    For example, many nanomaterials based on metals and metal compounds such as zinc,
    copper and silver tend to dissolve and release metal ions, which can further react
    with soil and plant components such as phosphate, sulfur and chloride. These transformations
    may alter the original nanomaterial properties that were designed for the specific
    application. For example, antifungal nanomaterials such as those based on silver
    can be oxidized, dissolved and sulfidized in soil environments, either by interaction
    with the soil microbiome or within plants, and the antifungal property of the
    silver nanomaterials could be reduced or diminished100. Some transformations might
    release toxic components—for example, graphene oxide was reported to degrade under
    sunlight and release polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-like compounds that are likely
    to exhibit toxic properties and persist in the environment101. Development of
    QSAR or machine learning models that can predict the transformations of nanomaterials
    under a wide range of soil and temperature conditions will facilitate optimization
    of nanomaterials properties for specific locations. Substantial progress towards
    modelling of nanomaterials transformations in the environment has already been
    made, including environment fate models and process-based models. Combining current
    models with experiments will enhance next-generation nanomaterial fate and transport
    models in key areas, including descriptions of nanomaterial heteroaggregation,
    descriptions of reactive nanomaterial chemistry, increased temporal and spatial
    resolution and sensitivity analyses to allow simplification of model structure102.
    Efforts to develop functional assays to generate the data needed to parametrize
    these models are also underway43,93,94, and can be extended to include functional
    assays for rhizosphere secretions in response to nanomaterials—for example, using
    hydroponics systems or standardized soils. Computational tools that can predict
    nanomaterial transformation processes will enable manipulation or direct simulation
    of the transformation to maintain the nanomaterial function or modify its effects.
    However, the complexity of soil chemistry and the high responsiveness of plants
    and their secretions into the rhizosphere increase the variability and diversity
    of potential nanomaterial transformations (Fig. 3). Many such factors are interlinked;
    for example, nanomaterial transformations are affected by the soil and plant microbiome
    and the extracellular polymeric substances and plant root exudates around the
    rhizosphere. However, plant root exudate and the microbiome can affect each other
    and both may be altered by exposure to nanomaterials, which in turn can affect
    the nanomaterial transformation processes. Changes to the microbiome will affect
    the nitrogen-cycling processes in soil. Foliar applied nanomaterials can be translocated
    downwards to the roots and interact with phyllosphere components such as microorganisms
    and leaf exudates. All of the above areas are also subject to change and disruption
    as a result of climate change—for example, changes in CO2 concentration and temperature
    can shift nutrient cycling, alter rates of reactions and transformations and change
    plant susceptibility to nanomaterials, among other effects. Therefore, the dynamic
    nature of the whole system needs to be considered, making this a perfect candidate
    for AI and machine learning solutions, by integrating existing predictive models
    for nanomaterials corona formation (for example, those based on binding affinities
    and Hamaker constants92) or machine learning models using biophysicochemical characteristics
    of proteins, nanomaterials and solution conditions via random-forest classification47,
    with databases of plant and microbe secretomics and plant proteomes to develop
    corona evolution and exchange models. Compared with prediction of small-molecule
    toxicity, nanoinformaticians tend to work with smaller datasets (sometimes including
    only a few nanomaterial variants), and typically use exposure concentrations and
    time points as a means to expand the dataset. Thus, evaluation of the impact of
    nanomaterials on NUE in a hydroponic system, for example, could assess a panel
    of 8–10 nanomaterials and gauge their effects alone and in combination with fertilizer
    at different ratios and over different timescales, and determine the nitrogen
    concentrations in the water and plant mass and gaseous emissions under controlled
    temperatures and CO2 levels. This would provide a multi-factorial dataset for
    establishment of machine learning models to predict the NUE of a new nanomaterial,
    as long as its physicochemical characteristics fell within the domain of applicability
    of the model; that is, if at least one of the nanomaterials in the training and
    test set overlapped with the properties of the new nanomaterial. If the nanomaterials
    were characterized over time under different conditions—for example, in terms
    of their size, dissolution and acquired corona composition—further models could
    be built predicting corona composition and nanomaterials fate and behaviour, identifying
    the key nanomaterials properties and environmental factors driving the specific
    effect. If data on plant growth (roots and shoots) or localization of the nanomaterials
    in the plants were determined, increasingly complete models of NUE could be developed,
    taking into account the nanomaterial localization and speciation within the plant.
    System complexity can then be increased by moving to soils, where nanomaterial
    characterization is more challenging, but where models for the environmental fate
    of the nanomaterials—such as the NanoFASE soil–water–organism model, which predicts
    the fate of nanomaterials in the environment43—may already exist. Thus, the initial
    steps will be small, but as the datasets and models emerge, their integration
    with other models and tools into overall IATA and agricultural systems models
    will become feasible and achievable. A roadmap for progress Smart and nano-enabled
    agriculture combined with AI and machine learning capabilities offer an exciting
    convergence of technologies with the unique capability to address the overarching
    SDG2. The impetus for smart agriculture is therefore multi-pronged: from enhancing
    and sustaining productivity through nano-enabled (responsive) delivery of agrochemicals
    to crops, to reduction in environmental pollution and negative human health impacts
    from agriculture. The grand challenges in agriculture can only be solved if the
    power of nanomaterials can be harnessed safely, responsibly and sustainably. Nanoinformatics
    will have a vital role in probing the design parameters, the plant and ecosystem
    responses, and their co-optimization for safe and sustainable agriculture. For
    example, AI may predict nanomaterial impacts on the agricultural ecosystem and
    their performance in improving agricultural production (NUE and reduction in air
    and water pollution forms of key elements), by integrating experimental data from
    across different soil conditions, plant species, climate conditions and nanomaterial
    physicochemical properties to predict both the nanomaterials impacts on the agricultural
    system (on plants and soil) and the impacts of the agricultural system on the
    nanomaterials in terms of their transformations, transport and bioavailability.
    This will enable safer-by-design development of nano-agrichemicals and co-optimization
    of both safety and desired functionality of the nanomaterials. For example, the
    potential impact of nanomaterials for remobilization of pesticide residue contaminants
    of soil resulting from decades of pesticide use remains an unexplored area, and
    indeed monitoring of pesticide residues in soil is not currently required at the
    European Union (EU) level despite the known degradation of soil quality, in contrast
    to the water monitoring regulated by the EU Water Framework Directive103. Future
    research directions to address these challenges are outlined here and summarized
    in Box 2. Box 2 Future research needs • Determine the long-term fate of nanomaterials,
    including transformation, transport in soil, and uptake and translocation in plants,
    curate these data and the accompanying metadata into nanomaterials knowledge bases
    and enrich them with global soil and weather characteristics, knowledge of plant
    biology (including proteome, secretome and transcriptomics data), global pesticide
    use datasets, soil microbial community characteristics and any other relevant
    datasets to facilitate development of deep learning models tailored to specific
    nanomaterials being developed for nano-agriculture and the local environmental
    conditions, crop rotations and historical and future needs. Show more Understand
    the long-term fate of nanomaterials in agricultural environments Transformation
    of nanomaterials will change their original designed properties, which may affect
    their function as fertilizers, pesticides, carriers or sensors. The transformation
    could occur in soil, at the plant interface (for example, root or leaf surface)
    or inside the plant. In soil, the transformation could be driven by soil texture
    and chemistry, and by interactions with soil microorganisms and animals. Plant
    interfaces, including the rhizosphere and phyllosphere, are critical locations
    for nanomaterials transformation. The transformations in these regions are driven
    by the dynamic and complex composition, including plant metabolites and microorganisms.
    Nanomaterials may also be transformed during their translocation in plant vascular
    structure by interacting with plant fluids. All of these areas remain largely
    unknown and thus generation of datasets that are deposited in open access databases
    is urgently required. Another critical question is how to effectively deliver
    nanomaterials to target different locations in plants. This requires a clear understanding
    of the uptake and translocation of the nanomaterials. Both the leaf and root contain
    physiological barriers to prevent the entry of unwanted substances, and the structures
    of these two organs are very different. Nanomaterials that enter the leaf translocate
    downward in phloem, whereas those entering roots translocate upward in the xylem.
    The fluid composition and flow rate in xylem and phloem may greatly affect the
    translocation and accumulation of nanomaterials in plant. Data and predictive
    models for these questions are all required urgently. Assess the long-term life
    cycle impact of nanomaterials in the agricultural ecosystem Given the fact that
    repeated application of nanotechnology in agriculture will become possible in
    the future, long-term retention of nanomaterials in agricultural soil is inevitable.
    The majority of current studies regarding plant–nanomaterials interactions are
    phenomenological observations of nanomaterials toxicity under short-term, high-dose
    conditions. Long-term, low-dose effects of nanomaterials on agroecosystems therefore
    also need to be studied, addressing nanomaterial impacts on plant growth, microbial
    activity and community structure, soil health (for example, soil enzyme activity
    and nutrient cycling), trophic transfer of nanomaterials and transgenerational
    effects. Use of multiple doses, multiple sampling time points and a wide panel
    of nanomaterials, a range of different soil conditions or different plants under
    identical exposure conditions will facilitate implementation of data-hungry machine
    learning models, although meta-analysis and computational gap filling of smaller
    datasets is also helping to accelerate the pace of development of nanomaterials
    models. Take a systems-level approach to nano-enabled agriculture The behaviour,
    fate and impact of nanomaterials in the soil–plant system, plants and microorganisms
    are all interconnected. As shown in Fig. 3 and described above, change of one
    factor may induce a change of the whole system. Given the power of AI and the
    complexity of the optimization challenges facing nano-agriculture, it is clear
    that their convergence offers exciting new directions (Fig. 4). Using extensive
    existing models and datasets for soil quality, crop yield and NUE, for example,
    and combining these with models and datasets related to plant and microbial secretomes,
    nanomaterials physicochemical properties, transformations and bioavailability,
    and release of active ingredients, could enable important new insights into: (1)
    the probable transformation pathways for the nanomaterials and their resulting
    environmental transport and bioavailability; (2) the potential impact of the nanomaterial
    and its associated active ingredients (in cases where the nanomaterial is a carrier)
    on crop yield and NUE; and (3) potential identification of biomarkers of crop
    health and disease that can be used as early warning systems. Identification of
    data gaps can also drive the design of focused experiments to fill the gaps or
    to develop sub-models for gap filling or prediction of specific parameters, to
    be integrated into an overall model framework enabling design of combinations
    of nanomaterials and active ingredients that optimize NUE and minimize pollution
    while enhancing crop yield and potentially even nutritional (calorific) value.
    Integration of safe-by-design approaches and feeding forward the emerging knowledge
    into the updating of regulatory processes for advanced nano-enabled agricultural
    applications, both in fertilization and in plant protection, are also essential.
    Fig. 4: Approach to integration of AI models needed to assess nanomaterials behaviour,
    fate and impact in agriculture based on the interplay between nanomaterial and
    environmental factors including the crop type and soil characteristics. Application
    of automated tools for harvesting data from public databases and pre-processing
    and curation of the data for direct input into the AI or machine learning models—for
    example, using the Enalos tools56 in KNIME—ensures that the output data from one
    model can serve as the input data for subsequent models, thereby facilitating
    model integration and development of increasingly multiplexed predictions for
    nano-enabled precision agriculture. A number of potential multi-object optimization
    machine learning modelling outputs are shown in the far right panel to inspire
    the development of the field. Full size image Systems-wide approaches can also
    support pre-emptive identification of potential challenges or solutions arising
    from use of nanomaterials. For example, integrating knowledge on the historical
    use of pesticides and the accumulation of pesticide residues in soils globally
    could potentially identify specific nanomaterials with high affinities for such
    residues, leading to their remobilization and unintended uptake into plants. Thus,
    the convergence of nanotechnology and AI or machine learning will also support
    efforts under the EU Green Deal, and could be used to identify hot spots and/or
    optimized nanomaterial compositions for soil remediation, for example, as well
    as supporting impact assessment and helping in efforts to protect soil fertility,
    reduce soil erosion and the overuse of nutrients, while increasing soil organic
    matter levels as part of an overall adoption of sustainable soil management practices,
    including as part of the forthcoming revision to the Common Agricultural Policy,
    which a recent report has suggested is only marginally consistent with the ambitions
    of the EU Green Deal11. Extensive changes to EU legislation are expected in 2021,
    including the EU Soil Thematic Strategy and the Zero Pollution Action Plan for
    Air, Water and Soil, which will encompass a range of chemicals including pesticides.
    Use AI and machine learning to identify key nanospecific properties that initiate
    the effects or functions of nanomaterials There are multiple physicochemical properties
    of nanomaterials such as size, shape, surface charge, surface area, surface reactivity
    and crystal structure that can influence their transformations and toxicities.
    AI and machine learning will enable selection of the most critical parameters
    that determine and predict the behaviour of nanomaterials in soil and plant systems
    from large datasets (Fig. 4). The use of automated data retrieval from public
    databases, data pre-processing and gap filling, and automated splitting of the
    data into test and validation sets for modelling56 will facilitate the in silico
    design of NMs that can be delivered to plants efficiently. Nanomaterial transformations
    in different soil conditions and different rhizosphere compositions under changing
    climate conditions could also be predicted by integrating predictive models, enabling
    optimization of nanomaterials for agricultural application in a range of climatic
    and local conditions. Wider ecosystem effects and prediction of tripartite (nanomaterials–soil–plant)
    behaviours under future climate scenarios can also be predicted using, for example,
    Bayesian networks and deep learning approaches. Such models are especially important
    as they can operate under data scarcity, yet can easily incorporate new data as
    they emerge. Application of these emerging models to address the broader issues
    of food security, and to tackle SDG2—improved nutrition and promotion of sustainable
    agriculture—will provide important new intersectional insights and suggestions
    for ways forward. References Shahzad, A. N., Qureshi, M. K., Wakeel, A. & Misselbrook,

    \ February 2022 \n© The Author(s) 2022\nAbstract\nArtificial intelligence (AI)\
    \ is a leading technology of the current age of the Fourth Industrial Revolution\
    \ (Industry 4.0 or 4IR), \nwith the capability of incorporating human behavior\
    \ and intelligence into machines or systems. Thus, AI-based modeling \nis the\
    \ key to build automated, intelligent, and smart systems according to today’s\
    \ needs. To solve real-world issues, various \ntypes of AI such as analytical,\
    \ functional, interactive, textual, and visual AI can be applied to enhance the\
    \ intelligence and \ncapabilities of an application. However, developing an effective\
    \ AI model is a challenging task due to the dynamic nature \nand variation in\
    \ real-world problems and data. In this paper, we present a comprehensive view\
    \ on “AI-based Modeling” with \nthe principles and capabilities of potential AI\
    \ techniques that can play an important role in developing intelligent and smart\
    \ \nsystems in various real-world application areas including business, finance,\
    \ healthcare, agriculture, smart cities, cyberse-\ncurity and many more. We also\
    \ emphasize and highlight the research issues within the scope of our study. Overall,\
    \ the goal \nof this paper is to provide a broad overview of AI-based modeling\
    \ that can be used as a reference guide by academics and \nindustry people as\
    \ well as decision-makers in various real-world scenarios and application domains.\n\

    \ 4.0 applications\nIntroduction\nNowadays, we live in a technological age, the\
    \ Fourth Indus-\ntrial Revolution, known as Industry 4.0 or 4IR [59, 91], \nwhich\
    \ envisions fast change in technology, industries, soci-\netal patterns, and processes\
    \ as a consequence of enhanced \ninterconnectivity and smart automation. This\
    \ revolution \nis impacting almost every industry in every country and \ncausing\
    \ a tremendous change in a non-linear manner at an \nunprecedented rate, with\
    \ implications for all disciplines, \nindustries, and economies. Three key terms\
    \ Automation, \ni.e., reducing human interaction in operations, Intelligent, \n\
    i.e., ability to extract insights or usable knowledge from \ndata, and Smart computing,\
    \ i.e., self-monitoring, analyz-\ning, and reporting, known as self-awareness,\
    \ have become \nfundamental criteria in designing today’s applications and \n\
    systems in every sector of our lives since the current world \nis more reliant\
    \ on technology than ever before. The use of \nmodern smart technologies enables\
    \ making smarter, faster \ndecisions regarding the business process, ultimately\
    \ increas-\ning the productivity and profitability of the overall opera-\ntion,\
    \ where Artificial Intelligence (AI) is known as a leading \ntechnology in the\
    \ area. The AI revolution, like earlier indus-\ntrial revolutions that launched\
    \ massive economic activity in \nmanufacturing, commerce, transportation, and\
    \ other areas, \nhas the potential to lead the way of progress. As a result, the\
    \ \nimpact of AI on the fourth industrial revolution motivates \nus to focus briefly\
    \ on “AI-based modeling” in this paper.\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is a broad\
    \ field of computer \nscience concerned with building smart machines capable of\
    \ \nperforming tasks that typically require human intelligence. \nIn other words,\
    \ we can say that it aims is to make computers \nThis article is part of the topical\

    \ to think and \nlearn using computer programs or machines, i.e., can think \n\
    and function in the same way that people do. From a philo-\nsophical perspective,\
    \ AI has the potential to help people \nlive more meaningful lives without having\
    \ to work as hard, \nas well as manage the massive network of interconnected \n\
    individuals, businesses, states, and nations in a way that \nbenefits everyone.\
    \ Thus, the primary goal of AI is to enable \ncomputers and machines to perform\
    \ cognitive functions \nsuch as problem-solving, decision making, perception,\
    \ and \ncomprehension of human communication. Therefore, AI-\nbased modeling is\
    \ the key to building automated, intelligent \nand smart systems according to\
    \ today’s needs, which has \nemerged as the next major technological milestone,\
    \ influenc-\ning the future of practically every business by making every \nprocess\
    \ better, faster, and more precise.\nWhile today’s Fourth Industrial Revolution\
    \ is typically \nfocusing on technology-driven “automation, intelligent and \n\
    smart systems”, AI technology has become one of the core \ntechnologies to achieve\
    \ the goal. However, developing an \neffective AI model is a challenging task\
    \ due to the dynamic \nnature and variation in real-world problems and data. Thus,\
    \ \nwe take into account several AI categories: The first one is \n“Analytical\
    \ AI” with the capability of extracting insights \nfrom data to ultimately produce\
    \ recommendations and thus \ncontributing to data-driven decision-making; the\
    \ Second one \nis “Functional AI” which is similar to analytical AI; how-\never,\
    \ instead of giving recommendations, it takes actions; \nthe Third one is “Interactive\
    \ AI” that typically allows busi-\nnesses to automate communication without compromising\
    \ \non interactivity like smart personal assistants or chatbots; \nthe Fourth\
    \ one is “Textual AI” that covers textual analytics \nor natural language processing\
    \ through which business can \nenjoy text recognition, speech-to-text conversion,\
    \ machine \ntranslation, and content generation capabilities; and finally \nthe\
    \ Fifth one is “Visual AI” that covers computer vision or \naugmented reality\
    \ fields, discussed briefly in “Why artificial \nintelligence in today’s research\
    \ and applications?”.\nAlthough the area of “artificial intelligence” is huge,\
    \ we \nmainly focus on potential techniques towards solving real-\nworld issues,\
    \ where the results are used to build automated, \nintelligent, and smart systems\
    \ in various application areas. \nTo build AI-based models, we classify various\
    \ AI tech-\nniques into ten categories: (1) machine learning; (2) neural \nnetworks\
    \ and deep learning; (3) data mining, knowledge \ndiscovery and advanced analytics;\
    \ (4) rule-based modeling \nand decision-making; (5) fuzzy logic-based approach;\
    \ (6) \nknowledge representation, uncertainty reasoning, and expert \nsystem modeling;\
    \ (7) case-based reasoning; (8) text min-\ning and natural language processing;\
    \ (9) visual analytics, \ncomputer vision and pattern recognition; (10) hybridization,\
    \ \nsearching and Optimization. These techniques can play an \nimportant role\
    \ in developing intelligent and smart systems in \nvarious real-world application\
    \ areas that include business, \nfinance, healthcare, agriculture, smart cities,\
    \ cybersecurity, \nand many more, depending on the nature of the problem \nand\
    \ target solution. Thus, it is important to comprehend the \nconcepts of these\
    \ techniques mentioned above, as well as \ntheir relevance in a variety of real-world\
    \ scenarios, discussed \nbriefly in “Potential AI techniques”.\nBased on the importance\
    \ and capabilities of AI tech-\nniques, in this paper, we give a comprehensive\
    \ view on \n“AI-based modeling” that can play a key role towards auto-\nmation,\
    \ intelligent and smart systems according to today’s \nneeds. Thus, the key focus\
    \ is to explain the principles of \nvarious AI techniques and their applicability\
    \ to the advance-\nment of computing and decision-making to meet the require-\n\
    ments of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Therefore the \npurpose of this paper\
    \ is to provide a fundamental guide \nfor those academics and industry professionals\
    \ who want \nto study, research, and develop automated, intelligent, and \nsmart\
    \ systems based on artificial intelligence techniques in \nrelevant application\
    \ domains.\nThe main contributions of this paper are therefore listed \nas follows:\n\
    • To define the scope of our study in terms of automation, \nintelligent and smart\
    \ computing, and decision-making in \nthe context of today’s real-world needs.\n\
    • To explore various types of AI that includes analytical, \nfunctional, interactive,\
    \ textual, and visual AI, to under-\nstand the theme of the power of artificial\
    \ intelligence in \ncomputing and decision-making while solving various \nproblems\
    \ in today’s Fourth Industrial Revolution.\n• To provide a comprehensive view\
    \ on AI techniques that \ncan be applied to build an AI-based model to enhance\
    \ the \nintelligence and capabilities of a real-world application.\n• To discuss\

    \ domains to assist developers \nas well as researchers in broadening their perspectives\
    \ on \nAI techniques.\n• To highlight and summarize the potential research issues\
    \ \nwithin the scope of our study for conducting future \nresearch, system development\
    \ and improvement.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next sec-\n\

    \ research and application. In the subse-\nquent section, we discuss and summarize\
    \ how various AI \ntechniques can be used for intelligence modeling in various\
    \ \napplication areas. Next, we summarize various real-world \napplication areas,\
    \ where AI techniques can be employed to \nbuild automated, intelligent, and smart\
    \ systems. The impact \nand future aspect of AI highlighting research issues have\

    \ Science\nWhy Artificial Intelligence in Today’s \nResearch and Applications?\n\
    In this section, our goal is to motivate the study of vari-\nous AI techniques\
    \ that can be applied in various application \nareas in today’s interconnected\
    \ world. For this, we explore \nIndustry 4.0 and the revolution of AI, types of\
    \ AI techniques, \nas well as the relation with the most prominent machine and\
    \ \ndeep learning techniques. Hence, the scope of our study in \nterms of research\
    \ and applications is also explored through \nour discussion.\nIndustry 4.0 and the Revolution\
    \ of AI\nWe are now in the age of the 4th Industrial Revolution, \nreferred to\
    \ as Industry 4.0 [59, 91], which represents a new \nera of innovation in technology,\
    \ particularly, AI-driven \ntechnology. After the Internet and mobile Internet\
    \ sparked \nthe 3rd Industrial Revolution, AI technologies, fueled by \ndata,\
    \ are now creating an atmosphere of Industry 4.0. The \nterm “Industry 4.0” typically\
    \ refers to the present trend of \nleveraging modern technology to automate processes\
    \ and \nexchange information. In a broad sense, Industry 4.0 has \nbeen defined\
    \ as “A term used to describe the present trend of \nindustrial technology automation\
    \ and data exchange, which \nincludes cyber-physical systems, the Internet of\
    \ Things, \ncloud computing, and cognitive computing, as well as the \ndevelopment\
    \ of the smart factory”. The digital revolution \nto Industry 4.0 begins with\
    \ data collection, followed by \nartificial intelligence to interpret the data.\
    \ Thus, the term \n“Intelligence Revolution” can be considered in the context\
    \ \nof computing and services as the world is being reshaped by \nAI that incorporates\
    \ human behavior and intelligence into \nmachines or systems.\nAI is the buzzword\
    \ these days as it is going to impact \nbusinesses of all shapes and sizes, across\
    \ all industries. \nExisting products or services can be enhanced by indus-\n\
    trial AI to make them more effective, reliable, and safe. For \nexample, computer\
    \ vision is used in the automotive industry \nto avoid collisions and allow vehicles\
    \ to stay in their lane, \nmaking driving safer. The world’s most powerful nations\
    \ are \nhurrying to jump on the AI bandwagon and are increasing \ntheir investments\
    \ in the field. Similarly, the largest and most \npowerful corporations are working\
    \ hard to build ground-\nbreaking AI solutions that will put them ahead of the\
    \ compe-\ntition. As a result, its impact may be observed in practically \nevery\
    \ area including homes, businesses, hospitals, cities, and \nthe virtual world,\
    \ as summarized in “Real-World Applica-\ntions of AI”.\nUnderstanding Various\
    \ Types of Artificial \nIntelligence\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is primarily\
    \ concerned with com-\nprehending and carrying out intelligent tasks such as think-\n\
    ing, acquiring new abilities, and adapting to new contexts \nand challenges. AI\
    \ is thus considered a branch of science \nand engineering that focuses on simulating\
    \ a wide range of \nissues and functions in the field of human intellect. How-\n\
    ever, due to the dynamic nature and diversity of real-world \nsituations and data,\
    \ building an effective AI model is a chal-\nlenging task. Thus, to solve various\
    \ issues in today’s Fourth \nIndustrial Revolution, we explore various types of\
    \ AI that \ninclude analytical, functional, interactive, textual, and visual,\
    \ \nto understand the theme of the power of AI, as shown in \nFig. 1. In the following,\
    \ we define the scope of each category \nin terms of computing and real-world\
    \ services.\n• Analytical AI: Analytics typically refers to the process of \n\
    identifying, interpreting, and communicating meaningful \npatterns of data. Thus,\
    \ Analytical AI aims to discover \nnew insights, patterns, and relationships or\
    \ dependen-\ncies in data and to assist in data-driven decision-making. \nTherefore,\
    \ in the domain of today’s business intelligence, \nit becomes a core part of\
    \ AI that can provide insights to \nan enterprise and generate suggestions or\
    \ recommenda-\ntions through its analytical processing capability. Various \n\
    machine learning [81] and deep learning [80] techniques \ncan be used to build\
    \ an analytical AI model to solve a \nparticular real-world problem. For instance,\
    \ to assess \nbusiness risk, a data-driven analytical model can be used.\n• Functional\
    \ AI: Functional AI works similarly to ana-\nlytical AI because it also explores\
    \ massive quantities of \ndata for patterns and dependencies. Functional AI, on\
    \ the \nother hand, executes actions rather than making recom-\nmendations. For\
    \ instance, a functional AI model could be \nFig. 1  Various types of artificial\
    \ \nintelligence (AI) considering \nthe variations of real-world \nissues\n \n\
    SN Computer Science (2022) 3:158\n158 \nPage 4 of 20\nSN Computer Science\nuseful\
    \ in robotics and IoT applications to take immediate \nactions.\n• Interactive\
    \ AI: Interactive AI typically enables efficient \nand interactive communication\
    \ automation, which is well \nestablished in many aspects of our daily lives,\
    \ particu-\nlarly in the commercial sphere. For instance, to build \nchatbots\
    \ and smart personal assistants an interactive AI \nmodel could be useful. While\
    \ building an interactive AI \nmodel, a variety of techniques such as machine\
    \ learning, \nfrequent pattern mining, reasoning, AI heuristic search \ncan be\
    \ employed.\n• Textual AI: Textual AI typically covers textual analytics \nor\
    \ natural language processing through which businesses \ncan enjoy text recognition,\
    \ speech-to-text conversion, \nmachine translation as well as content generation\
    \ capa-\nbilities. For instance, an enterprise may use textual AI \nto support\
    \ an internal corporate knowledge repository \nto provide relevant services, e.g.,\
    \ answering consumers’ \nqueries.\n• Visual AI: Visual AI is typically capable\
    \ to recognize, \nclassify, and sorting items, as well as converting images \n\
    and videos into insights. Thus, visual AI can be consid-\nered as a branch of\
    \ computer science that trains machines \nto learn images and visual data in the\
    \ same manner that \nhumans do. This sort of AI is often used in fields such as\
    \ \ncomputer vision and augmented reality.\nAs discussed above, each of the AI\
    \ types has the potential \nto provide solutions to various real-world problems.\
    \ How-\never, to provide solutions by taking into account the target \napplications,\
    \ various AI techniques and their combinations \nthat include machine learning,\
    \ deep learning, advanced ana-\nlytics, knowledge discovery, reasoning, searching,\
    \ and rel-\nevant others can be used, discussed briefly in “Potential AI \ntechniques”.\
    \ As most of the real-world issues need advanced \nanalytics [79] to provide an\
    \ intelligent and smart solution \naccording to today’s needs, analytical AI that\
    \ uses machine \nlearning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques can play \na\
    \ key role in the area of AI-powered computing and system.\nThe Relation of AI\
    \ with ML and DL\nArtificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and \n\
    deep learning (DL) are three prominent terminologies \nused interchangeably nowadays\
    \ to represent intelligent \nsystems or software. The position of machine learning\
    \ \nand deep learning within the artificial intelligence field \nis depicted in\
    \ Fig. 2. According to Fig. 2, DL is a subset \nof ML which is also a subset of\
    \ AI. In general, AI [77] \ncombines human behavior and intelligence into machines\
    \ \nor systems, whereas ML is a way of learning from data or \nexperience [81],\
    \ which automates analytical model build-\ning. Deep learning [80] also refers\
    \ to data-driven learning \napproaches that use multi-layer neural networks and\
    \ pro-\ncessing to compute. In the deep learning approach, the \nterm “Deep” refers\
    \ to the concept of numerous levels or \nstages through which data is processed\
    \ to develop a data-\ndriven model.\nThus, both ML and DL can be considered as\
    \ essen-\ntial AI technologies, as well as a frontier for AI that can \nbe used\
    \ to develop intelligent systems and automate pro-\ncesses. It also takes AI to\
    \ a new level, termed “Smarter \nAI” with data-driven learning. There is a significant\
    \ rela-\ntionship with “Data Science” [79] as well because both \nML and DL can\
    \ learn from data. These learning methods \ncan also play a crucial role in advanced\
    \ analytics and intel-\nligent decision-making in data science, which typically\
    \ \nrefers to the complete process of extracting insights in data \nin a certain\
    \ problem domain. Overall, we can conclude that \nboth ML and DL technologies\
    \ have the potential to trans-\nform the current world, particularly in terms\
    \ of a powerful \ncomputational engine, and to contribute to technology-\ndriven\
    \ automation, smart and intelligent systems. In addi-\ntion to these learning\
    \ techniques, several others can play \nthe role in the development of AI-based\
    \ models in various \nreal-world application areas, depending on the nature of\
    \ \nthe problem and the target solution, discussed briefly in \n“ Potential AI\
    \ techniques”.\nPotential AI Techniques\nIn this section, we briefly discuss the\
    \ principles and capabili-\nties of potential AI techniques that can be used in\
    \ developing \nintelligent and smart systems in various real-world applica-\n\
    tion areas. For this we divide AI techniques into ten poten-\ntial categories\
    \ by taking into account various types of AI, \nmentioned in earlier “Why artificial\
    \ intelligence in today’s \nresearch and applications?”. Followings are the ten\
    \ catego-\nries of AI techniques that can play a key role in automation, \nFig.\

    \ systems, depending on the \nnature of the problem.\nMachine Learning\nMachine\
    \ learning (ML) is known as one of the most promis-\ning AI technologies, which\
    \ is typically the study of computer \nalgorithms that automate analytical model\
    \ building [81]. ML \nmodels are often made up of a set of rules, procedures,\
    \ or \nsophisticated “transfer functions” that can be used to dis-\ncover interesting\
    \ data patterns or anticipate behavior [23]. \nMachine learning is also known\
    \ as predictive analytics that \nmakes predictions about certain unknowns in the\
    \ future \nthrough the use of data and is used to solve many real-world \nbusiness\
    \ issues, e.g., business risk prediction. In Fig. 3, a \ngeneral framework of\
    \ a machine learning-based predictive \nmodel is depicted, where the model is\
    \ trained from histori-\ncal data in phase 1 and the outcome is generated for\
    \ new \ntest data in phase 2. For modeling in a particular problem \ndomain, different\
    \ types of machine learning techniques can \nbe used according to their learning\
    \ principles and capabili-\nties, as discussed below.\n• Supervised learning This\
    \ is performed when particular \ngoals are specified to be achieved from a set\
    \ of inputs, \ni.e., a ‘task-driven strategy’ that uses labeled data to \ntrain\
    \ algorithms to classify data or forecast outcomes, \nfor example—detecting spam-like\
    \ emails. The two most \ncommon supervised learning tasks are classification \n\
    (predicting a label) and regression (predicting a quan-\ntity) analysis, discussed\
    \ briefly in our earlier paper Sarker \net al. [81]. Navies Bayes [42], K-nearest\
    \ neighbors [4], \nSupport vector machines [46], Decision Trees - ID3 [71], \n\
    C4.5 [72], CART [15], BehavDT [84], IntrudTree [82], \nEnsemble learning, Random\
    \ Forest [14], Linear regres-\nsion [36], Support vector regression [46], etc.\
    \ [81] are \nthe popular techniques that can be used to solve various \nsupervised\
    \ learning tasks, according to the nature of the \ngiven data in a particular\
    \ problem domain. For instance, \nto detect various types of cyber-attacks the\
    \ classification \nmodels could be useful, while cyber-crime trend analysis \n\
    or estimating the financial loss in the domain of cyberse-\ncurity, a regression\
    \ model could be useful, which enables \nenterprises to assess and manage their\
    \ cyber-risk.\n• Unsupervised learning This is referred to as a ‘data-\ndriven\
    \ method’, in which the primary goal is to uncover \npatterns, structures, or\
    \ knowledge from unlabeled data. \nClustering, visualization, dimensionality reduction,\
    \ find-\ning association rules, and anomaly detection are some of \nthe most common\
    \ unsupervised tasks, discussed briefly \nin our earlier paper Sarker et al. [81].\
    \ The popular tech-\nniques for solving unsupervised learning tasks are clus-\n\
    tering algorithms such as K-means [55], K-Mediods [64], \nCLARA [45], DBSCAN [27],\
    \ hierarchical clustering, \nsingle linkage [92] or complete linkage [93], BOTS\
    \ [86], \nassociation learning algorithms such as AIS [2], Apriori \n[3], Apriori-TID\
    \ and Apriori-Hybrid [3], FP-Tree [37], \nand RARM [18], Eclat [105], ABC-RuleMiner\
    \ [88] as \nwell as feature selection and extracting techniques like \nPearson\
    \ Correlation [81], principal component analysis \n[40, 66], etc. that can be\
    \ used to solve various unsuper-\nvised learning-related tasks, according to the\
    \ nature of \nthe data. An unsupervised clustering model, for example, \ncould\
    \ be useful in customer segmentation or identifying \ndifferent consumer groups\
    \ around which to build market-\ning or other business strategies.\n• Other learning\
    \ techniques In addition to particular super-\nvised and unsupervised tasks, semi-supervised\
    \ learning \ncan be regarded as a hybridization of both techniques \nexplained\
    \ above, as it uses both labeled and unlabeled \ndata to train a model. It could\
    \ be effective for improv-\ning model performance when data must be labeled \n\
    automatically without human interaction. For instance, \nclassifying Internet\
    \ content or texts, a semi-supervised \nlearning model could be useful. Reinforcement\
    \ learn-\ning is another type of machine learning training strategy \nthat rewards\
    \ desired behaviors while punishing unwanted \nones. A reinforcement learning\
    \ agent, in general, is capa-\nble of perceiving and interpreting its surroundings,\
    \ tak-\ning actions, and learning through trial and error, i.e., an \nenvironment-driven\
    \ approach, in which the environment \nis typically modeled as a Markov decision\
    \ process and \ndecisions are made using a reward function [10]. Monte \nCarlo\
    \ learning, Q-learning, Deep Q Networks, are the \nmost common reinforcement learning\
    \ algorithms [43]. \nTrajectory optimization, motion planning, dynamic path-\n\
    ing, and scenario-based learning policies for highways \nare some of the autonomous\
    \ driving activities where \nreinforcement learning could be used.\nFig. 3  A\

    \ both the training and testing phase\n \nSN Computer Science (2022) 3:158\n158\
    \ \nPage 6 of 20\nSN Computer Science\nOverall, machine learning modeling [81]\
    \ has been employed \nin practically every aspect of our lives, including health-\n\
    care, cybersecurity, business, education, virtual assistance, \nrecommendation\
    \ systems, smart cities, and many more. \nBlumenstock et al. [12], for example,\
    \ provides a machine \nlearning strategy for getting COVID-19 assistance to peo-\n\
    ple who need it the most. Sarker et al. highlight numerous \nsorts of cyber anomalies\
    \ and attacks that can be detected \nusing machine learning approaches in the\
    \ domain of cyber-\nsecurity [78, 89]. Saharan et al. [76] describe a machine-\n\
    learning-based strategy to develop an effective smart parking \npricing system\
    \ for smart city environments. In our earlier \npaper, Sarker et al. [81] we briefly\
    \ discussed various types \nof machine learning techniques including clustering,\
    \ feature \nlearning, classification, regression, association analysis, etc. \n\
    highlighting their working principles, learning capabilities, \nand real-world\
    \ applications. In Table 1, we have outlined the \nabove-mentioned machine learning\
    \ techniques, emphasiz-\ning model building procedures and tasks. Overall, machine\
    \ \nlearning algorithms can build a model based on training data \nof a particular\
    \ problem domain, to make predictions or deci-\nsions without having to be explicitly\
    \ programmed to do so. \nThus, we can conclude that machine learning approaches\
    \ can \nplay a crucial part in the development of useful models in \na variety\
    \ of application areas, based on their learning capa-\nbilities and the nature\
    \ of the data, and the desired outcome.\nNeural Networks and Deep Learning\nDeep\
    \ learning (DL) [80] is known as another popular AI \ntechnique, which is based\
    \ on artificial neural networks \n(ANN). Nowadays, DL has become a hot topic in\
    \ the \ncomputing world due to its layer-wise learning capabil-\nity from data.\
    \ Multiple hidden layers, including input and \noutput layers, make up a typical\
    \ deep neural network. Fig-\nure 4 shows a general structure of a deep neural\
    \ network \n( hidden layer = N and N ≥ 2) comparing with a shallow \nnetwork (\
    \ hidden layer = 1 ). DL techniques can be divided \ninto three major categories,\
    \ highlighted in our earlier paper \nSarker et al. [80]. These are as below:\n\
    • Deep networks for supervised or discriminative learning \nIn supervised or classification\
    \ applications, this type of \nDL approach is used to provide a discriminative\
    \ function. \nDiscriminative deep architectures are often designed to \nprovide\
    \ pattern categorization discrimination by charac-\nterizing the posterior distributions\
    \ of classes conditioned \non observable data [20]. Multi-layer perceptron (MLP)\
    \ \n[67], Convolutional neural networks (CNN or ConvNet) \n[53], Recurrent neural\
    \ networks (RNN) [24, 57], and \ntheir variants can be used to build the deep\
    \ discriminative \nlearning models to solve the relevant real-world issues.\n\
    • Deep networks for unsupervised or generative learn-\ning This category of deep\
    \ learning approaches is com-\nmonly used to identify high-order correlation qualities\
    \ \nor features for pattern analysis or synthesis, as well as \nTable 1  Various\

    \ distributions of visible data and their \nassociated classes [20]. The key notion\
    \ of generative \ndeep architectures is that specific supervisory informa-\ntion,\
    \ such as target class labels, is unimportant through-\nout the learning process.\
    \ Techniques in this category are \nmostly employed for unsupervised learning,\
    \ as they are \ncommonly used for feature learning or data generation \nand representation\
    \ [19, 20]. Thus, generative modeling \ncan also be utilized as a preprocessing\
    \ step for super-\nvised learning tasks, ensuring discriminative model accu-\n\
    racy. The Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) [32], \nAutoencoder (AE) [31],\
    \ Restricted Boltzmann Machine \n(RBM) [58], Self-Organizing Map (SOM) [50], and\
    \ \nDeep Belief Network (DBN) [39], as well as their vari-\nants, can be used\

    \ issues.\n• Deep networks for hybrid learning Generative models are \nversatile,\
    \ learning from both labeled and unlabeled data. \nIn contrast, discriminative\
    \ models are unable to learn \nfrom unlabeled data yet outperform their generative\
    \ ver-\nsions in supervised tasks. Hybrid networks are motivated \nby a paradigm\
    \ for simultaneously training deep genera-\ntive and discriminative models. Multiple\
    \ (two or more) \ndeep basic learning models make up hybrid deep learning \nmodels,\
    \ with the basic model being the discriminative or \ngenerative deep learning\
    \ model outlined previously. For \ninstance, a generative model followed by a\
    \ discriminative \nmodel, or an integration of a generative or discriminative\
    \ \nmodel followed by a non-deep learning classifier, may be \neffective for tackling\
    \ real-world problems.\nFigure 5 shows a taxonomy of these DL techniques that\

    SN Computer Science\nData Mining, Knowledge Discovery and Advanced \nAnalytics\n\
    Over the last decade, data mining has been a common word \nthat is interchangeable\
    \ with terms like knowledge mining \nfrom data, knowledge extraction, knowledge\
    \ discovery from \ndata (KDD), data or pattern analysis, etc. [79]. Figure 6 \n\
    shows a general procedure of the knowledge discovery pro-\ncess. According to\
    \ Han et al. [36], the term “knowledge min-\ning from data” should have been used\
    \ instead. Data mining \nis described as the process of extracting useful patterns\
    \ and \nknowledge from huge volumes of data [36], which is related \nto another\
    \ popular term “Data Science” [79]. Data science \nis typically defined as a concept\
    \ that unites statistics, data \nanalysis, and related methodologies to analyze\
    \ and investi-\ngate realities through data.\nIn the area of data analytics, several\
    \ key questions such \nas “What happened?”, “Why did it happen?”, “What will \n\
    happen in the future?”, “What action should be taken?” are \ncommon and important\
    \ [79]. Based on these questions, four \ntypes of analytics such as descriptive,\
    \ diagnostic, predictive, \nand prescriptive analytics are highlighted below,\
    \ which can \nbe used to build the corresponding data-driven models.\n• Descriptive\
    \ analytics It is the analysis of historical data \nto have a better understanding\
    \ of how a business has \nchanged. Thus, descriptive analytics answers the ques-\n\
    tion, “What happened in the past?” by describing histori-\ncal data such as sales\
    \ and operations statistics, marketing \ntactics, social media usage, etc.\n•\
    \ Diagnostic analytics It is a type of sophisticated analyt-\nics that explores\
    \ data or content to figure out “Why did it \nhappen?” The purpose of diagnostic\
    \ analytics is to assist \nin the discovery of the problem’s root cause.\n• Predictive\
    \ analytics This type of advanced analytics \ntypically explores data to answer\
    \ the question, “What \nwill happen in the future?” Thus, the primary purpose\
    \ \nof predictive analytics is to identify and, in most cases, \nanswer this question\
    \ with a high degree of confidence.\n• Prescriptive analytics This focuses on\
    \ advising the \noptimal course of action based on data to maximize the \ntotal\
    \ outcomes and profitability, answering the question, \n“What action should be\
    \ taken?”\nTo summarize, both descriptive and diagnostic analyt-\nics examine\
    \ the past to determine what happened and \nwhy it happened. Predictive and prescriptive\
    \ analytics \nemploy historical data to foresee what will happen in \nthe future\
    \ and what actions should be made to mitigate \nsuch impacts. For a clear understanding,\
    \ Table 2 shows \na summary of these analytics that are applied in various \n\
    application areas. For example, Hamed et al. [35] build \ndecision support systems\
    \ in Arabic higher education \ninstitutions using data mining and business intelligence.\

    \ \nPage 9 of 20 \n158\nSN Computer Science\nAlazab et al. [5] provide a data\
    \ mining strategy to maxi-\nmize the competitive advantage on E-business websites.\
    \ \nFrom logs to stories, Afzaliseresht et al. [1] provide \nhuman-centered data\
    \ mining for cyber threat information. \nPoort et al. [70] have described an automated\
    \ diagnostic \nanalytics workflow for the detection of production events-\napplication\
    \ to mature gas fields. Srinivas et al. [94] pro-\nvide a prescriptive analytics\
    \ framework for optimizing \noutpatient appointment systems using machine learning\
    \ \nalgorithms and scheduling rules. Thus, we can conclude \ndata mining and analytics\
    \ can play a crucial part to build \nAI models through the extracted insights\
    \ from the data.\nRule‑Based Modeling and Decision‑Making\nTypically, a rule-based\
    \ system is used to store and modify \nknowledge to understand data in a meaningful\
    \ way. A rule \nbase is a sort of knowledge base that has a list of rules. \n\
    In most cases, rules are written as IF-THEN statements \nof the form:\nIF < antecedent\
    \ > THEN < consequent >\nSuch an IF-THEN rule-based expert system model can \n\
    have the decision-making ability of a human expert in \nan intelligent system\
    \ designed to solve complex prob-\nlems and knowledge reasoning [85]. The reason\
    \ is that \nthe rules in professional frameworks are easily under-\nstood by humans\
    \ and are capable of representing relevant \nknowledge clearly and effectively.\
    \ Furthermore, rule-\nbased models may be quickly improved according to the \n\
    demands by adding, deleting, or updating rules based \non domain expert information,\
    \ or recency, i.e. based on \nrecent trends [83].\nPreviously, the term “rule-based\
    \ system” was used to \ndescribe systems that used rule sets that were handcrafted\
    \ \nor created by humans. However, rule-based machine \nlearning approaches could\
    \ be more effective in terms of \nautomation and intelligence, which include mainly\
    \ clas-\nsification and association rule learning techniques [85]. \nSeveral popular\
    \ classification techniques such as deci-\nsion trees [72], IntrudTree [82], BehavDT\
    \ [84], Ripple \nDown Rule learner (RIDOR) [101], Repeated Incremen-\ntal Pruning\
    \ to Produce Error Reduction (RIPPER) [102], \netc. exist with the ability of\
    \ rule generation. Based on \nsupport and confidence value, association rules\
    \ are built \nby searching for frequent IF-THEN pattern data. Com-\nmon association\
    \ rule learning techniques such as AIS \n[2], Apriori [3], FP-Tree [37], RARM\
    \ [18], Eclat [105], \nABC-RuleMiner [88], and others can be used to build \n\
    a rule-based model utilizing a given data set. Sarker \net al. [88], for example,\
    \ provide a rule-based machine \nlearning strategy for context-aware intelligent\
    \ and adap-\ntive mobile services. Borah et al. [13] propose a method \nfor employing\
    \ dynamic rare association rule mining to \nfind risk variables for unfavorable\
    \ illnesses. Using case-\nbased clustering and weighted association rule mining,\
    \ \nBhavithra et al. [11] offer a personalized web page sug-\ngestion. Xu et al.\
    \ [103] introduced a risk prediction and \nearly warning system for air traffic\
    \ controllers’ risky \nbehaviors utilizing association rule mining and random\
    \ \nforest. Thus, we can conclude that rule-based modeling \ncan play a significant\
    \ role to build AI models as well as \nintelligent decision-making in various\
    \ application areas \nto solve real-world issues.\nFuzzy Logic‑Based Approach\n\
    Fuzzy logic is a precise logic of imprecision and approxi-\nmate reasoning [104].\
    \ This is a natural generalization of \nstandard logic in which a concept’s degree\
    \ of truth, also \nknown as membership value or degree of membership, can \nrange\
    \ from 0.0 to 1.0. Standard logic only applies to con-\ncepts that are either\
    \ completely true, i.e., degree of truth 1.0, \nor completely false, i.e., degree\
    \ of truth 0.0. Fuzzy logic, \non the other hand, has been used to deal with the\
    \ concept \nof partial truth, in which the truth value may range from \ncompletely\
    \ true to completely false, such as 0.9 or 0.5. For \ninstance, “if x is very\
    \ large, do y; if x is not very large, do \nz”. Here the boundaries of very big\
    \ and not too big may \noverlap, i.e. fuzzy. As a result, fuzzy logic-based models\
    \ can \nrecognize, represent, manipulate, understand, and use data \nand information\
    \ that are vague and uncertain [104]. Figure 7 \nshows a general architecture\
    \ of a fuzzy logic system. It typi-\ncally has four parts as below:\n• Fuzzification\
    \ It transforms inputs, i.e. crisp numbers into \nfuzzy sets.\nFig. 7  A general\
    \ architecture of fuzzy logic systems\n \nSN Computer Science (2022) 3:158\n158\
    \ \nPage 10 of 20\nSN Computer Science\n• Knowledge-base It contains the set of\
    \ rules and the IF-\nTHEN conditions provided by the experts to govern the \n\
    decision-making system, based on linguistic information.\n• Inference engine It\
    \ determines the matching degree of \nthe current fuzzy input concerning each\
    \ rule and decides \nwhich rules are to be fired according to the input field.\
    \ \nNext, the fired rules are combined to form the control \nactions.\n• Defuzzification\
    \ It transforms the fuzzy sets obtained by \nthe inference engine into a crisp\
    \ value.\nAlthough machine learning models are capable of differen-\ntiating between\
    \ two (or more) object classes based on their \nability to learn from data, the\
    \ fuzzy logic approach is pre-\nferred when distinguishing features are vaguely\
    \ defined and \nrely on human expertise and knowledge. Thus, the system \nmay\
    \ work with any type of input data, including imprecise, \ndistorted, or noisy\
    \ data, as well as with limited data. It is a \nsuitable strategy to use in scenarios\
    \ with real, continuous-\nvalued elements because it uses data acquired in surround-\n\
    ings with such properties [34]. Fuzzy logic-based models \nare used to tackle\
    \ problems in a variety of fields. Reddy \net al. [74], for example, use a fuzzy\
    \ logic classifier for heart \ndisease detection, with the derived rules from\
    \ fuzzy classi-\nfiers being optimized using an adaptive genetic algorithm. \n\
    Krishnan et al. [51] describes a fuzzy logic-based smart irri-\ngation system\
    \ using IoT, which sends out periodic acknowl-\nedgment messages on task statuses\
    \ such as soil humidity \nand temperature. Hamamoto et al. [34] describe a network\
    \ \nanomaly detection method based on fuzzy logic for deter-\nmining whether or\
    \ not a given instance is anomalous. Kang \net al. [44] proposed a fuzzy weighted\
    \ association rule min-\ning approach for developing a customer satisfaction product\
    \ \nform. Overall, we can infer that fuzzy logic can make rea-\nsonable conclusions\
    \ in a world of imprecision, uncertainty, \nand partial data, and thus might be\
    \ useful in such scenarios \nwhile building a model.\nKnowledge Representation,\
    \ Uncertainty Reasoning, \nand Expert System Modeling\nKnowledge representation\
    \ is the study of how an intelligent \nagent’s beliefs, intents, and judgments\
    \ may be expressed \nappropriately for automated reasoning, and it has emerged\
    \ \nas one of the most promising topics of Artificial Intelli-\ngence. Reasoning\
    \ is the process of using existing knowledge \nto conclude, make predictions,\
    \ or construct explanations. \nMany types of knowledge can be used in various\
    \ application \ndomains include descriptive knowledge, structural knowl-\nedge,\
    \ procedural knowledge, meta-knowledge, and heuris-\ntic knowledge [87]. Knowledge\
    \ representation is more than \njust storing data in a database; it also allows\
    \ an intelligent \nmachine to learn from its knowledge and experiences to \nact\
    \ intelligently as a human. As a result, in designing an \nintelligent system,\
    \ an effective method of knowledge rep-\nresentation is required. Several knowledge\
    \ representation \napproaches exist in the fields that can be utilized to develop\
    \ \na knowledge-based conceptual model, including logical, \nsemantic network,\
    \ frame, and production rules [95]. In the \nfollowing, we summarize the potential\
    \ knowledge represen-\ntation strategies taking real-world issues into account.\n\
    • Ontology-based In general, ontology is “an explicit \nspecification of conceptualization\
    \ and a formal way \nto define the semantics of knowledge and data” [56]. \nAccording\
    \ to [56], formally, an ontology is represented \nas “ {O = C, R, I, H, A} , where\
    \ {C = C1, C2, … , Cn} rep-\nresents a set of concepts, and {R = R1, R2, … , Rm}\
    \ rep-\nresents a set of relations defined over the concepts. I rep-\nresents\
    \ a set of instances of concepts, and H represents a \nDirected Acyclic Graph\
    \ (DAG) defined by the subsump-\ntion relation between concepts, and A represents\
    \ a set of \naxioms bringing additional constraints on the ontology”. \nOntology-based\
    \ knowledge representation and reason-\ning techniques provide sophisticated knowledge\
    \ about the \nenvironment for processing tasks or methods. Figure 8 \nshows an\
    \ example of ontology components for the entity \nUniversity [26]. By defining\
    \ shared and common domain \ntheories, ontologies help people and machines to\
    \ commu-\nnicate concisely by supporting semantic knowledge for a \nparticular\
    \ domain. In the area of semantic data mining, \nsuch ontology-based approaches\
    \ like classification, min-\ning with association rules, clustering, finding links,\
    \ etc. \ncan play a significant role to build smart systems.\nFig. 8  An example\
    \ of ontology components for the entity University \n[26]\nSN Computer Science\
    \ (2022) 3:158 \nPage 11 of 20 \n158\nSN Computer Science\n• Rule-base It typically\
    \ consists of pairs of the condi-\ntion, and corresponding action, which means,\
    \ “IF \n< condition > THEN < action > ” [85]. As a result, an \nagent checks the\
    \ condition first, and if the condition \nis satisfied, the related rule fires.\
    \ The key benefit of a \nrule-based system like this is that the “condition” part\
    \ \ncan select which rule is appropriate to use for a given \nscenario. The “action”\
    \ portion, on the other hand, is \nresponsible for implementing the problem’s\
    \ solutions. \nFurthermore, in a rule-based system, we can easily insert, \ndelete,\
    \ or update rules as needed.\n• Uncertainty and probabilistic reasoning Probabilistic\
    \ \nreasoning is a method of knowledge representation in \nwhich the concept of\
    \ probability is used to signify the \nuncertainty in knowledge, and where probability\
    \ theory \nand logic are combined to address the uncertainty [65]. \nProbability\
    \ is the numerical measure of the possibil-\nity of an event occurring, and it\
    \ can be defined as the \nchance that an uncertain event will occur. To deal with\
    \ \nuncertainty in a model, probabilistic models, fuzzy logic, \nBayesian belief\
    \ networks, etc. can be employed.\nA knowledge-based system, such as an expert\
    \ system for \ndecision-making, relies on these representations of knowl-\nedge.\
    \ The inference engine and the knowledge base are two \nsubsystems of the expert\
    \ system, as represented in Fig. 9. \nThe information in the knowledge base is\
    \ organized accord-\ning to the knowledge representation discussed above. The\
    \ \ninference engine looks for knowledge-based information \nand linkages and,\
    \ like a human expert, provides answers, \npredictions, and recommendations. Such\
    \ a knowledge-based \nsystem can be found in many application areas. For instance,\
    \ \nGoel et al. [29] present an ontology-driven context-aware \nframework for\
    \ smart traffic monitoring. Chukkapalli et al. \n[16] present ontology-driven\
    \ AI and access control sys-\ntems for smart fisheries. Kiran et al. [49] present\
    \ enhanced \nsecurity-aware technique and ontology data access control \nin cloud\
    \ computing. Syed et al. [97] present a conceptual \nontology and cyber intelligence\
    \ alert system for cyber-\nsecurity vulnerability management. An ontology-based\
    \ \ncyber security policy implementation in Saudi Arabia has \nbeen presented\
    \ in Talib et al. [98]. Recently, Sarker et al. \n[90] explores an expert system\
    \ modeling for personalized \ndecision-making in mobile apps. Thus, knowledge\
    \ repre-\nsentation and modeling are important to build AI models as \nwell as\
    \ intelligent decision-making in various application \nareas to solve real-world\
    \ issues.\nCase‑Based Reasoning\nCase-based reasoning (CBR) is a cognitive science\
    \ and AI \nparadigm that represents reasoning as primarily memory-\nbased. CBR\
    \ is concerned with the “smart” reuse of knowl-\nedge from previously solved problems\
    \ (“cases”) and its \nadaption to new and unsolved problems. The inference is\
    \ \na problem-solving strategy based on the similarity of the \ncurrent situation\
    \ to previously solved problems recorded in \na repository. Its premise is that\
    \ the more similar the two \nissues are, the more similar their solutions will\
    \ be. Thus, \ncase-based reasoners handle new problems by obtaining pre-\nviously\
    \ stored ’cases’ that describe similar earlier problem-\nsolving experiences and\
    \ customizing their solutions to meet \nnew requirements. For example, patient\
    \ case histories and \ntreatments are utilized in medical education to assist\
    \ diag-\nnose and treating new patients. Figure 10 shows a general \narchitecture\
    \ of case-based reasoning. CBR research looks at \nthe CBR process as a model\
    \ of human cognition as well as \na method for developing intelligent systems.\n\
    CBR is utilized in a variety of applications. Lamy et al. \n[52], for example,\
    \ provide a visual case-based reasoning \nstrategy for explainable artificial\
    \ intelligence for breast \ncancer. Gonzalez et al. [30] provide a case-based\
    \ reason-\ning-based energy optimization technique. Khosravani et al. \n[47] offers\
    \ a case-based reasoning application in a defect \ndetection system for dripper\
    \ manufacturing. Corrales et al. \n[17] provide a case-based reasoning system\
    \ for data clean-\ning algorithm recommendation in classification and regres-\n\
    sion problems. As the number of stored cases grows, CBR \nbecomes more intelligent\
    \ and thus might be useful in such \nscenarios while building a model. However,\
    \ as the time \nFig. 9  A general architecture of an expert system\nFig. 10  A\
    \ general architecture of case-based reasoning\n \nSN Computer Science (2022)\
    \ 3:158\n158 \nPage 12 of 20\nSN Computer Science\nrequired to find and process\
    \ relevant cases increases, the \nsystem’s efficiency will decline.\nText Mining\
    \ and Natural Language Processing\nText mining [7], also known as text data mining,\
    \ similar to \ntext analytics, is the process of extracting meaningful infor-\n\
    mation from a variety of text or written resources, such as \nwebsites, books,\
    \ emails, reviews, docs, comments, articles, \nand so on. Information retrieval,\
    \ lexical analysis to investi-\ngate word frequency distributions, pattern recognition,\
    \ tag-\nging or annotation, information extraction, and data mining \ntechniques\
    \ such as link and association analysis, visualiza-\ntion, and predictive analytics\
    \ are all part of text analysis. \nText mining achieves this by employing several\
    \ analysis \ntechniques, such as natural language processing (NLP). NLP \nis a\
    \ text analysis technique that allows machines to interpret \nhuman speech. NLP\
    \ tasks include speech recognition, also \nknown as speech-to-text, word segmentation\
    \ or tokenization, \nlemmatization and stemming, part of speech tagging, pars-\n\
    ing, word sense disambiguation, named entity recognition, \nsentiment analysis,\
    \ topic segmentation and recognition, and \nnatural language generation, which\
    \ is the task of convert-\ning structured data into human language [21]. Fake\
    \ news \nidentification, spam detection, machine translation, question \nanswering,\
    \ social media sentiment analysis, text summariza-\ntion, virtual agents and chatbots,\
    \ and other real-world appli-\ncations use NLP techniques.\nAlthough many language-processing\
    \ systems were built \nin the early days using symbolic approaches, such as hand-\n\
    coding a set of rules and looking them up in a dictionary, \nNLP now blends computational\
    \ linguistics with statistical, \nmachine learning, and deep learning models [80,\
    \ 81]. These \ntechnologies, when used together, allow computers to pro-\ncess\
    \ human language in the form of text or speech data and \ncomprehend its full\
    \ meaning, including the speaker’s or \nwriter’s intent and sentiment. Many works\
    \ have been done \nin this area. For example, using the feature ensemble model,\
    \ \nPhan et al. [68] propose a method for improving the perfor-\nmance of sentiment\
    \ analysis of tweets with a fuzzy senti-\nment. Using weighted word embeddings\
    \ and deep neural \nnetworks, Onan et al. [62] provide sentiment analysis on \n\
    product reviews. Subramaniyaswamy et al. [96] present sen-\ntiment analysis of\
    \ tweets for estimating event criticality and \nsecurity. In [60], the efficacy\
    \ of social media data in health-\ncare communication is discussed. Typically,\
    \ learning tech-\nniques rather than static analysis is more effective in terms\
    \ \nof automation and intelligence in textual modeling or NLP \nsystems. In addition\
    \ to standard machine learning algorithms \n[81], deep learning models and techniques,\
    \ particularly, \nbased on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recur-\nrent\
    \ neural networks (RNNs) enable such systems to learn \nas they go and extract\
    \ progressively accurate meaning from \nlarge amounts of unstructured, unlabeled\
    \ text and speech \ninput. Thus various deep learning techniques including \n\
    generative and discriminative models can be used to build \npowerful textual or NLP\
    \ model according to their learning \ncapabilities from data, discussed briefly\
    \ in our earlier paper \nSarker et al. [80], which could also be a significant research\
    \ \ndirection in the area. Overall, we can conclude that by com-\nbining machine\
    \ and deep learning techniques with natural \nlanguage processing, computers can\
    \ intelligently analyze, \nunderstand, and infer meaning from human speech or\
    \ text, \nand thus could be useful for building textual AI models.\nVisual Analytics,\
    \ Computer Vision and Pattern \nRecognition\nComputer vision [99] is also a branch\
    \ of AI that allows com-\nputers and systems to extract useful information from\
    \ digi-\ntal images, videos, and other visual inputs and act or make \nrecommendations\
    \ based on that data. From an engineering \nstandpoint, it aims to comprehend\
    \ and automate operations \nthat the human visual system is capable of. As a result,\
    \ this \nis concerned with the automated extraction, analysis, and \ncomprehension\
    \ of relevant information from a single image \nor a series of images. In terms\
    \ of technology, it entails the \ncreation of a theoretical and algorithmic foundation\
    \ for \nachieving autonomous visual understanding by processing \nan image at\
    \ the pixel level. Typical tasks in the field of visual \nanalytics and computer\
    \ vision include object recognition or \nFig. 11  A general architecture of a\

    \ recognition \nof patterns and regularities in data, is the basis for today’s\
    \ \ncomputer vision algorithms. Pattern recognition often \ninvolves the categorization\
    \ (supervised learning) and group-\ning (unsupervised learning) of patterns [81].\
    \ Although pat-\ntern recognition has its roots in statistics and engineering,\
    \ \ndue to the greater availability of huge data and a new wealth \nof processing\
    \ power, some recent techniques to pattern rec-\nognition include the use of machines\
    \ and deep learning. \nConvolutional neural networks (CNN or ConvNet) [53, 80]\
    \ \nhave recently demonstrated considerable promise in a vari-\nety of computer\
    \ vision tasks, including classification, object \ndetection, and scene analysis.\
    \ The general architecture of a \nconvolution neural network is depicted in Figure 11.\
    \ Large \ndatasets of thousands or millions of labeled training samples \nare\
    \ typically used to train these algorithms. However, the \nlack of appropriate\
    \ data limits the applications that can be \ndeveloped. While enormous volumes\
    \ of data can be obtained \nfast, supervised learning also necessitates data that\
    \ has been \nlabeled. Unfortunately, data labeling takes a long time and \ncosts\
    \ a lot of money. In this area, a lot of work has been \ndone. Elakkiya et al.\
    \ [25] develop a cervical cancer diag-\nnostics healthcare system utilizing hybrid\
    \ object detection \nadversarial networks in their paper. Harrou et al. [38] present\
    \ \nan integrated vision-based technique for detecting human \nfalls in a residential\
    \ setting. Pan et al. [63] demonstrated \na visual recognition based on deep learning\
    \ for navigation \nmark classification. Typically, learning techniques rather\
    \ \nthan static analysis is more effective in terms of automation \nand intelligence\
    \ in such visual analytics. In addition to stand-\nard machine learning algorithms\
    \ [81], various deep learning \ntechniques including generative and discriminative\
    \ models \ncan be used to build powerful visual model according to \ntheir learning\
    \ capabilities from data, discussed briefly in our \nearlier paper Sarker et al.\
    \ [80], which could also be a signifi-\ncant research direction in the area. Thus,\
    \ this is important to \nbuild effective visual AI models in various application\
    \ areas \nto solve real-world issues in the current age of the Fourth \nIndustrial\
    \ Revolution or Industry 4.0, according to the goal \nof this paper.\nHybrid Approach,\
    \ Searching, and Optimization\nA “hybrid approach” is a blend of multiple approaches\
    \ or \nsystems to design a new and superior model. As a result, a \nhybrid strategy\
    \ integrates the necessary approaches outlined \nabove depending on the demands.\
    \ For instance, in our earlier \npublication, Sarker et al. [85], we have used\
    \ a hybridization \nof machine learning and knowledge-base expert system to \n\
    build an effective context-aware model for intelligent mobile \nservices. In this\
    \ hybrid context-aware model, context-aware \nrules are discovered using machine\
    \ learning techniques, \nwhich are used as the knowledge base of an expert sys-\n\
    tem rather than traditional handcrafted static rules to make \ncomputing and decision-making\
    \ processes more actionable \nand intelligent. Similarly, in another hybrid approach\
    \ [68], \nthe concepts of fuzzy logic, deep learning, and natural lan-\nguage\
    \ processing were integrated to improve Twitter senti-\nment analysis accuracy.\
    \ The authors in [33] present a deep \nconvolutional neural network-based automated\
    \ and robust \nobject recognition in X-ray baggage inspection, where deep \nlearning\
    \ is integrated with computer vision analysis. Kang \net al. [44] proposed a fuzzy\
    \ weighted association rule min-\ning strategy to produce a customer satisfaction\
    \ product form. \nMoreover, Sarker et al. discussed various machine learning \n\
    [81] and deep learning [80] techniques and their hybridiza-\ntion that can be\
    \ used to solve a variety of real-world prob-\nlems in many application areas\
    \ such as business, finance, \nhealthcare, smart cities, cybersecurity, etc. Thus,\
    \ hybridiza-\ntion of multiple techniques could play a key role to build an \n\
    effective AI model in the area.\nMoreover, many AI problems can be solved theoretically\
    \ \nby searching through a large number of possible solutions, \nand the reasoning\
    \ process may be reduced down to a sim-\nple search. Thus, search strategies,\
    \ also known as universal \nproblem-solving approaches in AI, can also play a\
    \ signifi-\ncant role to solve real-world issues such as gaming, ranking \nweb\
    \ pages, video, and other content in search results, etc., \ndue to the properties\
    \ of its completeness, optimality, time \ncomplexity, and space complexity. Depending\
    \ on the nature \nof the problems, search algorithms can be uninformed search\
    \ \n(a.k.a. blind, brute-force) or informed search (a.k.a. heuristic \nsearch).\
    \ Uninformed search [75] refers to a group of general-\npurpose search algorithms\
    \ that generate search trees without \nrelying on domain information, such as\
    \ breadth-first, depth-\nfirst, uniform cost search, etc. Informed search [75]\
    \ algo-\nrithms, on the other hand, use additional or problem-specific \nknowledge\
    \ in the search process, such as greedy search, A* \nsearch, graph search, etc.\
    \ For example, when searching on \nGoogle Maps, one needs to provide information\
    \ such as a \nposition from the current location to precisely traverse the \n\
    distance, time traveled, and real-time traffic updates on that \nspecific route.\
    \ Informed search can solve a variety of com-\nplicated problems that cannot be\
    \ handled any other way. Fur-\nthermore, evolutionary computation employs an optimiza-\n\
    tion search technique, such as genetic algorithms, which has \na great potential\
    \ to solve real-world issues. For instance, in \nthe domain of cybersecurity,\
    \ a genetic algorithm is used for \neffective feature selection to detect anomalies\
    \ in fog comput-\ning environment [61]. In [28], genetic algorithm is used for\
    \ \noptimized feature selection to detect Android malware using \nmachine learning\
    \ techniques. With AI-powered search, the \nplatform learns from the data to provide\
    \ the most accurate \n \nSN Computer Science (2022) 3:158\n158 \nPage 14 of 20\n\
    SN Computer Science\nand relevant search results automatically. Thus, searching\
    \ \nas well as optimization techniques can be used as a part of \nhybridization\
    \ while building AI models to solve real-world \nproblems.\nOverall, we can conclude\
    \ that the above explored ten \npotential AI techniques can play a significant\
    \ role while \nbuilding various AI models such as analytical, functional, \ninteractive,\
    \ textual, and visual models, depending on the \nnature of the problem and target\
    \ application. In the next \nsection, we summarize various real-world application\
    \ areas, \nwhere these AI techniques are employed in today’s inter-\nconnected\
    \ world towards automation, intelligent and smart \nsystems.\nReal‑World Applications\
    \ of AI\nAI approaches have been effectively applied to a variety of \nissues\
    \ in a variety of application areas throughout the last \nseveral years. Healthcare,\
    \ cybersecurity, business, social \nmedia, virtual reality and assistance, robotics,\
    \ and many \nother application areas are common nowadays. We have \noutlined some\
    \ potential real-world AI application areas in \nFig. 12. Various AI techniques,\
    \ such as machine learning, \ndeep learning, knowledge discovery, reasoning, natural\
    \ lan-\nguage processing, expert system modeling, and many oth-\ners, as detailed\
    \ above in “Potential AI techniques” are used \nin these application domains.\
    \ We have also listed several \nAI tasks and techniques that are utilized to solve\
    \ in several \nreal-world application areas in Table 3. Overall, we can con-\n\
    clude from Fig. 12 and Table 3 that the future prospects of \nAI modeling in real-world\
    \ application domains are vast and \nthere are several opportunities to work and\
    \ conduct research. \nIn the following section, we discuss the future aspect of\
    \ AI \nas well as research issues towards automation, intelligent \nand smart\
    \ systems.\nFuture Aspect and Research Issues\nArtificial intelligence is influencing\
    \ the future of almost \nevery sector and every person on the planet. AI has acted\
    \ \nas the driving force behind developing technologies for \nindustrial automation,\
    \ medical applications, agriculture, \nIoT applications, cybersecurity services,\
    \ etc. summarized \nin “Future Aspect and Research Issues”, and it will continue\
    \ \nto do so for the foreseeable future. This interdisciplinary sci-\nence comes\
    \ with numerous advancements and approaches \nthat are possible with the help\
    \ of deep learning, machine \nlearning algorithms, knowledge-base expert systems,\
    \ natu-\nral language processing, visual recognition, etc. discussed \nbriefly\
    \ in “Potential AI techniques”. Thus, by taking into \naccount the capabilities\
    \ of AI technologies, we illustrate \nthree essential terms, mentioned in “Introduction”\
    \ within \nthe scope of our study. These are\nFig. 12  Several potential \nreal-world\

    \ 3:158 \nPage 15 of 20 \n158\nSN Computer Science\n• Automation One of the main\
    \ themes of today’s applica-\ntions is automation, which encompasses a wide range\
    \ of \ntechnologies that reduce human interaction in operations. \nA program,\
    \ a script, or batch processing are commonly \nused in computing to automate tasks.\
    \ AI-based automa-\ntion takes the insights gained through computational ana-\n\
    lytics to the next level, allowing for automated decision-\nmaking. As a result,\
    \ we can describe automation as the \ndevelopment and implementation of technology\
    \ to manu-\nfacture and deliver products and services to increase the \nefficiency,\
    \ dependability, and/or speed of various jobs \ntraditionally handled by humans.\
    \ In customer service, \nfor example, virtual assistants can lower expenses while\
    \ \nempowering both customers and human agents, resulting \nin a better customer\
    \ experience. Artificial intelligence \ntechnology has the potential to automate\
    \ almost any \nindustry and every person on the planet.\n• Intelligent computing\
    \ It is also known as computational \nintelligence, and it refers to a computer’s\
    \ or system’s \nability to extract insights or usable knowledge from data \nor\
    \ experimental observation, or to learn a specific task. \nIntelligent computing\

    \ language processing, fuzzy systems, \nknowledge representation, and reasoning.\
    \ Transportation, \nindustry, health, agriculture, business, finance, security,\
    \ \nand other fields could all benefit from intelligent systems. \nThus, the above-mentioned\
    \ AI techniques, discussed in \n“Potential AI techniques” are the main drivers\
    \ for per-\nforming intelligent computing as well as decision-mak-\ning.\n• Smart\
    \ computing The word “Smart” can be described \nas self-monitoring, analyzing,\
    \ and reporting technology \nin smart computing, and the word “Computing” can\
    \ be \ndefined as computational analysis. As a result, it can be \nthought of\
    \ as the next generation of computing, which is \nused to create something self-aware,\
    \ that is, something \nthat can sense the activities of its environment, massage\
    \ \nthe gathered data, perform some analytics, and provide \nthe best decisions\
    \ while also predicting future risks and \nchallenges. In other words, it is a\
    \ significant multidisci-\nplinary area in which AI-based computational methods\
    \ \nand technologies, as explained in “Potential AI tech-\nniques”, are integrated\
    \ with engineering approaches to \nproduce systems, applications, and new services\
    \ that suit \nsocietal demands. Overall, it strives to construct a smart \nsystem\
    \ by monitoring, analyzing, and reporting data in \na faster and smarter manner,\
    \ with AI-based modeling \nplaying a vital part in system intelligence and decision-\n\
    making.\nThe above terms are also the key focus of the current \nfourth industrial\
    \ revolution (Industry 4.0). Business, health \ncare, energy, transportation systems,\
    \ environment, secu-\nrity, surveillance, industrial systems, information retrieval\
    \ \nand publication, entertainment and creativity, and social \nactivities can\
    \ all benefit from automation, intelligence, and \nsmart computer systems. For\
    \ example, chatbots, consumer \npersonalization, image-based targeting advertising,\
    \ and \nwarehouse and inventory automation are all examples of \nhow AI will continue\
    \ to drive e-commerce. The potential \nbenefits of using AI in medicine are now\
    \ being investi-\ngated. The medical industry has a wealth of data that may \n\
    be used to develop healthcare-related predictive models. \nManufacturing, notably\
    \ the automobile industry, will \nbe significantly impacted by AI. AI will have\
    \ an impact \non sales operations in a range of industries. Marketing \ntactics,\
    \ such as business models, sales procedures, and \ncustomer service options, as\
    \ well as customer behavior, \nare predicted to be significantly influenced by\
    \ AI. AI and \nmachine learning will be key technologies in cybersecu-\nrity for\
    \ identifying and forecasting threats [77, 89]. AI \nwill be a vital tool for\
    \ financial security because of its \nability to analyze large amounts of data,\
    \ foresee fraud, \nand identify it. In the near future, interacting with AI will\
    \ \nsurely become commonplace. Artificial intelligence can be \nused to solve\
    \ incredibly difficult problems and find solu-\ntions that are vital to human\
    \ well-being. These develop-\nments have enormous economic and societal implications.\
    \ \nThus, we can say, AI’s potential is limitless and its future \nwill be shaped\
    \ by our decisions and actions. While our \ndiscussion has established a solid\
    \ foundation on AI-based \nsystems and applications, hence we outline the below\
    \ ten \nresearch issues.\n• Several potential AI techniques exist in the area\
    \ with \nthe capability of solving problems, discussed in “Poten-\ntial AI techniques”.\
    \ To understand the nature of the \nproblem and an in-depth analysis is important\
    \ to find \na suitable solution, i.e., detecting cyber-anomalies or \nattacks\
    \ [78]. Thus, the challenge is “Which AI tech-\nnique is most suited to solving\
    \ a specific real-world \nproblem, taking into account the problem’s nature?”\n\
    • One promising research direction for AI-based solu-\ntions is to develop a general\
    \ framework that can handle \nthe issues involved. A well-designed framework and\
    \ \nexperimental evaluation are both a crucial direction and \na significant challenge.\
    \ Thus, the question is “How can \nwe design an effective AI-based framework to\
    \ achieve \nthe target outcome by taking into account the issues \ninvolved?”\n\
    • The digital world contains a wealth of data in this age \nof the Fourth Industrial\
    \ Revolution (Industry 4.0 or \n4IR), including IoT data, corporate data, health\
    \ data, \ncellular data, urban data, cybersecurity data, and many \nmore [79].\
    \ Extracting insights using various analytical \nmethods is important for smart\
    \ decision-making in a \nparticular system. Thus, the question is “How to extract\
    \ \nuseful insights or knowledge from real-world raw data \nto build an automated\
    \ and intelligent system for a par-\nticular business problem?\n• Nowadays, data\
    \ are considered as the most valuable \nresource in the world and various machine\
    \ learning \n[81] and deep learning [80] techniques are used to learn \nfrom data\
    \ or past experience, which automates analyti-\ncal model building. The increase\
    \ in data and such data-\ndriven analytical modeling have made AI the highest\
    \ \ngrowth in history. Thus, it’s important to do some data \npre-processing tasks\
    \ to feed into the ultimate machine \nlearning model, so the data behaves nicely\
    \ for the model. \nTherefore, the question is “How to effectively feed data \n\
    to a machine or deep learning model to solve a particular \nreal-world problem?”\n\
    • The traditional machine learning [81] and deep learning \n[80] techniques may\
    \ not be directly applicable for the \nexpected outcome in many cases. Thus, designing\
    \ new \ntechniques or their variants by taking into account model \nSN Computer\
    \ Science (2022) 3:158 \nPage 17 of 20 \n158\nSN Computer Science\noptimization,\
    \ accuracy, and applicability, according to \nthe nature of the data and target\
    \ real-world application, \ncould be a novel contribution in the area. Therefore\
    \ the \nquestion is—“How to design an effective learning algo-\nrithm or model\
    \ allowing the application to learn auto-\nmatically from the patterns or features\
    \ in the data?”\n• In the domain of today’s smart computing, the term \n‘context-awareness’\
    \ typically refers to a system’s capac-\nity to gather information about its surroundings\
    \ at any \ngiven time and adapt its behavior accordingly. Thus, the \nconcept\
    \ of context-aware machine learning can play a \nkey role to build an intelligent\
    \ context-aware applica-\ntion, highlighted in our book Sarker et al. [85]. Thus,\
    \ \nthe question is “How to effectively incorporate context-\nawareness in an\
    \ AI-based smart system that can sense \nfrom the surrounding environment and\
    \ make intelligent \ndecisions accordingly?”\n• Decision rules, represented as\
    \ IF-THEN statement, can \nplay an important role in the area of AI. Expert systems,\
    \ \na core part of AI, are typically used to solve many real-\nworld complex problems\
    \ by reasoning through knowl-\nedge, which are mostly represented by such IF-THEN\
    \ \nrules rather than traditional procedural code [85]. Thus, \na rule-based system\
    \ can manipulate knowledge and inter-\npret information in a useful way.  Therefore,\
    \ the question \nis “How can we design an automated rule-based system \nemulating\
    \ the decision-making ability of a human expert \nthrough discovering a concise\
    \ set of IF-THEN rules from \nthe data?\n• A decision support system is a type\
    \ of information \nsystem that aids in the decision-making process of a \nbusiness\
    \ or organization. AI techniques discussed in \n“Potential AI techniques” can\
    \ play a key role to pro-\nvide intelligent decisions across a wide range of sectors\
    \ \n(e.g., business, education, healthcare, etc.) rather than \nthe traditional\
    \ system, according to the nature of the \nproblem. Thus, the challenge is “How\
    \ can we design \nan AI-assisted decision-support system that aids a team \nor\
    \ organization in making better decisions?”\n• Uncertainty refers to an event’s\
    \ lack of confidence or \ncertainty, e.g., information occurred from unreliable\
    \ \nsources. Several strategies, such as the probability-\nbased model or fuzzy\
    \ logic, discussed in “Potential AI \ntechniques” allow for the processing of\
    \ uncertain and \nimprecise knowledge while also providing a sophisti-\ncated\
    \ reasoning framework. The ability of AI to iden-\ntify and handle uncertainty\
    \ and risk is essential for \napplying AI to decision-making challenges. Thus,\
    \ the \nquestion is “How to manage uncertainty in AI-enabled \ndecision-making\
    \ applications”.\n• With the widespread availability of various IoT ser-\nvices,\
    \ Internet of things (IoT) devices are becoming \nmore common in mobile networks.\
    \ It is essential \nnowadays to have a lightweight solution that promises \nhigh-performing\
    \ artificial intelligence applications for \nmobile and IoT devices. Thus, the\
    \ question is “How \nto design AI-enabled lightweight model for intelligent \n\
    decision-making through IoT and mobile devices”.\nTo summarize, AI is a relatively\
    \ open topic to which aca-\ndemics can contribute by inventing new methods or\
    \ refin-\ning existing methods to address the issues raised above and \nsolve\
    \ real-world problems in a range of application areas. \nAI will be employed in\
    \ any context where large amounts \nof data are needed to be handled fast and\
    \ accurately, and \ncost savings are required. AI will affect the planet more\
    \ \nthan anything else in human history. One important thing \nis that AI-powered\
    \ automation does not pose a threat to \njobs in the workplace for individuals,\
    \ businesses, or coun-\ntries with the appropriate skills. AI-certified professionals\
    \ \nhave access to a wide range of job prospects. AI Engineer, \nArtificial Intelligence\
    \ Programmer, AI System Developer, \nData Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer,\
    \ Data Analyst, \nAI Architect, Deep Learning Engineer, AI Software Engi-\nneer,\
    \ and many other employment opportunities are avail-\nable to these professionals.\n\
    Overall, AI technologies are driving a new wave of \neconomic progress, resolving\
    \ some of the world’s most \nchallenging issues and delivering solutions to some\
    \ of \nhumanity’s most significant challenges. Many industries, \nincluding information\
    \ technology, telecommunications, \ntransportation, traffic management, health\
    \ care, education, \ncriminal justice, defense, banking, and agriculture, have\
    \ \nthe potential to be transformed by artificial intelligence. \nWithout compromising\
    \ the significant characteristics that \nidentify mankind, we can assure that\
    \ AI systems are delib-\nerate, intelligent, and flexible with adequate security.\
    \ Gov-\nernments and decision-makers of a country need to focus \npublic policies\
    \ that promote AI innovation while minimiz-\ning unexpected societal consequences\
    \ to realize its full \npotential in real-world scenarios.\nConcluding Remarks\n\
    In this article, we have provided a comprehensive view of \nAI-based modeling\
    \ which is considered a key component \nof the fourth industrial revolution (Industry\
    \ 4.0). It begins \nwith research motivation and proceeds to AI techniques and\
    \ \nbreakthroughs in many application domains. Then in numer-\nous dimensions,\
    \ the important techniques in this area are \nexplored. We take into account ten\
    \ categories of popular \nAI techniques in this thorough analysis, including machine\

    \ depending on current \ndemands. In terms of machine intelligence, complex learn-\n\
    ing algorithms should be trained using data and knowledge \nfrom the target application\

    \ the scope of \nour study. This can also aid researchers in conducting more \n\
    in-depth analyses, resulting in a more reliable and realistic \noutcome. Overall,\
    \ we feel that our study and discussion on \nAI-based modeling points in the right\

    \ are faced when formulating hydrological processes, including that of\nevapotranspiration\
    \ (ET). Conventional empirical methods for formulating these possess some\nshortcomings.\
    \ The artiﬁcial intelligence approach emerges as the best possible solution to\
    \ map the\nrelationships between climatic parameters and ET, even with limited\
    \ knowledge of the interactions\nbetween variables. This review presents the state-of-the-art\
    \ application of artiﬁcial intelligence\nmodels in ET estimation, along with diﬀerent\
    \ types and sources of data. This paper discovers\nthe most signiﬁcant climatic\
    \ parameters for diﬀerent climate patterns. The characteristics of the\nbasic\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence models are also explored in this review. To overcome\
    \ the pitfalls of the\nindividual models, hybrid models which use techniques such\
    \ as data fusion and ensemble modeling,\ndata decomposition as well as remote\
    \ sensing-based hybridization, are introduced. In particular,\nthe principles\
    \ and applications of the hybridization techniques, as well as their combinations\
    \ with\nbasic models, are explained. The review covers most of the related and\
    \ excellent papers published\nfrom 2011 to 2019 to keep its relevancy in terms\
    \ of time frame and ﬁeld of study. Guidelines for the\nfuture prospects of ET\
    \ estimation in research are advocated. It is anticipated that such work could\n\
    contribute to the development of agriculture-based economy.\nKeywords: hydrological\

    \ reported that world population had reached 7.7 billion. In the same\nreport,\
    \ it was predicted that the world population would continue to grow, and the forecasted\
    \ ﬁgures\nare 8.5 billion, 9.7 billion and 10.9 billion for the years 2030, 2050,\
    \ and 2100, respectively. Consequently,\nagricultural activity that contributes\
    \ to the population food supply increases progressively and\nbecoming more important.\
    \ Agricultural activity is regarded as the anthropic activity that depletes\n\
    the highest amount of water [2]. Therefore, a good estimation of the water cycle\
    \ can assist in eﬃcient\nagricultural planning, water catchment and irrigation\
    \ strategy, and thus optimize the utilization of\nwater. Evapotranspiration (ET),\
    \ as suggested by the term itself, is the combination of evaporation of\nwater\
    \ from land and plant surfaces and transpiration from vegetation through the leaves’\
    \ stomata [3].\nET is a natural event that aﬀects the hydrological cycle, which\
    \ is believed to be highly complex\nthat involves several nonlinear processes\
    \ [4]. There are numerous factors that govern the rate of\nevapotranspiration\
    \ and these include temperature, solar radiation, air humidity, and wind speed\
    \ [5].\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 101; doi:10.3390/agronomy10010101\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/agronomy\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 101\n2 of 33\nET is classiﬁed as a physical phenomenon. Hence,\
    \ the rate of ET can be measured and represented\nby a numerical value.\nTraditionally,\
    \ lysimeters are used to measure ET directly without any\nassumptions [6]. It\
    \ works by measuring the rate of water percolation through soil on the basis\n\
    of mass transfer [7]. Non-weighable lysimeters are normally used for long-term\
    \ observation, whereas\nweighable lysimeters can provide readings with greater\
    \ temporal resolution [8]. It was claimed that\nlysimeters could provide the most\
    \ accurate measurement of ET. In fact, several studies that involved\nET estimation\
    \ in the early years, utilized readings of lysimeters as their calibration standards\
    \ [9,10].\nUnfortunately, the construction, maintenance, and use of lysimeters\
    \ involve high ﬁnancial burden\nand ecological footprints. The limited amount\
    \ of lysimeters also hindered the measurement of ET at\ndistinct locations [3].\
    \ In view of such situation, the development of other more convenient estimation\n\
    tools to estimate ET with higher accuracy and lower cost becomes the mode of choice.\n\
    Before the age of artiﬁcial intelligence, empirical equations were constantly\
    \ developed to cater the\nneed of accurately estimating ET. However, in the absence\
    \ of point measurement, direct acquisition of\nET value is virtually impossible.\
    \ According to Pereira et al. [11], the term of reference evapotranspiration\n\
    (ET0) was introduced to overcome the problem. ET0 is an estimate of the amount\
    \ of water loss or\nconsumption based on the weather primary eﬀect. In the coeﬃcient-reference\
    \ system, a crop coeﬃcient\n(Kc) will be multiplied with the ET0 to obtain the\
    \ potential evapotranspiration (PET) for that particular\ngrowth period.\nOver\
    \ the years, numerous eﬀorts had been pursued to obtain ET0 to the extent of higher\n\
    accuracy with lower computational complexity. Among the vast number of conventional\
    \ models\nfor ET0 estimation, some of the most notable empirical approaches are\
    \ discussed in this review.\nThe Penman–Monteith (PM) model [12], which had its\
    \ early beginnings in 1948, is regarded as one of\nthe most widely employed models\
    \ in the estimation of ET0. Furthermore, the Food and Agriculture\nOrganisation\
    \ (FAO) of the United Nations, in their publication “Crop evapotranspiration—Guidelines\n\
    for computing crop water requirements—FAO Irrigation and Drainage Paper 56” (FAO56\
    \ in short),\nhad followed up and revised the calculation of ET0 and PET based\
    \ on the PM model [13]. This indirectly\nmade the PM model as a standard in estimating\
    \ ET0, and it was used in a number of research works as\na standard for comparison\
    \ [14–16]. However, the sheer number of parameters and the complexity of\ntheir\
    \ investigation, derivation, and calculation do put paid to its use in a world\
    \ of increasing knowledge\nadvancement and digital advance.\nEver since,\nthe\
    \ eﬀort of providing simpler solution than the PM model continued.\nThe Hargreaves–Samani\
    \ (HS) model is another method to estimate ET0, which was proposed by\nHargreaves\
    \ and Samani [17]. The HS model had been employed in various occasions to estimate\n\
    ET0. However, the constants and coeﬃcients involved in the HS model can be site-speciﬁc.\
    \ Hence,\neﬀorts were also done to calibrate the coeﬃcients in HS model to suit\
    \ local needs and this can be\nlaborious. Luo et al. [18] validated the utilization\
    \ of calibrated the HS model in Guilin, Kaifeng, Ganyu,\nand Yinchuan to predict\
    \ ET0 by using forecasted temperature. The results showed that, although\nthe\
    \ prediction accuracy was suﬃciently high (87.54% to 96.90%), when the ET0 is\
    \ relatively high or\nrelatively low, the Hargreaves model would fail as it did\
    \ not consider the eﬀects of wind speed and\nrelative humidity. In Veneto, Italy\
    \ (sub-humid climate), a study was done to compare the performance\nof calibrated\
    \ and uncalibrated the HS model [19]. It was found that the standard HS model\
    \ would\noverestimate ET0 value, which led to the tendency of excess water requirements.\
    \ Calibrating the\nempirical parameters of the HS model successfully reduced the\
    \ overestimation from 18.9% to 2.6%\nthus justiﬁed the importance of calibration.\n\
    The Priestly–Taylor (PT) Model was proposed by Priestley and Taylor [20]. Similar\
    \ to the HS\nmodel, the PT model instead ignores the sensitivity of ET0 towards\
    \ vapor pressure and air movement.\nOn top of that, the PT model even further\
    \ simpliﬁed the PM model where temperature parameters are\nalso removed. Due to\
    \ the nature of the model that neglects the eﬀect of temperature, the PT model\
    \ tends\nto underestimate ET0 when compared to the PM model [21]. This suggestion\
    \ was further supported\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 101\n3 of 33\nby the poor performance\
    \ of PT model at dry climate regions. Moreover, the missing aerodynamic\ncomponent\
    \ in the PT model also limited its spatial applicability.\nApart from the three\
    \ models discussed previously, there are some other less popular models to\nestimate\
    \ ET0. These include the radiation-based Turc model [22] and temperature-based\
    \ Thornthwaite\nmodel [23]. They are seldom used as a standard for comparison\
    \ unlike the previous three models.\nAs shown in the literature, conventional\
    \ models of ET0 estimation generally have two main\nshortcomings: highly data\
    \ intensive and strongly dependent on geographical location or not spatially\n\
    robust [24,25]. Researchers attempted to solve these problems by modifying or\
    \ calibrating available\nmodels to suit their needs. In addition, researchers\
    \ also tried to produce a more powerful prediction\ntool that can handle highly\
    \ complex and nonlinear processes like ET. This review provides an outlook\non\
    \ the emerging prediction tool, which is the artiﬁcial intelligence model.\nThe\
    \ “black-box” nature of artiﬁcial intelligence model makes it very useful to map\
    \ the relationship\nbetween inputs and outputs even in the absence of relevant\
    \ scientiﬁc knowledge. This leads to its\napplication in ET estimation in order\
    \ to replace the data intensive and relatively less adaptive empirical\nmodels.\
    \ Increasing popularity of artiﬁcial intelligence application in ET estimation\
    \ can be seen in\nFigure 1, which is concluded from Scopus. From 2011 to 2015,\
    \ the number of publications related to\nET prediction using artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ model appears to be quite stagnant. However, from 2016\nonwards (except for\
    \ 2017), there is a steady increase in the number of publications especially in\
    \ 2018\nand 2019. This shows the wide acceptance of such technique by global researchers\
    \ that aﬃrms the\nusefulness of artiﬁcial intelligence modeling. Having that said,\
    \ there are certain ﬂaws that exist in\nthe basic artiﬁcial intelligence models.\

    data and the remote sensing data [38]. In essence, these two types of datasets\
    \ act as complimentary\ndata to one another. To obtain ground observation data,\
    \ meteorological and weather stations are set up\nfor continuous collections.\
    \ FLUXNET, which consists of micrometeorological tower sites, was set up\nas an\
    \ initiative to cope with the large demand of ground observation data. The micrometeorological\n\
    tower sites are mostly concentrated in North America, Europe and Asia, whilst\
    \ some tower sites are\nalso available in South America, Oceania, and Africa regions.\
    \ Various types of data could be obtained\nfrom the FLUXNET database, including\
    \ diﬀerent locations, durations, and time scales. It was claimed\nthat FLUXNET\
    \ would continue its eﬀort to expand in order to increase the geographical coverage\
    \ [39].\nThe main advantage of using ground observation data is that it provides\
    \ direct measurement, which\ndoes not need further imputation or processing in\
    \ order to retrieve the intrinsic information. Explicitly,\nthe data acquired\
    \ from weather stations or ﬂux towers are ready to be used without any pre-processing\n\
    steps. However, measurements of weather station only represent the conditions\
    \ of the tower’s location\nand its close proximity. In other words, deduction\
    \ of the weather conditions for a larger region can be\na challenging task [40].\n\
    Remote sensing emerges as a solution to cover the problem stated. This can be\
    \ realized by\neither subtracting the sensible heat ﬂux from net radiation (residual\
    \ method) or computing the\nsurface resistance with a vegetation index–surface\
    \ temperature scatterplot [41]. Successful estimation\nof ET from satellite images\
    \ opened the door for its forecasting using artiﬁcial intelligence models.\nThe\
    \ major sources of satellite images could be obtained from Landsat, Moderate Resolution\
    \ Imaging\nSpectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS).\
    \ Remote sensing data allow\nfor more information to be captured by satellite\
    \ images. In fact, the remote sensing method can be\nused to derive vegetation\
    \ information as well as diﬀerent types of radiation, which are useful for ET\n\
    estimation. Nonetheless, estimation using remote sensing data has to be well calibrated\
    \ in order to\nreﬂect accurate readings. This can be done through the integration\
    \ of land data assimilation system\n(LDAS). LDAS forces land surface models with\
    \ the observed ﬁelds and removes biases in forcing\nbased on atmospheric models.\
    \ In this way, unrealistic model states can be corrected. By merging\nmeasurements\
    \ (from satellite and ground observations) with model estimations, imperfections\
    \ in\nobservations and errors in model prediction can be minimized [42]. Table\
    \ 2 summarizes the types\nof data for ET estimation and their sources, along with\
    \ the obtainable parameters, advantages,\nand disadvantages.\nCareful selection\
    \ of data is important for an excellent model training process. Identiﬁcation\
    \ and\ndetermination of data sources, parameters, and data points are keys to\
    \ developing an outstanding\nartiﬁcial intelligence model. Hence, prior to model\
    \ selection, one should always ﬁrst consider the data\navailable. In the next\
    \ section, this review will lead the readers to discover some of the more common\n\

    3. Artiﬁcial Intelligence Models\n3.1. Artiﬁcial Neural Network (ANN)\nArtiﬁcial\
    \ neural network (ANN), as suggested by the name, is a variation of the machine\
    \ learning\nmodel that resembles the neural network of human brain. In the latter,\
    \ neurons are connected to each\nother via synapses. In ANN, synapses are replaced\
    \ by weights and biases connections. This helps to\nmap the relationship between\
    \ inputs and outputs [43]. A Multilayer perceptron (MLP) is one of the\nearliest\
    \ types of ANN, and it was introduced by Rosenblatt [44]. However, it was not\
    \ until the year\n1989 that MLP was proven to be able to approximate functions\
    \ after training [45]. In 1992, in tandem\nwith the advancement of computer development,\
    \ the MLP showed better performance than traditional\nstatistical method for the\
    \ ﬁrst time [46].\nThe application of the MLP in estimation of ET0 was initiated\
    \ by Kumar et al. [47]. In the\nstudy, the authors collected the six essential\
    \ parameters for estimating ET0 using the PM model in\nDavis, California. This\
    \ set of data was dated from 1 January 1990 to 30 June 2000. At the same time,\n\
    a second set of data dated from 1 January 1960 to 31 December 1963 was obtained\
    \ together with their\ncorresponding lysimeter readings. The authors intended\
    \ to compare the performance of the MLP\nwith diﬀerent architecture trained with\
    \ diﬀerent target data. The outcome of the study showed that,\nwhen all the six\
    \ parameters were fed as input of the MLP model, a single layer of seven hidden\
    \ neurons\nwith 5000 learning cycles was ample to represent the nonlinear process\
    \ of ET. The training of the model\nusing lysimeter measurement as target produced\
    \ slightly more accurate estimations than using the\nPM model. This not only justiﬁed\
    \ the ability of the MLP to map inputs to output in the absence of\nclear relationship,\
    \ but also at the same time laid down a foundation that estimation of the PM model\
    \ is\nsuﬃciently good to be used as a target for the model training.\nThe success\
    \ achieved by Kumar et al. [47] attracted the attention of researchers to further\
    \ study\nthe capability of the MLP in estimating ET0. Attempts to reduce the number\
    \ of required parameters\nwere continuously done. Rahimikhoob [48] trained the\
    \ MLP with only temperature and radiation data\nin eight diﬀerent stations in\
    \ southern coast of Caspian Sea located in northern Iran (humid subtropical\n\
    climate). By using only maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and global radiation,\
    \ the trained\nmodels were compared with the HS model and the calibrated HS model.\
    \ The authors had wished to\nmake a comparison between the MLP and empirical models\
    \ with limited climatic data (both were\ntemperature and radiation based). The\
    \ study proved that, even in the case where climatic dataset\nwas incomplete,\
    \ the prediction of the MLP model was still promising, as the lack of ﬂexibility\
    \ in\nthe empirical model had the tendency of either underestimating or overestimating.\
    \ Antonopoulos\nand Antonopoulos [49] conducted their study in a mountainous area\
    \ in West Macedonia of Greece.\nThe authors continuously removed variables one\
    \ by one from the MLP model in order to investigate\nthe ability of the MLP in\
    \ estimating ET0 with limited climatic parameters. The performance of the MLP\n\
    contrasted with that of the PT model, the Makkink model, and the HS model. The\
    \ study showed that,\neven in the case of two parameters (temperature and radiation),\
    \ the MLP still outperformed Makkink\nmodel and HS model while having comparable\
    \ performance with the PT model. Some other studies\nreported by other literature\
    \ also showed that the MLP could give better estimation than equivalent\nconventional\
    \ empirical models in the case of limited climatic parameters, in the four main\
    \ classes of\nclimate regions such as semi-arid [50,51], arid [31,52,53], humid,\
    \ and semi humid regions [54].\nThe introduction of the MLP had also encouraged\
    \ the establishment of other forms of the\nANN model. Some of the examples are\
    \ the radial basis function network (RBF) [55], generalized\nregression neural\
    \ network (GRNN) [56], back-propagation neural network (BPNN) [45] and extreme\n\
    learning machine (ELM) [57]. These algorithms achieved promising performances\
    \ in ET0 estimation.\nThe characteristics of each ANN model are provided in Table\

    \ their study, meteorological data were collected from the\nAgronomy 2020, 10,\
    \ 101\n10 of 33\nSudano-Sahelian zone. The HS model, which is a temperature based\
    \ empirical model, was compared\nto BPNN model that was trained with only temperature\
    \ data. The results showed that the artiﬁcial\nintelligence model outperformed\
    \ the conventional HS model. On top of that, the authors also revealed\nthat inclusion\
    \ of wind speed data could eﬀectively enhance the accuracy as compared to radiation\n\
    and relative humidity. Other research works related to the BPNN included comparison\
    \ of BPNN\nwith gene programming in arid region [62], comparison with tree models\
    \ [63], and reduction of input\nparameters [48].\nThe latest development of artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence models resulted in the introduction of the ELM as\nan option of\
    \ ANN. In 2015, this variation of ANN was ﬁrst used to estimate ET0 in Iraq where\
    \ the\nauthors claimed that this region represented general atmospheric and geographical\
    \ conditions [30].\nSimilar to most of the available literature, the authors trained\
    \ their ELM model by using the PM model\nestimation as target. Several diﬀerent\
    \ combinations of input parameters that consisted of temperature,\nwind speed,\
    \ relative humidity, and radiation were tested to study the most favorable combination.\n\
    Although the ELM and the BPNN showed comparable results, the authors opined that\
    \ the ELM was\npreferable due to its eﬃcient computation and great generalization\
    \ ability. The fast iteration of ELM is\ndue to the fact that only the number\
    \ of hidden layer nodes have to be tuned and this in turn reduces\nthe risk of\
    \ overﬁtting. Their work was followed up by Gocic et al. [64], where they trained\
    \ the ELM\nusing empirical models with lesser input parameters. In their study,\
    \ it was found that the ELM trained\nwith the HS model was more superior to those\
    \ that were trained with the PT model and the Turc model.\nWith that being said,\
    \ the diﬀerence between individual the ELM models were marginal. In comparison\n\
    with the PM model estimated ET0, the ELM predictions had good correlation which\
    \ justiﬁed that the\nELM were feasible for such purpose. Subsequently, another\
    \ study was also carried out to reduce the\nrequired input for ELM training [65].\n\
    Besides reducing the number of parameters required, researchers were also working\
    \ towards\nidentifying the optimum training algorithm of the ANN for ET0 prediction\
    \ [28]. The study compared\nsix learning algorithms of MLP, namely the Levenberg–Marquardt,\
    \ Delta–Bar–Delta, Step, Momentum,\nConjugateGradient and the QuickProp. For each\
    \ algorithm, diﬀerent combinations of input parameters\nwere tested.\nAt the same\
    \ time, diﬀerent activation functions such as the hyperbolic tangent,\nsigmoid,\
    \ and linear functions. The investigation revealed that irrespective of input\
    \ parameters,\nthe Levenberg–Marquardt learning algorithm coupled with hyperbolic\
    \ tangent function was the\noptimum setting for ET0 estimation using the MLP.\
    \ The major distinction of the Levenberg-Marquardt\nalgorithm is that it includes\
    \ the Gauss–Newton algorithm in its iterative process, which would lead\nto the\
    \ search of global minimum, unlike the other algorithms which have higher risk\
    \ to converge to\nlocal minima.\nRecently, the investigations related to the ANN\
    \ prediction of ET were focused on speciﬁc case\nstudies. Instead of estimating\
    \ ET0, researchers began to utilize the MLP to predict PET directly. Since\nPET\
    \ relies heavily on the types of crops (diﬀerent Kc), this resulted in the study\
    \ to be very speciﬁc\nin terms of regions and plantations. For instance, Hashemi\
    \ and Sepaskhah [66] obtained lysimeter\nreadings from Kooshak Agricultural Research\
    \ Station in southwest of Iran. They compared the\nperformance of the MLP with\
    \ the PM model and the radial basis function (RBF) model to estimate\nPET at a\
    \ barley plantation. By only feeding sunshine hours, mean humidity, mean temperature,\n\
    and wind speed as input, both the MLP and the RBF achieved better performance\
    \ than the PM\nmodel. This breakthrough reduced the need of collecting data for\
    \ Kc computation which could be\ntedious. Similar work was also carried out on\
    \ wheat and maize plantations, which demonstrated the\nadvantages of MLP over\
    \ conventional methods [67]. However, such studies required lysimeter reading\n\
    and perhaps leaf area index for training purposes. These data are not widely or\
    \ easily available and\nthus suﬃce to say that it would aﬀect the premise of utilizing\
    \ the ANN in forecasting PET directly\nfor plantations.\nAn assessment of the\
    \ various papers that have been reviewed in this subsection reveals\nthe following:\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 101\n11 of 33\n1.\nThe evolution of the ANN from the MLP to\
    \ the ELM was due to the constant need of improving\ntraining methods and algorithms\
    \ in order to obtain eﬀective predictions with greater accuracy,\nbetter generalization\
    \ and lesser dependency on input parameters.\n2.\nWithin each and every variation\
    \ of the ANN model, one could safely and easily deduce that the\ntrend and focus\
    \ of study would not deviate much from the following four aspects:\na.\nMinimization\
    \ of required input parameters,\nb.\nGeneralization of the ANN for wider spatial\

    \ of the SVM in predicting ET0 with ground observation data started as early as\
    \ \n2010 [72]. The case study was done in California, which represented a Köppen–Geiger\
    \ climate system. \nThe predictions of the SVM were compared with the CIMIS Penman,\
    \ HS model, Ritchie model, and \nthe Turc model. The authors discovered that when\
    \ all climatic parameters were available, the SVM \noutperformed all other models\
    \ in all the stations studied. When wind speed and relative humidity \nwere removed\
    \ during the training of the SVM, the model underestimated ET0 but still had satisfying\
    \ \noutcomes, whereby it only performed slightly worse than conventional the HS\
    \ model. In fact, the \nauthors also claimed that the SVM had better performance\
    \ than the ANN, where the former incurred \nlower error and higher correlation\
    \ with the standard PM model. \nAs stated earlier, the performance of the SVM\
    \ greatly relies on the type of kernel functions \nchosen to transform the datasets\
    \ before plotting them into the feature space. Selection of kernel \nfunctions\
    \ can be done using a trial-and-error method. Mehdizadeh et al. [73] did a comprehensive\
    \ \nstudy to compare the performance of the SVM using the RBF and polynomial kernel\
    \ functions. The \nstudy revealed that the RBF kernel function could obtain more\
    \ accurate results, but did not provide \nfurther explanation. A simple deduction\
    \ that can be made is that the RBF function which represents \na Gaussian distribution\
    \ can be fitted well to the ET problem and datasets of the particular study. This\
    \ \nsuggestion is supported by the results of Mohammadrezapour et al. [74], where\
    \ they showed that \nselection of kernel functions to estimate ET0 varied from\
    \ case to case. In other words, there is no \nuniversal kernel function that is\
    \ suited for all problems. Researchers who wished to estimate ET using \nthe SVM\
    \ should be prepared to include a tuning stage in order to identify suitable kernel\
    \ functions. \nContinuous efforts were done to study the limit of the SVM as well\
    \ as comparing the SVM to \nother artificial intelligence models. While the pioneers\
    \ that applied the SVM in estimating ET0 \nreported that the SVM performed better\
    \ than ANN, some other literature opined otherwise [75,76]. \nThis is due to the\
    \ nature of the SVM where a global optimum has to be located instead of converging\

    \ it would incur higher \nresiduals. More often, the strengths of the SVM would\
    \ be visualized in the case of limited climatic \nparameters. In a work done by\
    \ Fan et al. [77], when only temperature and radiation data were \navailable,\
    \ the performance of the SVM could be on par with the ELM. In fact, in terms of\
    \ accuracy \nand correlation, the SVM achieved better score than most of the hybrid\

    \ ground observation data started as early\nas 2010 [72]. The case study was done\
    \ in California, which represented a Köppen–Geiger climate\nsystem. The predictions\
    \ of the SVM were compared with the CIMIS Penman, HS model, Ritchie\nmodel, and\
    \ the Turc model. The authors discovered that when all climatic parameters were\
    \ available,\nthe SVM outperformed all other models in all the stations studied.\
    \ When wind speed and relative\nhumidity were removed during the training of the\
    \ SVM, the model underestimated ET0 but still\nhad satisfying outcomes, whereby\
    \ it only performed slightly worse than conventional the HS model.\nIn fact, the\
    \ authors also claimed that the SVM had better performance than the ANN, where\
    \ the former\nincurred lower error and higher correlation with the standard PM\
    \ model.\nAs stated earlier, the performance of the SVM greatly relies on the\
    \ type of kernel functions chosen\nto transform the datasets before plotting them\
    \ into the feature space. Selection of kernel functions can\nbe done using a trial-and-error\
    \ method. Mehdizadeh et al. [73] did a comprehensive study to compare\nthe performance\
    \ of the SVM using the RBF and polynomial kernel functions. The study revealed\
    \ that\nthe RBF kernel function could obtain more accurate results, but did not\
    \ provide further explanation.\nA simple deduction that can be made is that the\
    \ RBF function which represents a Gaussian distribution\ncan be ﬁtted well to\
    \ the ET problem and datasets of the particular study. This suggestion is supported\n\
    by the results of Mohammadrezapour et al. [74], where they showed that selection\
    \ of kernel functions\nto estimate ET0 varied from case to case. In other words,\
    \ there is no universal kernel function that is\nsuited for all problems. Researchers\
    \ who wished to estimate ET using the SVM should be prepared to\ninclude a tuning\
    \ stage in order to identify suitable kernel functions.\nContinuous eﬀorts were\
    \ done to study the limit of the SVM as well as comparing the SVM to other\nartiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence models. While the pioneers that applied the SVM in estimating ET0\
    \ reported that\nthe SVM performed better than ANN, some other literature opined\
    \ otherwise [75,76]. This is due to the\nnature of the SVM where a global optimum\
    \ has to be located instead of converging to local optima as\nin ANN. This makes\
    \ SVM a very generalizable model, but it would incur higher residuals. More often,\n\
    the strengths of the SVM would be visualized in the case of limited climatic parameters.\

    \ whereas ANN had better performance when sunshine hours were\nused. Similarly,\
    \ the performance of ANFIS and ANN could be aﬀected by geographical location [88].\n\
    However, some literature claimed that ANN had slightly better performance than\
    \ ANFIS, which could\nbe due to ANN’s ﬂexibility (not bound by any rules) [89,90].\n\
    One interesting study on the ANFIS model is the comparison between two methods\
    \ of setting up\na fuzzy rule, namely the grid partitioning method and subtractive\
    \ clustering method [91]. The former\ndivides input space in grid-like manner\
    \ and each region is fuzzy. For subtractive clustering, rules\nare set up based\
    \ on the number of clusters found in the input space. It was claimed that subtractive\n\
    clustering had computational advantage over grid partitioning. Investigation done\
    \ by Cobaner [91]\nshowed that both approaches had similar performances. However,\
    \ the ANFIS model using subtractive\nclustering method could be aﬀected by quality\
    \ of training data, especially when data are missing [92].\nThe review of publications\
    \ in this subsection revealed that, unlike nonlinear learning in ANN\nand kernel\
    \ tricks applied in SVM, fuzzy logic provides another way for a machine to learn\
    \ the rather\ncomplex phenomenon of evapotranspiration. The main advantage of\
    \ the fuzzy logic-based models\nover the ANN and the SVM is that it actually allows\
    \ for a more linguistic way of describing the data.\nIn other words, based on\
    \ the fuzzy rules and membership functions, one can more or less deduce the\n\
    relationship that maps the inputs to the outputs.\n3.4. Tree Based Models\nBreiman\
    \ [93] was the ﬁrst person to compile decision trees into two main categories,\
    \ which were\nthe classiﬁcation tree and regression tree. However, it was Quinlan\
    \ [94] who provided a better\nunderstanding on the operation of tree models. In\
    \ Quinlan’s work, it was stated that the decision\nwould continue to split and\
    \ grow as long as the data within the nodes of the trees were still considered\n\
    as impure. In the case of ET, using a tree model for regression analysis is favored\
    \ over classiﬁcation.\nWithin this context, Pal and Deswal [95] introduced a widely\
    \ accepted splitting criterion for the M5\ntree model. They claimed that, in order\
    \ to produce better splits with highest computation eﬃciency,\ndata within any\
    \ nodes should be split in such a way that the standard deviation reduction could\
    \ be\nmaximized. It was observed that the M5 tree model could produce high correlation\
    \ results to the\nET0 value, although the errors of estimations gradually increased\
    \ when input climatic parameters\nwere reduced.\nThere are several research works\
    \ published that followed up the study of Pal and Deswal [95].\nRahimikhoob et\
    \ al. [96] attempted to convert pan evaporation data in ET0 while using other\
    \ climatic\nparameters as complementary data. Subsequently, the performance of\
    \ M5 tree model in predicting ET0\nwas compared with the ANN [52]. The study was\
    \ done in Iran where wind speed and radiation data\nwere found to be absent. The\
    \ author concluded that, under such circumstances, the M5 tree model\ncould achieve\
    \ similar performance to the ANN. It was also suggested that the M5 tree model\
    \ should\nbe favored over the ANN due to its simplicity in terms of computation.\n\
    Elsewhere, Kisi and Kilic [97] also studied the diﬀerence in prediction performance\
    \ of the M5 tree\nmodel and ANN. In their concluding remarks, the authors revealed\
    \ that both the M5 tree model and\nANN could produce outstanding ET0 estimation\
    \ when trained and tested locally. This was however\nnot true when the machine\
    \ learning models were trained and tested at diﬀerent stations. The M5\ntree model\
    \ had the worst performance, especially where lesser climatic parameters were\
    \ available.\nIn fact, the performance of M5 tree model was worse than the empirical\
    \ models. However, in another\nstudy, the results showed disagreement where the\
    \ M5 tree model was claimed to be having better\nforecasting accuracy when trained\
    \ locally as well as using external data [98]. In other words, the M5\nAgronomy\
    \ 2020, 10, 101\n15 of 33\ntree model could be very dependent on the quality of\
    \ training data to determine its spatial robustness\nand generalisability.\nAccording\
    \ to the papers reviewed regarding to tree-based modeling, it is clear to us that\
    \ tree-based\nmodels exhibit a clear advantage of simple and fast computation.\
    \ In spite of that, the pitfall of such\na model is also obvious. As the tree\
    \ in the model would have to grow until there are no any other\npossible splits\
    \ (the data is deemed to be pure by then), there is a risk of overgrowing the\
    \ tree. In such\ncircumstance, overﬁtting could occur which is undesirable for\
    \ regression analysis. To overcome the\nproblem, a strategy known as pruning is\
    \ needed to remove unnecessary parts of the tree and replaced\nthem with linear\
    \ functions. Moreover, the sequence of tree’s splitting could end up with diﬀerent\n\
    results even though with the same set of training data. To compensate the eﬀect\
    \ of randomness,\ntrees are sometimes bundled to form a random forest. This will\
    \ be discussed in detail in later parts of\nthis review.\nBasic artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ models have their own advantages as well as disadvantages. The ANN\ncan be eﬃcient\
    \ in ﬁtting nonlinear relationship, but it is less explanatory and prone to overﬁt.\
    \ The SVM\nhas good generalizability at the expense of costly computation especially\
    \ for high dimensionality\nproblems. The fuzzy logic provides interpretable rules\
    \ but that would require initial set up with expert\nknowledge. The Tree models\
    \ are computationally eﬃcient, however, would incur high errors. Hence,\nusing\
    \ basic artiﬁcial intelligence models alone is insuﬃcient to accommodate the increasing\
    \ expectations\nof their performances. In the following next section, diﬀerent\
    \ hybridization techniques of artiﬁcial\nintelligence models are explored as an\
    \ eﬀective solution to overcome the problems encountered above.\n4. Hybrid Models\n\
    Hybrid modeling which combines two or more models may somehow improve model performance\n\
    by merging their individual strengths [99,100]. As demonstrated in the research\
    \ works mentioned\npreviously, researchers are ambitious for artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ models to be developed in the future\nthat can work in harsher conditions. For\
    \ example, in environments with limited climatic parameters,\nwide region of interest,\
    \ or longer prediction horizon, among others. Therefore, this section of review\n\
    will be focusing on uncovering some more commonly used techniques to develop hybrid\
    \ artiﬁcial\nintelligence models.\n4.1. Data Fusion and Ensemble Modelling\n4.1.1.\
    \ Averaging\nThe idea of ensemble modeling was suggested in 2005, where it was\
    \ used to forecast weather\nto overlay predictions of multiple models [101]. The\
    \ simplest possible ensemble model is by plainly\naveraging the product of the\
    \ members of the ensemble. Simple averaging obtains the mean of the\nmodels. In\
    \ such a way, all involved models will be treated as though they have equal performance.\n\
    In order to correct the absurdity in the assumption of simple averaging, some\
    \ studies preferred to\nuse weighted averaging. The weight values assigned to\
    \ the models are ranked based on certain\nperformance measure. For example, Nourani\
    \ et al. [33] proposed to use the coeﬃcient of determination\nas a ranking reference.\
    \ However, these two methods were not comprehensive enough to provide\naccurate\
    \ insights for individual models in an ensemble.\nTaylor [102] proposed an alternative\
    \ measure known as the simple Taylor skill. For each individual\nmodel, a Taylor\
    \ skill score will be assigned as the weight value. The Taylor skill score is\
    \ deemed\nto be more comprehensive as it takes correlation coeﬃcient and relative\
    \ standard deviation into\nconsideration. This approach is used by Yao et al.\
    \ [103], where it was proven that the ensemble model\nproduced from the simple\
    \ Taylor skill fusion could produce spatial estimation which was comparable\n\
    to the remote sensing technique. Nonetheless, the authors raised the concern that\
    \ the simple Taylor\nskill fusion lacks the ability to describe the ET phenomena\
    \ physically. This led to the rather low\npopularity of this method among researchers\
    \ worldwide.\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 101\n16 of 33\n4.1.2. Bootstrap Aggregating\n\
    One of the most common techniques to hybridize artiﬁcial intelligence models is\
    \ the data fusion\ntechnique (ensemble modeling). There are various strategies\
    \ that can lead to the desired output.\nThe ﬁrst method to be reviewed in the\
    \ bootstrap aggregating (bagging) method. Generally, bootstrap\naggregating involves\
    \ two main parts: resampling and aggregation. Bootstrap aggregating is especially\n\
    useful when one has a smaller sample size. During the stage of resampling, the\
    \ collected samples\nwill be treated as an “apparent population”. Bags of “samples”\
    \ will be produced from the “apparent\npopulation” by using resampling with replacement\
    \ method. The bags of “samples” will be having\nan equivalent size with its “apparent\
    \ population” [104]. Application of bootstrap aggregating in\nestimating ET0 is\
    \ common. Kim et al. [105] applied bootstrap aggregating on the GRNN to study\n\
    the performance of soft computing in forecasting ET0. The study showed that using\
    \ bootstrapping\nalone to solely extend the size of training data was insuﬃcient\
    \ to produce signiﬁcant improvement\nto the GRNN models. Instead, the authors\
    \ suggested training multiple models in order to obtain\ntheir aggregated output.\
    \ It was opined that the latter could eﬀectively reduce the generalization error.\n\
    This study was the pioneer of utilising bootstrap aggregating for improvement\
    \ of artiﬁcial intelligence\nmodels when calculating ET0.\nThe success of Kim\
    \ et al. [105] attracted the attention of global researchers to conduct similar\n\
    studies. Besides the GRNN, bootstrap aggregating can be applied on other machine\
    \ learning models\nsuch as tree models. In fact, performing the tree model analysis\
    \ using bootstrapped samples can\nlead to the formation of a random forest that\
    \ was mentioned in passing in the previous section.\nFeng et al. [59] reported\
    \ that the random forest model could perform better than the GRNN. In the\nstudy\
    \ of Granata [5], the author compared the results of bagged random forests with\
    \ individual\nregression tree models. However, this study reported another ﬁnding\
    \ which claimed that bagging\ndid not signiﬁcantly improve the performance of\
    \ single regression tree. Although the author did\nnot provide explanation to\
    \ his discovery, nonetheless, it is strongly believed that the contradictions\n\
    between the works of Kim et al. [105], Feng et al. [59], and Granata [5] originated\
    \ from diﬀerences in\nthe datasets. The former two opted to use monthly and annual\
    \ data respectively, whereas the latter\nwas using daily time step data. Bootstrap\
    \ aggregating is clearly providing positive eﬀects when the\nsample size is smaller.\n\
    The unique characteristics of bootstrap aggregating is that it does not only perform\
    \ data\npre-processing on the raw datasets.\nAt the same time, it oﬀers an algorithm\
    \ to aggregate and\naverage out the output of individual models. This is especially\
    \ useful as an approach to enlarge the\nlimited collected data while oﬀsetting\
    \ the bias and variance that was aroused from the randomness of\nmodel training.\n\
    4.1.3. Bayesian Modeling Approaches\nApart from averaging and bootstrap aggregating,\
    \ another very useful technique to create an\nensemble model is via the Bayesian\
    \ modeling approaches. The Bayesian modeling approaches utilizes\nthe Bayes rules\
    \ in statistical studies. There are two main strategies when applying the Bayesian\n\
    modeling approaches in modeling hydrological processes, namely the Bayesian model\
    \ selection and the\nBayesian model averaging [106]. Although both approaches\
    \ originated from the same fundamentals,\ntheir intuitions could still show remarkable\
    \ diﬀerences. In Bayesian model averaging (“team-of-rivals”\napproach), the main\
    \ theory underneath is that the model is convinced that there is a truth to be\
    \ told by\nmodels. However, the degree of correctness is strongly dependent on\
    \ the uncertainties incurred.\nBayesian model averaging works on the basis that\
    \ it considers truthfulness of the members in\nan ensemble as their weights. Explicitly,\
    \ this is realized through the computation of the posterior\nprobability of each\
    \ model [107]. In this way, the ensemble model would not take excessive risk to\n\
    exclude models that could be true as well. In the case when data and observations\
    \ are massive enough\nto conﬁdently deduce a conclusion, or when there is a particular\
    \ model that considered virtually able\nto be true, this model will be promoted\
    \ to Bayesian model selection (“winner-takes-all” approach).\nAgronomy 2020, 10,\
    \ 101\n17 of 33\nIn other words, Bayesian modeling approaches will keep updating\
    \ weight of models by imputing their\nposterior probabilities, until an exceptional\
    \ model emerges as a “winner” to end the search.\nBayesian modeling approaches\
    \ were widely used in ET0 estimation research. Zhu et al. [108]\nstudied the posterior\
    \ distributions of factors aﬀecting ET0 for diﬀerent periods, which varied in\n\
    terms of leaf area index. In a later study, Zhu et al. [109] produce an ET0 estimation\
    \ ensemble model\nwhich included the likes of the PM model, the advection-aridity\
    \ model, the Shuttleworth–Wallace\nmodel, and the modiﬁed PT model. The outcome\
    \ of the study proved that, as compared to the\nsimple averaging, the Bayesian\
    \ model averaging had more positive inﬂuences during the process of\ndeveloping\
    \ the ensemble model. The authors is of the opinion that the probability density\
    \ function\nproposed in the Bayesian theory was well suited to ET phenomena. Despite\
    \ its good performance,\nthe authors also stressed that output of the Bayesian\
    \ model averaging was strongly linked to the\nselection of input parameters.\n\
    Chen et al. [110] took a more aggressive approach whereby they used the Bayesian\
    \ model\naveraging to combine empirical and artiﬁcial intelligence models. The\
    \ research team suggested two\ndiﬀerent schemes to create the ensemble model.\
    \ The authors observed that including all models in the\nensemble would result\
    \ in poorer performance as the Bayesian model averaging assign some weights\n\
    to poor-performing models. In view of such circumstance, another ensemble was\
    \ created to include\nonly the models that were performing well. The hypothesis\
    \ of the authors was veriﬁed to be correct.\nThe usefulness of the Bayesian modeling\
    \ approaches has resulted in the introduction of various\nrelated algorithms such\
    \ as the Bayesian joint probability [111] and the Bayesian regression [112].\n\
    Bayesian regression was thought to be able to provide an insight to the selection\
    \ of input parameters as\nwell as their relationship to ET0. This could provide\
    \ a solution to policy makers to prioritize collection\nof data in the near future.\n\
    4.1.4. Boosting Algorithm\nBoosting is a technique whereby the prediction accuracy\
    \ is improved by compounding estimations\nof several weak learners [113]. Unlike\
    \ the Bayesian model averaging, the boosting algorithm works\nin a step-wise method,\
    \ where a learner is added at a time to minimize the loss function. In the\nboosting\
    \ algorithm, the ﬁrst learner will try to search for an optimum loss function\
    \ value. Subsequently,\nthe following models will be ﬁtted into the ensemble and\
    \ work on the residuals of their predecessors.\nOver the years, many versions\
    \ of boosting algorithms had been established, each with its own novel\ndistinction.\
    \ Some commonly known boosting methods include the gradient boosting [114], adaptive\n\
    boosting [115], extreme gradient boosting [116], and the categorical boosting\
    \ [117].\nIn recent years, the use of the boosting algorithm in estimating ET0\
    \ has emerged increasingly\npopular. Fan et al. [77], in particular, had provided\
    \ the comparison of two types of boosting algorithms\non tree models, namely gradient\
    \ boosting and extreme gradient boosting. The two algorithms diﬀer in\nthe sense\
    \ that the gradient boosting uses nodes of tree models as weak learners, whereas\
    \ the extreme\ngradient boosting uses set of trees as weak learners. The authors\
    \ found that„ generally, the extreme\ngradient boosting overpowered the gradient\
    \ boosting. This could be due to the fact that extreme\ngradient boosting combined\
    \ the averaged-out results of trees in set, which reduced the variance in the\n\
    output. On top of that, the design of extreme gradient boosting allows for parallel\
    \ computation, which\ncould reduce the time taken for analysis.\nPonraj and Vigneswaran\
    \ [118] proposed the use of the gradient boosting regression to estimate\nET0\
    \ at Borrego Springs, California. In the same study, the authors compared the\
    \ performance of\nthe gradient boosting regression with the conventional multiple\
    \ linear regression and random forest\nmethods. The results of the study showed\
    \ that the gradient boosting regression showed higher\ncorrelation with the standard\
    \ PM model. The authors also suggested the use of the gradient boosting\nmachine\
    \ as an alternative in future investigations.\nRecently, Fan et al. [119] used\
    \ another variation of the boosting algorithm, which was the light\ngradient boosting\
    \ algorithm to estimate ET0. The operating principle of the light gradient boosting\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 101\n18 of 33\nis that it integrates the essence of gradient\
    \ boosting and extreme gradient boosting. It performs\nleaf-wise optimization\
    \ instead of level-wise optimization. This could eﬀectively reduce the memory\n\
    and time taken for computation. However, as shown by the results, the light gradient\
    \ boosting machine\nrequired suﬃcient data in order to be trained well. During\
    \ the training stage, the performance of light\ngradient boosting machine was\
    \ generally weaker than the random forest as well as the M5 tree model.\nThe situation\
    \ was reversed during the testing phase where light gradient boosting machine\
    \ performed\nbetter when it was well trained.\nThe core of the boosting algorithm\
    \ is to assemble several weak learners to form a strong learner.\nBy doing so,\
    \ the strengths and experience of the weak learners can be utilized well by the\
    \ hybrid\nartiﬁcial intelligence model. Most important of all, the boosting algorithm\
    \ can be used as a strategy\nthat can reduce the risk of overﬁtting. Nevertheless,\
    \ the development of the boosting algorithm is still\nat the early stages and\
    \ more advanced methods shall be anticipated in the near future.\n4.1.5. Nonlinear\
    \ Neural Ensemble\nPreviously discussed data fusion techniques are developed based\
    \ on certain statistical logics.\nThere is a kind of data fusion technique that\
    \ depends on the black-box theory known as the nonlinear\nneural ensemble. To\
    \ summarize, outputs of individual artiﬁcial intelligence models are fed into\
    \ a\nsecondary neural network to be trained once more. In other words, an ANN\
    \ will be used to assemble\nindividual artiﬁcial intelligence models. This method\
    \ had been applied by Nourani et al. [33] through\nthe combined ANN, SVM, ANFIS,\
    \ and multiple linear regression. When compared with the simple\naveraging and\
    \ the weighted averaging, the nonlinear neural ensemble yielded better performance.\n\
    Similar observations were obtained when they used nonlinear neural ensemble to\
    \ combine empirical\nmodels. This proved that, for a highly nonlinear process\
    \ like ET, averaging might be insuﬃcient to\ncapture the complexity.\nIn another\
    \ study, the individual ANN was added one at a time to produce an ensemble [120].\n\
    The addition of ANN was continued until the termination condition was met (tolerable\
    \ error was\nachieved). In this way, the architecture and activation function\
    \ of individual ANN can be constantly\nmodiﬁed in order to be considered acceptable\
    \ into the ensemble. This approach was also used by\nEl-Shaﬁe et al. [121]. The\
    \ resulting ensemble model would be consisting of only excellent models,\nwhich\
    \ in turn led to the accurate prediction of seasonal ET0.\nThe nonlinear neural\
    \ ensemble is very useful in the scenario where statistical data fusion methods\n\
    could not produce improvements as compared to the original artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ models. It can\nhybridize the artiﬁcial intelligence models by mapping another\
    \ black-box relationship between inputs\nand outputs. However, the results would\
    \ be less interpretable as the intrinsic relationship within the\nblack box could\
    \ not be observed.\n4.1.6. Ensemble Models for Remote Sensing\nOne of the ﬁrst\
    \ attempt to use the machine learning model to estimate ET0 with remote sensing\n\
    data was done in the United States, where AmeriFlux sites were available [40].\
    \ In the study, land surface\ntemperature, enhanced vegetation index, shortwave\
    \ radiation, and land cover data are recovered from\nsatellite images that provided\
    \ 1 km by 1 km coverage and eight-day time step. The ET0 were estimated\nusing\
    \ the SVM, ANN and multiple regression. A similar approach was done by Zhang et\
    \ al. [122] in\nChina where they extended the application of remote sensing data\
    \ in the BPNN and the ANFIS for\nestimating ET0. Further studies were done to\
    \ include more artiﬁcial intelligence models such as the M5\ntree model, bagging,\
    \ random forest [5], ELM [123], and boosted tree [124]. However, the accuracy\
    \ of\nthese studies was constrained by the quality of the images for retrieving\
    \ the estimated meteorological\ndata. It was claimed that the images shall be\
    \ within microwave band whereas cloud free condition is\npreferred [125,126].\n\
    The major advantages of the remote sensing data over conventional ground observation\
    \ data\ninclude the wide selection of spatiotemporal range as stated earlier.\
    \ Furthermore, satellite images can\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 101\n19 of 33\nprovide\
    \ a massive variety of parameters to be used for ET0 estimation. As a result,\
    \ multiple models\ncan be used to train the artiﬁcial intelligence models such\
    \ as land surface model, energy balance (based\non eddy covariance and Bowen ratio)\
    \ and equations for ET0 predictions. In spite of its advantages,\nthe shortcoming\
    \ of remote sensing is that the estimation of ground data could be inaccurate.\
    \ Moreover,\nthe homogeneity of the satellite images could also aﬀect the process\
    \ of estimation. Hence, numerous\neﬀorts were done to apply data assimilation\
    \ techniques on ET0 estimation artiﬁcial intelligence models\nbased on remote\
    \ sensing data. This could be done by merging several satellite images that capture\n\
    diﬀerent information and feed them to the artiﬁcial intelligence models during\
    \ the training stage.\nThe spatial and temporal adaptive reﬂectance fusion model\
    \ (STARFM) is regarded as one of the\nmost commonly used data assimilation technique\
    \ when dealing with remote sensing data. The basic\nidea of the STARFM is that,\
    \ if a Landsat-MODIS image pair is available, the algorithm can calculate\nthe\
    \ systematic error on each pixel for MODIS image in order to retrieve a Landsat-like\
    \ image [127].\nHowever, this method assumes that both Landsat and MODIS images\
    \ observe the same amount of\nreﬂectance and incur by a constant bias error. Enhanced\
    \ STARFM (ESTARFM) was introduced later\nto overcome some problems of STARFM [128].\
    \ ESTARFM can handle heterogeneous regions unlike\nSTARFM method. In other words,\
    \ when the pixel resolutions of the satellite images are not uniform,\nESTARFM\
    \ would be favored over STARFM [129].\nThe operating principles of both the STARFM\
    \ and ESTARFM are similar. Available MODIS images\nare matched with Landsat images\
    \ of diﬀerent overpass dates. Optimum base pairs will be used for\ntraining the\
    \ model. Based on the given MODIS image, the two data fusion techniques will retrieve\n\
    a predicted Landsat image so that the computation of ET0 is made possible. Cammalleri\
    \ et al. [130]\nproposed to apply data fusion technique on remote sensing based\
    \ ET0 prediction so that images that\ncarry multiple information can be combined.\
    \ In their study, Landsat images (30 m spatial resolution,\n16-day temporal resolution)\
    \ and MODIS images (1 km spatial resolution, 1-day temporal resolution)\nwere\
    \ used to estimate ET0 using ALEXI and DisALEXI land surface models. By using\
    \ the STARFM,\nET0 can be estimated from both sets of data. Landsat based ET0\
    \ was compared with Landsat-MODIS\nbased ET0. It was found the latter had higher\
    \ accuracy, especially in the presence of discriminant\nfactors such as rainfall\
    \ events.\nA similar method was applied by Cammalleri et al. [131] to the ﬁeld\
    \ scale, where they studied the\nET0 of corn and cotton crops. Semmens et al.\
    \ [132] extended the application to viticulture system where\nLandsat, MODIS and\
    \ multi-sensor data were fused by the STARFM method. Recently, the ALEXI\nand\
    \ DisALEXI fused by STARFM was also used by Knipper et al. [126]. Their study\
    \ was built on\nthe basis of Semmens et al. [132] with the expansion of study\
    \ to multiple years in order to have an\ninsight of seasonal dynamics of ET0.\
    \ Ma et al. [133] deployed ESTARFM for ET0 estimation from\nsatellite imaging\
    \ for the ﬁrst time. They used three sets of MODIS data and two sets of Landsat\
    \ data\nwith dissimilar spatial and temporal resolutions. Instead of using the\
    \ ALEXI and DisALEXI models,\nthe surface energy balance system (SEBS) model was\
    \ used in the study to calculate ET0. The authors\nclaimed that their results\
    \ produced high resolution ET0 estimation with good accuracy. It was stated\n\
    that the estimated ET0 could produce similar trends with the observed ET0 with\
    \ slight underestimation.\nNevertheless, a direct comparison between STARFM and\
    \ ESTARFM has not been studied. Hence, it is\nbelievable that the upper hand of\
    \ ESTARFM is that it allows for inclusion of more satellite images with\ndiﬀerent\
    \ resolutions.\nBesides the STARFM and ESTARFM, another very popular data assimilation\
    \ technique used by\nresearchers worldwide is the Kalman based ensemble. The deﬁnition\
    \ of the observable model and state\nmodel are essential to use the Kalman algorithm.\
    \ Alavi et al. [134] demonstrated the usefulness of the\nKalman ﬁlter based ET0\
    \ estimation. To be exact, the work estimated missing heat ﬂux by treating as\
    \ a\nfunction of time and temperature which acted as observable models. The Kalman\
    \ ﬁlter-based algorithm\nwas compared with the conventional mean diurnal variation,\
    \ multiple regression, two-week average\nPT coeﬃcient, and the multiple imputation.\
    \ It was found that, although the Kalman ﬁlter-based\nalgorithm did not show outstanding\
    \ accuracy among the other methods, the slight diﬀerence provided\nAgronomy 2020,\
    \ 10, 101\n20 of 33\nbetter estimation of ET0, especially during short gap periods\
    \ with volatile ET0 ﬂuctuations where\nsensitivity was a decisive factor.\nEver\
    \ since then, the ensemble Kalman ﬁlter approach was widely used in estimating\
    \ ET0.\nFor instance, Peters-Lidard et al. [135] evaluated several data assimilation\
    \ systems that employed the\nKalman ﬁlter approach to predict the latent heat\
    \ ﬂux. The prediction was done using FLUXNET as\nwell as MODIS data as inputs.\
    \ It was reported that data assimilation was able to provide more accurate\nresults,\
    \ indicating wide data structure application of the ensemble Kalman ﬁlter. In\
    \ the Shahe River\nBasin of China, Yin et al. [136] assimilated a hydrological\
    \ model (data) with remote sensing-based\nevapotranspiration. The outcome of the\
    \ research work showed a promising potential of the ensemble\nKalman ﬁlter as\
    \ a predictor when the state model is available. The advantages of using the ensemble\n\
    Kalman ﬁlter are that it permits the realization of multisource data as well as\
    \ increases the precision\nof estimation by incorporating suitable models. However,\
    \ the determination of the observation and\nstate models can be challenging, and\
    \ this throws the spanner in the works for the popularity of the\nensemble Kalman\
    \ ﬁlter.\nUtilization of the remote sensing approach in estimating ET0 removes\
    \ the constraint of spatial\ncoverage. Satellite images of varying resolutions\
    \ can be processed to recover valuable information\nduring the prediction. The\
    \ remote sensing method also enables the provision of real-time data to\nbecome\
    \ possible and allows continuous monitoring of ET of certain regions. The development\
    \ of\ndata fusion algorithms successfully combines diﬀerent satellite images and\
    \ this in turn results in more\ninformation to be used in ET0 prediction. Despite\
    \ all these, the use of remote sensing is still at its early\nstage and hence\
    \ more robust as well as powerful tools can be expected in the near future.\n\
    4.2. Data Decomposition\nThe previous discussions are mainly focused on the exploitation\
    \ of historical data as ingredients\nfor creating an estimating model. However,\
    \ temporal trends and variations of ET are of utmost\nimportance as they can be\
    \ a predictive tool to assist the decision-making of the stakeholders. Therefore,\n\
    a good artiﬁcial intelligence model shall be able to provide such information.\
    \ Data related to ET could\nbe highly dynamic and contain unnecessary noises.\
    \ Decomposition of data is needed to ﬁlter out the\nnoises in order to retrieve\
    \ useful information.\nAccording to Partal [137], the wavelet transformation had\
    \ been successfully applied in many\nhydrological processes research. In fact,\
    \ a combination of ANN with wavelet transformation was\nproved to be feasible\
    \ in many other studies. Therefore, Partal [137] attempted to perform wavelet\n\
    transformation of data series of several climate data using diﬀerent temporal\
    \ resolutions to obtain\nuseful decompositions. Theses sub-series were reconstructed\
    \ and then be fed into the BPNN, multiple\nlinear regression and HS model. The\
    \ resultant wavelet neural network (WNN) had better performance\nthan the other\
    \ two models and proved that the wavelet-transformed data were useful to retain\
    \ only\nuseful information as well as trends. The application of wavelet transformation\
    \ is not constrained\nto only BPNN, but is also applied in other ANNs such as\
    \ RBF [138], ELM [29], GRNN [139,140],\nand ANFIS [141].\nCobaner [142] converted\
    \ Class A pan evaporation data into ET0 by using wavelet decomposition.\nThe study\
    \ only focused on the eﬀect of wavelet transformation; therefore, instead of using\
    \ an ANN,\nthe author selected a regression model for analysis. By using the Mallat\
    \ discrete wavelet transformation,\nthe complex time series was broken down into\
    \ several sub-time series that exhibited daily, monthly,\nand annual features\
    \ of the process. Each time series was weighted based on the strength of its\n\
    correlation. It was concluded that although the wavelet regression model had slightly\
    \ lower accuracy\nthan the standard FAO-24 model for pan evaporation conversion;\
    \ however, the drastic reduction of\nrequired parameters was suﬃciently proved\
    \ to be a success of this study.\nApart from the wavelet transformation, there\
    \ are also other variations of data decomposition.\nFor instance, Adarsh et al.\
    \ [143] used a multivariate empirical mode decomposition to pre-treat the raw\n\
    data (temperature, solar radiation, relative humidity and wind speed). In this\
    \ method, intrinsic mode\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 101\n21 of 33\nfunctions were generated\
    \ after the decomposition of the data using varying temporal scale. Using\nmultivariate\
    \ empirical mode decomposition on the data did not provide signiﬁcant improvement\
    \ on the\nobtained predictions. Future investigations can be conducted to study\
    \ the eﬀect of such decomposition\nmethod when climatic parameters were scarce.\n\
    Misaghian et al. [144] provided another form of data decomposition a priori to\
    \ estimate ET0.\nThe ET0 data were represented in a multi-dimensional or tensor\
    \ vector space. By using the Tucker\ndecomposition (a variation of singular value\
    \ decomposition), the three-way relationship of month,\nyear and ET0 was unfolded.\n\
    The core tensor can be computed by the prediction machine and\nreconstructing\
    \ the predicted original tensor. The authors compared the values of ET0 computed\
    \ with\nthe empirical models with those generated by tensor decomposition prediction.\
    \ The predicted outcome\nof tensor decomposition model was close to the estimations\
    \ using the PM model, PT model, HS model,\nBlaney–Criddle model, and the Jensen–Haise\
    \ model.\nData decomposition oﬀers another perspective of the ET0 prediction whereby\
    \ future ET0 can be\nforecasted based on historical trends. In order to obtain\
    \ a clearer picture of how ET0 is behaving at\ndiﬀerent time scales, data decomposition\
    \ could do the work by ﬁltering noise and generate proﬁles\nof ET0 trends to be\
    \ analyzed by artiﬁcial intelligence models.\nData decomposition works as a\n\
    pre-processing technique that serves to reduce redundant data to the artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence model in\norder to produce more meaningful and useful estimations.\n\
    Figure 6 outlines the pathways to develop hybrid models using diﬀerent modeling\
    \ approaches.\nIn addition, in Table 4, an overview of diﬀerent hybridization\
    \ methods is provided. The variations\nof hybridization models are discussed in\
    \ details in terms of their background principles and\nsuitable applications.\n\

    Shifting from conventional empirical models to artiﬁcial intelligence models for\
    \ ET estimation\nshould be regarded as an indubitable trend. This is in line with\
    \ the introduction of the Fourth\nIndustrial Revolution where artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ will take over non-value-added activities such as\nforecasting and estimation.\
    \ This would assist in the reduction of errors or mistakes when policy\nmakers\
    \ are making decisions based on highly precise, accurate, and eﬀective predictions.\
    \ In addition,\nit is inevitably important for researchers worldwide to seek for\
    \ solutions and reduce the number\nof meteorological parameters needed for ET\
    \ prediction for all its attendant costs and time savings\nand eﬃciency reasons.\
    \ The black-box operating nature of artiﬁcial intelligence models is currently\n\
    the solution to this problem. With that being said, ET data from ground observation\
    \ or physical\nmeasurement would still remain imperative during this transition\
    \ while a robust artiﬁcial intelligence\nmodel is being developed concurrently.\
    \ On the other hand, advancement in satellite technologies\nallows the use of\
    \ remote sensing in ET monitoring. In other words, this provides another form\
    \ of\ndata that would not have been collected from ground weather stations. Application\
    \ of remote sensing\ntechnology in ET estimation reduces the dependency of ET\
    \ estimation from ground observation data\nas it oﬀers a new basis to compute\
    \ ET. Nevertheless, ground observation data are still important in\norder to calibrate\
    \ raw satellite images for better prediction in coming years.\nIn short, the future\
    \ prospects of this ﬁeld of study can be summarized as follows:\n1.\nEﬀective\
    \ data assimilation.\nData fusion techniques shall be well utilized to accurately\
    \ map ground observation data to remote\nsensing data. This can make the satellite\
    \ images become more informative in terms of accuracy as well\nas temporal and\
    \ spatial resolutions, if well calibrated.\n2.\nCreation of new hybrid models.\n\
    This can be done by changing the combinations of currently available artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence models\nand hybridization techniques. Meanwhile, development of\
    \ new algorithms or enhancement of present\nalgorithms can be attempted in the\
    \ future. It is anticipated that the “committee of decision” formed\nfrom hybrid\
    \ models can produce predictions with greater accuracy and shorter computation\
    \ time.\n3.\nBe cautious of climate changes.\nArtiﬁcial intelligence models are\
    \ highly dependent on the training (historical) data. Volatile\nclimate poses\
    \ a serious challenge where past trends might not be applicable in the future.\
    \ Studies in the\ncoming years can be focused on retrieving information which\
    \ take climate changes into consideration.\nFor example, data selection and sampling\
    \ shall be done with care in order to ensure the homogeneity\nof the data where\
    \ the eﬀect of climate change is minimal. In addition, models should be kept as\n\
    updated as possible. Dynamic modeling can be done to cater to this need while\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence\ncan support it with fast calculation and real-time data.\n\
    4.\nRelationship discovery from new association rules.\nMaking use of the “Big\
    \ Data” allows us to explore various possibilities which associate input\nparameters\
    \ to ET. By using the developed artiﬁcial intelligence models, one can explore\
    \ a vast\nnumber of variables or parameters and study their association with ET\
    \ within a short period of time.\nParameters that are highly correlated with ET\
    \ can be further studied to reveal their relationships and\nscientiﬁc interactions.\n\
    5.\nWidening of forecasting horizons.\nRelated studies were still in the infancy\
    \ stage where the forecasting windows were too narrow.\nIncreasing forecasting\
    \ lead time can assist in the design of eﬃcient water resource management plans.\n\
    This would be important, especially in crop plantations that require a longer\
    \ time to schedule irrigation\ntheir plan.\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 101\n24 of 33\n\
    6. Conclusions\nThe estimation of ET is of paramount importance, especially when\
    \ dealing with agricultural\nactivities. This review has outlined the pitfalls\
    \ of conventional models based on energy balance\nwhich included the high dependency\
    \ on climatic parameters. In addition, empirical models could be\nspeciﬁc to certain\
    \ regions and this in turn requires further calibration before the models could\
    \ be used.\nEmergence of artiﬁcial intelligence models, which operated on the\
    \ premise of a black-box principle\naims to overcome these problems. The integration\
    \ of artiﬁcial intelligence reignites the possibility of\nreduction of the now\
    \ much needed climatic parameters for estimation of ET. Since artiﬁcial intelligence\n\
    models are data-driven, this review has pointed out some sources of data, and\
    \ also the signiﬁcance of\ndiﬀerent parameters in various climate patterns. ANN,\
    \ SVM, fuzzy models, and tree-based models\nhad been studied extensively in the\
    \ past and their feasibilities were tried and tested. Nevertheless,\nstudies had\
    \ revealed that, in the case of limited meteorological parameters or data, performance\
    \ of\nthese artiﬁcial intelligence models would deteriorate.\nIn view of such\
    \ circumstance, data fusion techniques had been developed as a solution. Bootstrap\n\
    aggregating is useful when available data size is too little to train a good model.\
    \ Bayesian modeling\napproaches rely on the imputation of posterior probabilities\
    \ to weigh the correctness of individual\nmodels. The boosting algorithm works\
    \ by combining several weak learners to form a strong learner.\nMoreover, the\
    \ nonlinear neural ensemble relies on the black-box operation in order to create\
    \ an\nensemble which produced better results than its constituent individual models.\
    \ Data decomposition\nhas distinct characteristics whereby it extracts useful\
    \ information at diﬀerent resolutions via certain\nforms of transformation. This\
    \ could assist in the removal of unwanted noise prior analysis. The purpose\n\
    of performing data decomposition, especially wavelet transformation is to draw\
    \ certain trends from\nhistorical data in order to predict future behaviour of\
    \ ET. At the end of this review, a compilation\nof suggested hybridization techniques\
    \ for each base artiﬁcial intelligence models are provided in\nTable 5. This could\
    \ serve as a guideline in terms of parameters selections and ensemble strategies\
    \ for\nfuture research workers who wish to have a fresh start on ET estimation\
    \ using the hybrid artiﬁcial\nintelligence models.\nRemote sensing technology\
    \ appears to be able to remove the limitation of spatial coverage when\nestimating\
    \ ET. It also serves to provide real-time data in order to increase the dynamicity\
    \ of analysis.\nRemote sensing-based ET estimation is always integral with land\
    \ surface model where energy balance\nand radiation play important roles. Data\
    \ assimilation can also be performed on remote sensing data\nwhere satellite images\
    \ from diﬀerent sources could be combined in artiﬁcial intelligence models.\n\
    This enables the combination of diﬀerent information being carried by diﬀerent\
    \ sources of satellite\nimages (including resolution and band range). This can\
    \ be realized by some of the commonly used\ntechniques such as the STARFM, ESTARFM,\
    \ and the Kalman ﬁlter-based ensemble.\nBesides providing the chronological development\
    \ and guidelines to select methods or algorithms\nfor ET estimation using artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence models, this review also suggested the future trends\nof the development\
    \ of artiﬁcial intelligence in ET prediction. In upcoming studies, it is anticipated\n\
    that data fusion or assimilation would be the major subject alongside with the\
    \ development of more\nrobust artiﬁcial intelligence models. It is in our interest\
    \ that ground observation data can be merged\nwith remote sensing data. New hybrid\
    \ models are also anticipated in order to increase the prediction\naccuracy and\
    \ speed. In the near future, climate change will be a major environmental issue\
    \ and\nresearchers shall be cautious about its eﬀect. With matured and well-developed\
    \ models, we could\nexpect that more parameters well associated with ET can be\
    \ explored to discover their relationship\nwith ET, all in all for a more profound\
    \ understand of the processes. Finally, forecasting horizons are\nto be lengthened\
    \ for achieving water resources allocation with higher eﬃciency. It can be a useful\n\
    tool during key steps of the decision-making process for policy makers, especially\
    \ in water resources\nmanagement for a successful economic growth and development\
    \ in the agricultural sector.\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 101\n25 of 33\nTable 5. Mapping\

    Abstract: Digitalization has impacted agricultural and food production systems,\
    \ and makes applica-\ntion of technologies and advanced data processing techniques\
    \ in agricultural ﬁeld possible. Digital\nfarming aims to use available information\
    \ from agricultural assets to solve several existing challenges\nfor addressing\
    \ food security, climate protection, and resource management. However, the agricultural\n\
    sector is complex, dynamic, and requires sophisticated management systems. The\
    \ digital approaches\nare expected to provide more optimization and further decision-making\
    \ supports. Digital twin in\nagriculture is a virtual representation of a farm\
    \ with great potential for enhancing productivity and\nefﬁciency while declining\
    \ energy usage and losses. This review describes the state-of-the-art of\ndigital\
    \ twin concepts along with different digital technologies and techniques in agricultural\
    \ con-\ntexts. It presents a general framework of digital twins in soil, irrigation,\
    \ robotics, farm machineries,\nand food post-harvest processing in agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld. Data recording, modeling including artiﬁcial\nintelligence, big data,\
    \ simulation, analysis, prediction, and communication aspects (e.g., Internet\n\
    of Things, wireless technologies) of digital twin in agriculture are discussed.\
    \ Digital twin systems\ncan support farmers as a next generation of digitalization\
    \ paradigm by continuous and real-time\nmonitoring of physical world (farm) and\
    \ updating the state of virtual world.\nKeywords: digital twin; digitalization;\
    \ digital farming; farm management; smart farming\n1. Introduction\nOne of the\
    \ main global challenges is how to ensure food security for the world’s\ngrowing\
    \ population whilst ensuring long-term sustainable development. According to the\n\
    Food and Agriculture Organization, agricultural and food productions will need\
    \ to grow\nto feed the world population, which will reach around 10 billion by\
    \ 2050 [1]. Due to the\nincrease in world population and market demand for higher\
    \ product quantity and quality\nstandards, the issue of food security, sustainability,\
    \ productivity, and proﬁtability becomes\nmore important. Furthermore, the economic\
    \ pressure on the agricultural sector, labor,\nenvironmental, and climate change\
    \ issues are increasing [2,3]. Therefore, the enhancement\nof efﬁciency through\
    \ effective integrated smart technologies and techniques has been\nwidely considered\
    \ in recent years.\nIn this context, digital agriculture (also known as smart\
    \ farming or smart agriculture)\ntools can support the deeper understanding of\
    \ interrelations within the agricultural pro-\nduction system and the consequent\
    \ effects on the performance of farm production while\nbalancing human health\
    \ and well-being, social and environmental aspects, and sustain-\nability associated\
    \ with agricultural system [4–6]. Due to advances in data generation, data\nprocessing\
    \ and human-computer interactions, digital farming has progressed in recent\n\
    years [7]. One of the main features of digitalization in agriculture is the introduction\
    \ of inno-\nvative Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Internet of\
    \ Things (IoT), big data\nanalytics and interpretation techniques, machine learning\
    \ and Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI).\nData acquisition and analysis in digital farming\
    \ by means of smart technologies are\nsupporting complex decision-making approaches\
    \ [8,9]. They enhance ﬁnal productivity,\nSensors 2022, 22, 498. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22020498\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n2 of 16\nreduce costs,\
    \ and optimize the decision-making process. Furthermore, ICT tools present\nadvantages\
    \ for on-farm management, efﬁciency, quality control, and the food supply chain\n\
    as well as decision support tools [10]. The AI and big data support better and\
    \ precise\nfarm monitoring, data acquisition and analytics, improve information\
    \ extraction from\nsensors as well as farm management [11]. For instance, crop\
    \ health and productivity can\nbe monitored and controlled using advanced AI and\
    \ deep learning techniques [12]. Data-\ndriven approaches augment on-farm decision-making\
    \ capabilities, improve crop yield,\nreduce losses, and therefore, beneﬁt farmers.\
    \ The IoT and wireless technologies enable\nreal-time data transferring and monitoring\
    \ in digital farming [13,14]. The IoT, along with\ncloud computing systems, can\
    \ facilitate communication between software platforms and\nsensors, pieces of\
    \ machinery, crops, and animals in digital farming. However, by increasing\nthe\
    \ number of sensors and generating large amounts of data in digital farming could\
    \ cause\nhigh load on the cloud server and reduce the response speed [15]. In\
    \ this context, in may\nbe impractical to always store and process data in the\
    \ cloud systems [16]. An alternative\ntechnology which has been recently introduced\
    \ to the smart farming is edge-computing\nthat enables computation at the edge\
    \ of the network [17]. It helps to reduce network load\nand supports real-time\
    \ data processing in agricultural ﬁelds. Furthermore, cyber-physical\nsystems\
    \ have been introduced through smart farming systems to develop hardware and\n\
    software, improve adaptability, and safety and security of computer-based algorithms\n\
    and systems [18]. It enables adaptability, practicality, security, and safety\
    \ of collected\ninformation in agricultural ﬁeld e.g., climate, irrigation, soil,\
    \ nutrition, and yield for\nbetter management.\nAccording to ref. [19], digital\
    \ farming approaches can provide farmers with useful\ninformation about (I) the\
    \ use of fertilizers, chemicals, seeds, and irrigation management\nstrategies,\
    \ (II) the environment protection, (III) pest, climate, and crop monitoring man-\n\
    agement solutions, (IV) market demands and business conditions. However, agricultural\n\
    production systems are complex, dynamic, and require sophisticated management\
    \ [20].\nDigitalization approaches are expected to provide more monitoring, data\
    \ analysis and\noptimization capabilities, and further decision-making supports.\n\
    To enhance the efﬁciency of these systems, an emerging paradigm has been proposed\n\
    and implemented in digital agriculture, that is, digital twin. The digital twin\
    \ was ﬁrstly\npresented by NASA for monitoring of spacecraft behavior and can\
    \ be deﬁned as a virtual\nor digital representation of physical systems to simulate\
    \ the behavior of the physical\nsystem [21,22]. There are different deﬁnitions\
    \ for digital twin available in the literature\nwhich have been reviewed by [23–25].\
    \ Based on the reported deﬁnitions, the component\nof digital twin can be characterized\
    \ by physical and virtual objects, as well as a set of\nconnections between physical\
    \ and digital assets [26].\nThe physical system or physical world in agriculture\
    \ is a complex and dynamic\nenvironment and includes basic information and features\
    \ of the object or device such\nas shape, position, cooler, material, and live\
    \ objects [27]. The physical system is one\nof the key components, and a digital\
    \ twin without a physical world is a model [28],\nand system boundaries of a digital\
    \ twin are identiﬁed based on the real physical world [29].\nThe physical system\
    \ can be a single component of an object or the whole object with sub-\ncomponents\
    \ located in a physical environment [28]. The physical world in agriculture can\n\
    be an animal itself or located in a farm including building, feeding strategies,\
    \ number of\nanimals [30], or a crop with different soil, climate, and irrigation\
    \ conditions [22], robots\nand agricultural pieces of machinery, e.g., tractors,\
    \ harvesters and fertilizers, as well as\noperators. The physical world can include\
    \ a whole object (e.g., whole machine) or sub-part\nof the object, or a single\
    \ asset of the object connected with other objects. In an agricultural\ncontext,\
    \ the physical system may be some aspects of the crop, soil, and irrigation systems,\n\
    or animal body. The physical world requires measurement technologies and sensors\
    \ to\ncollect and receive data from the physical object. Examples of digital twins\
    \ in smart\nagriculture include optical sensors for plant canopy and disease [31,32],\
    \ soil and weather\nsensors for crop [33], barn sensors such as temperature, humidity,\
    \ ammonia for animals [34],\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n3 of 16\nGlobal Positioning\
    \ System (GPS) and Real-Time Kinematic-Global Navigation Satellite for\ntracking\
    \ of agricultural robots [35], and food supply chain.\nThe connection between\
    \ physical and virtual worlds depends on the developed digital\ntwin. This component\
    \ enables data transmission between virtual and physical systems.\nIt interprets\
    \ the collected data from the physical system and updates the state of the\nvirtual\
    \ system, and transfers feedbacks from the virtual system to the physical world\
    \ [25].\nThe connection components can be varied depending on the source, type\
    \ and volume of\ndata, data transfer rate and speed, as well as the minimum delay\
    \ between data acquisition\nand feedbacks. Wireless and IoT techniques have been\
    \ used in digital twins of agricultural\nconcepts to connect between physical\
    \ and virtual worlds (such as [34,36,37]).\nThe models and data of the physical\
    \ world are represented in a virtual system.\nThe virtual world may also include\
    \ different processing and simulation concepts, software,\nmachine learning, data\
    \ mining, and AI models. In this context, data processing and analyt-\nics by\
    \ means of AI techniques to support decision-making and feedback to the physical\n\
    system were suggested by some researchers [38,39]. The virtual twin may simulate\
    \ and\ncontrol the physical system, optimize a process, and predict unseen issues\
    \ in the physical\nsystem. For example, an application layer of a digital twin\
    \ reported by [22] provides\nreal-time monitoring of weeds, crop growth, and expected\
    \ yield via cloud dashboards for\nfarmers. A schematic of the digital twin concept\

    \ and evaluation of soil quality to sustain plant productivity is the basis of\n\
    land-use strategies in agricultural farms [48]. Crop health and productivity depends\
    \ on\nthe quality and properties of the soil. More detailed information about\
    \ the agricultural\nsoil may reduce the potential use of chemical fertilizer and\
    \ pesticide dosages, therefore\nimproving the underground water, protecting the\
    \ environment and human health. It also\nsupports deﬁning plant density in a more\
    \ efﬁcient way. Digital technologies are supporting\nscientists to better understand\
    \ and study soil in agriculture. Soil monitoring sensors such\nas moisture, temperature,\
    \ organic matter, and soil pollutant sensors are playing critical\nroles in digital\
    \ agriculture [49]. For instance, soil moisture information can be used to\nassess\
    \ irrigation efﬁciency in agricultural ﬁelds [50]. Furthermore, to support the\
    \ decision-\nmaking process of smart farming, digital soil mapping is an essential\
    \ paradigm that can be\ndeﬁned as spatial soil information based on ﬁeld and laboratory\
    \ investigations coupled\nwith soil inference systems [51]. Digital soil assessment\
    \ approaches have a direct impact on\ncrop yield and performance by identifying\
    \ zones that may cause low crop yield. Digital\nalternative methodologies for\
    \ soil survey and identifying key soil characteristics could\nhave the possibility\
    \ to quantify the trend of agricultural soil conditions [52].\nThe advancement\
    \ of knowledge and technology (e.g., wireless sensors, IoT, AI) in\ndigital agriculture\
    \ could lead to digital twin paradigms of soil in agriculture. The recent\ndevelopment\
    \ of digital soil mapping techniques may support digital twins by digital\nrepresentation\
    \ of knowledge obtained from the soil in virtual entrainment [53]. For in-\nstance,\
    \ digital soil mapping could be used to describe soil variation in digital twins\
    \ using\ninformation from complex soil variation at a speciﬁc depth, time, and\
    \ special locations [52].\nAdditionally, the decision about crop management depends\
    \ directly on the crop water\nrequirements, soil properties, and availability\
    \ of water. In order to manage soil and crop\nrequirements in smart farming, digital\
    \ technologies have been used to meet the requirement\nof smart or precise water\
    \ management strategies. Wireless system networks, IoT, edge-\ncomputing, local\
    \ weather-based controllers, and soil sensors are some of the digital tools\n\
    based on smart irrigation systems. The mentioned tools can be used in the digital\
    \ twin of\nsoil and irrigation systems. For example, ref. [37] developed a digital\
    \ twin concept for smart\nwater management in the agricultural domain. Information\
    \ of air and ground temperature,\nand humidity sensors, soil moisture, and ambient\
    \ light as well as geospatial position\nsensors were collected. An IoT system\
    \ was used to connect the cloud and the physical\nsystem. A virtual environment\
    \ including decision-making tools and models was designed\nto inform the data\
    \ collected by connection device (the IoT system) and to send feedback\nto the\
    \ physical system. They also presented a digital twin system architecture including\n\
    monitoring devices (i.e., soil probe, weather information, irrigation system,\
    \ machines,\nand other equipment) in a physical system (farm) with could serve\
    \ as a connection between\nthe physical and virtual systems to visualize satellite\
    \ and drone images.\nIn another study, to evaluate and forecast plants’ irrigation\
    \ requirements, and support\nirrigation and water distribution planning, a digital\
    \ twin for a smart water management\nsystem was developed by [54]. Data of the\
    \ physical world (agriculture ﬁeld) such as\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n5 of 16\n\
    weather, fertilizer, and soil type as well as information from developed models\
    \ that simulate\nthe behavior of soil and crops were considered as input data\
    \ for the digital twin. The digital\ntwin concept also consisted of a Soil Agent\
    \ (includes hydrological models and soil data),\nCrop Agent (includes crop models\
    \ and evaporation data), and a Field Avatar, which is a\ndigital representation\
    \ of the ﬁeld such as geological models and weather data [54]. In their\ndeveloped\
    \ digital twin concept, the information from Soil Avatar and Crop Avatar feed\n\
    into the Field Avatar, and an IoT system was used for data transformation and\
    \ connection\nbetween the physical and virtual worlds.\nDue to increase in world\
    \ population, water and energy management, storage, and proper\ndistribution of\
    \ water become more essential for water users in agricultural sectors, which can\n\
    be managed through a collective irrigation system [55]. A digital twin of water\
    \ systems\ncoupled with big data can reduce risk and uncertainty of water management,\
    \ explore\nconsumption patterns, and optimize operation planning [56]. Furthermore,\
    \ in a collective\nirrigation system, improvement of water efﬁciency could help\
    \ to reduce water losses. In this\ncontext, a digital twin concept was created\
    \ using ﬁeld and laboratory tests of a collective\nirrigation system network to\
    \ evaluate energy, pumping facilities, water losses and water use\nefﬁciencies\
    \ [57]. The developed digital twin methodology was based on information from\n\
    the physical system, i.e., infrastructure data, acquired information through telemetry,\
    \ data\nanalytics from laboratory tests and ﬁeld measurements, IoT data transferring\
    \ as connection,\nenergy balance, water balance, and hydraulic model in the virtual\
    \ system. It was found\nthat the digital twin of the irrigation management system\
    \ made it possible to understand\nsystem processes, maintenance, and management\
    \ strategies [57].\nA digital twin of soil and irrigation systems in smart farming\
    \ enables digital repre-\nsentation of information from agricultural soil, and\
    \ provides prediction and fundamental\nunderstanding of water requirement and\
    \ soil components for crop farming. Exchanging\ninformation from the soil as a\
    \ physical system to a virtual system using IoT, cloud, fog,\nand edge-computing\
    \ technologies in digital twin may allow evaluating the state of soil and\nirrigation\
    \ systems. In particular, the edge-computing technique that saves and performs\n\
    the data processing near the soil monitoring and irrigation devices can improve\
    \ the perfor-\nmance and overcome issues of cloud-based system in digital twin\
    \ concepts. Furthermore,\nit could offer different irrigation recommendations\
    \ based on crop requirements which are\nnot solved yet by the researchers.\n3.\
    \ Digital Twin in Crop Production\nThe use of digital and ICT tools in crop production\
    \ technologies, in particular agri-\ncultural machineries, e.g., tractors, combine\
    \ harvesters, fertilizers, and sprayers, plays an\nimportant role in the improvement\
    \ of overall efﬁciency by reducing the cost of fuel, fertiliz-\ners, human labor,\
    \ and parameters which affect production efﬁciency and sustainability [58].\n\
    Digitalization has modernized agricultural machinery application and management\
    \ policies\nusing collected information and advanced data analytics approaches.\
    \ It allows to optimize\nthe performance and enhance the use of advanced tools\
    \ in manufacturing. For instance,\nbased on the European Agricultural Machinery\
    \ Association, a digital farm machine should\nbe able to assist and support drivers\
    \ by sending and receiving data via sensors and ICT\ntools, enable the best and\
    \ optimal use of machinery, and the technology should facilitate\nthe automated\
    \ operation of the devices [59]. The application of AI, big data analytics,\n\
    and wireless and IoT technologies have led to signiﬁcant changes in farm technology\
    \ roles\ntowards the development of autonomous systems. The role of agricultural\
    \ machinery in\nthe implementation of digital agriculture was stated by [58] as\
    \ data collected from sensors\nmounted on typical and autonomous agricultural\
    \ machinery and transferred via an IoT\nplatform. Then, the information was analyzed\
    \ by data analytics such as AI, fuzzy logic,\nand big data analysis to support\
    \ farmers, consumers, and markets [58]. In this context,\ncombining digital tools\
    \ with autonomous machines and robots could help farmers to do\nmore effective\
    \ practices and improve the quality of products [60]. Nowadays, with ad-\nvancements\
    \ in digital technology, the real-time visualization of smart farm equipment\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 498\n6 of 16\nconditions is possible through digital twin approaches\
    \ [40]. It allows contact to the system\n(e.g., machinery and robots), simulates\
    \ the condition of the system, and monitors the\nbehavior and operation as well\
    \ as the maintenance situation of the machines (Figure 2).\n \ntransferred via\
    \ an IoT platform. Then, the information was analyzed by data analytics \nsuch\
    \ as AI, fuzzy logic, and big data analysis to support farmers, consumers, and\
    \ markets \n[58]. In this context, combining digital tools with autonomous machines\
    \ and robots could \nhelp farmers to do more effective practices and improve the\
    \ quality of products [60]. Now-\nadays, with advancements in digital technology,\
    \ the real-time visualization of smart farm \nequipment conditions is possible\
    \ through digital twin approaches [40]. It allows contact \nto the system (e.g.,\
    \ machinery and robots), simulates the condition of the system, and \nmonitors\
    \ the behavior and operation as well as the maintenance situation of the machines\
    \ \n(Figure 2).  \n \nFigure 2. An architecture of the digital twin concept for\
    \ crop production technology. \nDigital twin in design and manufacturing of products\
    \ (e.g., farm machinery) requires \n(I) geometric (e.g., size, shape) and physical\
    \ properties of an object, (II) in the detailed \ninformation of the product which\
    \ can illustrate dynamic processing of the object, (III) in-\ntegration of geometric,\
    \ physical, and process information [61]. Digital twin approaches \nmake it possible\
    \ to model, design, simulate, and develop agricultural machinery that \nwould\
    \ yield more productive machines in terms of energy and power efficiencies. For\
    \ \ninstance, it was shown that overall energy consumption of machinery could\
    \ be modeled \nin digital twin concepts, and the effect of different factors on\
    \ energy consumption can also \nbe explored there [62]. In the agricultural context,\
    \ ref. [40] reported that a commercially \navailable digital twin platform for\
    \ agricultural machinery is able to track the machines in \nreal-time, monitor\
    \ the energy consumption, economic efficiency of crop management, and \ntrajectories\
    \ of tractors by considering the specific conditions of the farm. It has also\
    \ been \nreported that using digital twins could potentially impact the training\
    \ of unskilled har-\nvester operators and lead to high macro-economic benefits\
    \ [63].  \nWithin the digital farming technologies, robotics, as an important\
    \ technology in crop \nproduction, has played an essential role in digitalization\
    \ and has been drawing more at-\ntention in recent years. To optimize the robotic\
    \ application process, reduce costs, and in-\ncrease the quality and efficiency\
    \ of the product, the digital twin concepts can be used for \nvirtualization of\
    \ the robot environment by introducing a remote operating system [64]. By \nproviding\
    \ simulation and remote operation possibilities and modeling various interac-\n\
    tions between robot and environment in digital twin concepts, accuracy, performance,\
    \ \nand flexibility may enhance, and the final product cost may decline. Ref.\
    \ [65] analyzed the \nhuman-robot interactive behaviors using a digital twin platform.\
    \ Their developed digital \ntwin helps to improve operational productivity and\
    \ comfort. In another study, a digital \nFigure 2. An architecture of the digital\

    For instance, it was shown that overall energy consumption of machinery could\
    \ be mod-\neled in digital twin concepts, and the effect of different factors\
    \ on energy consumption can\nalso be explored there [62]. In the agricultural\
    \ context, ref. [40] reported that a commercially\navailable digital twin platform\
    \ for agricultural machinery is able to track the machines\nin real-time, monitor\
    \ the energy consumption, economic efﬁciency of crop management,\nand trajectories\
    \ of tractors by considering the speciﬁc conditions of the farm. It has also\n\
    been reported that using digital twins could potentially impact the training of\
    \ unskilled\nharvester operators and lead to high macro-economic beneﬁts [63].\n\
    Within the digital farming technologies, robotics, as an important technology\
    \ in crop\nproduction, has played an essential role in digitalization and has\
    \ been drawing more\nattention in recent years. To optimize the robotic application\
    \ process, reduce costs, and in-\ncrease the quality and efﬁciency of the product,\
    \ the digital twin concepts can be used for\nvirtualization of the robot environment\
    \ by introducing a remote operating system [64].\nBy providing simulation and\
    \ remote operation possibilities and modeling various inter-\nactions between\
    \ robot and environment in digital twin concepts, accuracy, performance,\nand\
    \ ﬂexibility may enhance, and the ﬁnal product cost may decline. Ref. [65] analyzed\n\
    the human-robot interactive behaviors using a digital twin platform. Their developed\n\
    digital twin helps to improve operational productivity and comfort. In another\
    \ study,\na digital twin approach was proposed to assist the remote programming\
    \ of a robot [66].\nThe developed digital twin system consists of a robot (as\
    \ a physical object), and a gaming\nplatform (as a virtual system) which was able\
    \ to observe the motion of the robot, ease\nprogramming for complex environments\
    \ as well as introduce a remote operating system\nfor communication across different\
    \ platforms [66]. In the agricultural context, an approach\nwas recommended by\
    \ [35] that the development of a digital twin paradigm for agricultural\nrobots\
    \ may improve predictive emulation of the vehicles, operational scheduling, digital-\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 498\n7 of 16\nization, economic, environmental, and social sustainability\
    \ in agriculture. Furthermore,\nthe digital twin paradigm makes it possible to\
    \ overcome common challenges in the control\nof robot components in the agriculture\
    \ ﬁeld. In this context, a research group demonstrated\nthe possibility of a digital\
    \ twin concept for a desktop version of an agricultural robot [67] to\ncontrol\
    \ the motor and indoor localization capabilities of the robot. Besides, the digital\
    \ twin\nconcept was used to predict movement and monitor the safety mechanism\
    \ of the robot [67].\nHowever, their developed digital twin concept needs different\
    \ kinds of calibrations to be\napplicable in different environmental conditions.\n\
    In another study, to simulate complexity of the crop production process, variability\
    \ of\nplant, soil, environment, and technologies in the agricultural ﬁeld, digital\
    \ twin concepts\nwere developed [68]. Three ﬁeld robots for different agricultural\
    \ applications were used to\ndevelop different digital twin concepts and optimize\
    \ sensor-based autonomous navigation.\nIt is reported that the developed concepts\
    \ could provide considerable information in prepar-\ning ﬁeld experiments, and\
    \ better evaluation for the use and positioning of sensor systems\ntowards demonstrating\
    \ and implementation of the developed robotic technologies [68].\nIntegration\
    \ of the digital twin systems with technologies and management strategies\nin\
    \ crop production can provide a new phenomenon for digitalization in agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld.\nManagement strategies can be improved and optimized by providing reliable\
    \ forecasts of\nthe key parameters in digital twins [69]. The digital twin systems\
    \ can not only act as a man-\nagement system, but it may also be used to revolutionize\
    \ agricultural farm management\nstrategies [40]. For instance, a digital twin\
    \ concept was applied in a greenhouse to discover,\nanalyze, and extract behavior\
    \ of farmers [70]. Sensor data were analyzed using deep learn-\ning techniques\
    \ to establish decision-making models to replicate expert famers’ experience\n\
    for transferring to young farmers. It was found that the developed digital twin\
    \ module\ncould improve control and management strategies in crop farming [70].\
    \ In this context,\nthe use of distributed architecture in digital twin may increase\
    \ efﬁciency and reliability\nof the module by proper resource handling [71]. A\
    \ distributed digital twin concept was\ndeveloped to handle resources over different\
    \ stakeholders and platforms in agricultural\nlandscape [72]. It consists of different\
    \ components, i.e., stakeholders, applications in agri-\nculture and farm management,\
    \ sensor data, analytics and simulation tools, virtual model,\nIoT, and resource\
    \ registry which makes interoperable and cross-scale management possible\nin agricultural\
    \ landscape [71].\nIn addition, the use of digital twin system as a decision support\
    \ system can beneﬁt and\nbe adopted for crop farming applications, and optimization\
    \ of products and farm system\nperformance. A digital twin model was implemented\
    \ by [36] in sustainable agriculture\nfor monitoring and control of product qualities,\
    \ adjustment of environmental conditions,\nidentiﬁcation of forecasting, and decision\
    \ support scenarios. In addition, a novel approach\nbased on digital twin paradigms\
    \ was developed to forecast yield, vegetation quality,\nand duration of plant\
    \ development [33]. Consequently, the quality of crop production\ncould be improved\
    \ due to detailed analysis and control of plant growth, and the efﬁciency\nof\
    \ farms could be improved due to automation of decision support processes through\n\
    the developed digital twin concept. Digital twin along with forecasting models\
    \ were able\nto provide feedback to farmers for a better decision-making scenario\
    \ in a reported study\nby [73]. Their proposed digital twin system consists of\
    \ a monitoring system to collect\nenvironmental condition data from an underground\
    \ farm, as well as data analysis and\nmodeling techniques to identify key parameters,\
    \ critical trends, and forecast operational\nscenarios. Furthermore, digital twin\
    \ was able to optimize productivity of crops in a\ngreenhouse environment through\
    \ climate control strategies and treatments related to\ncrop management [74].\n\
    Information from crop production machineries (e.g., tractors, harvesters, robots)\
    \ have\nbeen used in smart farming to optimize the performance and efﬁciency,\
    \ and reduce the fuel\nand energy consumption. However, the digital twin concepts\
    \ collect real-time data from\nthe devices and characterize the states of the\
    \ physical object continuously. This capability\nmakes it possible to predict\
    \ and prescribe solutions using the collected information from\nSensors 2022,\
    \ 22, 498\n8 of 16\nthe farm machineries. Hence, big data analytics coupled with\
    \ AI models are able to detect\nfailures in the machines before or in the early\
    \ stage of when breakdowns happen. In this\ncontext, the use of state-of-the-art\
    \ edge-computing systems may reduce latency by the\nlimited amount of transmitted\
    \ data and provide information from the crop production\nmachineries such as autonomous\
    \ robot, harvesters, and tractors to the digital twin concepts.\nThe digital twin\
    \ paradigm in crop farming can change production productivity, farm man-\nagement,\
    \ and sustainability at farm level. Advanced statistical models, machine learning\n\
    and data analytic approaches can provide farmers with more precise information\
    \ to make\nbetter decisions that were not possible previously. Based on the past\
    \ (historical) and current\ncontinuous knowledge from crop (sensors deployed at\
    \ farm) and environment data, the dig-\nital twin systems provide information\
    \ about future states of the farm, and offer solutions\nfor turning the collected\
    \ information into useful and actionable on-farm knowledge.\n4. Digital Twin in\
    \ Post-Harvest Process\nPost-harvest process is a stage of agricultural products\
    \ after harvesting until consum-\ning the products, which may include transportation,\
    \ drying, cooling, storage, and market-\ning. Through digital farming approaches,\
    \ the post-harvest processes could beneﬁt from loss\nreduction, improvement of\
    \ monitoring and optimization of food processing, storage condi-\ntions, marketing,\
    \ and transportation. Digital solutions allow monitoring real-time agri-food\n\
    supply chain to increase robustness and resilience of the chain [75], and lower\
    \ food waste\nand losses. The IoT platform supports the reduction of food losses\
    \ in post-harvest pro-\ncessing [76], and tracking of the product through the\
    \ food supply chain. To achieve food\nsecurity AI and big data analytics enable\
    \ data processing, optimization, and management\nin food and crop post-harvest\
    \ stages [77], also reducing waste and improving overall prof-\nitability [78].\
    \ The ICT offers solutions to monitor and control quality criteria of food and\n\
    agricultural products during post-harvest processing [43]. However, different\
    \ environmen-\ntal conditions, processing factors, and dynamic features of agricultural\
    \ product (e.g., shape,\nsize), environmental parameters (e.g., temperature, humidity),\
    \ handling, transportation,\nand storage of the products inﬂuence the quality\
    \ of post-harvest process [79].\nTo overcome these issues and increase the efﬁciency\
    \ of the system, digital twin ap-\nproaches have been used in post-harvest processing\
    \ to continuously monitor the products\nand update the processing stages [80].\
    \ Digital twins, as an expanding family of digital\nfarming could strengthen agri-food\
    \ systems, affect knowledge and skills of farm manage-\nment [44]. Digital twin\
    \ in post-harvest processes can be deﬁned as a digital representation\nof harvested\
    \ agricultural products based on the information collected from the products.\n\
    In this context, ref. [42] reported the digital twin concept of food processing\
    \ may include:\n(I) data collected from a physical system (food process operation)\
    \ by means of sensors that\nmeasure properties and variables of products and environmental\
    \ parameters, (II) an IoT\nplatform to provide sensor communication, data storage\
    \ and big data analytics, high-\nperformance computing, and link to the digital\
    \ twin assets, (III) a simulation platform that\nuses input data from physical\
    \ system for optimization, testing and validation of models,\nand provides decision\
    \ supports in the virtual world. In order to beneﬁt food process-\ning by developing\
    \ digital twin models, it is important to include accurate information\nrepresenting\
    \ production processes of the product, e.g., equipment, labor, and to create\n\
    realistic models with all existing boundaries and barriers [81]. In a study reported\
    \ by [82],\na digital twin of mango fruit was developed to simulate and qualify\
    \ thermal and associ-\nated bio-chemical behavior of the fruit through a post-harvest\
    \ supply chain. In order to\ndevelop the digital twin concept, environmental air\
    \ temperature as input was considered,\nand the actual supply chain conditions\
    \ were mimicked within mechanistic ﬁnite element\nmodels [82]. Moreover, the impact\
    \ of higher air speed on storage life, cold chain length,\nand delivery air temperature\
    \ on the fruit quality were considered in the digital twin. It was\nreported that\
    \ the digital twin allows to monitor and predict temperature-dependent fruit\n\
    quality losses, improve refrigeration and logistic processes, consequently, it\
    \ can reduce\nfood losses [82]. Furthermore, it is reported that the digital twin\
    \ can help horticultural\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n9 of 16\nproducts along with\
    \ the post-harvest life, and can be used to forecast the shelf-life of\nagricultural\
    \ products through the cold chain [45]. It can support food consumers as well\n\
    as food business owners for tracking of the products, logistics, and marketing\
    \ decisions;\nhowever, the existing digital twin concept needs to be enhanced\
    \ by considering more bio-\nchemical and physical features [45]. Ref. [83] proposed\
    \ a digital twin concept food supply\nchain analysis. Their developed digital\
    \ twin includes: (I) a network based on knowledge\nfrom, e.g., customers, suppliers,\
    \ and factories, (II) some parameters, e.g., in production,\ntransportation, warehouses,\
    \ sourcing, shipment costs, and policies, (III) various operational\nparameters,\
    \ e.g., demand, quality, target inventory, and vehicle capacity. It was found\n\
    that the developed digital twin can be used for optimization, simulation, and\
    \ analysis of\noperation and performance changes in the food supply chain [83].\n\
    According to [43], digital twin in post-harvest can be considered as mechanistic,\n\
    statistical, and intelligent models; however, it was found that the physics-based\
    \ mechanistic\ndigital twin concepts can evaluate the quality of fresh agricultural\
    \ products better than\nthe others. Physics-based digital twins were developed\
    \ on 331 cold chain shipments of\nfour fruits (i.e., cucumber, eggplant, strawberry,\
    \ raspberry) by [84]. Based on digital twin\nconcepts, it was found that the quality\
    \ of fruits may be affected (around 43–85%) before\nbeing delivered to stores.\n\
    The post-harvest processing has improved through the application of digital solutions\n\
    over the last several years. However, the use of the digital twin paradigm is\
    \ receiving more\nattention in post-harvest food processing due to the future\
    \ product quality prediction and\ncost reduction. The digital twin of post-harvest\
    \ processes may be developed to model,\noptimize, represent, and characterize\
    \ the design and operational parameters such as quality,\nsafety, ingredients,\
    \ shelf-life, and product status, which need to be considered by researchers\n\
    in future studies.\n5. Challenges and Future Needs\nSummary of the digital twin\
    \ concepts developed in the literature for different purposes\nin agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds, including soil, irrigation, crop monitoring, robotics, farm machinery,\n\
    and post-harvest processing, is presented in Tables 2–4. These tables show that\
    \ the digital\ntwin paradigm is in the early stage of research and development\
    \ in the agricultural context,\nand future studies in terms of knowledge, technological,\
    \ system development, and application\naspects of digital twin concepts in different\

    \ the agricultural\nsoil by considering the soil quality and properties may accommodate\
    \ plant productivity,\nhealth, and yield, save water, and reduce chemical usage.\
    \ Many elements of the soil,\nirrigation, and environmental parameters in agricultural\
    \ land can be continuously mon-\nitored, analyzed, and their management strategies\
    \ optimized using big data analytics,\nmachine learning models, and decision support\
    \ systems embedded in the digital twin\nconcepts. The combination of soil and\
    \ irrigation digital twin approaches to record, monitor,\nand analyze agricultural\
    \ land changes may lead to improved performance of crop farming.\nFor instance,\
    \ simulation of soil structure along with data-driven updating models could\n\
    connect farmers to the farm using the IoT technology and present, in detail, pictures\
    \ of\nparameters that impact the soil, irrigation, and crop yield. However, few\
    \ studies focus on\nthe development of digital twin concepts of agriculture soil\
    \ with higher degree of ﬂexibility\nas well as considering a wider range of operation\
    \ than existing simulation models. Soil\nsensors could constantly measure and\
    \ record the dynamic condition of arable soil, e.g.,\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n\
    11 of 16\nwater holding capacity, moisture, temperature [53]. These data, along\
    \ with information\nfrom soil structure and simulation techniques, can be transferred\
    \ to digital twin concepts,\nand constant feedback from the digital world may\
    \ advise real-time responses for soil and\nwater management as well as control\
    \ systems. In recent years, there has been rapid growth\nin the digital farming\
    \ scenarios, use of remote sensing, digital soil mapping, and develop-\nment of\
    \ software platforms. However, researches needed to fuse the developed techniques\n\
    along with the IoT, edge-computing, AI, data analytics, and simulation techniques\
    \ that\ncould lead to development of a digital twin paradigm is in an early stage\
    \ and needs to\nbe addressed in future studies. Furthermore, researchers need\
    \ to consider the practical\nchallenges of digital twin-based systems in soil\
    \ and irrigation as digital twins are multi-\nand interdisciplinary techniques\
    \ and require systems engineering perspectives [90].\nDigital twin offers real-time\
    \ simulation of farm machinery and robots that can beneﬁt\noptimal design of the\
    \ products, interaction with the environment, energy usage, and main-\ntenance\
    \ strategies. Digital twin concepts have the possibility to predict failures in\
    \ farm\nmachinery and support decision-making scenarios in plant production. Farm\
    \ owners can\nbe able to connect to the machines through virtual world for monitoring\
    \ and tracking of the\ndevices in agricultural farms. Digital twin systems are\
    \ accompanied by recording a large\namount of data and exchanging information\
    \ between different assets; hence compiling\nand analyzing these data is a challenge\
    \ facing farms, particularly in some rural areas with\npoor internet and technological\
    \ infrastructures [91]. Other alternatives, e.g., Long Range\ntechnology based\
    \ on wireless sensor networks communication and edge-computing could\nbe used\
    \ to mitigate internet access problems in rural areas for the connection part\
    \ of the\ndigital twin concepts [32,92]. Future opportunities for the implementation\
    \ of digital twin\nsystems in crop farm technologies could lie in the development\
    \ of standards as well as data\ntransferring and communication strategies in this\
    \ context.\nThe digital twin of crop production using big data collected from\
    \ crop and farm ma-\nchinery as well as robots, analytical and AI models, IoT,\
    \ and satellite and drone information\ncould allow simulating crop, environmental,\
    \ and farm conditions in the digital world to\ndetermine unknown and unseen issues\
    \ before happening in the physical world. Agricul-\ntural objects (crops in particular)\
    \ need frequent updates in data to support information\nanalysis and decision-making\
    \ processes [93] which in turn can promote sustainable farming\npractices and\
    \ save energy usage in crop productions. In this context, greater effort should\n\
    be focused in the future on characterization and development of frameworks for\
    \ more effec-\ntive practical digital twin paradigms. In crop farming, all information\
    \ may not be recorded\nand tracked using digital sensors; however, combining data\
    \ from different sources could\nimprove the virtual representation of the farm\
    \ operation and environment [73]. Continuous\nmonitoring of crops in digital twin\
    \ systems by simulating the dynamic farm conditions\nand considering the effect\
    \ of management, climate, and environmental conditions on the\nplant growth and\
    \ use of data-driven models along with sensor fusion techniques could\nhelp to\
    \ identify deviations from the normal conditions of the plant, and forecast growth\n\
    stages to reduce risk of environmental and management effects. In future, different\
    \ digital\ntwin concepts might be applied to copy the complex physical system\
    \ of crop farming in\nthe digital world and incorporate variable sensors, data\
    \ collecting strategies, modeling,\nforecasting, and simulation approaches in\
    \ crop farming.\nIn addition, digital twin concepts can support monitoring, tracking,\
    \ and analysis of\nfood through the entire supply chain. Development of a digital\
    \ copy of an agricultural\nproduct to monitor post-harvest processing could be\
    \ used to optimize the process, reduce\nenergy use, labor, and food losses based\
    \ on information from different sensors and simula-\ntion models. Future studies\
    \ need to be carried out to consider more environmental and\npost-harvest product\
    \ features for the development of robust digital twins [45]. Another\nmajor challenge\
    \ in the development of digital twin for post-harvest processing to minimize\n\
    quality losses and improve the shelf-life of the product is considering the value\
    \ chain of\nagricultural products from farm to fork [43], which has not been addressed\
    \ yet. In post-\nharvest processing to reduce uncertainty in digital twins and\
    \ enable the consumer to trust\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n12 of 16\nthe output of\
    \ digital twin concepts, detailed experimental and data collection approaches\n\
    along with numerical modeling and validation techniques need be considered.\n\
    6. Conclusions\nEmploying digital technology has helped agricultural farm managers\
    \ to improve\nefﬁciency, yield, and reduce losses. There are different types of\
    \ digital farming paradigms\nin the literature that could be used in digital twin\
    \ concepts as the next generation of\ndigitalization in the agricultural ﬁeld.\
    \ The results of this review show that the digital twin\nconcepts in agriculture\
    \ and food processing have, so far, been little exploited in research.\nThere\
    \ are several research challenges and opportunities in different stages of digital\
    \ farming.\nDigital twin paradigms can be meaningfully utilized for soil and irrigation,\
    \ crop, robots and\nfarm machinery, and post-harvest food processing in the agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld. In this context,\nmost of the studies have focused on the development\
    \ of digital twins by considering some\nlimited parameters in agricultural sectors.\
    \ Deploying of state-of-the-art technologies, e.g.,\nAI, advanced statistical\
    \ and optimization models, big data analytics, and three-dimensional\nsimulation,\
    \ offer further possibilities for improvement in farm management. With real-\n\
    time and continuous information about agricultural assets, virtual models can\
    \ predict\nand address unseen issues in the ﬁelds. It may support farmers to decline\
    \ the economic\npressure on the agricultural sector and labor issues, and help\
    \ policy makers responsible for\nfood security and environmental protection, towards\
    \ strengthening the agriculture sector.\nIn addition, it facilitates the work\
    \ of researchers exploring methods to track and monitor\ncrop farm machinery,\
    \ agricultural and post-harvest products or reduce water, chemicals,\nand energy\
    \ usage in digital farming. Although many digital twin systems in engineering,\n\
    manufacturing, and health contexts have been developed, further attempts need\
    \ to be\nconsidered in the agricultural context towards the development of digital\
    \ twin systems\nthat can monitor, record, and analyze data, to predict and prescribe\
    \ the best decision for\ndigital farming management.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization,\

    \ The European Space Agency’s Sentinel satellites have laid the foundation for\
    \ global\nland use land cover (LULC) mapping with unprecedented detail at 10 m\
    \ resolution. We present a\ncross-comparison and accuracy assessment of Google’s\
    \ Dynamic World (DW), ESA’s World Cover\n(WC) and Esri’s Land Cover (Esri) products\
    \ for the ﬁrst time in order to inform the adoption and\napplication of these\
    \ maps going forward. For the year 2020, the three global LULC maps show\nstrong\
    \ spatial correspondence (i.e., near-equal area estimates) for water, built area,\
    \ trees and crop\nLULC classes. However, relative to one another, WC is biased\
    \ towards over-estimating grass cover,\nEsri towards shrub and scrub cover and\
    \ DW towards snow and ice. Using global ground truth\ndata with a minimum mapping\
    \ unit of 250 m2, we found that Esri had the highest overall accuracy\n(75%) compared\
    \ to DW (72%) and WC (65%). Across all global maps, water was the most accurately\n\
    mapped class (92%), followed by built area (83%), tree cover (81%) and crops (78%),\
    \ particularly\nin biomes characterized by temperate and boreal forests. The classes\
    \ with the lowest accuracies,\nparticularly in the tundra biome, included shrub\
    \ and scrub (47%), grass (34%), bare ground (57%) and\nﬂooded vegetation (53%).\
    \ When using European ground truth data from LUCAS (Land Use/Cover\nArea Frame\
    \ Survey) with a minimum mapping unit of <100 m2, we found that WC had the highest\n\
    accuracy (71%) compared to DW (66%) and Esri (63%), highlighting the ability of\
    \ WC to resolve\nlandscape elements with more detail compared to DW and Esri.\
    \ Although not analyzed in our\nstudy, we discuss the relative advantages of DW\
    \ due to its frequent and near real-time data delivery\nof both categorical predictions\
    \ and class probability scores. We recommend that the use of global\nLULC products\
    \ should involve critical evaluation of their suitability with respect to the\
    \ application\npurpose, such as aggregate changes in ecosystem accounting versus\
    \ site-speciﬁc change detection\nin monitoring, considering trade-offs between\
    \ thematic resolution, global versus. local accuracy,\nclass-speciﬁc biases and\
    \ whether change analysis is necessary. We also emphasize the importance of\n\
    not estimating areas from pixel-counting alone but adopting best practices in\
    \ design-based inference\nand area estimation that quantify uncertainty for a\
    \ given study area.\nKeywords: accuracy; deep learning; Earth observation; Sentinel-2;\
    \ validation\n1. Introduction\nGlobal land use land cover (LULC) maps provide\
    \ information necessary to quantify\nand understand Earth system processes and\
    \ anthropogenic pressures, often at multiple\nspatial and temporal scales [1–3].\
    \ Earth observation and satellite remote sensing have en-\nabled mapping LULC\
    \ in a spatially explicit manner that ultimately informs policy and land\nRemote\
    \ Sens. 2022, 14, 4101. https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14164101\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing\n\
    Remote Sens. 2022, 14, 4101\n2 of 19\nmanagement decisions aimed at achieving\
    \ the global sustainable development goals [4].\nGlobal LULC maps are adopted\
    \ in a vast range of scientiﬁc domains and application envi-\nronments. A few\
    \ examples of LULC map application include: data input into mesoscale\nmodels\
    \ for operational numerical weather forecasts and climate models for future climate\n\
    projections [5,6]; outlining the extent of ecosystems and the change therein,\
    \ e.g., as the\nbasis for ecosystem service accounting [7,8]; isolating urban\
    \ areas from their background\nto quantify local climate impacts [9]; informing\
    \ spatial species distribution models that\ncan predict and inform biodiversity\
    \ conservation [10,11]; spatial conservation planning\nand environmental impact\
    \ assessments [12]; monitoring deforestation and reporting to\npolicy mechanisms,\
    \ such as reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation\n(REDD+)\
    \ [13]. One of the most impactful applications of global LULC maps going forward\n\
    may be for ecosystem extent mapping following UN statistical standards for ecosystem\n\
    accounting (EA) under the System of Environmental–Economic Accounting (SEEA) [14].\n\
    Over the past two decades, the spatial resolution of land cover maps has kept\
    \ pace with\nthe resolution of available satellite sensors, including the Moderate\
    \ Resolution Imaging\nSpectroradiometer (MODIS; 250–500 m), PROBA-v (100 m) and\
    \ Landsat (30 m) satellites.\nThe most prominent corresponding global LULC maps\
    \ include the National Aeronautics\nand Space Administration (NASA) MCD12Q1 500\
    \ m resolution dataset (2001–2018) [15],\nthe European Space Agency (ESA) Copernicus\
    \ Global Land Service (CGLS) Land Cover\n100 m dataset (2015–2019) [16] and GlobLand30\
    \ (2010) [17]. While these products have\nbeen widely adopted, particularly at\
    \ provincial to regional spatial scales, the medium\nspatial resolution prohibits\
    \ the detection and monitoring of smaller landscape elements,\nwhich are vital\
    \ to ﬁner-scale Earth system processes and local land use planning. For\ninstance,\
    \ the monitoring and evaluation of agri-environmental schemes [18], such as\n\
    installing hedge rows or semi-natural vegetation vital to pollinators, is not\
    \ possible with\nthe aforementioned LULC maps. Similarly, accounting for intra-urban\
    \ blue–green space\nrequires ﬁner resolution data to distinguish street trees,\
    \ green roofs and pocket parks from\nbuilt surfaces [19].\nAdvancing upon the\
    \ revolutionary legacy of the open-access Landsat missions [20],\nthe European\
    \ Space Agency (ESA) and Copernicus Programme have delivered globally\nconsistent\
    \ optical and radar data from the Sentinel satellites (10–20 m resolution) since\n\
    2014. Together with the advances in machine learning algorithms and cloud computing\n\
    platforms for Earth observation, such as Google Earth Engine (GEE) [21] and openEO\
    \ [22],\nthe Sentinel satellites have enabled large-scale mapping of LULC at a\
    \ 10 m resolution [2].\nSince 2021, there have been three global Sentinel-based\
    \ 10 m LULC maps released, including\nGoogle’s Dynamic World (DW) [23], ESA’s\
    \ World Cover 2020 (WC) [24] and Esri’s 2020\nLand Cover (Esri) [25]. All three\
    \ products have the vision of being multi-temporal, with\nWC and Esri being annually\
    \ updated, but only DW is operationally delivering near real-\ntime LULC maps\
    \ as new Sentinel-2 scenes become available (every 5 days). Esri and DW\nwere\
    \ both developed from deep learning models trained on the same reference dataset\
    \ of\nover 5 billion hand-annotated Sentinel-2 pixel patches from 24,000 individual\
    \ image tiles\n(510 × 510 pixels each) distributed over the world [23]. In contrast,\
    \ WC was produced with\na random forest classiﬁcation tree algorithm trained on\
    \ hand-labeled pixels in 100 × 100 m\ngrids at 141,000 unique locations distributed\
    \ over the world [24]. WC also included both\nSentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data as\
    \ predictors in their model. Furthermore, a noteworthy\ndifference is that the\
    \ DW and Esri reference dataset was digitized with a minimum mapping\nunit (MMU)\
    \ of 250 m2, while the WC reference dataset was digitized with an MMU of 100 m2.\n\
    To date, there have been no systematic evaluations of the three global 10 m LULC\n\
    products with reference to one another. Given the importance of global LULC maps\n\
    for various applications, and the large differences in the production of the recent\
    \ 10 m\nproducts, we aimed to compare DW, WC and Esri global LULC maps in terms\
    \ of their\nspatial correspondence with one another and their global and regional\
    \ accuracy. To quantify\naccuracy at the global scale, we used the hand-annotated\
    \ validation dataset published\nalongside DW. We supplemented this with a regional\
    \ reference dataset of in situ point-based\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 4101\n3 of\
    \ 19\nsurvey data on LULC across the European Union. We discuss how spatial correspondence\n\
    and accuracy vary across LULC classes, biomes and human settlement types and explore\n\
    key limitations and advantages of the three datasets.\n2. Materials and Methods\n\
    2.1. Land Cover Data Processing\nData pre-processing and extraction took place\
    \ in GEE [21] and fed into our complete\nworkflow, as outlined in Figure 1. Data\
    \ analysis and visualization were performed in R [26].\nThe WC and Esri global\
    \ land cover datasets for 2020 are available in the GEE official and\ncommunity\
    \ data catalogs. However, DW is provided as a collection of classified Sentinel-\n\
    2 images with less than 35% cloud cover, as defined by the ‘CLOUDY_PIXEL_PERCENTAGE’\n\
    scene metadata property. Each image has a ‘label’ band with a discrete classiﬁcation\
    \ of\nLULC, but also 9 probability bands with class-speciﬁc probability scores\
    \ generated by the\ndeep learning model on the basis of the pixel’s spatial context.\
    \ To generate an annual LULC\ncomposite comparable with WC and Esri, we calculated\
    \ the mode of the predicted LULC\nclass in the ‘label’ band of all DW images for\
    \ 2020. We also tested annual compositing by\ncalculating the mean and median\
    \ probability scores for all LULC classes during the year\nand then classifying\
    \ by taking the class with the highest probability score per pixel. We\nfound\
    \ no difference in overall accuracy using the alternative methods (Figure S1),\
    \ and,\nbecause the mode composite on the ‘label’ band was more computationally\
    \ efﬁcient, we\ndecided to use that global composite for further analysis. The\
    \ land cover typologies were\nidentical for DW and Esri; however, we converted\
    \ the WC typology to match DW and Esri\nby aggregating four LULC classes, as outlined\
    \ in Table 1. The three global 10 m LULC maps\n(Figure 2) were used to assess\
    \ spatial correspondence and accuracy, as outlined below.\nTable 1. Classiﬁcation\

    \ strongly the global LULC products corresponded to one another over\nspace, we\
    \ quantiﬁed and compared class-wise LULC area sums that were aggregated to an\n\
    equal-area hexagonal grid (70,000 km2), which covered the globe. The size of the\
    \ grid was\nchosen based on a trade-off between computation time and precision\
    \ of area aggregation.\nPixels were aggregated over mutually overlapping extents\
    \ and image masks across the\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 4101\n7 of 19\nthree LULC\
    \ products. To quantify correspondence between products, for each LULC class\n\
    and unique hexagonal grid cell, we calculate the proportional share of each product’s\n\
    area estimation. Perfect correspondence resulted in a proportional ratio of 0.33:0.33:0.33\n\
    or 33% proportional share for each product. We deﬁned strong correspondence when\
    \ no\nsingle product’s proportional share of the LULC class area exceeded 40%\
    \ in a grid cell.\nTherefore, weak correspondence was when the maximum difference\
    \ between the product\nwith the biggest and smallest proportional share was greater\
    \ than 20%. We visualized\nthese proportional shares for each hexagon over the\
    \ globe by assigning a color code along\na tri-color gradient using the tricolore\
    \ (v1.2.2.) package in R. The relative abundance of\nthe given LULC class (average\
    \ of the three products’ area estimates) was mapped to the\nopacity of each hexagon\
    \ grid so that areas where the LULC is abundant appear opaque\nand those where\
    \ the LULC is less abundant are transparent.\n2.3. Accuracy Assessment\nTo quantify\
    \ the accuracy of the three LULC products, we used two sources of open-\naccess\
    \ reference data (Figure 3). The ﬁrst source was from the ground truth validation\n\
    dataset produced by the Dynamic World team, which included a group of annotators\n\
    (manual labeling of LULC types using visual interpretation of high-resolution\
    \ reference\nimagery) supported by the National Geographic Society in partnership\
    \ with Google\nand the World Resources Institute [23]. This team consisted of\
    \ 25 expert and 45 non-\nexpert annotators who together annotated approximately\
    \ 24,000 individual image tiles of\n510 × 510 pixels from Sentinel-2 imagery from\
    \ random dates in 2019. Annotators followed\nthe typology deﬁnitions outlined\
    \ in the ﬁrst column of Table 1 and were instructed to\nconsider an MMU of 250\
    \ m2, which, by deﬁnition, included mosaics of distinct landscape\nelements within;\
    \ for example, buildings, trees and grass within a 250 m2 area might be\nlabeled\
    \ as “built area”. From the annotated dataset, a stratiﬁed random subsample of\n\
    409 Sentinel-2 tiles were withheld from the training of the DW deep learning model\
    \ and\nused for validation. The validation tiles included expert consensus labels\
    \ where all three\nexperts agreed, or where two experts agreed and the third had\
    \ no opinion or where\none expert had an opinion and the other two did not. We\
    \ used this dataset constituting\n72 million distinct 10 × 10 m pixels for global\
    \ accuracy assessment of the three LULC\nproducts (Figure 3A). WC used a completely\
    \ different reference dataset for training and\nvalidation of their model, which\
    \ is not open-access, and, thus, we could not use it in the\npresent analysis.\
    \ Esri used the same reference dataset as DW to train and validate their\nLULC\
    \ model; however, the sub-set of tiles they used for validating their map was\
    \ not\nopen-access, and, therefore, we cannot be sure that the 409 validation\
    \ tiles we use here\nwere in fact independent from the dataset used to train the\
    \ Esri LULC model.\nFigure 3. Distribution of the global (A) and regional (B)\
    \ reference data locations. Locations in (A)\nrepresent Sentinel-2 image tiles\
    \ of 510 × 510 pixels, which were manually annotated ex situ. Locations\nin (B)\
    \ are grid points sampled in situ in the LUCAS area survey. Inset bar plot shows\
    \ the number of\nreference samples per LULC class.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 4101\n\
    8 of 19\nThe second source of reference data was a regional dataset from the Land\
    \ Use/Cover\nArea Frame Survey (LUCAS) over the European Union (Figure 3B). LUCAS\
    \ is a systematic\ngrid of 337,845 points that are visited triennially for the\
    \ collection of in situ land cover and\nland use data [27]. In contrast to the\
    \ DW ground truth dataset described above, LUCAS\nsurveyors are instructed to\
    \ record the land cover within a 1.5 m circle at each point in\nthe grid, and,\
    \ therefore, when applied to Earth observation, it consists of a signiﬁcantly\n\
    smaller MMU. We used the 2018 LUCAS dataset with the ﬁrst-level classiﬁcation\
    \ with the\nexception of removing “G50: glaciers and permanent snow” from the\
    \ water category into\nits own category to match the “snow and ice” category in\
    \ the global LULC maps (Table 2).\nTable 2. Classiﬁcation typology of the LUCAS\

    \ using the RESOLVE biore-\ngions dataset [28], while human settlement type was\
    \ derived from the Global Human\nSettlement Layers, Settlement Grid [29]. We constructed\

    \ and producer’s/recall accuracy and\noverall accuracies.\n2.4. Implementation\
    \ Details\nData were summarized and/or extracted from GEE using the JavaScript\
    \ API. The data\nwere summarized by a global grid created using the dgggridR (v2.0.3)\

    3. Results\n3.1. Spatial Correspondence\nThe area estimates for built area, crops,\
    \ trees and water showed strong correspondence\nbetween the three global LULC\
    \ products, particularly in areas with the greatest relative\nabundance of the\
    \ given LULC class (i.e., gray areas with bordered grid cells in Figure 4).\n\
    However, for some regions, there were discrepancies between products; for example,\
    \ DW\nover-estimated the crop cover in the western USA, Kazakhstan and Mongolia\
    \ relative to\nthe other LULC products.\nThe LULC classes with the lowest correspondence\
    \ between global products were bare\nground, grass, scrub and shrub (Figure 4).\
    \ DW estimated higher proportions of bare ground\nin mid- to lower latitudes,\
    \ whereas WC estimated more bare ground in higher latitudes\n(Figure 4C). WC consistently\
    \ estimated greater grass cover than DW and Esri across most\nof the world, except\
    \ for over the taiga in Russia (Figure 4D). Conversely, the Esri product\nestimated\
    \ greater shrub and scrub cover across the world except for a small section in\n\
    Canada and the savanna-forest ecotone in central Africa (Figure 4E).\nThe LULC\
    \ classes ﬂooded vegetation, and snow and ice exhibited notable disagree-\nments\
    \ between products for the northern latitudes (Figure 4G,I). Esri estimated the\
    \ highest\nproportions of ﬂooded vegetation over North America, whereas WC estimated\
    \ the high-\nest proportions over Russia. DW estimated signiﬁcantly more snow\
    \ and ice cover than\nboth WC and Esri over the whole of the Northern Hemisphere,\
    \ apart from areas that are\npermanently snow-covered (e.g., Greenland) or snow-free\
    \ (e.g., Sahara desert) (Figure 4I).\n3.2. Accuracy\nUsing the global ground truth\
    \ dataset with a minimum mapping unit of 250 m2, we\nfound that Esri had the highest\
    \ overall accuracy (75%) compared to DW (72%) and WC\n(65%; Table 3; Figure 5).\
    \ Across all the LULC products, water was consistently the most\naccurately mapped\
    \ class (balanced accuracy 92%; mean of precision and recall Figure 5),\nfollowed\
    \ by built area (83%), trees (81%) and crops (78%). In contrast, bare ground (57%),\n\
    grass (34%), shrub and scrub (47%) and ﬂooded vegetation (53%) were mapped with\
    \ the\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 4101\n10 of 19\nlowest accuracies (Figure 5). The\
    \ accuracies across all the LULC products were generally\nlowest in the tundra\
    \ biome, where grass, bare ground, shrub and scrub and crops were\nmis-classiﬁed\
    \ and had the lowest recall and precision accuracies. The accuracies were\nthe\
    \ highest in temperate and boreal forests, where crops, trees and built area had\
    \ the\nhighest accuracies. There was very little difference in overall accuracy\
    \ between urban,\nrural and uninhabited areas, with the exception that trees had\
    \ lower precision in urban\nareas compared to rural and uninhabited areas, particularly\
    \ for WC (40% lower) and DW\n(20% lower). Differences in accuracy between the\
    \ continents were small; however, when\naveraged across LULC products, the accuracies\
    \ were highest in North America and lowest\nin Africa (Figure 6).\nFigure 4. Spatial\
    \ correspondence between global 10 m land cover maps for each of 9 land cover\n\
    classes. The proportion of land cover within each hexagonal grid cell is calculated\
    \ for each LULC\nproduct and then visualized along a tri-color gradient illustrating\
    \ the proportional share of areas\nestimated by each LULC product. Gray areas\
    \ indicate strong correspondence, whereas colored areas\nreﬂect dominance of one\
    \ LULC product. Gric cells outlined in black indicate strong correspondence,\n\
    deﬁned as cases where no single LULC product has more than 40% share of the combined\
    \ area within\nthe grid cell. The opacity of the grid cells indicates the absolute\
    \ percentage abundance of each LULC\nclass averaged over the three LULC classes.\
    \ Opaque areas have near-maximum percentage cover for\nthat LULC class, whereas\
    \ transparent areas have very low percentage cover.\nTable 3. Summary of overall\

    4.1. Explaining the Differences between Global LULC Products\nThe production of\
    \ global LULC maps is inherently difﬁcult due to the extensive\nbiogeographical\
    \ variations within and across biomes that lead to diverse spectral signatures\n\
    within a single LULC class [30]. In this sense, it is not surprising that three\
    \ global LULC\nmaps produced by three independent groups have large differences\
    \ in accuracy and spatial\ncorrespondence. Below, we attempt to explain some of\
    \ the main differences as presented in\nour results.\n4.1.1. Minimum Mapping Unit\n\
    The global LULC maps had contrasting accuracies when validated against the global\n\
    versus regional reference datasets (Figure 5 versus Figure 7). While Esri and\
    \ DW were\nmost accurate at the global scale, WC was most accurate at the European\
    \ scale. Apart from\nthe spatial extent, the most important difference between\
    \ the reference datasets used to\nvalidate the LULC maps is the MMU used to collect\
    \ ground truth information. The global\nvalidation dataset was digitized ex situ\
    \ (i.e., based on visual interpretation of satellite\nimagery) using an MMU of\
    \ 250 m2 (i.e., 50 × 50 m square), whereas the regional validation\ndataset (LUCAS)\
    \ was collected in situ for point circles with a radius of 1.5 m (MMU <100 m).\n\
    We suspect that the main reason Esri and DW had higher accuracies than WC at the\
    \ global\nscale was because Esri and DW were produced from models trained on reference\
    \ data\nwith an MMU unit of 250 m2, while WC was trained on data with an MMU of\
    \ 100 m2. We\nalso posit that this difference in MMU is partially responsible\
    \ for the difference in LULC\nclassiﬁcation granularity at the landscape scale.\
    \ For instance, the inset maps in Figure 2\nreveal how Esri and DW predictions\
    \ are more clustered and generalized compared to WC,\nwhich exhibits more of the\
    \ ‘salt and pepper’ characteristic of pixel-based classiﬁcation\ntechniques. Urban\
    \ gardens and trees are incorporated into the “built area” cluster of pixels\n\
    in DW and Esri maps, while they are labeled as “grass” or “trees” in WC. This\
    \ illustrates\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 4101\n13 of 19\nwhy WC is 10% more accurate\
    \ than Esri and DW when classifying built areas across Europe\nusing the point-based\
    \ LUCAS dataset as a reference (Figure 7).\n4.1.2. Classiﬁcation Typology\nAnother\
    \ factor leading to differences between global LULC products is the classiﬁca-\n\
    tion typology used. For the purposes of cross-comparison, we harmonized all three\
    \ LULC\nproducts to a nine-class typology (Table 1). Even though this is a much\
    \ simpler typology\nthan other regional LULC datasets (e.g., CORINE land cover\
    \ [31]), there remain signiﬁcant\nchallenges in distinguishing spectrally similar\
    \ classes, such as bare ground, grass, shrub\nand scrub, a ﬁnding often echoed\
    \ in the literature [16,32,33]. These classes are not only\ndifﬁcult for satellite-based\
    \ machine learning models to distinguish but also for human\nannotators using\
    \ aerial or satellite imagery for visual interpretation. For instance, there\n\
    was large disagreement between expert and non-expert labelers involved in developing\
    \ the\ntraining dataset for DW and Esri [23]. A pixel-based comparison of expert\
    \ and non-expert\nannotations revealed a recall rate (producer’s accuracy) as\
    \ low as 22% for grass and 31% for\nbare ground. Although WC did not publish a\
    \ similar uncertainty assessment of its annota-\ntion team, it is reasonable to\
    \ assume their reference dataset suffered from the same error.\nIt is known that,\
    \ even with in situ LULC labeling (i.e., ﬁeld-based ground truth), similar\nerrors\
    \ due to sampler bias may exist. For instance, the European Environment Agency\n\
    discovered that CORINE-2000 accuracy was boosted by 6.4% following post-screening\
    \ and\ncleaning of erroneous LULC labels in the LUCAS dataset [34]. This partly\
    \ explains why\nthe spatial correspondence between global LULC products and class-level\
    \ accuracy was\ngenerally poorest for bare ground, grass and shrub and scrub cover\
    \ (Figures 4 and 5).\nAnother source of discrepancy between LULC products is the\
    \ slight difference in\nLULC deﬁnitions for certain classes (see descriptions\
    \ in Table 1). For instance, the ﬂooded\nvegetation class in DW and Esri includes\
    \ rice paddies and irrigated/inundated agricul-\nture. In WC, this type of cropland\
    \ is included in the cropland class. Furthermore, the\nDW reference dataset deﬁnes\
    \ the shrub and scrub class relatively broadly as clusters of\nplants that are\
    \ dispersed over an area without any speciﬁcation of cover percentage (“ . . .\n\
    moderate to sparse cover of bushes, shrubs, and tufts of grass”) [23]. This is\
    \ different to the\nWC typology, where grass, bare ground and shrub/scrub are\
    \ deﬁned using speciﬁc cover\npercentages (“ . . . shrubs having a cover of 10%\
    \ or more. Shrubs are deﬁned as woody\nperennial plants with persistent and woody\
    \ stems and without any deﬁned main stem\nbeing less than 5 m tall”) [24].\n4.1.3.\
    \ Modeling and Validation Methods\nAt the global scale, the accuracies of DW,\
    \ WC and Esri were different to one another\n(Figure 5) and also different to\
    \ the independent accuracies reported by the data providers\nthemselves: DW 72%\
    \ versus reported 74%; WC 65% versus reported 74%; Esri 75% versus\n85%. The discrepancy\
    \ for DW is likely due to the fact that we aggregated LULC predictions\nto an\
    \ annual composite for 2020 (using the mode of the ‘label’ band), whereas the\
    \ DW\nvalidation report used scene-level model predictions for Sentinel-2 tiles\
    \ in 2019. The WC\ndataset was produced and validated with a completely different\
    \ reference dataset with a\ndifferent MMU to the DW validation tiles used here.\
    \ The metadata published with the Esri\ndataset is incomplete, and, thus, we do\
    \ not know which reference data were withheld from\nmodel training and whether\
    \ the 409 validation tiles used here were indeed independent\nfrom the Esri training\
    \ dataset. If it is the case that the validation data used here had been\npart\
    \ of the data used to train the Esri deep learning model, then it is possible\
    \ that our\nestimates of the Esri map accuracy are overly optimistic.\nThe DW\
    \ and Esri maps were produced using a deep learning model, whereas WC\nwas produced\
    \ using a random forest classiﬁcation. This difference in modeling framework\n\
    likely explains some of the difference in accuracy between LULC products. Deep\
    \ learning\nmodels, such as the fully convolutional neural network employed in\
    \ DW, take the pixel\ncontext into account when making inferences, whereas random\
    \ forest does not. This,\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 4101\n14 of 19\ntogether with\
    \ the difference in MMU, explains why the DW and Esri maps are clustered\nand\
    \ generalized at a landscape scale (inset maps Figure 2).\nFinally, we acknowledge\
    \ that we are using reference data from 2019 (global) and 2018\n(European) that\
    \ do not align with the year of the LULC maps (2020) and that this may lead\n\
    to discrepancies between the validation set and the reality on the ground in 2020.\
    \ However,\nwe suspect these changes to be minimal, and any bias introduced should\
    \ be consistent\nacross global LULC products. Furthermore, even the WC reference\
    \ dataset, which is not\nopen-access, faces the same limitation as it was collected\
    \ for the year 2015 and used to\ncreate and validate the WC map for the year 2020.\n\
    4.2. Recommendations for Users\nThe cross-comparison results presented here indicate\
    \ that there is no “one-size-ﬁts-all”\nwhen it comes to global LULC maps and their\
    \ potential application. We ﬁnd differences in\naccuracy across spatial scales\
    \ (global versus regional), LULC classes, continents, biomes\nand urban settlement\
    \ types. Therefore, an overall recommendation is to carefully evaluate\nthe global\
    \ LULC products with respect to the aforementioned factors and how they relate\n\
    to the application requirements. We note that it is also possible to use all three\
    \ LULC\nproducts in combination by creating some form of majority vote or weighted\
    \ average.\nNevertheless, we make some general recommendations for users of either\
    \ DW, Esri or WC\nor a combination thereof:\n•\nRegardless of LULC product, users\
    \ should implement design-based inference when\ncalculating LULC areas or changes\
    \ and avoid drawing conclusions from simple ‘pixel-\ncounting’, which leads to\
    \ biased area estimates [35]. Design-based inference involves\ngenerating a post-classiﬁcation\
    \ reference (validation or “ground truth”) sample that is\nimplemented with a\
    \ probability sampling design (e.g., simple random or stratiﬁed\nrandom), which\
    \ can be used to quantify unbiased area and accuracy estimates.\n•\nIn general,\
    \ users can rely on water, built area, trees and crops being mapped with the\n\
    highest accuracy, while shrub and scrub, grass, bare ground and ﬂooded vegetation\n\
    have the lowest accuracies. With this in mind, it may be beneﬁcial to simplify\
    \ the\nLULC typology by merging classes with low accuracies into aggregate classes\
    \ if your\nuse-case allows it.\n•\nUsers should be aware of the biases in global\
    \ LULC products (reported relative to\none another). Speciﬁcally, WC is biased\
    \ toward estimating greater grass cover, Esri\ntowards shrub and scrub cover and\
    \ DW towards snow and ice.\n•\nLULC classiﬁcation accuracy varies by biome, continent\
    \ and urban settlement type,\nand, therefore, users may consult Figures 4–6 here\
    \ to gather information on what to\nexpect given the local context of their work.\n\
    •\nWC is most appropriate when considering an MMU of <100 m2 or when a user wants\n\
    to resolve smaller landscape elements. For example, WC is advantageous in urban\n\
    areas and complex agricultural landscapes with small or thin vegetation structures,\n\
    such as trees or hedge rows.\n•\nBased on our supplementary analysis of the DW\
    \ compositing method (Figure S1), we\nﬁnd that the type of temporal aggregation\
    \ of DW predictions has very little effect on\nglobal and regional accuracy. However,\
    \ we note that changing the seasonal extent of\ntemporal aggregation (e.g., growing-season\
    \ composite) may have signiﬁcant effects\non accuracy (although we did not test\
    \ this here).\n•\nThe delivery format of DW in near real-time, covering the entire\
    \ Sentinel-2 image\ncollection and including LULC class-speciﬁc probability scores,\
    \ is qualitatively unique\nfrom Esri and WC, which only produce annual LULC maps\
    \ without probability scores.\nWe encourage users to take advantage of this unique\
    \ aspect to DW by exploring novel\npossibilities discussed in the section below.\n\
    Remote Sens. 2022, 14, 4101\n15 of 19\n4.3. Potential for Future Research\nAlthough\
    \ our analysis provides important information about global model accuracies,\n\
    it remains to be seen which LULC product provides area change estimates with the\
    \ least\namount of error as measured using design-based inference for area estimation\
    \ [35,36].\nQuantifying conﬁdence intervals around area estimates or area change\
    \ estimates is nec-\nessary for the adoption of LULC products in policy mechanisms,\
    \ such as the REDD+ [13]\nreporting on deforestation or the SEEA ecosystem accounting\
    \ [14]. It is, therefore, of interest\nto test DW, Esri and WC (as well as other\
    \ multi-temporal medium resolution maps (e.g.,\nFriedl et al., 2022 [37]) in terms\
    \ of how accurately they estimate changes in LULC at various\nspatial and temporal\
    \ scales. However, design-based inference can be time-consuming and\ncostly. A\
    \ requirement for design-based inference is an explicitly speciﬁed population,\
    \ and,\nin the context of evaluating map accuracy, this population often refers\
    \ to a population of\npixels included in a map and given different class labels.\
    \ This population varies spatially\nand temporally depending on the project scope,\
    \ and, therefore, a probability-based sample\nneeds to be generated for making\
    \ an inference each time the project scope changes. The\nprobability scores provided\
    \ by DW may allow for more efﬁcient alternatives to design-\nbased inference.\
    \ Sales et al., 2021 [38] have shown that averaging class probability scores\n\
    from a random forest model can give area estimates that are substantially less\
    \ biased than\n‘pixel-counting’ and almost as precise as design-based methods.\
    \ The same might be true of\nDW class probability scores. Furthermore, there is\
    \ also scope to use DW probability scores\nto estimate per-pixel classiﬁcation\
    \ accuracy [39,40].\nThe probability scores available in the DW product provide\
    \ scope for several other\navenues of further research and tailored LULC classiﬁcation.\
    \ Firstly, they can be aggregated\nover time frames relevant to the application\
    \ task. For example, annual composites might\nbe appropriate for some tasks, while\
    \ summer or winter mosaics might be appropriate for\nothers. Secondly, users can\
    \ apply custom thresholds or more complex decision frameworks\nto the predicted\
    \ probabilities in order to derive continuous or discrete LULC outputs\n(Figure\
    \ 8C). For example, this type of thresholding can be used to generate surface\
    \ water\nextent data much more frequently than the global surface water (GSW)\
    \ dataset without\nany update lags (currently up to 18 months). Thirdly, users\
    \ can train their own local\nmachine learning models using DW probability scores\
    \ and custom reference data as the\ninput (Figure 8D). This may allow for changing\
    \ the LULC typology or resolving ﬁner-scale\nlandscape elements that are not present\
    \ in the default DW ‘label’ band. Users that explore\ncustom models, such as DNN\
    \ architectures, may also try different loss functions that result\nin predictions\
    \ that are less clustered and able to resolve ﬁner details. For example, Lang\n\
    et al., 2022 [41] use GEDI reference data at 25 m but produce a tree canopy height\
    \ model at a\n10 m resolution. Fourthly, frequency and near real-time availability\
    \ of the class probability\nscores allow for application of advanced time series\
    \ analysis, such as LandTrendr (Landsat-\nbased detection of trends in disturbance\
    \ and recovery) and CCDC (continuous change\ndetection and classiﬁcation) [42].\n\
    There are several spheres of application for which 10 m LULC maps are particularly\n\
    well-suited. Urban ecology and climate science is one such area because landscape\
    \ compo-\nsition and structure often manifest at scales of 10 m or less. In an\
    \ increasingly urbanizing\nplanet, it is important to accurately monitor global\
    \ and regional urban extent for planning\npurposes. How these newer-generation\
    \ datasets compare to existing estimates across re-\ngions is still largely unknown\
    \ [43]. There is also potential for using DW to quantify seasonal\nland cover\
    \ dynamics (e.g., including urban vegetation phenology [44]) within cities, which\n\
    is not possible with static annual LULC maps. The spatial compositions of LULC\
    \ and LULC\nchanges are important for modeling landscape connectivity and biodiversity\
    \ community\ndynamics [45]. Urban ecology may, therefore, beneﬁt from comparing\
    \ the landscape metrics\nthat result from global 10 m LULC maps.\nRemote Sens.\
    \ 2022, 14, 4101\n16 of 19\n \nexplore custom models, such as DNN architectures,\
    \ may also try different loss functions \nthat result in predictions that are\
    \ less clustered and able to resolve finer details. For exam-\nple, Lang et al.,\
    \ 2022 [41] use GEDI reference data at 25 m but produce a tree canopy height \n\
    model at a 10 m resolution. Fourthly, frequency and near real-time availability\
    \ of the class \nprobability scores allow for application of advanced time series\
    \ analysis, such as Land-\nTrendr (Landsat-based detection of trends in disturbance\
    \ and recovery) and CCDC (con-\ntinuous change detection and classification) [42].\

    \ forest \nmodel trained on LUCAS reference data and Dynamic World class probabilities\
    \ are shown in (D), \nillustrating the possibility of resolving smaller landscape\
    \ elements. \nThere are several spheres of application for which 10 m LULC maps\
    \ are particularly \nwell-suited. Urban ecology and climate science is one such\
    \ area because landscape com-\nposition and structure often manifest at scales\
    \ of 10 m or less. In an increasingly urbaniz-\ning planet, it is important to\
    \ accurately monitor global and regional urban extent for \nFigure 8. Example\
    \ of the ﬂexibility inherent in the Dynamic World data format, which includes\n\
    multi-temporal class probability estimates. An urban landscape in Prague, Czechia\

    \ tree cover (C). The predictions from a random forest model\ntrained on LUCAS\
    \ reference data and Dynamic World class probabilities are shown in (D), illustrating\n\
    the possibility of resolving smaller landscape elements.\nEcosystem accounting\
    \ is another application where multi-temporal 10 m LULC maps\nmay prove particularly\
    \ useful. Many have highlighted the need for remote-sensing-based\napproaches\
    \ to implement ecosystem extent-condition accounting in ecosystem services\nmapping\
    \ for ecosystem accounts [46]. A challenge for ecosystem accounting has been\n\
    that biophysical mapping of ecosystem services at a national level has relied\
    \ on discrete\ncategories of land cover types typical of traditional LULC maps.\
    \ Therefore, ecosystem\nservice models have not been sensitive to transitional\
    \ or successional changes from one\nLULC type to another typical of ecological\
    \ gradients or continuums [47]. It is possible\nthat DW probability scores can\
    \ detect continuous gradients in ecosystem accounting and\nthat LULC probability\
    \ can be thought of as a higher-level structural composition indicator\nwithin\
    \ the ecosystem condition typology. Area-weighted probabilities have been computed\n\
    for biodiversity indices but typically at much coarser spatial levels [48]. It\
    \ is possible that\nLULC class probabilities could be applied to some standard\
    \ ecosystem services (required\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 4101\n17 of 19\nby EUROSTAT)\
    \ in decreasing order of accuracy, including (i) biomass, carbon storage and\n\
    sequestration, air ﬁltration, run-off control; (ii) somewhat less for local climate\
    \ regulation\nand landscape aesthetics/greenview exposure and (iii) even less\
    \ for crop pollination and\nrecreation potential. Therefore, class probability\
    \ scores could allow a merging of the extent-\ncondition account for the purpose\
    \ of more accurate ecosystem service computation (i.e.,\nreducing the information\
    \ loss in using threshold levels for classifying LULC types for the\nextent account\
    \ on its own—moving from Figure 8C to Figure 8D).\n5. Conclusions\nLULC mapping\
    \ at global extents has been revolutionized by the plethora of medium-\nresolution\
    \ satellite data available from programs such as Landsat and Sentinel. In our\n\
    cross-comparison of global 10 m resolution LULC maps, we found large inaccuracies\
    \ and\nspatial and thematic biases in each product that vary across biomes, continents\
    \ and human\nsettlement types. Our overarching recommendation is to critically\
    \ evaluate each LULC\nproduct with reference to the application purpose. We highlight\
    \ the novelty of DW as a\nglobal near real-time LULC product with class probability\
    \ scores. LULC types, regardless\nof deﬁnition and type system, share with ecosystems\
    \ the property that their composition,\nstructure and processes often vary in\
    \ a gradual, continuous manner over space and time.\nWe suggest that the DW probability\
    \ scores offer a fundamental shift in land cover mapping\nfrom categorical to\
    \ continuum concepts.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information\

    • Different data-driven methods are compared in estimating soil temperatures (ST).
    • Climatic data from two stations are used as inputs to the models. • The ELM
    models provide the best estimates. • Adding periodicity into the models'' inputs
    considerably increase their accuracies. Abstract In knowledge-based decision-support
    systems, soil temperature (ST) estimation can be considered as the core modeling
    task used for investigating the dynamics of solar energy exchange between the
    land surface and the sub-surface soil layers. In addition, the impacts of meteorological
    processes on energy uptake into the underlying soils and the design of more resilient
    and sustainable agricultural systems for improved crop health and resource management.
    In this paper, monthly ST estimation at various soil depths (i.e., 5, 50 and 100 cm)
    is performed by applying data-intelligent machine learning models: extreme learning
    machine (ELM), artificial neural network (ANN) and M5 Model Tree (M5 Tree). The
    predictive models are trained using meteorological information from two stations
    (i.e., Mersin and Adana, Turkey). The models are constructed using monthly input
    variables, including air temperature (T-air), windspeed (W), relative humidity
    (RH), solar radiation (SR), while the objective variable is the soil temperature
    measurement at 5, 50 and 100 cm depths for the period 1986–2010. Multi-objective
    performance criteria are applied to diagnose the predictive accuracy of the data-intelligent
    models, entailing the correlation coefficient (R), root mean square error (RMSE),
    mean absolute error (MAE), Willmott''s Index (WI), Nash Sutcliffe''s coefficient
    (Nash) and the Legates & McCabe''s Index (LMI). Based on the tested dataset, the
    ELM model is yielded the most accurate performance for Mersin station compared
    to the lower performance of ANN and M5 Tree models. For this case, the most accurate
    performance is attained for the ST estimation at a depth of 50 cm, with the highest
    value of R = 0.992, WI = 0.999, Nash = 0.981, LMI = 0.879 and the lowest value
    of the relative RMSE and MAE values (i.e., 4.7 and 4.0%, respectively), attained
    using T-air, W, RH and periodicity as the predictor variables. The performance
    results for the Adana station behave differently, where ELM is seen to exceed
    the ANN and M5 Tree models for ST estimation at the depths of 5 and 100 cm. On
    the other hand, the ANN model performs marginally better than the ELM and the
    M5 Tree model at a depth of 50 cm with a different set of input combinations.
    The assessment of the estimation skills reveals the efficacy of the ELM over the
    counterpart benchmark models. In accordance with the present results, it is concluded
    that ELM model can be applied as an ideal decision-support tool for soil temperature
    estimation at multiple depths, whilst ensuring that an appropriate combination
    of meteorological inputs is applied to yield an optimal model. Previous article

    1. Introduction Soil temperature is a micro-meteorological property that assumes
    an imperative role in environmental management and bio-meteorological processes,
    acting to balance the interaction of heat energy between the atmosphere and the
    land surface (Keshavarzi et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2009). In addition, soil temperature
    has a significant role in different ecosystems, including forests and deserts,
    agricultural applications, and various water resources and hydrologic engineering
    aspects (Lai et al., 2012; Peng et al., 2009). The estimation of soil temperature
    is very important for agriculture, and this property is greatly affected by the
    different environmental factors that include meteorological parameters, such as
    solar radiation, air temperature, physical soil parameters (surface albedo, water
    content, soil texture and capacity of infiltration; topographical variables) and
    the other land surface characteristics (Kang et al., 2000; Liang et al., 2014).
    Recently, the implementation of soft computing models has shown a remarkable progress
    on earth science researches (Chen et al., 2015; Diop et al., 2018; Elzwayie et
    al., 2016; Gholami et al., 2015; Hameed et al., 2016; Taormina et al., 2015; Wang
    et al., 2015). Within the topic of soil temperature simulations, there are several
    previous studies that have accomplished an acceptable degree of success in this
    regard. Different statistical interpolation methods and various modeling techniques
    have been used, including the multiple linear regression (MLR), gene expression
    programming (GEP), adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), stepwise regression
    (SR) and the genetic programming (GP)-based models (Jebamalar et al., 2012; Kim
    and Singh, 2014; Kisi et al., 2016; Mehdizadeh et al., 2017). One of the earliest
    research conducted on soil temperature estimation conducted by (Yang et al., 1997),
    they developed a model to estimate ST at different depths (i.e., 10, 50 and 150 cm)
    using the application of ANN technique. In that study, five years of climatic-based
    input data, measured at a weather station at the Central Experimental Farm in
    Ottawa, Ontario, Canada were used. George (2001) applied an ANN model to estimate
    weekly scale of ST, assuming that the ST data was affected by the relative humidity,
    wind speed and air temperature. A single layer neural network was considered,
    which incorporated the McCulloch-Pitts type neuronal system with the Widdrow-Hoff
    algorithm applied to train the network. A estimation of daily ST data at six depths
    (i.e., 5, 10, 20, 30, 50 and 100 cm) at the four stations of Iran conducted by
    (Tabari et al., 2011). In this study, the artificial neural network model was
    developed by using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model and tested in an arid
    region where only four climatic datasets, comprised of: air temperature, solar
    radiation, relative humidity and precipitation were used as the model''s inputs.
    Bilgili et al. (2013) estimated monthly mean ST data by using a nonlinear regression,
    linear regression and MLR model for different soil depths (i.e., 5, 10, 20, 50
    and 100 cm) where the greatest accuracy was found at a depth of 5 cm. Wu et al.
    (2013) estimated the monthly mean ST data at the depth of 10 cm by using the ANN
    method. The study of Napagoda and Tilakaratne (2012) used an MLP model to estimate
    ST at different depths of 5 cm and 10 cm in the Bathalagoda area. Ozturk et al.
    (2011) developed a set of data-intelligent models for the monthly estimation of
    ST data using the classical MLP at different depths with standard geographical
    and meteorological data including altitude, latitude, longitude, month, year,
    monthly solar radiation, monthly sunshine duration and monthly mean air temperature.
    Bilgili (2011) developed a set of models to estimate monthly mean ST with an ANN
    algorithm based on SR at Izmir in Turkey where a total of 7 neighboring measuring
    stations data were adopted in the model development and the model evaluation phases.
    All the studies mentioned above used ANN method which has some disadvantages (e.g.,
    slower in learning, higher computation time and less accuracy) compared to ELM.
    In another study, Mehdizadeh et al. (2017) compared an ANN, ANFIS and GEP methods
    to estimate monthly mean soil temperature, where the best accuracy was obtained
    from the ANFIS model. Hosseinzadeh Talaee (2014) estimated daily ST by using an
    ANFIS model using meteorological data at different depths in the region of Isfahan,
    Iran. In this study, the best ST estimations were obtained using ANFIS model,
    which included the Takagi–Sugeno–Kang (TSK) model that used Gaussian membership
    function. Abyaneh et al. (2016) applied an ANN model and a co-active neuro fuzzy
    inference system (CANFIS) for an estimation of ST using air temperature time series
    in different (i.e., dry and humid) climate in Iran. The developed ANN model resulted
    in a good accuracy for the dry climate. Kisi et al. (2016) used an ANN, ANFIS,
    and the GP model to estimate the monthly ST at different depths using climatic
    data of air temperature, wind speed, solar radiation, and relative humidity in
    Adana and Mersin in Turkey and showed that the GP model mostly performed better
    than the ANN and ANFIS in monthly ST. However, the ANN models outperformed the
    ANFIS and GP model for estimating the monthly ST of Mersin Station without local
    climatic inputs. Notably, this was the first study that estimated the monthly
    ST with a GP model. It was evident from the related literature; the previous studies
    have generally used the ANN, ANFIS and GEP methods in the estimation of ST. The
    GEP and ANFIS or CANFIS models are associated with several disadvantages compared
    to the ELM model. The ANFIS (CANFIS) methods with large rule bases and high number
    of parameters (or weights) in its structure have high computational time and sometimes
    overtraining problem (Tahmasebi and Hezarkhani, 2010). GEP method uses evolutionary
    computation (genetic algorithm) and therefore it has slower approximation compared
    to ANN method. On the other hand, in application of intelligent models to hydrological
    or hydrogeological data, there is no algorithm that is superior to all problems
    as echoed by (Bárdossy and Singh, 2008). This necessitates the comparative studies
    including application of various models on ST estimation. Although several types
    of data intelligent models (including ANN, ANFIS, GP, GEP, etc.) were used, the
    extreme learning machine (ELM) abd M5 Tree models utilized in this study as a
    new data-intelligent modeling strategies, which have not been explored previously
    in the estimation of soil temperature. The premise of embracing the ELM model
    as a data-intelligent tool is certainly a desirable task by virtue of its fast
    and efficient learning ability, universal approximation capability, user-friendly
    and enigmatic-less design and its powerful non-linear estimation skill. Such advantageous
    features suffices the ELM model to be potentially used as a real-time decision-support
    tool, and the construction of a real-time, expert system in agriculture, water
    management and the estimation of micro-meteorological events (Akusok et al., 2017).
    Several recent studies have demonstrated the ELM model to be an efficient connectionist
    algorithm that were applied in data-intelligent frameworks for solving regression
    problems and practical decision system problems (e.g., (Avci, 2013; Chen and Ou,
    2011; Deo et al., 2017; Scardapane et al., 2014)). Originally, the ELM model was
    proposed by Huang and Siew (2004) as a pertinent learning tool that is able to
    learn much faster and more efficiently than its conventional counterparts (i.e.,
    the ANN) model. Basically, the ELM model is based on a simple, three-layer feed
    forward neural network (Wang et al., 2012). Due to the randomized selection of
    hidden neurons and biases, the ELM model is able to reduce the required computational
    time for feature extraction and prediction process compared to several other learning
    algorithms (e.g., the ANN, support vector machines, evolutionary computing, ANFIS,
    etc.). In recent years, the ELM technique has successfully been applied in many
    different research fields, such as the function approximation (Huang et al., 2006a,
    Huang et al., 2006b), regression-based modeling (Yu et al., 2014) and classification
    problems (Akusok et al., 2015). Furthermore, the ELM model has been able to incredibly
    enhance the neural training speed and overall prediction accuracy (Huang et al.
    2011), which was evident in a number of recent studies (Deo et al., 2016). In
    spite of the widespread embracement of the ELM model as an efficient data intelligent
    tool, its application in the area of soil temperature estimation (i.e., as a potential
    decision-support tool) is yet to be fully explored. The primary contribution of
    this research paper is to design and evaluate a non-tuned predictive model based
    on the ELM algorithm applied of long-term (i.e., monthly) soil temperature (ST)
    estimation. The predictive ability of the proposed ELM model is also validated
    with respect to the conventional ANN and M5 Tree-based data-intelligent models.
    Upon designing the ELM model, the predictive performance is also assessed in respect
    to the three different soil temperature elevations: at a depth of 5, 50 and 100 cm.
    Through a statistical assessment of the observed and estimated ST data and a diagnostic
    evaluation of the model is performed at a real agricultural district (namely the
    Adana and Mersin) located in Turkey. 2. Theoretical overview and climate input
    data 2.1. Extreme learning machine (ELM) approach Extreme learning machine is
    considered as a relatively new soft computing (or data intelligent) model that
    aims to address the drawbacks of the classical machine learning model (Huang et
    al., 2015). The term of “extreme” in this context represents the strong capability
    to mimic the human brain aptitude in a relatively short modeling time (Huang and
    Chen, 2007). The learning process of this approach is very simple and unique where
    there is no need to tune the hidden neurons during the learning phase (Huang et
    al., 2006a). On the contrary, traditional learning methods such as the artificial
    neural networks or support vector machines require more human intervention, particularly
    in obtaining the most appropriate model parameters. An advantage of the ELM over
    the traditional data-intelligent models is its greater potential role in the design
    of this data-intelligent expert systems for real life application (e.g., (Avci,
    2013; Chen and Ou, 2011; Deo et al., 2017; Kaya et al., 2014)). Over the past
    few years, the ELM model has been successfully implemented in various applications
    in existing literature with an approved level of proficiency in area of the relatively
    good learning capacity for problems in clustering, regression, feature learning,
    and classification (Bhat et al., 2008; Lian et al., 2012; Samat et al., 2014;
    Shamshirband et al., 2016; Soria-Olivas et al., 2011). In accordance with the
    authors'' knowledge, there is no single research work that assessed the predictive
    skill of the ELM approach for the modeling of soil temperature data. The novelty
    of the ELM model in this study, therefore, lies in the fact that it has a fast
    learning rate based on the single layer feed forward network (SLFN) and has a
    capability for the generalization of data features over the other soft computing
    methods (Yaseen et al., 2016). As a graphical presentation, Fig. 1 shows the architectural
    structure of the generalized ELM model. In accordance with this figure, the input
    variables for the present study are the solar radiation, relative humidity, air
    temperature, and wind speed, while the target variable is the soil temperature
    to be evaluated at multiple elevations (i.e., 5, 50, and 100 cm). The hidden nodes
    within the phase space connects the input and the output variables in such a way
    that the features determined by the input and output weights are randomly generated.
    The modeling of the input-target data set is performed by the trained model for
    this particular case, was covered 60%, validation phase covers 20% and testing
    phase covers the remaining 20%. Download : Download high-res image (228KB) Download

    in this study. The input data are processed using the ELM algorithm through the
    M-dimensional mapping feature space that randomly determines the internal weights,
    while the output network is based on the following mathematical procedure (Huang
    et al., 2006b): (1) The variables in Eq. (1) are: βi = output matrix weight that
    connected the hidden layer space and the targeted phase, hi = hidden nodes output
    for the input variables (x) and M denotes the dimension of the ELM algorithm''s
    feature space. The regression problem for the estimation of soil temperature with
    multiple meteorological inputs can thus be solved using the ELM learning processes
    (Huang et al., 2006b): (2) In Eq. (2), the H represents feature space for the
    “hidden zone output matrix”, M while T defines the target matrix. The basic learning
    operation conducted by ELM algorithm is to obtain the minimum error in accordance
    with the term: Minimize : ‖Hβ − T‖ and ‖β‖ whereas the hidden output layer H can
    be indicated as follows: (3) 2.2. M5 model tree To validate the applicability
    of the non-tuned ELM model for soil temperature estimation, the M5 Tree model
    has been used as an alternative data-intelligent tool (Bhattacharya and Solomatine,
    2005; Goyal, 2014; Zia et al., 2015). M5 Tree model is a hierarchical, decision-tree
    type model, based on the binary decision framework, employing linear regression
    at the terminal nodes (of a tree) to investigate the relationships in the input-target
    matrix (Solomatine and Ostfeld, 2008). There are two processes involved in the
    design of an M5 Tree: firstly, the splitting of the input-target matrix into a
    set of subsets for the construction of decision trees is used to establish patterns
    in the input and output data; and secondly, the tuning of the decision-trees to
    attain the optimal M5 Tree model is undertaken (Deo et al., 2016; Prasad et al.,

    The structure of the M5 Model tree used in this study. Mathematically, assuming
    that we are given a particular dataset sampled with N-number of entries and the
    M-dimensional training matrix (i.e., multivariate data related to a target variable).
    This data needs to be sorted by the features associated with the predictor variables.
    Here, the objective of the M5 Tree model is to establish non-linear relationships
    between the target training data and the predictor data (Quinlan, 1992). By employing
    the divide and conquer rule, M5 Tree model is designed with N points associated
    with a test criterion that divides them into subsets in accordance to the outcome
    (Bhattacharya and Solomatine, 2005; Solomatine and Xue, 2004). This procedure
    is applied when the subsets are generated based on the criterion that subjects
    to the class value of standard deviation and error reduction (σR) (Deo et al.,
    2016): (4) Ω indicates the examples that reach the node, Ωi presents the subset
    of examples. Having reached the maximum split of the data attributes, the model
    is selected using a regression tree to optimize the M5 Tree with the smallest
    magnitude of σR (Malerba et al., 2004). As soon as the class value of all the
    instances reach a node are the same or have a few instances, the splitting of
    the dataset will cease. This is an indication that the divide and conquer rule
    can lead to large input data with an over -elaborate structured network that must
    be pruned back. In the case of a model developed from several data points, smoothing
    is used to compensate any sudden discontinuity that might occur at the leaves
    of the pruned trees of the adjacent models (Malerba et al., 2004). This acts to
    enhance the fine-tuned models'' accuracy. While smoothing, the linear regressions
    are updated to bring closer the relation between the estimated output and the
    input variables. Comprehensive details of the M5 Tree model can be found in other''s
    research works (e.g., (Bhattacharya and Solomatine, 2006; Keshtegar et al., 2016;
    Landwehr et al., 2005)). 2.3. Artificial neural networks (ANN) approach ANN are
    a parallel data processing system that can processes information made up of a
    set of neurons arranged in three layers (Haykin, 1999). ANNs are very well-known
    and comprise of three layers including input, output and a sandwiched layer called
    hidden layer with several tuned neurons (Maier and Dandy, 2000). In each layer,
    the neurons are connected by weights to the neurons in the subsequent layers in
    the training phase. The sigmoid and the linear activation functions are commonly
    used in the hidden and output layer respectively, to analyze the features in an
    input data. The most common and popular training algorithm used in the literature
    is the Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with a back-propagation algorithm (Maier et
    al., 2010; Maier and Dandy, 2000; Yaseen et al., 2015). Given its faster speed
    and adaptability as a second order learning algorithm providing high efficiency
    for data feature extraction (Adamowski and Chan, 2011; Adamowski and Karapataki,
    2010) this algorithm has been selected to model the soil temperature data in this
    paper. 2.4. Study area and dataset In this research paper, atmospheric datasets
    (i.e., solar radiation, relative humidity, air temperature, wind speed and multiple
    elevation soil temperature data at (5, 50, and 100 cm)) over monthly time scales
    for to the case of Mersin and Adana stations located in Turkey were utilized to
    construct data-intelligent models. The temporal span of these dataset covered
    a twenty-five year period (1986 to 2010). Fig. 3 displays the coordinates of the
    stations from where data were measured and monitored regularly by the Turkish
    Meteorological Organization (https://mgm.gov.tr/eng/forecast-cities.aspx). Download

    The location of the tested stations and the study area in Turkey. The regional
    climate of the study area is largely the Mediterranean type with hot and dry conditions
    during the summer (mean air temperature above 40 °C) and mild to cool through
    the winter season (mean air temperature around 24 °C). The rainfall hydrological
    processes are very intense and cause serious problems. In addition, the mountain
    areas experience massive snow fall which is rarely found in the coastal zones.
    It is worth to state here, that the selection of these cases was based on their
    significant impact on the society. The Mersin and Adana cities have very important
    agricultural areas where cotton, wheat, corn, soy bean, barley, grapes and citrus
    fruits are farmed. Most of the Adana industry is based on agriculture, and therefore
    a study of soil temperature can be immensely useful for farming management purposes.
    For more statistical information about the study sites, Table 1 shows the statistical
    indicators in terms of the xmin, xmax, xmean, Sx, Csx and Cv that define the following
    sequence of variables: minimum, maximum, mean, standard deviation, skewness and
    variation coefficient. Based on this information, it can be observed that the
    soil temperature at the elevation 5 cm exhibits the largest variation for both
    stations. In addition, it is clear from the table that windspeed has the highest
    negative skewness while the air temperature is very close to normal distribution
    (zero skewness) in the both stations. Soil temperatures showed similar characteristic
    in Adana and Mersin. ST-5, ST-50 and ST-100 range 6.5–39.6 cm, 8.9–35.8 cm and
    11.2–33.6 cm, respectively, whereas, the Sx, Csx and Cv statistics show almost
    equal values, albeit with a very slight variation. Table 1. Statistical properties

    In this study, for the ELM model, a 3-layer neuronal network was initialized where
    the optimal training was attained by changing the hidden neurons (in increments
    of 1 that was governed by the dimension of input matrix), while the activation
    function for the hidden layer was set as the logarithmic sigmoid equation following
    earlier studies (Deo et al., 2017c). After determining the optimal number of hidden
    neurons (in accordance with the smallest training mean square error), a total
    of 1000 ELM models were constructed (randomly) with the training data, and the
    best model with the lowest root mean square error on the validation dataset was
    then selected. To benchmark the ELM model, the ANN model was calibrated with the
    Levenberg-Marquardt training algorithm, a much faster and a powerful tool compared
    to the standard backpropagation algorithms used in ANN models. For the hidden
    and output nodes, we have utilized the tangent sigmoid (tansig) and pure linear
    (purelin) functions, while different number of hidden neurons was tried one by
    one for each ANN network to yield the lowest value of the mean square error in
    the validation phase. It is especially noted that in the ANN model, the iterative
    tuning of the model weights by means of a trial and error procedure on a range
    of hidden neurons led to an optimum ANN network architecture, albeit this was
    attained at a higher computational cost compared to the automatic identification
    of hidden layer neurons in the ELM case (e.g., (Deo and Şahin, 2015a, Deo and
    Şahin, 2015b)). As a final benchmark tool, the M5 Tree model was constructed where
    a number of basic training parameters were initialized: a minimum split of 2.0,
    a smoothing of 15 and a split threshold of 0.05 (Wang and Witten, 1997). Pruning
    was applied to implement ‘divide-and-conquer rule’ (Kisi, 2015; Rahimikhoob et
    al., 2013). Optimum decision-trees (or ‘rules’) were then determined from the
    model with the smallest mean square error and the largest coefficient of determination
    (R2), which concurred with the standard deviation of class values and the greatest
    reduction in the model''s training error. The M5 Tree model was fine-tuned to
    yield the tree-based rules and a final predictive equation to simulate the soil
    temperature at different depths. 2.6. Statistical performance evaluation measures
    To evaluate the ELM vs., the comparative (ANN & M5 model tree) data-intelligent
    models, different statistical evaluation criteria including the correlation coefficient
    (R), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), relative root mean
    square error (RRMSE), relative mean absolute error (RMAE), Nash-Sutcliffe model
    efficiency coefficient (NS), Willmott Index of Agreement (WI) and Legates and
    McCabe index (LMI) have been employed. The equations are as follows: (6) (7) (8)
    (9) (10) (11) (12) In Eqs. (6)–(12), N is the number of data points, is the mean
    value of the observed soil temperature data at each depth, STiM and STiO denote
    the soil temperature values generated by the data-intelligent models and the observations,
    respectively. Note that for a perfect estimation model, the values of RMSE/MAE
    (and their relative percentage equivalents) are expected to be zero, while the
    NS, WI and LMI values are expected to be unity (Legates and Mccabe, 1999; Nash
    and Sutcliffe, 1970; Willmott, 1984, Willmott, 1981). 3. Application, results
    and discussion In this section, the results of the ELM model in respect to the
    ANN and M5Tree models employed for estimating soil temperatures at different depths
    are discussed. For each type of algorithm applied in the estimation problem, 5
    different sub-models were constructed using different input combinations of meteorological
    variables. The variables; air temperature (T-air), solar radiation (SR), wind
    speed (W), relative humidity (RH) were used as inputs to the models because they
    are physically effective on ST and therefore, previous literature also used these
    data for ST estimation. The input variables attributes can be abbreviated as followed,
    (Model M1) T-air, (Model M2) T-air + SR, (Model M3) T-air + SR + W, (Model M4)
    T-air + SR + W + RH, (Model M5) T-air + SR + W + RH + month number (i.e., periodicity
    component). The construction of the ANN and the M5 Tree-based predictive models
    followed earlier published works (e.g., (Kisi et al., 2016; Deo et al., 2017a;
    Deo et al., 2017b)) where the same input combinations as identified above were
    used to estimate the soil temperature at different depths for Mersin and Adana
    study sites. In Table 2, the testing results of the three different predictive
    models used in emulating the ST data at the depths of 5, 50 and 100 cm are enumerated
    for the Adana station. For the 5 cm depth results, the optimal ELM model (i.e.,
    Model M3) is seen to outperform the optimal ANN and the M5 Tree models (i.e.,
    Models M2). That is, for this particular soil depth, the ELM model with the best
    input combinations is seen to yield the LMI of 0.621 vs. 0.424 (ANN) and 0.422
    (M5 Tree) whereas the relative error values amount to 17.189% (for the ELM) compared
    to 24.890% and 24.921% for the ANN and the M5 Tree models, respectively. Hence,
    it is clear from a comparison of three data-intelligence models that the ELM model
    has a superior level of accuracy compared to the ANN and M5Tree, since this model
    has a lower value of RMSE, MAE, RRMSE, RMAE and the highest value of R, WI, Nash
    and LM index. Notwithstanding this result, it is evident that the comparison of
    the Models M4 and M5 with their relevant input combinations for each approach
    supports the fact that adding the periodicity component leads to a modest improvement
    in the models'' accuracy. This accords to earlier studies where periodicity was
    shown to be a contributing factor for a better model performance (Deo et al.,
    2017a). Table 2. The testing phase results of the ELM, ANN and the M5 Tree predictive

    50 cm, the best estimation results generated by the ELM, ANN and the M5 Tree models
    are obtained for the case of Model M5, indicating that the models can be improved
    significantly using the monthly cycle as a potential input variable. However,
    based on the visualized results, the best ANN model is seen to outperform the
    best ELM and M5 Tree model in estimating the ST data at a depth of 50 cm although
    the accuracy improvement is more clearly seen for the ANN and the M5 Tree models
    by the addition of periodicity component to the model inputs. Indeed, this result
    can be best explained by considering the fact that the different machine learning
    models behave differently from one model to another, mainly driven by their variety
    of feature extraction ability and learning process. In the case of the 100 cm
    depth, the results comprised of the 5th input combination (i.e., Model M5) generated
    the best accuracy for all three data intelligent models considered in the problem
    of ST estimation. It is notable that the best ELM model yielded a better accuracy
    than the best ANN and the best M5 Tree models. This is in spite of the fact that
    a closer analysis reveals a slight difference between the predictive accuracy
    of the ELM and the M5 Tree models. Considerable improvements were also obtained
    by adding the periodicity as an input to the data intelligent models for all of
    the three soft-computing methods. The graphical comparison of the best models
    used in estimating ST at a depth of 5, 50 and 100 cm are shown in Fig. 4 for the
    Adana station. Download : Download high-res image (670KB) Download : Download

    station (a) at the depth of 5 cm, (b) at the depth of 50 cm, and (c) at the depth
    of 100 cm. For the estimates for the 5 cm soil depth (Fig. 4a), it is apparent
    from the scatterplots that the ELM model''s line of linear agreement between estimated
    (y) and observed (x) ST data (i.e., y = 0.8223 x + 3.5383) is closer to the ideal
    line (y = x), and this has also registered a higher R2 value compared to the ANN
    and the M5 Tree model. On the other hand, the Taylor diagram for this comparison
    seems to indicate that the ELM model is able to obtain a higher correlation and
    a lower value of the standard deviation when compared with the other two data-intelligent
    models. For a depth of 50 cm (Fig. 4b), it is clearly seen from the scatterplots
    that the ANN-based linear equation was closer to the ideal line y = x compared
    to the other two data-intelligent models although this model is not able to appropriately
    represent some of the observed ST values. However, it is notable that the ELM
    model has a slightly smaller standard deviation than the ANN and the M5 Tree models.
    The differences among the three data-intelligent models for estimating the ST
    data at a depth of 100 cm are not clearly evident from the scatterplots (Fig.
    4c). Table 3 reports the testing results of the ELM, ANN and the M5Tree models
    used in estimating ST at a depth of 5, 50 and 100 cm for the Mersin station. For
    the 5 cm depth, the 5th model has the best accuracy for the ELM case while the
    best ANN and M5 Tree model results were the most accurate, obtained using the
    first input combination. The ELM model comprising of the 5th input combination
    yielded a lower RMSE (1.598 °C), MAE (1.278 °C), RRMSE (6.635%), RMAE (5.470%)
    and higher R (0.993), WI (0.999), Nash (0.975) and LMI (0.859) compared to the
    ANN and M5Tree models. Considerable improvement is also evident in the ANN and
    the ELM model by including the periodicity as an input (i.e., compare the 4th
    and 5th models). Table 3. The testing phase results of the ELM, ANN and M5 Tree

    50 cm soil depth, the best results of the ANN and the M5 Tree models are obtained
    from the 4th models while the 5th model demonstrated the best accuracy among the
    ELM model. It is apparent from the Table 3, the best ELM model performs better
    than the best ANN and the best M5Tree models with respect to the absolute estimation
    error and the goodness-of-fit metrics. An improvement in the accuracy is also
    evident for the ELM model by adding periodicity as a model input. Similar to the
    Adana station, the models comprised of the 5th input combination is seen to provide
    the best accuracy for all three inspected models in case of the 100 cm soil depth.
    The best ELM model has a better accuracy than the ANN and the M5Tree model. However,
    the present results show that there is a slight difference between the ELM and
    the ANN models. Similar to the Adana station, adding the periodicity as an input
    to the data intelligent models is seen to considerably improve their accuracies.
    To further show this, the models are graphically compared in Fig. 5, where results
    for estimating the ST at the depths of 5, 50 and 100 cm for the Mersin station
    are shown. Download : Download high-res image (653KB) Download : Download full-size

    and 76, 32 and 32% in Mersin, respectively) for the smallest error magnitude encountered

    counts. Overall, these results indicate that the ELM models generally perform
    superior to the ANN and M5 Tree model in estimating the ST data at different depths.
    M5 Tree model generally has the worst estimate. The reason for this might be its
    linear tree structure that could potentially prevents the model from adequately
    modeling the nonlinear behaviors of the ST phenomenon. On the other hand, the
    ELM model, which is considered as a relatively new and an advanced approach for
    ST modeling, has some advantages over the ANN model. Notably, the ELM model has
    high-performance, that entails new design features such as the random generation
    of the hidden node parameters without an iterative modeling process (as with the
    case of an ANN model), and analytically determining of the output weights to provide
    considerably fast solutions (Deo and Şahin, 2015a, Deo and Şahin, 2015b; Deo et
    al., 2016; Yaseen et al., 2016). To compare our results with previous works, we
    refer to the study of Kisi et al. (2016) that has modeled the ST data for Mersin
    station (i.e. using the same data sets with the current study) for different soil
    depths using the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Radial Basis Neural Networks (RBNN)
    and Generalized Regression Neural Networks (GRNN). Their results yielded the tested
    RMSE values at a depth of 5, 50 and 100 cm to be approximately 2.06, 1.72 and
    3.36 °C for the their best GRNN model, 1.88, 1.69 and 3.64 °C for their best MLP
    model, 1.83, 2.92 and approximately 5.04 °C for their best RBNN models. In accordance
    with this comparison, it is evident from Table 2, Table 3 that the proposed ELM
    method in this study has successfully modeled the ST data at different soil depths
    with a relatively smaller RMSE value (i.e., 1.60, 1.11 and 2.03 °C for a depth
    of 5, 50 and 100 cm) in the testing phase compared to the previous study (Kisi
    et al., 2016) for the same station. 4. Conclusion and final remarks Estimating
    soil temperature is a paramount task for precision agriculture and sustainability
    of different ecosystems, evapotranspiration studies, irrigation/water management
    and hydrologic engineering. In addition, soil temperature estimation is also required
    in decision-support systems that can be adopted by natural resource managers to
    study root development in plants, understanding the soil characteristics required
    for crop health and for maintaining a balance of energy in the underlying soil
    for better crop yield. In this paper, the estimation of soil temperature (ST)
    using an extreme learning machine (ELM), artificial neural network (ANN) and M5
    Tree model was performed with meteorological variables defined by the air temperature,
    solar radiation, windspeed and humidity and the models were developed with various
    input combinations to estimate the ST for the depths of 5 cm, 50 cm and 100 cm.
    To attain accurate estimations of ST data, and also to evaluate the ability of
    the ELM vs. the ANN and M5 Tree models, a total of five different data-intelligent
    models were designed in this study. The modeling strategy followed a successive
    addition of each predictor variable, one by one, (whilst cross-checking the training
    and the testing performances of each new resulting model), to finally include
    the periodicity factor as an additional tool for ST estimation. These data-intelligent
    models were then validated at two study locations (Adana and Mersin, Turkey).
    In this regard, the optimal ANN model was attained in respect to the best set
    of model''s neuronal parameters by iteratively tuning the hidden neurons one by
    one. On the other hand, for the ELM model, the most suitable hidden layer parameters
    were randomly generated a total of 1000 times, and the ELM model with the lowest
    mean square error attained in the training dataset was selected as the optimal
    model. The results were then evaluated in respect to several statistical score
    metrics and diagnostic plots of the estimated and the measured ST data in an independent
    testing phase for both the optimal ELM and the optimal ANN model. The results
    evaluated in the testing phase showed that the optimal ELM model was generally
    better than the optimal ANN and the M5 Tree models, yielding the most accurate
    performance for the Mersin station for all three soil depths. On the other hand,
    for Adana, the ELM model was the most accurate for the depths of 5 cm and 100 cm.
    It can be noteworthy that the inclusion of periodicity (i.e. incorporating the
    seasonal behavior of temperature) as the model input variable led to a remarkable
    improvement in the model''s testing performance for the case of 50 cm and 100 cm
    depths (Adana) and also for all three depths for Mersin. Especially for the case
    of Mersin, the superiority of the optimal ELM model was evident, as verified by
    a relatively large magnitude of the Legate & McCabe''s Index (0.859 vs. 0.835
    & 0.826 for 5 cm, 0.879 vs. 0.852 & 0.844 for 50 cm and 0.713 vs. 0.698 & 0.618
    for 100 cm) relative to the optimal ANN and M5 Tree models, respectively. In accordance
    with these results, it can be ascertained that the ELM model developed in this
    study is a useful artificial intelligence tool that could be explored further
    as a decision-support tool in several applications, such as in agricultural precision,
    ecosystem management, hydrologic engineering and water resources management. Despite
    the significant benefits of the ELM model evidenced by accurate performance for
    soil temperature prediction, the scope of present study can be further enhanced
    in several ways, such as: (i) using the related morphological information that
    have causal relationships with the soil temperature at different depths, (ii)
    improving the ELM model by integrating it nature-inspired optimization algorithms
    for robust feature weight extraction (e.g., the Firefly Optimizer), and finally,
    (iii) attempting to apply the data-intelligent (i.e., ELM) model in real applications
    such as mobile phone apps, web-based estimation systems or hand held devices and
    practical implementation in real-time estimation systems for soil temperature
    at shorter timescales (e.g., sub-hourly or daily) in agriculture, water resources
    management and other cropping or horticultural applications. The relatively fast
    modeling ability of the ELM model is also likely to play a major role in real-life
    decision support systems where fast, efficient and reliable informative systems
    needs to be designed for practically-relevant digital media (e.g., a web-hosted
    system estimation system). Acknowledgments The authors are grateful to the Turkish

    the cross-scale linkages between drought and food security is vital to developing
    tools to reduce drought impacts and support decision making. This study reviews
    how drought hazards transfer to food insecurity through changes in physical processes
    and socio-environmental systems across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales.
    We propose a multi-scale, integrated framework leveraging modeling advances (e.g.
    drought and crop monitoring, water-food-energy nexus, decision making) and increased
    data availability (e.g. satellite remote sensing, food trade) through the lens
    of the coupled human–natural system to support multidisciplinary approaches and
    avoid potential policy spillover effects. We discuss current scale-dependent challenges
    in tackling drought-induced food security whilst minimizing water use conflicts
    and environmental impacts. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Current

    Introduction Recent decades have witnessed substantial strides in increasing global
    food production. Yet we still face challenges to feed 9.8 billion people by 2050,
    especially over drought-prone and dry areas of the developing world. For example,
    in sub-Saharan Africa, food crises are periodically triggered by droughts, and
    could be further exacerbated by other compounding factors (e.g. heat waves, floods,
    conflict). Over the last five decades, food production shocks (i.e. sudden losses)
    have become more frequent across all regions and all food sectors [2•]. Half of
    these shocks are caused by extreme weather [2•] with disproportionate effects
    on countries with low coping capacity, such as the ability of farmers to diversify
    food production or the ability of governments to import food or provide insurance.
    For instance, the 2017 Kenya drought led to a national emergency and left 2.5
    million people facing food insecurity [3]. With more effective adaptation strategies
    and actions, the impact of elevated drought risk due to climate change [4,5] can
    be reduced and help facilitate progress towards hitting the second United Nations
    Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) (i.e. zero hunger). Synchronous challenges
    are emerging if multiple inter-related SDG goals are to be achieved simultaneously
    (e.g. SDG2 to ensure food security, SDG6 to ensure water security, SDG13 to foster
    resilience), as they interact across a range of spatial and temporal scales, leading
    to diverse trade-offs, synergies and even competing policy responses with impacts
    that are also scale-dependent [6••]. Understanding such cross-scale interactions
    is key for policymakers and stakeholders to develop adaptation policies that can
    effectively reduce the impacts of drought on agricultural production, and to increase
    societal resilience to future drought-induced emergencies, while still meeting
    competing demands and enhancing environmental sustainability. Figure 1 conceptualizes
    a range of potential food security outcomes, for the example of Zambia, driven
    by cross-scale interactions of a range of plausible physical and socio-economic
    scenarios. The effect of drought (or other hazards) on individuals and communities
    depends on both the direct impact of the drought on local food production and
    the response of trade networks and institutions to drought occurrences (e.g. aid/relief
    organizations), which are reliant upon domestic infrastructure to move food resources.
    The impacts of droughts are also shaped by existing policies and institutional
    factors, such as agricultural subsidy programmes. For example, the food security
    impact of a small but severe drought can be mitigated if the affected region is
    well connected to regional transport and food distribution networks, provided
    food transfer policies are flexible and adaptive enough, or regional trade flows
    are sufficient so that enough food can be transferred to the affected region to
    make up for local farmers’ production losses (Figure 1, top row). On the other
    hand, a drought of the same extent but of less severity could lead to much larger
    food insecurity in a region that is relatively isolated (making it less likely
    that market forces can meet food shortfalls, even given substantial regional trade),
    particularly if food security policy is relatively inflexible and unable to concentrate
    and prioritize resources at a subnational scale (Figure 1, 2nd row). Other scenarios
    can play out based on other combinations of drivers and responses (Figure 1, rows
    3 and 4). Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download full-size
    image Figure 1. Examples of food security scenarios, illustrating the interactions
    between droughts of different scale and impact (localized or national coverage;
    mild or severe), transportation access (isolated or connected), food security
    policies (fixed or adaptive subnationally), and regional trade (free trade, preferential
    trade or trade barriers), and their impacts on average household dietary mix (ratio
    of local to imported food) and overall food security. Given scale-dependent drought-food
    security linkages in both the environmental and socio-economic realms, disciplinary
    approaches are unlikely to solve such ‘wicked’ problems. Instead, interdisciplinary
    approaches across scales are needed to fully understand drought-linked food security
    outcomes, and the corresponding interventions that can minimize impacts. To this
    end, we review recent progress in drought risk and food security analysis, and
    modeling approaches from both the biophysical and socio-economic perspectives.
    We also discuss how to leverage emerging opportunities in modeling advances and
    rich datasets to develop scalable and integrated decision support frameworks that
    incorporate local knowledge and stakeholder involvement. These frameworks can
    be used to reduce drought impacts on food security and help address SDG targets.
    How does drought impact food security? In this review, we focus on three categories
    of food security: availability (i.e. crop production, stock, and trade), access
    (related to physical and economic factors such as food trade, income, market,
    price), and stability (adequate access to food), all of which are directly or
    indirectly affected by drought risk, either through biophysical processes (related
    to the hazard component) or socio-economic processes (related to vulnerability
    and exposure components). We do not address the utilization aspect (i.e. the appropriate
    use of the nutritional content by the human body) of food security as this is
    generally less affected by drought, and we focus on crops rather than livestock.
    Drought impacts on agricultural production Drought is an extreme state of the
    hydrological cycle and reflects a situation with below average water availability
    conditions. Drought usually starts with precipitation deficit (called meteorological
    drought) and sometimes can be exacerbated by increased evapotranspiration due
    to high temperature, which can further propagate to the land surface and lead
    to reduced soil moisture (called agricultural drought) and streamflow (called
    hydrological drought). Water stress during drought slows down crop root growth,
    delays maturation and reduces agricultural productivity. Physically, this directly
    leads to reduced food availability especially for regions where livelihoods are
    highly dependent on rain-fed agriculture that are susceptible to droughts (e.g.
    sub-Saharan Africa). Globally, droughts caused 1820 million Mg loss of cereal
    (maize, rice, and wheat) production over the past four decades [7]. The extent
    to which various types of drought affect food security is highly linked to their
    spatio-temporal footprint. For instance, the timing and duration of droughts largely
    determine their impact on agriculture. Individual drought events with short-duration
    (several weeks) exert less pressure on agricultural and water management compared
    to multi-year prolonged droughts, whose effects can ripple across other sectors
    [2•]. The timing of drought occurrence is important, as the sensitivity of crop
    yield to water stress differs with growth stage, which is related to the fundamental
    biophysical mechanisms of crop growth [8]. Given this, there is a need to assess
    drought impacts on agricultural productivity separately for specific growth stages,
    which is more meaningful for agricultural water management [9]. Statistical and
    process-based models are important tools for estimating drought impacts on crop
    yields [10•], but these are inherently scale dependent, ranging from the farm
    level to global scale [7,11]. This highlights the need for multivariate probabilistic
    approaches [12,13] to simultaneously consider the joint distribution of the spatial
    and temporal footprint of drought. Such approaches can be combined with model-based
    large ensembles [14] for more robust quantification of agricultural risk, but
    should consider whether risk assessments are transferable across scales. Drought
    is a risk multiplier to the interlinked food, energy and water (FEW) sectors,
    making agricultural sectors more vulnerable as the FEW sectors become more interconnected
    [15]. Globally, there is increasing competition between urban water provision
    and agriculture water demand [16••]. Water allocated to domestic/industrial uses
    necessarily decreases water available for irrigation which can result in decreased
    yields in times of inadequate rainfall. The situation could become more challenging
    if water is diverted for more profitable non-food sectors (e.g. irrigation for
    biofuel production or water for mining) [17]. Such trade-offs in terms of water
    allocation not only exist across sectors, but are also manifested through the
    spatial patterns of upstream-downstream relationships along the river network,
    with competing goals between, for example, upstream hydropower generation and
    downstream irrigation. Although hydropower is a non-consumptive water use (except
    for seepage and evaporation), hydropower reservoirs can alter the timing when
    water would naturally flow into the river system. This can sometimes interfere
    with downstream agriculture, especially when the crop growing season and high
    electricity demand periods do not coincide [18•]. However, the extent to which
    there are trade-offs depends on the duration and spatial footprint of droughts,
    as well as whether there are cross-basin and large-scale water-transfer infrastructures.
    Drought interactions with markets and trade Besides the direct physical influence
    of drought on agriculture, drought also indirectly jeopardizes food security through
    its impact on socio-economic systems. The impact is scale-dependent, not only
    because the hazard component of drought risk varies across different spatiotemporal
    scales [19], but also because vulnerability and exposure vary across scales, and
    are influenced by infrastructure (e.g. reservoirs, roads) and policies (e.g. subsidies,
    trade policy). At the local scale, farmers whose production is affected by drought
    face the double-shock of both a loss of income along with potentially increasing
    food prices. Even urban consumers who are not directly linked to farming systems
    are affected by increased prices for food in urban markets. At the regional scale,
    spatially extensive droughts could destabilize regional food systems, and further
    increase the volatility of crop prices. Such regional impacts can ripple into
    the globally interconnected markets, exacerbating the vulnerability of countries
    whose economies strongly rely on international food trade [20]. Water is embodied
    in traded goods across spatial and temporal scales. Extensive research has focused
    on the global virtual water trade, or the water embodied in internationally traded
    commodities [21], with increasing interest in determining the source of the water
    (e.g. rainfall, surface supplies, or groundwater) [22••,23•]. Recent research
    has examined virtual water transfers at smaller spatial scales, including domestic
    virtual water flows [24] and transfers to urban areas [25•]. Food trade appears
    to exhibit the same structural properties across spatial scales [26•], indicating
    that it likely also improves water use and food security at smaller scales of
    analysis, though research is still needed to better understand this. Most water
    footprint studies are at the annual temporal scale [27•]. For example, research
    has examined unsustainable groundwater resources that are embodied in the global
    trade system [22••]. However, to evaluate the buffering capacity of groundwater
    to supply chains during drought events, we require estimates at the subannual
    time scale [23•]. Future research should resolve virtual water trade flows in
    space and time to better understand the exposure of supply chains to both long-term
    water stress and shorter-term hazards (e.g. drought, flood). It is important to
    note that virtual water does not necessarily indicate if trade is leading to more
    or less water use. The critical question is how much water (sustainable and unsustainable)
    would be used in the absence of trade. To address this critical question, tools
    of causal inference are needed. Recent work has shown that trade decreases water
    use (on average) in agriculture [28•] and does not increase nutrient applications
    [29•]. At the subnational scale, causal inference methods have been used to show
    that the ability to transfer food leads to less famine in India [30•]. Drought
    and food policy From the policy perspective, local, national and international
    policies could either alleviate or intensify the drought impact, and in some cases
    can lead to unintended consequences across scales. For example, recent work using
    causal inference finds that crop insurance policy has spillovers to water use
    [31••] because farmers tend to use more water than they would have in the absence
    of crop insurance. At the national level, decisions to prevent exports to mitigate
    drought impacts can harm domestic food security and agricultural markets, by increasing
    price volatility rather than the intended goal of price stabilization and reduction
    [32]. Internationally, global food trade can help mitigate the effect of local
    production shocks, by facilitating movement of food from other regions whose production
    was unaffected, but can also spread the effect of drought-related shocks across
    time and space [33]. These effects can be exacerbated by the imposition of export
    barriers, particularly by traditionally major exporters, such as were imposed
    by India, Thailand, Russia, Argentina and many others in the face of the 2008
    food price increase. For example, Zambia enacts explicit export bans (prohibition
    of maize exports) as well as implicit bans (limits on export licenses) depending
    on national level maize production [34]. While successful at lowering price variability
    within the country, by restricting global supply, these policies exacerbated the
    global price increase for rice and wheat in particular [35,36]. Many developing
    countries also have stock-holding policies meant to mitigate production shocks.
    In Africa, stockholding has become increasingly popular among governments over
    the past two decades, and government marketing boards have become major players
    in African food markets [37]. Subsidized grain purchases are combined with often
    subsidized consumer sales to raise prices to farmers and lower them to consumers,
    with the goal of reducing price volatility. These programs are often large and
    expensive. India''s combined stock-holding and food subsidy program is the largest
    social safety net in the world, costing 6% of the government budget. Despite their
    popularity, it is unclear how well these policies work to stabilize price across
    space, within or across years [38]. Policies that impact crop prices or production
    supports (e.g. biofuel mandates, input supports) can promote expanded crop production,
    which may lead to greater investment into a single crop at the expense of crop
    diversity, or increased cultivation in agriculturally marginal lands [39,40].
    Either result may increase the risk of failure due to drought. Recent advances
    in integrated drought impact mitigation approaches The multifaceted impact of
    drought and its cross-scale interactions between physical and socio-economic systems
    requires a portfolio of integrated approaches to mitigate its impacts on food
    security. In this section, we review recent advances in hydrological and crop
    modeling, satellite remote sensing, and machine learning that can be used to detect
    and anticipate drought impacts, as well as how to translate the scientific advances
    to support real-world decision making through nexus approaches within the coupled
    human-natural system. Drought early warning and forecasting Progress in the development
    of drought early warning and forecasting has been made in recent years due to
    advances in understanding predictability, land surface modeling, satellite-based
    measurement of key hydrological variables (e.g. precipitation, soil moisture),
    as well as advances in machine learning algorithms facilitated by the surge of
    big data of the Earth system. Techniques to monitor and forecast drought can be
    distinguished as process-based approaches, data-driven approaches and hybrid approaches.
    Processed-based approaches are physically oriented, relying on large-scale meteorological
    forecasts from climate and weather models to drive hydrological models to obtain
    critical hydrological variables, which are used to calculate agricultural and
    hydrological drought indices [41, 42, 43]. This has been routinely adopted to
    develop regional and global scale drought monitoring system across different temporal
    scales, from short-term to seasonal [41, 44••]. However, there remain challenges
    in translating the skill of large-scale, short-term hydrological forecasts to
    the local scale at long lead time (e.g. subseasonal, seasonal), which is more
    relevant for agricultural management and planning. This requires bias-correction
    and downscaling techniques [45] to pre-process large-scale meteorological input
    so that they have commensurate resolution with hyper-resolution hydrological models
    [46,47] and therefore drought impact assessment is locally relevant. More importantly,
    the predictability of the forecasts themselves need to be substantially improved
    through enhanced understanding of the underlying drought mechanisms [48]. This
    also applies to data driven approaches, which aim to develop statistical relationships
    between drought characteristics (e.g. severity, spatial extent, duration) and
    environmental covariates (e.g. hydrological, meteorological, climatic variables).
    The wealth of environmental datasets from different sources (e.g. in situ observations,
    remote sensing, retrospective simulations, reanalysis products, climate projections,
    and even citizen-science observations) combined with advanced machine learning
    models (e.g. deep learning, [49••]) and increased computational power (e.g. cloud
    computing, [50]) makes data-driven approaches increasingly attractive for drought
    monitoring and forecasting [51, 52, 53, 54••]. However, as drought is a dynamic
    process and its evolution (i.e. onset, persistence, and recovery) is space and
    time dependent [55], challenges exist in terms of how to select the most informative
    and scale-dependent predictors from the wealth of data. This can be guided through
    advances in physical understanding of drought mechanisms [48]. At the same time,
    data-driven approaches can provide insights for diagnosing the underlying mechanisms
    and therefore could identify new pathways for physical model improvement. Hybrid
    models [49••] which harness advantages from both physically based and data-driven
    approaches show promise for future development and enhancement of regional [41,56]
    and smaller scale systems. For instance, the flexibility of machine learning in
    adapting to multi-resolution datasets can be used to replicate physical model
    parameterization schemes across different scales. It is also possible to use machine
    learning based emulators to fully or partially replace the computationally expensive
    physical model to accelerate the simulation process of drought monitoring and
    forecasting systems, especially when they are running operationally and at high
    resolution. Crop monitoring and yield forecasting To understand how drought impacts
    agriculture, it is essential to estimate and forecast crop yields at the scale
    of individual fields or agricultural landscapes over large extents (countries
    to regions), in order to understand how productivity impacts propagate across
    scales. There are three critical pieces of information that must be accurately
    measured, in sequence, to provide reliable, fine-scale information on crop productivity:
    Firstly, the location and extent of crop fields; secondly, the crop types growing
    within them; and finally, the yield response [57, 58, 59•]. Obtaining accurate
    estimates of each of these three elements remains a major challenge, particularly
    in regions dominated by smallholder farming systems, where agricultural census
    is often lacking or inaccurate, and the ability to accurately measure these properties
    with remote sensing is particularly challenging. Accurately mapping croplands
    at the characteristic scales of individual fields (1-2 ha) is arguably an unsolved
    problem, one that can propagate significant error into crop type and crop yield
    estimates [60, 61, 59•]. Despite such challenges, recent technological and methodological
    developments are helping to rapidly improve agricultural datasets. The emergence
    of small satellite fleets is providing imagery at the high spatial and temporal
    resolutions required to accurately map smallholder-dominated croplands [62••,
    61], while recent work using Sentinel and Landsat imagery have led to 20-30 m
    resolution, global to continental scale cropland maps [63,64]. Such efforts are
    facilitated by the increasing availability of cloud-based image processing, such
    as Google Earth Engine [65••], which provides a free platform combining open image
    archives, large-scale computing, and advanced processing and classification algorithms.
    Advances in computer vision and machine learning are helping to improve agricultural
    mapping [64,61]. Alongside these algorithms, which typically require large training
    datasets, new crowdsourcing platforms allow large, distributed networks of human
    mappers to digitize labels by visually interpreting high resolution satellite
    imagery [66, 67, 68]. In addition, the Sen2Agri system provides an operationalizable
    method for creating annual maps of both cropland and crop types that has been
    demonstrated at national scales [69•]. However, this approach must be trained
    with large volumes of in situ crop type observations, which are often challenging
    to obtain, thus recent work demonstrating a training data-free crop type mapping
    approach appears promising, at least over more homogenous cropping systems [70•].
    Progress has also been made in field-scale yield estimation. Prominent among these
    is the Scalable Yield Mapper approach [71], which uses a mechanistic crop simulator
    to develop an empirical model of yields that uses remotely sensed predictors (e.g.
    vegetation indices, gridded weather variables), thereby foregoing the need for
    field data. This approach has been used to map between-field differences in yield
    and crop management practices (e.g. planting date) in smallholder-dominated systems,
    with errors comparable to those in field-collected yield data [72, 73••]. Most
    recently, it has been combined with automated crop type mapping [70•] to map maize
    yields over Kenya and Tanzania [74•]. The rise of new in situ sensing systems,
    novel SMS-based farmer survey methods [75] and autonomous aerial vehicles [76••]
    will make it easier to calibrate and constrain crop simulations used by this method,
    by substantially increasing the amount of field data that can be collected on
    crop phenology and management. Accurate crop yield forecasting plays an important
    role in risk management, trading, policy making, and decision making for improving
    food accessibility. A number of approaches have been developed for crop yield
    forecasting at regional, national, and international levels. Empirical approaches
    are based on deriving statistical relationships between crop yields and satellite
    vegetation indices [77], climate data and forecasts [10•, 78, 79, 80], or both
    satellite and climate information [81]. Combining climate data and remote sensing
    based vegetation indices is a relatively new and promising approach. Process-based
    approaches with dynamic crop simulation models combined with climate forecasts
    are used as well [82]. These advances have been incorporated into land data assimilation
    systems, which take advantage of the improved skill of climate forecasts at subseasonal
    and seasonal lead times, and have been employed for crop growth monitoring and
    crop yield forecasting at global and regional scales [83]. Compared with empirical
    approaches, process-based approaches have large data requirements which could
    prevent their spatial generalization and application. In contrast, empirical approaches
    using statistical models provide a simple alternative for spatially explicit crop
    yield forecasts, but are generally limited to the range of variability they were
    developed for. Both empirical and process-based methods are transferable across
    different scales contingent upon the scale of the input data. Studies have also
    been conducted to investigate the linkages between large-scale climate variability
    and crop yields, providing the basis to develop climate-informed seasonal crop
    yield forecasting [84,85]. Benefitting from these advances, a few systems have
    been developed and are running operationally, such as the European Commission
    MARS Crop Yield Forecasting System (MCYFS) (http://agri4cast.jrc.ec.europa.eu/).
    Decision support and risk reduction for water and agricultural management Progress
    in understanding drought mechanisms and crop impacts combined with easy access
    to timely data and improved physical models have enabled the recent development
    of agricultural drought monitoring and forecasting systems [41,56]. These systems
    run operationally and disseminate data to a wider scientific community and stakeholders,
    and therefore are valuable decision support tools [86, 87, 88, 89]. For instance,
    these systems can aid in the strategic planning of water and agricultural resources
    across scales (e.g. local, regional). With forecast information available at seasonal
    or even longer time scales, these systems can allow local government to establish
    coping strategies to ward off famine and allow the humanitarian community to develop
    more effective assistance. This has been demonstrated during the 2016/2017 East
    African drought, with the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) contributing
    to enhanced drought resilience in Kenya and reduced mortality rate in Somalia
    compared to the 2010/2011 drought [56]. Of key importance is to make similar progress
    towards integrating cross-scale policies (e.g. national trade agreements, local
    subsidies) and food transfers (e.g. international and domestic food trade, food
    aid) into drought early warning systems through hierarchical and scalable network
    approaches. Recent implementation of risk-based frameworks [90,91] has demonstrated
    their value in enhancing resilience for both short-term (e.g. coping and recovery
    of drought) and long-term horizons (e.g. anticipating trends and variability for
    future long-term planning such as infrastructure, water banking, etc.). It is
    extremely challenging for policy-makers to identify and implement strategies which
    address the complexities and deep uncertainty associated with climate and non-climate
    factors (e.g. society, land use, economy, etc.) that lead to drought impacts [92].
    Generally speaking, there are two main approaches to deal with deep uncertainty
    from the decision making perspective [93]: Firstly, robust decision making approaches
    which look for strategies or interventions which guarantee a minimum performance
    against a wide range of possible future scenarios [94, 95••]; and finally, adaptive
    decision making approaches which periodically revise strategies and interventions
    to adapt to changes in the decision making context as future uncertainties unfold
    [96,97]. Recently developed end-to-end probabilistic risk assessment frameworks
    account for the full spectrum of risk (i.e. risk mitigation, risk forecast, and
    risk transfer instruments) [98]. This framework not only considers physical-loss
    risk due to lowered crop production caused by droughts, but also addresses how
    it translates to direct and indirect economic loss, which is more directly related
    to decision making. If applied in real contexts, such scientific advances have
    the potential to enable the exploration of constraints and tipping points of food
    security as well as the identification of probabilistic solutions that can be
    used for domestic food transfers to optimize food security across scales. However,
    research on the integration of such environmental and economic decision making
    into current drought monitoring and early forecasting systems is still in its
    infancy. Coupled modeling and assessment of human and natural systems Better understanding
    of drought risk and its translation to crop impacts is one aspect of supporting
    decision making. From the adaptation point of view, decision making can be more
    cost-effective if adaptation capacities associated with different levels of stakeholders
    (e.g. individual farmer, environmental agency) are jointly considered [99]. On
    one hand, this is important for more accurate estimation of agricultural water
    demand, especially over regions with irrigated agriculture, where farmers can
    adapt to droughts by changing their irrigation behaviors or through land use changes
    (e.g. changing crop types, fallowing land). Their decisions on agricultural management
    can be further aided if their perception on drought risk is better informed through
    seasonal forecasting [100]. The importance of such behavioral dynamics has been
    increasingly recognized by the physical modeling [101] and risk assessment communities
    [102], especially under the influence of climate change [103]. The recently developed
    human-climate model [104] enables the bi-directional coupling between human behaviors
    and the climate system, and represents a useful approach to understand the potential
    interaction of overlooked behavioral dimensions and environmental consequences.
    Such large-scale conceptual models can be applied in the context of drought to
    evaluate the usefulness of potential policy interventions as well as to identify
    feasible adaptation pathways that can lead to sustainable agricultural development.
    However, challenges still exist in terms of how to downscale the spatial human
    dimensions from larger (e.g. global scale) to more relevant scales (e.g. basin
    scale), and how to better consider the dynamics of interconnectedness across scales
    [105]. The scaling issue becomes even more vital as the increased pace of globalization
    is strengthening the inter-connectedness and tele-connectedness of coupled human–water
    systems [106]. More and more evidence has shown that even piecemeal behaviors/actions
    can add up to a much larger scale and trigger a cascade of effects [107,105].
    This further highlights the necessity to extend current coupled frameworks [108,109]
    to larger scales from the bottom-up point of view, but using hierarchical model
    structures to reconcile the top-down approach with layers of different spatial
    and temporal resolutions, and appropriate complexities thereof. Agent-based modeling
    (ABM) has advantages to characterize such complexities (e.g. farmer–farmer, farmer–government,
    farmer–environment interactions), but is usually limited to small spatial scales
    and is highly reliant on the availability of empirical data (e.g. survey data)
    to characterize various agents’ behaviors and their associated heterogeneity,
    as well as to validate model assumptions. Despite these challenges, coupled hydrological
    and ABM systems are useful to understand the relative importance of social and
    behavioral dimensions in agricultural decision making, compared to other factors
    (e.g. climate change). They also have the potential to promote behavioral changes
    and inform adaptation strategies to increase society''s resilience to drought
    [110]. Representing water-food-energy connections through multi-scale nexus approaches
    Progress towards reducing drought impacts on food security, and in general, towards
    achieving SDGs related to water, also needs consideration of the manifold interlinkages
    among water, food and energy [111, 112••, 113]. These interlinkages can be directly
    altered by climate shocks such as droughts [114], which themselves vary across
    different spatial and temporal scales. Of particular importance is the spatial
    dimension, recently highlighted by Liu et al. [115••], who proposed a new integrated
    and metacoupling framework for investigation of nexuses in three different types:
    intracoupling (within a specific place), pericoupling (between adjacent places)
    and telecoupling (between distance places). This framework can be used to understand
    the linkages between drought and food security, and help identify potential intra-regional
    policy instruments [114] to facilitate decision making for different levels of
    stakeholders. Take the food trade in sub-Saharan Africa as an example. Although
    local food production is vulnerable to prolonged droughts (e.g. Kenya), food shortage
    could be buffered by international food trade/aid. However, for the poorest of
    the population, food security can be negatively affected by the interaction of
    policies at different scales (e.g. local, domestic, international) [116], yet
    the spatial expression of these impacts is still unknown. Therefore, local to
    international food trade should be jointly considered for understanding and planning
    of the entire food system. This should also account for embedded virtual water,
    especially for countries (e.g. Pakistan) whose export of agricultural production
    is at the expense of environmental degradation (e.g. groundwater depletion) [22••].
    Furthermore, droughts can exacerbate competition for water resources between irrigation
    water supply and hydropower generation, usually through upstream-downstream relationships
    [117,118]. The fact that 54% of hydropower plants compete with irrigation water
    use at the global scale [18•] indicates that we need to reconcile competing water
    demands among different upstream-downstream sectors, optimize water use to minimize
    conflicts and maximize synergies among multiple goals [112••,95••]. The temporal
    scale of nexus approaches should also be considered for future planning, through
    scenario analysis based on explicit drought shocks [113] or through dynamic life
    cycle assessment methods [119]. Challenges, opportunities and future directions
    Progress towards closing yield gaps in the face of drought risk, and ensuring
    food security requires a range of research and interventions, including improving
    the availability and use of methodological tools (either physically based or data
    driven or both) and datasets (e.g. satellite remote sensing, climate and hydrological
    model simulations, citizen-science observations) for monitoring and predicting
    food security. It is of critical importance to deliver data (e.g. forecasts of
    drought and crop yield) at the time scale that is relevant for decision making
    and can be used to support management practices. These datasets should also be
    long-term, consistent and continuous such that risk quantification is robust and
    accurate enough. It is also critical to develop policy instruments which could
    balance the temporal trade-offs between conflicted short-term (e.g. buffer droughts
    through groundwater pumping) and long-term objectives (e.g. maintain sustainability
    of depletable groundwater resources). A more challenging issue is how to factor
    in climate change information for long-term planning such that drought risk management
    is adaptive and proactive [120,121]. This requires different levels of adaptation
    strategies that are targeted for different time horizons. For example, incremental
    adaptation (e.g. farmers make moderate changes of existing irrigation behaviors)
    may be adequate for the short-term response to drought, but large-scale transformation
    options (e.g. fundamental changes of agricultural systems through innovation)
    may be needed for longer planning horizon [122]. A specific challenge is to avoid
    maladaptation, in which short-term benefits may lead to worse situations in the
    long-term. This was reflected in the 2007–2009 California drought, where high
    agricultural and energy production were maintained through adaptation strategies
    that increase the vulnerability of other sectors in the long-term [123]. For instance,
    the increased purchase of natural gas to replace declining hydropower leads to
    more greenhouse gas emissions. Although high agricultural production was maintained
    during this drought, increased groundwater pumping over the Central Valley to
    cope with longer and more severe droughts for future generations is unsustainable.
    From the spatial perspective, we face challenges in terms of how to vertically
    integrate data, models, and decision making processes in a consistent way. The
    context and location specific challenges in drought-induced food insecurity require
    tailoring models and the representation of agricultural management (e.g. irrigation)
    to local, more policy-relevant scales, with a view to delivering effective climate/hydrologic
    services for food security. On one hand, we are benefiting from the wealth of
    data-based predictive information which can be used to understand drought risk
    and to reduce its agricultural impact. But on the other hand, this information
    is derived from different sources and is usually spatially and temporally downscaled/upscaled
    based on different assumptions, and therefore may lead to data inconsistencies.
    This highlights the need to merge information to reduce uncertainty. Given the
    increased availability of geospatial data emerging from various sources, a promising
    avenue is to combine machine learning with these data, but guided by physical
    modeling [49••], so that more interpretable information can be extracted and integrated
    across disciplines and scales. This will aid the development of nested models,
    which have flexible resolutions and complexities to consider multiple levels of
    spatial heterogeneity (e.g. local details, cross-scale interactions). Conflict

    • SLR is conducted using PRISMA approach and148 articles are selected and critically
    analyzed. • The results show the extent of digital technologies adoption in agriculture.
    • The potential benefits of digital technologies and roadblocks hindering their
    implementation in agriculture sector are identified and discussed. • The study
    will positively impact the research around agriculture 4.0. Abstract Agriculture
    is considered one of the most important sectors that play a strategic role in
    ensuring food security. However, with the increasing world''s population, agri-food
    demands are growing — posing the need to switch from traditional agricultural
    methods to smart agriculture practices, also known as agriculture 4.0. To fully
    benefit from the potential of agriculture 4.0, it is significant to understand
    and address the problems and challenges associated with it. This study, therefore,
    aims to contribute to the development of agriculture 4.0 by investigating the
    emerging trends of digital technologies in the agricultural industry. For this
    purpose, a systematic literature review based on Protocol of Preferred Reporting
    Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses is conducted to analyse the scientific
    literature related to crop farming published in the last decade. After applying
    the protocol, 148 papers were selected and the extent of digital technologies
    adoption in agriculture was examined in the context of service type, technology
    readiness level, and farm type. The results have shown that digital technologies
    such as autonomous robotic systems, internet of things, and machine learning are
    significantly explored and open-air farms are frequently considered in research
    studies (69%), contrary to indoor farms (31%). Moreover, it is observed that most
    use cases are still in the prototypical phase. Finally, potential roadblocks to
    the digitization of the agriculture sector were identified and classified at technical
    and socio-economic levels. This comprehensive review results in providing useful
    information on the current status of digital technologies in agriculture along
    with prospective future opportunities. Previous article in issue Next article

    problem Food security is a multidimensional concept that alleviates hunger by
    ensuring a sustainable, nutritious food supply. It is characterized by a four-pillar
    model shown in Fig. 1, with each pillar intrinsic to ensure food security [1].

    full-size image Fig. 2. Agriculture value chain: stages and main functions. Due
    to several anthropogenic factors, such as rapid population growth, urbanization,
    industrialization, farmland loss, freshwater scarcity, and environmental degradation,
    food security is becoming a serious global issue. This is because these factors
    are also directly impacting agricultural industry which is a primary source of
    agri-food production around the world. It is anticipated that by 2050 global population
    will be increased from the current 7.7 billion to 9.2 billion, urban population
    will be rise by 66%, arable land will be declined by approximately 50 million
    hectares, global GHG emissions (source of CO2 – promote crop disease and pest
    growth) will be increased by 50%, agri-food production will be declined by 20%,
    and eventually, food demand will be increased by 59 to 98% – posing an imminent
    threat to food security and adequate food availability [2], [3], [4]. To satisfy
    the increasing food demands, agricultural practitioners worldwide will need to
    maximise the agricultural productivity involving crop and livestock farming. In
    this review paper, the focus is on crop farming that involves cultivation of both
    food and cash crops. A typical agri-food value chain depicting three primary stages,
    namely pre-field (pre-plantation stage), in-field (plantation and harvesting stage),
    and post-field (post-harvesting stage) involved in the production of agricultural
    products is shown in Fig. 2. All the stages play a vital role in the value chain
    but, in this review, the second stage ˝in-field˝ will be considered that involves
    several crop growing processes such as plowing, sowing, spraying, and harvesting,
    etc. These processes currently employ traditional agricultural practices that
    are labor-intensive, require arable land, time, and a substantial amount of water
    (for irrigation) – making it a challenge to produce enough agri-food [5]. A part
    of problem is also related to irregular use of pesticides and herbicides and misuse
    of available technology which cause harm to crop and eventually resulting in agricultural
    wastes [6]. These issues can be addressed by integrating sophisticated technologies
    and computer-based applications that ensure high crop yield, less water consumption,
    optimised pesticide/herbicide utilization, and enhanced crop quality. This is
    where the smart agriculture concept comes in. 1.2. Smart agriculture Industry
    4.0, also known as the fourth industrial revolution, is revolutionizing, and reshaping
    every industry. It is a strategic initiative characterized by a fusion of emerging
    disruptive digital technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), big data and
    analytics (BDA), system integration (SI), cloud computing (CC), simulation, autonomous
    robotic systems (ARS), augmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI), wireless
    sensor networks (WSN), cyber-physical system (CPS), digital twin (DT), and additive
    manufacturing (AM) to enable the digitization of the industry [7]. The integration
    of these technologies in agriculture is sparking the next generation industrial
    agriculture, namely, agriculture 4.0 – also termed smart agriculture, smart farming,
    or digital farming [7]. Smart agriculture provides farmers with a diverse set
    of tools (shown in Fig. 3) to address several agricultural food production challenges
    associated with farm productivity, environmental impact, food security, crop losses,
    and sustainability. For instance, with IoT-enabled systems consisting of WSNs,
    farmers can connect to farms remotely irrespective of place and time to monitor
    and control farm operations. Drones equipped with hyperspectral cameras can be
    used to collect data from heterogeneous sources on farmlands and autonomous robots
    can be used to support or accomplish repetitive tasks at farms. Data analytics
    techniques can be employed to analyze the gathered data with computer applications
    can be used to assist farmers in decision-making process. Likewise, a wide variety
    of parameters related to environmental factors, weed control, crop production
    status, water management, soil conditions, irrigation scheduling, herbicides,
    and pesticides, and controlled environment agriculture can be monitored and analyzed
    in smart agriculture to increase crop yields, minimize costs, enhance product
    quality, and maintain process inputs through the use of modern systems [8]. Download

    The concept of “Smart Agriculture”. 1.3. Research motivation and contribution
    The motivation for preparing this review stems from the fact that digital technologies
    in agricultural systems offer new strategic solutions for enhancing the efficiency
    and effectiveness of farms’ production. Moreover, digital transformation provides
    a way forward to implement modern farming practices such as vertical farming (hydroponics,
    aquaponics and aeroponics), which has the potential to overcome food security
    problems. But there is a set of problems and limitations associated with this
    transformation from the technical, socio-economic, and management standpoint that
    must be death to fully exploit the potential of agriculture 4.0 [9]. There are
    number of studies that have discussed emerging trends in the development of agriculture
    4.0 by providing succinct information on key applications, advantages, and corresponding
    research challenges of smart farming [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15],
    [16], [17], [18]. The research focus of these studies is limited to either explaining
    more generic technical aspects while paying attention to only one or few digital
    technologies, and/or enhancing agricultural supply chain performance, and/or developing
    agriculture 4.0 definition, and/or achieving sustainable agronomy through precision
    agriculture, and/or proposing a smart farming framework. Nevertheless, these studies
    do not involve explicit discussion on the tools and techniques used to develop
    different systems and maturity level of these systems. There is also a lack of
    studies considering modern soilless farms such as hydroponics, aquaponics and
    aeroponics (indoor/outdoor) and implications of digital technologies in these
    farms. Hence, it is necessary to analyse the evolution of agriculture 4.0 from
    different perspectives to stimulate the discussion in the area. This study aims
    to present a holistic overview of digital technologies implemented in second stage
    of agricultural production value chain (in-field) for different types of farms
    as mentioned in section 1.1. The main theoretical contribution of the study involves
    analysis and dissemination of the tools and techniques employed, the farm type,
    the maturity level of the developed systems, along with potential roadblocks or
    inhibiting factors in development of agriculture 4.0. The reflections presented
    in the review will support researchers and agricultural practitioner in future
    research on agriculture 4.0. 1.4. Paper organization Following the introduction,
    the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses the approach used to gather
    the relevant literature; then, Section 3 presents the statistical results obtained
    after a general analysis of the selected research studies; next, Section 4 provides
    a detailed overview of the core technologies used in the digitization of agriculture;
    after, Section 5 highlights the technical and socio-economic roadblocks to digital
    integration in agriculture; next, Section 6 outlines a discussion about the research
    questions followed by added value, considerations and future prospects related
    to agricultural digitization, and transition to agriculture 5.0; and lastly, Section
    8 concludes the review. 2. Research methodology A systematic literature review
    (SLR) is a tool used to manage the diverse knowledge and identify research related
    to a predetermined topic [19]. In this study, SLR is conducted to investigate
    the status of Industry 4.0 technologies in agricultural industry. Particularly,
    cases are searched where the term ‘agriculture’ appeared concurrently in the title,
    abstract, or keywords of an article with any of the ‘Industry 4.0 technologies”
    mentioned in section 1.2. Before conducting the SLR, a review protocol is defined
    to ensure a transparent and high-quality research process, which are the characteristics
    that make a literature review systematic [20]. The review protocol also helps
    to minimize bias by conducting exhaustive literature searches. This includes three
    steps: the formulation of the research questions, the definition of the search
    strategy, and the specification of inclusion and exclusion criteria. This paper
    uses a preferred reporting item for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA)
    approach to conduct SLR. PRISMA is an evidence-based minimum set of items that
    are used to guide the development process of systematic literature reviews and
    other meta-analyses [19]. 2.1. Review protocol A review protocol (in Table 1)
    is defined before conducting the bibliographic analysis to identify, evaluate,
    and interpret results relevant to the research scope. First, research questions
    are formulated to provide insight into the analysis of published studies in the
    research area of interest from different dimensions. These questions need to be
    answered in the study. Next, the search strategy is defined, which helps identify
    appropriate keywords later in the search equation to identify the relevant information
    sources, such as academic databases and search engines that provide access to
    a massive amount of digital documentation. Three online research repositories
    are used to retrieve relevant studies: ScienceDirect1, Scopus2, and IEEE Xplore3.
    Finally, to refine the search results of each database, boundaries are set by
    predefining inclusion and exclusion criteria for further investigation and content
    assessments of selected publications. It involves, for instance, defining the
    time interval for the research process from 2011 to 2021 to limit the studies
    to those published in English, disregarding chapters of books and grey literature,
    such as reports and summaries of events and seminars. These last two steps of
    the review protocol allow the preliminary filtering of metadata sources and narrow
    down the scope of research. Table 1. Review protocol for systematic literature

    search process is done in four stages: identification, screening, eligibility,
    and inclusion, as detailed by the PRISMA flow diagram shown in Fig. 4. After initial
    metadata filtering through the application of search expression, a total of 3165
    records are found (1690 from Scopus, 926 from ScienceDirect, and 549 from IEEE
    Xplore), which are then consolidated for the removal of duplicate items in the
    identification stage. The number of publications after this step is reduced to
    2876. In the screening stage, the titles and abstracts of the papers are analyzed,
    and only 498 papers are selected for integral reading. In the third stage, full-text
    screening of these articles is performed to verify their eligibility in relation
    to the objective of this paper, which is to answer the research questions mentioned
    in Table 1. Of the 498 papers, 137 are found to be relevant for this review. Another
    11 are added through a cross-referencing approach, adding up to 148 papers selected
    in the final stage for further analysis. Download : Download high-res image (624KB)

    search process (PRISMA). 2.3. Threats to validity i SLR replication: The presented
    SLR is susceptible to threats to validity because the current search is limited
    to only three online repositories. More publications could potentially be found
    if additional sources were explored. The process of SLR is described clearly in
    sub-sections 2.1 and 2.2, and hence, validity can be considered well addressed.
    However, in the case of replication of this SLR, it is possible that one can find
    slightly different publications. This difference would result from different personal
    choices during the screening and eligibility steps of PRISMA, but it is highly
    unlikely that the overall findings would change. ii Search string: the search
    string used to find the relevant studies cover the whole scope of SLR, but there
    is a possibility that valuable studies might have been missed. Additional keywords
    and synonyms with a broader search might return more studies. 3. Digitization
    trends in agriculture The year-wise distribution of the 148 articles from 2011
    to 2021 is represented in Fig. 5. Around 22% of the scientific publications in
    the last ten years were published in 2018. This reflects that the agricultural
    industry is making considerable progress in the context of the implementation
    of digital technologies, but the pace is still slow as compared to other domains
    such as healthcare, manufacturing, mining, automotive, energy, etc.,[15]. Download

    of the 148 selected research studies. The farm type refers to the crop farming
    method considered while developing an application or framework. For instance,
    the farming method can be soil-based or soilless. The soil-based farming category
    involves open-air fields (traditional outdoor agricultural farms) and greenhouse
    farms (indoor). On the other hand, the soilless farming category involves modern
    farming practices such as aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics (mostly indoor).
    The numbers at the top of the stacked column in Fig. 6 indicate the total number
    of studies that have used the particular technology to develop a smart agriculture
    system, whereas different colors of columns indicate the respective farm types.
    Use cases are from these publications are analysed, and conclusions are drawn.
    For instance, it is found that autonomous robotics systems (including unmanned
    guided vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles (drones)), internet of things, and
    machine learning appear to be the widely applied technologies in the agricultural
    domain in the last decade. The same illustration suggests that big data, wireless
    sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and digital twins are the emerging areas
    in agriculture. Moreover, open-air farms are the most frequently considered in
    research studies (69%), contrary to indoor farms (31%). For soilless farming systems
    (aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics), only 22 publications are found, which
    insinuates that these modern farming practices are still in their infancy. Likewise,
    services of each use case are identified and are classified under nine different
    service categories, namely: i) crop management, CM (Estimation/ prediction of
    crop yield/ growth rate/ harvesting period and seed plantation/ harvesting/ pollination/
    spraying (fertilizer/ pesticide)); ii) crop quality management, CQM (fresh weight,
    green biomass, height, length, width, leaf density, piment content (chlorophyll)
    and phytochemical composition); iii) water and environment management, WEM (monitoring
    and control of flow rate, water level, water quality (nutrients), temperature,
    humidity, CO2, and weather forecast etc.); iv) irrigation management, IM (water
    stress detection and scheduling); v) farm management, FM (monitoring of farm operations,
    tracking and counting products, determining production efficiency, financial analysis,
    energy consumption analysis, technology integration and decisions implementation);
    vi) pest and disease management, PDM (pest identification and disease detection);
    vii) soil management, SM (moisture content, soil nutrients, fertilizer needs and
    application); viii) weed and unwanted vegetation management, WUVM (weed/unknown
    vegetation mapping, classification, and herbicides application); and ix) fruit
    detection and counting, FDC — as shown in Fig. 7. These categories illustrate
    the role of different digital technologies in smart farming. Upon analysis, it
    is found that crop management parameters, such as crop yield prediction, growth
    rate estimation, or evaluation of harvesting period are the most frequently researched
    areas for agriculture 4.0 in the last decade (29%), whereas very little heed is
    paid towards soil management (2%), fruit detection and counting (2%), and crop
    quality management (3%). Download : Download high-res image (561KB) Download :

    using European Union''s TRL scale that partitions system''s maturity level into
    three generic levels [21]. The first level is conceptual, that represents European
    TRL 1–2 (use case is in conceptual phase), the second level is the prototype,
    which means European TRL 3–6 (use case is working even without the complete planned
    functionality), and the third level is deployed, that includes European TRL 7–9
    (use case is mature with all the possible functions). Fig. 8 depicts the TRL of
    each use case developed in selected studies. It is observed that little progress
    has been made in advancing smart agricultural systems beyond the concept and prototype
    levels to the commercial level. For instance, most use cases (129) are at the
    prototype level. Download : Download high-res image (269KB) Download : Download

    provides critical insights towards answering RQ1 and RQ2 from Table 1. 4.1. Internet
    of Things driven agricultural systems Internet of things (IoT) refers to a cosmos
    of interrelated computing devices, sensors, appliances, and machines connected
    with the internet, each having unique identities and capabilities for performing
    remote sensing and monitoring [21]. The reference architecture of IoT with six
    layers, namely perception layer (hardware devices), network layer (communication),
    middleware layer (device management and interoperability), service layer (cloud
    computing), application layer (data integration and analytics), and end-user layer
    (user-interface), is shown in Fig.9. In the agricultural domain, IoT devices in
    the physical layer gather data related to environmental and crop parameters such
    as temperature, humidity, pH value, water level, leaf color, fresh leaf weight,
    etc. The transmission of this data takes place in the network layer, the design
    of which depends on the selection of suitable communication technologies relevant
    to the field size, farm location, and type of farming method. For instance, ZigBee,
    LoRa, and Sigfox are widely used and employed in outdoor fields because they are
    cheaper and have low energy consumption and a good transmission range [22,23].
    Despite being a secure technology, Bluetooth is only used in indoor farms as it
    offers a short transmission range [22]. Wi-Fi is not a promising technology for
    agricultural applications due to its high costs and high energy consumption [22].
    RFID (radio frequency identification) and NFC (near field communication) technologies,
    on the other hand, are increasingly being implemented in agricultural systems
    for tracking agricultural products [24]. GPRS or mobile communication technology
    (2G, 3G, and 4G) are used for periodic monitoring of environmental and soil parameters.
    In addition, communication protocols mostly used in the agricultural scenarios
    are HTTP, WWW, and SMTP. Likewise, to ensure interoperability and system security
    to their context-aware functionalities, middleware HYDRA and SMEPP are mostly
    employed in agricultural systems [25]. To store data, cloud computing techniques
    are employed in the service layer. This data is then used in the application layer
    to build smart applications used by farmers, agriculture experts, and supply chain
    professionals to enhance farm monitoring capacity and productivity. Download :

    architecture of Internet of Things (IoT), (adapted) [26]. The integration of IoT
    in agriculture is meant to empower farmers with the decision tools and automation
    technologies that seamlessly integrate knowledge, products, and services to achieve
    high productivity, quality, and profit. A multitude of studies is performed and
    put forward concerning the incubation of the IoT concepts in the agricultural
    sector. The main findings of some of the studies are presented in Table 2. Multiple
    technological issues and architectural problems have been addressed through the
    development of IoT-based agricultural systems. But most of these systems are either
    in a conceptual stage or in a prototype form (not commercial) at the moment. Focus
    is mainly laid on-farm management, irrigation control, crop growth, health monitoring,
    and disease detection. Some of these studies have also explained IoT implementation
    in modern agricultural systems such as vertical farming (soilless farming - aquaponics,
    hydroponics, and aeroponics) and greenhouse farming (soil-based). Moreover, most
    studies have focused on addressing a specific problem. Table 2. IoT-driven agricultural

    networks in agriculture Wireless sensor network (WSN) is regarded as a technology
    that is used within an IoT system. It can be defined as a group of spatially distributed
    sensors for monitoring the physical conditions of the environment, temporarily
    storing the collected data, and transmitting the gathered information at a central
    location [22]. The general architecture of WSN is shown in Fig. 10. A WSN for
    smart farming is made up of numerous sensor nodes connected through a wireless
    connection module. These nodes have a variety of abilities (e.g., processing,
    transmission, and sensation) that allow them to self-organize, self-configure,
    and self-diagnose. There are different types of WSNs, which are categorized depending
    on the environment where they are deployed. These include terrestrial wireless
    sensor networks (TWSNs), wireless underground sensor networks (WUSNs), underwater
    wireless sensor networks (UWSNs), wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs),
    and mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSNs) [55]. In agricultural applications,
    TWSN and UWSN are widely used. In TWSNs, the nodes are deployed above the ground
    surface, consisting of sensors for gathering the surrounding data. The second
    variant of WSNs is its underground counterpart – WUSNs, where sensor nodes are
    planted inside the soil. In this setting, lower frequencies easily penetrate through
    the soil, whereas higher frequencies suffer severe attenuation [56]. Therefore,
    the network requires a higher number of nodes to cover a large area because of
    the limited communication radius. Many research articles are available in the
    literature that discusses the use of WSN for different outdoor and indoor farms’
    applications such as irrigation management, water quality assessment, and environmental
    monitoring. A summary of some of these articles is given in Table 3. These studies
    have focused on developing WSNs architectures that are simplified, low cost, energy-efficient
    and scalable. Yet, various factors associated with WSNs need further attention,
    such as minimum maintenance, robust and fault-tolerant architecture, and interoperability.

    [66] 4.3. Cloud computing in agriculture According to the National Institute of
    Standard and Technologies (NIST), cloud computing (CC) is defined as a model for
    enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of
    configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications,
    and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management
    effort or service provider interaction [67]. The main architecture of CC shown
    in Fig. 11 is comprised of four layers: datacenter (hardware), infrastructure,
    platform, and application [68]. Each of these layers is linked with specific cloud
    service models, which are classified as software as a service (SaaS), platform
    as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS). Cloud computing has
    gained great attention over the past decade in the agriculture sector because
    it provides: 1) inexpensive storage services for data gathered from different
    domains through WSNs and other preconfigured IoT devices, 2) large-scale computing
    systems to perform intelligent decision-making by transforming this raw data into
    useful knowledge, and 3) a secure platform to develop agricultural IoT applications
    [69]. In combination with IoT and WSN, CC is employed to develop different agricultural
    applications, most of which are presented in Tables 2 and 3. CC technology is
    also used to create operational farm management systems (FMSs) to support farmers
    and farm managers in efficient monitoring of farm operations Table 4. presents
    the salient features of some of these FMSs. Another topic of interest that is
    being explored in global research is related to the traceability of agri-product
    quality [70]. But only preliminary research has been attempted to explore traceability
    compliance with standards of food safety and quality. Download : Download high-res

    systems have the potential to solve problems of increasing food demands, environmental
    pollution caused by excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers, and the safety
    of agricultural products. These FMSs, however, do not have the capability to support
    run-time customization in relation to distinct requirements of farmers. Moreover,
    because most farm data is usually fragmented and dispersed, it is difficult to
    record farm activities properly in current FMSs applications [75]. 4.4. Edge/fog
    computing in agriculture The rapid development of IoT has led to the explosive
    growth of sensors and smart devices, generating large volumes of data. The processing
    and analysis of such an enormous amount of data in real-time are challenging because
    it increases the load on the cloud server and also reduces the response speed.
    Simply using a cloud server is not able to provide real-time response while handling
    such a large data set. Additionally, IoT applications are sensitive to network
    latency because they require a constant exchange of information between devices
    and the cloud, making CC unfeasible to handle these applications [23]. The emergence
    of the edge computing concept can resolve the problems associated with CC. This
    new computing model deploys computing and storage resources (such as cloudlets
    or fog nodes) at the edge of the network closer to data sources such as mobile
    devices or sensors. This way, it can facilitate real-time analytics while keeping
    data secure on the device [23]. Edge computing offers intriguing possibilities
    for smart agriculture, but the applications of this technology are only in their
    infancy in agricultural systems. Hence, few research studies are available in
    this area; see Table 5. Most of the edge computing-based agricultural systems
    discussed in these studies are prototypical and address a limited selection of
    problems in various agricultural domains. So far, interoperability and scalability
    issues have not received sufficient consideration. Table 5. Edge computing-based

    robot systems in agriculture Autonomous robot systems (ARS) are intelligent machines
    capable of performing tasks, making decisions, and acting in real-time, with a
    high degree of autonomy (without external influence or without explicit human
    intervention) [83]. Interest in agricultural ARS (AARS) has grown significantly
    in recent years because of their ability to automate some practices in outdoor
    and indoor farms - including seeding, watering, fertilizing, spraying, plant monitoring
    and phenotyping, environmental monitoring, disease detection, weed and pest controlling,
    and harvesting [15]. The agricultural robots use a combination of emerging technologies
    such as computer vision, WSNs, satellite navigation systems (GPS), AI, CC, and
    IoT, thereby facilitating the farmers to enhance productivity and quality of agricultural
    products. AARS in smart farming can be mobile AARS, which can move throughout
    the working field, or fixed AARS [84]. Mobile AARSs are further classified into
    unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) and 2) unnamed aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are
    explained in the following sections. 4.5.1. Unmanned ground vehicles in agriculture
    Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are agricultural robots that operate on the ground
    without a human operator. The main components of UGVs generally include; a platform
    for locomotive apparatus and manipulator, sensors for navigation, a supervisory
    control system, an interface for the control system, the communication links for
    information exchange between devices, and a system architecture for integration
    between hardware and software agents [85]. The control architecture of UGV can
    be remote-operated (controlled by a human operator via the interface) or fully
    autonomous (operated without the need for a human controller based on artificial
    intelligence technologies) [85]. Likewise, locomotive systems can be based on
    wheels, tracks, or legs [85]. Despite high ground adaptability, intrinsic omnidirectionality
    and soil protection of legged robots, they are uncommon in agriculture. However,
    when combined with wheels (wheel-legged robots), these robots offer a disruptive
    locomotion system for smart farms. In addition to their needed characteristics
    for infield operations, UGV should fulfill certain requirements such as small
    size, maneuverability, resilience, efficiency, human-friendly interface, and safety
    – to enhance crop yields and farm productivity. Table 6 summarizes the diverse
    range of UGVs designed for agricultural operations. Table 6. Different types of

    above have a 4WD locomotive system because it offers ease of construction and
    control. The drawback of 4WD is that the wheels are strongly affected by terrains
    containing stone elements and/or cavities [85]. Hence, it is significant to explore
    other mechanisms, such as legged or wheel-legged locomotive systems. Some robots
    have computer vision systems, but due to the difficulty of developing an accurate
    and reliable system that replaces manual labor, most of these robots are built
    with a low-cost computer vision system, that is, using conventional RGB cameras.
    Moreover, most of the systems mentioned above are still in the research phase,
    with no commercial use on a large scale. 4.5.2. Unmanned aerial vehicles in agriculture
    Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or aerial robots are aircrafts with no human pilot
    on board. Depending on the type of technology incorporated to fly (wing structure)
    and autonomy level, there is a wide variety of UAVs [96]. For instance, according
    to wing type, UAVs can be fixed-wing (planes), single-rotor (helicopter), hybrid
    system (vertical takeoff and landing), and multirotor (drone). Among these, drones
    (multi-rotor technology) which are lifted and propelled by four (quadrotor) or
    six (hex-rotor) rotors, have become increasingly popular in the agriculture sector
    due to their mechanical simplicity in comparison to helicopters, which rely on
    a much more sophisticated plate control mechanism [97]. Similarly, according to
    autonomy level, UAVs can be either teleoperated in which the pilot provides references
    to each actuator of the aircraft so as to control it, in the same manner, an onboard
    pilot would, or tele-commanded in which the aircraft relies on an automatic controller
    on board that is in charge of maintaining a stable flight [96]. Equipped with
    the appropriate sensors (vision, infrared, multispectral, and hyperspectral cameras,
    etc.), agricultural UAVs allow farmers to obtain data (vegetation, leaf area,
    and reflectance indexes) from their fields to study dynamic changes in crops that
    cannot be detected by scouting the ground [98]. This data permits farmers to infer
    information related to crop diseases, nutrient deficiencies, water level, and
    other crop growth parameters. With this information, farmers can plan possible
    remedies (irrigation, fertilization, weed control, etc.). Table 7 reviews some
    of the UAV-based systems used for different agricultural operations. Table 7.

    Most of the systems mentioned above are still in the research phase, with no commercial
    use on a large scale. Other problems with these UAVs are associated with battery
    and flight time [96]. At the moment, lithium-ion batteries are being used because
    their capacity is larger than that of conventional batteries. But an increase
    in battery capacity increases the drone weight, and now research is undergoing
    to address this issue. In addition, the existing UAVs have complex user interfaces,
    and only experts can use them to perform agricultural tasks. By improving the
    user interface making it human-centered with multimodal feedback will allow people
    who are older or unfamiliar with UAV technology to control it more easily. 4.6.
    Big data and analytics in agriculture Rapid developments in IoT and CC technologies
    have increased the magnitude of data immeasurably. This data, also referred to
    as Big Data (BD), includes textual content (i.e., structured, semi-structured,
    and unstructured), and multimedia content (e.g., videos, images, audio) [119].
    The process of examining this data to uncover hidden patterns, unknown correlations,
    market trends, customer preferences, and other useful information is referred
    to as big data analytics (BDA). Big data is typically characterized according
    to five dimensions defined by five Vs, which are displayed in Fig. 12 [120]. The
    paradigm of BD-driven smart agriculture is comparatively new, but the trend of
    this application is positive as it has the capacity to bring a revolutionary change
    in the food supply chain and food security through increased production. Agricultural
    big data is usually generated from various sectors and stages in agriculture,
    which can be collected either from agricultural fields through ground sensors,
    aerial vehicles, and ground vehicles using special cameras and sensors; from governmental
    bodies in the form of reports and regulations; from private organizations through
    online web services; from farmers in the form of knowledge through surveys; or
    from social media [120]. The data can be environmental (weather, climate, moisture
    level, etc.), biological (plant disease), or geo-spatial depending on the agricultural
    domain and differs in volume, velocity, and formats [121]. The gathered data is
    stored in a computer database and processed by computer algorithms for analyzing
    seed characteristics, weather patterns, soil properties (like pH or nutrient content),
    marketing and trade management, consumers’ behavior, and inventory management.
    A variety of techniques and tools are employed to analyze big data in agriculture.
    A summary of some of the studies is given in Table 8. Machine learning, cloud-based
    platforms, and modeling and simulation are the most commonly used techniques.
    Particularly, machine learning tools are used in prediction, clustering, and classification
    problems. Whereas cloud platforms are used for large-scale data storing, preprocessing,
    and visualization. There are still many potential areas that are not adequately
    covered in existing literature, where BDA can be applied to address various agricultural
    issues. For instance, these include data-intensive greenhouses and indoor vertical
    farming systems, quality control and health monitoring of crops in outdoor and
    indoor farms, genetic engineering, decision support platforms to assist farmers
    in the design of indoor vertical farms, and scientific models for policymakers
    to assist them in decision-making regarding the sustainability of the physical
    ecosystem. Lastly, most systems are still in the prototypical stage. Download

    [125] 4.7. Artificial intelligence in agriculture Artificial intelligence (AI)
    involves the development of theory and computer systems capable of performing
    tasks requiring human intelligence, such as sensorial perception and decision-making
    [126]. Combined with CC, IoT, and big data, AI, particularly in the facet of machine
    learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), is regarded as one of the key drivers behind
    the digitization of agriculture. These technologies have the potential to enhance
    crop production and improve real-time monitoring, harvesting, processing, and
    marketing [127]. Several intelligent agricultural systems are developed that use
    ML and DL algorithms to determine various parameters like weed detection, yield
    prediction, or disease identification. These systems are discussed in the next
    two sub-sections. 4.7.1. Machine learning in agriculture Machine learning (ML)
    techniques are broadly classified into three categories: 1) supervised learning
    (linear regression, regression trees, non-linear regression, Bayesian linear regression,
    polynomial regression, and support vector regression), 2) unsupervised learning
    (k-means clustering, hierarchal clustering, anomaly detection, neural networks
    (NN), principal component analysis, independent component analysis, a-priori algorithm
    and singular value decomposition (SVD)); and 3) reinforcement learning (Markov
    decision process (MDP) and Q learning) [128]. ML techniques and algorithms are
    implemented in the agriculture sector for crop yield prediction, disease, and
    weed detection, weather prediction (rainfall), soil properties estimation (type,
    moisture content, pH, temperature, etc.), water management, determination of the
    optimal amount of fertilizer, and livestock production and management [129] Table
    9. presents a list of publications where different ML algorithms are utilized
    for various agricultural applications. From the analysis of these articles, “crop
    yield prediction” is a widely explored area, and linear regression, neural network
    (NN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) is the most used ML
    techniques to enable smart farming. The presented use cases are still in the research
    phase with no reported commercial usage at the moment. Moreover, it is also found
    that AI and ML techniques are sparsely explored in the greenhouse and indoor vertical
    farming systems, particularly hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics. There are
    only a few publications available summarized in the same table where ML techniques
    are employed. Considering the digital transformation''s cyber-security and data
    privacy challenges, new approaches such as federated learning and privacy-preserving
    methods are being developed to enable digital farming [130]. These approaches
    build ML models from local parameters without sharing private data samples, thus
    mitigating security issues. Table 9. Machine learning-based agricultural systems.

    Prototype [148] 4.7.2. Deep learning in agriculture Deep learning (DL) represents
    the extension of classical ML that can solve complex problems (predictions and
    classification) particularly well and fast because more “depth” (complexity) is
    added into the model. The primary advantage of DL is feature learning which involves
    automatic extraction of features (high-level information) from large datasets
    [149]. Different DL algorithms are convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long
    short term memory (LSTM) networks, recurrent neural (RNN) networks, generative
    adversarial networks (GANs), radial basis function networks (RBFNs), multilayer
    perceptron (MLPs), feedforward artificial neural network (ANN), self-organizing
    maps (SOMs), deep belief networks (DBNs), restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs),
    and autoencoders. A detailed description of these algorithms, popular architectures,
    and training platforms is available at various sources [150]. Fig. 13 illustrates
    an example of DL architecture of CNN [151]. In the agriculture sector, DL algorithms
    are mostly used to solve problems associated with computer vision applications
    that target the prediction of key parameters, such as crop yields, soil moisture
    content, weather conditions, and crop growth conditions; the detection of diseases,
    pests, and weed; and the identification of leaf or plant species [152]. Computer
    vision is an interdisciplinary field that has been gaining huge amounts of traction
    in recent years due to the surge in CNNs. It offers methods and techniques that
    allow the processing of digital images accurately and enables computers to interpret
    and understand the visual world [153]. A summary of agricultural applications
    using DL and computer vision techniques is given in Table 10. Among all the DL
    algorithms, CNNs or Convet and its variants are the most used algorithms in agricultural
    applications. The variants of CNN are region-based CNNs (RCNN), Fast-RCNN, Faster-RCNN,
    YOLO, and Mask-RCNN, among which the first four are mostly used to solve object
    detection problems. Mask-RCNN, on the other hand, is used to solve instance segmentation
    problems. The reader could refer to the existing bibliography for a detailed description
    of these algorithms and their applications [152]. Few studies have also used other
    DL techniques. Talking about datasets, most DL models are trained using images,
    and few models are trained using sensor data gathered from fields. This shows
    that DL can be applied to a wide variety of datasets. It is also observed that
    most of the work is done on outdoor farms, whereas next-generation farms (environment-controlled)
    are not extensively explored. Though DL has the potential to enable digital farming,
    most systems are still in the prototype phase. Additionally, the new challenges
    imposed by cyber-security and privacy issues require optimization of current DL
    and computer vision approaches. Download : Download high-res image (334KB) Download

    decision support systems A decision support system (DSS) can be defined as a smart
    system that supports decision-making to specific demands and problems by providing
    operational answers to stakeholders and potential users based on useful information
    extracted from raw data, documents, personal knowledge, and/or models [170]. DSS
    can be data-driven, model-driven, communication-driven, document-driven, and knowledge-driven.
    The salient features of these DSSs are available at following source [171]. Fig.
    14 presents the general architecture of a DSS, consisting of four fundamental
    components, each having its specific purpose. Download : Download high-res image

    (adapted) [187]. Due to the evolution of agriculture 4.0, the amount of farming
    data has increased immensely. To transfer this heterogenous data into practical
    knowledge, platforms like agricultural decision support systems (ADSS) are required
    to make evidence-based and precise decisions regarding farm operation and facility
    layout [172]. Over the past few years, ADSSs are gaining much attention in the
    agriculture sector. A number of ADSSs have been developed that focus on a variety
    of agricultural aspects, such as farm management, water management, and environmental
    management. Table 11 presents a summary of the ADSSs found in the literature.
    From this analysis, most ADSSs have been found to not consider expert knowledge,
    which is highly valuable as it allows to development of systems as per user''s
    needs. The other reported issues with some of these ADDSs are complex GUIs, inadequate
    re-planning components, a lack of prediction and forecast abilities, and a lack
    of ability to adapt to uncertain and dynamic factors. It is also worth noting
    that all the ADSSs are for outdoor agricultural systems and are in the research
    phase. In comparison, the application of ADSS in indoor soilless farming is still
    very much unexploited. Table 11. Agricultural decision support systems. Use case

    As one of the main technologies of Industry 4.0, a cyber-physical system (CPS)
    refers to an automated distributed system that integrates physical processes with
    communication networks and computing infrastructures [184]. There are three standard
    CPS reference architecture models: namely, 5C, RAMI 4.0, and IIRA, and their detailed
    description is available at following source [185]. Among these, the 5C is a well-known
    reference model with widespread usage. The architecture of 5C consists of five
    levels which are represented in Fig. 15. CPS benefits from a variety of existing
    technologies such as agent systems, IoT, CC, augmented reality, big data, and
    ML [186]. Its implementation ensures scalability, adaptability, autonomy, reliability,
    resilience, safety, and security improvements. Download : Download high-res image
    (461KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 16. Schematic of a digital twinning
    process, (adapted) [199]. Agricultural field is regarded as one of the complex
    domains that can benefit from CPS technology. Agricultural cyber-physical systems
    (ACPSs) use advanced electronic technologies and agricultural facilities to build
    integrated farm management systems that interact with the physical environment
    to maintain an optimal growth environment for crops [188]. ACPSs collect the essential
    and appropriate data about climate, soil, and crops, with high accuracy and use
    it to manage watering, humidity, and plant health, etc. A variety of ACPSs has
    been developed for the management of different services, and their summary is
    given in Table 12. Looking at these ACPSs, most systems are still at the prototype
    and conceptual level. Moreover, most studies are conducted for outdoor farms,
    with only a few works published related to soil-based greenhouse systems. No study
    is found that is relevant to indoor soilless farming systems. ACPSs has attracted
    significant research interest because of their promising applications across different
    domains; deploying CPS models in real-life applications is still a challenge as
    it requires proper hardware and software [189]. Moreover, particular attention
    should be given to autonomy, robustness, and resilience while engineering ACPSs
    in order to handle the unpredictability of the environment and the uncertainty
    of the characteristics of agricultural facilities. There are multiple factors
    (humans, sensors, robots, crops, and data, among others) that impact ACPSs. To
    ensure a smooth operation while avoiding conflicts, errors, and disruptions, ACPSs
    need to be designed carefully and comprehensively. Table 12. Agricultural cyber-physical

    in agriculture Digital twin (DT) is a dynamic virtual replica of a real-life (physical)
    object of which it mirrors its behaviors and states over multiple stages of object''s
    lifecycle by using real-world data, simulation, and machine learning models, combined
    with data analytics to enable understanding, learning, and reasoning [198]. A
    complete description of the DT concept for any physical system requires consolidation
    and formalization of various characteristics, including the physical and virtual
    entities, the physical and virtual environments, the metrology, and realization
    modules that perform the physical to virtual and the virtual to physical connection
    or twinning, the twinning and twinning rate, and the physical and virtual processes
    [199]. The schematic showing the mapping of these characteristics is shown in
    Fig. 16. The DT concept has gained prominence due to the advances in the technologies
    such as the Internet of Things, big data, wireless sensor networks, and cloud
    computing. This is because these technologies allow real-time monitoring of physical
    twins at high spatial resolutions through both miniature devices and remote sensing
    that produce ever-increasing data streams [21]. The concept of DT in agricultural
    applications is rather immature as compared to other disciplines with its first
    references occurred in 2017; hence its added value has not yet been discussed
    extensively [21]. This is because framing is a highly complex and dynamic domain
    because of its dependence on natural conditions (climate, soil, humidity) and
    presence of living physical twins (plants and animals) and non-living physical
    twins (indoor farm buildings, grow beds, outdoor agricultural fields, agricultural
    machinery). The non-living physical twins interact directly or indirectly with
    plants and animals (living physical twins), thereby introducing more challenges
    for DT in agriculture. Whereas in other domains such as manufacturing DTs are
    mostly concerned with non-living physical twins. Table 13 summarises the agricultural
    DTs developed in the last 10 years. Table 13. Digital twins in agriculture Use

    computational units Prototype Open-air [207] The analysis shows that most studies
    have focused on open-air farming systems. Only one study is found that has proposed
    DT for soil-based vertical farming system and one study that implemented DT for
    soilless farming system (aquaponics). This might be because the design and management
    of modern farming systems are challenging. Moreover, most DTs are in the research
    phase with no commercial deployment at the moment. The reported benefits of the
    DT applications in agriculture are cost reductions, catastrophe prevention, clearer
    decision making, and efficient management operations, which can be applied to
    several agricultural subfields like plant and animal breeding, aquaponics, vertical
    farming, cropping systems, and livestock farming. While DT technology has great
    potential, achieving the synchronization between the physical entity and its digital
    counterpart is challenging. The complexity of this process is further amplified
    in agricultural systems due to the idiosyncrasies of living physical twins. Hence,
    implementation of agricultural DT should start with micro-farms, which can then
    be gradually enhanced to an intelligent and autonomous version by incorporating
    more components. 4.11. Roadblocks in digitization of agriculture industry This
    section provides an answer to RQ3 by listing a series of interconnected roadblocks
    hampering a larger adoption of digital technologies in the agriculture sector.
    After analysing 148 articles, 21 roadblocks are identified which can be categorized
    at technical and socio-economic levels. 4.12. Technical roadblocks • Interoperability:
    data is considered a cornerstone for the success of smart systems. Agricultural
    data usually comes from multiple heterogeneous sources such as thousands of individual
    farmlands, animal factories, and enterprise applications. This data can have diverse
    formats, making data integration complex. Hence, data interoperability is essential
    to enhance the value of this massively dispersed data after systematic data collection,
    storage, processing, and knowledge mining [208]. Likewise, for establishing effective
    communication between heterogeneous devices, they need to be interconnected and
    interoperable. With cross-technology communication, interoperability of the system
    can be improved [209]. • Standardization: to fully exploit the digital technologies
    for smart farming applications, standardization of the devices is essential. Output
    differences can occur because of misinterpretation and alterations from time to
    time. With standardization, the interoperability issues of the devices, applications,
    and systems can also be resolved [25]. • Dataquality: to produce meaningful results,
    data quality is also crucial along with data security, storage, and openness.
    The lack of decentralized data management systems is another roadblock hindering
    the adoption of smart farming practices [9]. This issue decreases the willingness
    of multiple actors to share agriculture data. • Hardwareimplementation: the deployment
    of a smart agricultural setup in large-scale open fields is extremely challenging.
    This is because all the hardware consisting of IoT devices, wireless sensor networks,
    sensor nodes, machinery, and equipment directly exposed to harsh environmental
    conditions such as heavy rainfall, high/low-temperature levels, extreme humidity,
    strong wind speeds and many other possible dangers which can destroy electronic
    circuits or disrupt their normal functionality [210]. A possible solution is to
    build an adequate casing for all the costly devices that is robust and durable
    enough to endure real field conditions [211]. • Adequatepower sources: typically,
    the wireless devices deployed at farms consistently operate for a long time and
    have limited battery life. A suitable energy saving scheme is necessary because,
    in case of any failure, instant battery replacement is complicated, especially
    in open-air farms where devices are strategically placed with minimum access [210].
    The possible solutions to optimize energy consumption are usage of low power sensors
    and, proper management of communication [24,212]. Wireless power transfer and
    self-supporting wireless system are other promising solutions to eliminate the
    need for battery replacement by recharging the batteries through electromagnetic
    waves. However, long-distance wireless charging is needed in most agricultural
    applications [9]. Ambient energy harvesting from rivers, fluid flow, movement
    of vehicles and, ground surface using sensor nodes offers another viable solution,
    but the converted electrical energy is limited at present – posing the need to
    improve power conversion efficiency [213]. • Reliability: The reliability of devices,
    as well as corresponding software applications, is crucial. This is because IoT
    devices need to gather and transfer the data based on which decisions are made
    using several software packages. Unreliable sensing, processing, and transmission
    can cause false monitoring data reports, long delays, and even data loss – eventually
    impacting the performance of agricultural system [25]. • Adaptability: agricultural
    environments are complex, dynamic, and rapidly changing. Hence, when designing
    a system, it is pertinent for the devices and applications to proactively adapt
    with the other entities under uncertain and dynamic factors - offering the needed
    performance [214]. • Robust wirelessarchitectures: wireless networks and communication
    technologies offer several benefits in terms of low cost, wide-area coverage,
    adequate networking flexibility, and high scalability. But dynamic agriculture
    environments such as temperature variations, living objects’ movements, and the
    presence of obstacles pose severe challenges to reliable wireless communication.
    For instance, fluctuations in the signal intensity occur due to the multipath
    propagation effects – causing unstable connectivity and inadequate data transmission
    [215]. These factors impact the performance of the agricultural system. Hence,
    there is a need for robust and fault-tolerant wireless architectures with appropriate
    location of sensor nodes, antenna height, network topology, and communication
    protocols that also require minimum maintenance [11]. • Interference: another
    challenge is wireless interference and degradation of the quality of service because
    of the dense deployment of IoT devices and wireless sensor networks. These issues
    can be mitigated with efficient channel scheduling between heterogeneous sensing
    devices, cognitive radio-assisted WSNs, and emerging networking primitives such
    as concurrent transmission [216]. Since agriculture devices are distributed at
    indoor greenhouses, outdoor farmlands, underground areas, or even water areas,
    cross-media communication between underground, underwater, and air is also required
    for the complete incorporation of smart technologies [217]. • Security and privacy:
    the distributed nature of smart agricultural systems brings potential vulnerabilities
    to cyber-attacks such as eavesdropping, data integrity, denial-of-service attacks,
    or other types of disruptions that may risk privacy, integrity, and availability
    of the system [218]. Cyber-security is a major challenge that needs to be addressed
    within the context of smart farming, with diverse privacy-preserving mechanisms
    and federated learning approaches [130]. • Compatibility: to achieve the standards
    of fragmentation and scalability, the models or software applications developed
    should be flexible and run on any machine installed in the agricultural system
    [13]. • Resource optimization: farmers require a resource optimization process
    to estimate the optimal number of IoT devices and gateways, cloud storage size,
    and amount of transmitted data to improve farm profitability. Since farms have
    different sizes and need distinct types of sensors to measure different variables,
    resource optimization is challenging [219]. Secondly, most of the farm management
    systems do not offer run-time customization in relation to the distinct requirements
    of farmers. Hence, complex mathematical models and algorithms are required to
    estimate adequate resource allocation [75]. • Scalability: the number of devices,
    machinery, and sensors installed at farms is increasing gradually due to advancements
    in technologies. To support these entities, gateways, network applications, and
    back-end databases should be reliable and scalable [220]. • Human-centereduserinterfaces:
    complex user interfaces of existing agricultural applications and devices are
    impeding smart farming practices. Most GUI is designed in a way that only experts
    can use to perform agricultural tasks. Improving the user interface by making
    it human-centered with multimodal feedback will allow a larger group of people
    to use it to perform different agricultural operations [96]. 4.13. Socio-economic
    roadblocks • Gap between farmers and researchers: the participation of farmers
    is a key factor toward the success of the digitization of the agricultural industry.
    Farmers face a lot of problems during the agri-food production process, which
    smart technologies could fix, but agricultural experts are not usually aware of
    these issues [16]. Moreover, to devise an adequate smart solution, first, it is
    important to fully understand the nature of problems. Hence, it is essential to
    bridge the gap between farmers, agricultural professionals, and AI researchers.
    • Costs associated with smart systems: the costs associated with the adoption
    of smart technologies and systems are the major deterrent in the digitization
    of the agricultural sector. These costs usually involve deployment, operating,
    and maintenance costs. The deployment costs of smart systems are usually very
    high as they involve; i) hardware installation such as autonomous robots and drones,
    WSNs, gateways, and base station infrastructure, etc., to perform certain farm
    operations, and ii) hiring the skilled labour [221]. Likewise, to facilitate data
    processing, management of IoT devices and equipment, and knowledge exchange, subscription
    of centralized networks and software packages is required, which ultimately increases
    the operating costs [222]. Though sometimes service providers offer free subscription
    packages with restricted features, the amount of storage capacity is limited.
    To ensure the adequate operations of the smart system, occasional maintenance
    is required, which then also adds up to total costs. Other types of costs associated
    with smart systems deployment could be environmental, ethical, and social costs.
    To overcome cost related roadblocks, initiatives focusing on cooperative farming
    are needed that provide; i) support services for better handling of costs and
    needed investments, and ii) hardware solutions to transform conventional equipment
    into smart farm-ready machinery to reduce high initial costs [222]. • Digital
    division: another factor that is slowing the digitization of the agricultural
    sector is the lack of knowledge of digital technologies and their applications.
    The majority of farmers have no idea about the significance of digital technologies,
    how to implement and use them, and which technology is suitable for their farm
    and meets their requirements [14]. Hence, it is essential to educate farmers about
    modern farming technologies and systems. Moreover, different strategies are needed
    to build tools using natural language that farmers with low education levels can
    easily understand [223]. • Return on investment: in agriculture, the profit margin
    is very important like other sectors. When it comes to the implementation of advanced
    technologies, farmers have concerns related to the time to recover the investment
    and to the difficulties in evaluating the advantages [12]. • Trust building: unlike
    in other disciplines, building trust regarding the effectiveness of smart technologies
    in agriculture is difficult because many decisions affect systems that involve
    living and non-living entities, and consequences can be hard to reverse [16].
    Additionally, insufficient proof of the impact of digital tools on-farm productivity
    further intensifies the current challenges. • Laws and regulations: different
    regions and countries have different legal frameworks which impact the implementation
    of digital technologies in the agriculture sector, particularly in monitoring
    and agri-food supply [70]. Likewise, regulations related to resource allocation
    (spectrum for wireless devices), data privacy, and security also vary from one
    country to another [70]. • Connectivity infrastructure: most less-developed countries
    usually have insufficient connectivity infrastructure that limits access to advanced
    digital tools that would help to turn data from heterogenous sources into valuable
    and actionable insights [10]. 4.14. Discussion This section discusses the main
    conclusions of RQ1, RQ2, and RQ3. In addition, added value, considerations, and
    future directions are also presented to ensure higher accuracy and great advancements
    in agricultural industry. 4.15. RQ1, RQ2 and RQ3 The present study tried to articulate
    the emerging digital technologies being implemented in agricultural industry to
    anticipate the future trajectories of agriculture 4.0. By looking at Table 2,
    Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7, Table 8, Table 9, Table 10, Table
    11, Table 12, Table 13 in section 4, it can be seen some technologies such as
    big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and
    digital twins are not significantly explored in agriculture. A reason for this
    gap could be that implementing advanced technologies with more complex operations
    can be expensive, at least in the early experimental phase of their adoption.
    Hence, the development of these technologies in agricultural industry should increase
    in the coming years. The results of SLR also show that IoT is significantly implemented
    in farms. This is due to the broad functionality of IoT such as in the monitoring,
    tracking and tracing, agriculture machinery, and precision agriculture [21]. It
    can be said that IoT is one of the main research objectives within the agriculture
    4.0 approaches. Nevertheless, only few studies have considered data security and
    reliability, scalability, and interoperability while developing an intelligent
    agricultural system. The research findings also demonstrated that most use cases
    are still in the prototype phase. The possible reason could be because most agricultural
    operations have to do with living subjects, like animals and plants or perishable
    products, and developing systems is harder than non-living human-made systems.
    Another reason might be that agriculture is a slow adopter of technology because
    of transdisciplinary nature of this field, and hence to develop intelligent systems,
    the agricultural community must become familiar will all the digital technologies.
    Lastly, variations in plant/crops’ species, and growth conditions also make digitization
    of agricultural systems complex [188]. The SLR findings also show that most of
    the systems are developed for open-air soil-based farms contrary to indoor farms
    (soilless and soil-based). This is due to complex design and management of indoor
    farms particularly soilless farms where parameters and factors (pH, air temperature,
    humidity, etc.) to be controlled are diverse [5]. But with introduction of digital
    technologies and data-driven computer applications in indoor farms, a more robust
    control of the process can be achieved. Furthermore, it is also revealed from
    SLR that limited research is conducted in three (soil management, fruit detection
    and counting and crop quality management) out of nine different service categories
    mentioned in section 3. This corroborates that substantial research and development
    is needed in some areas to ensure successful digitization of agriculture industry
    in developed countries as well as in developing countries. The complexity of agriculture
    ecosystem presents a series of interconnected roadblocks that hinder the full
    integration of digital technologies for agriculture 4.0 realization. Hence, it
    is essential to identify potential roadblocks in order to come up with strategic
    solutions to overcome them. This study is an attempt to explore what these roadblocks
    are. Based on analysis, 21 roadblocks were identified and classified at technical
    and socio-economic levels. These roadblocks are listed in section 5, which suggests
    what needs to be done for digitization of agricultural industry on larger scale.
    But it is still not known, to what extent elimination or mitigation of these roadblocks
    assist in successful integration of digital technologies. 4.16. Added value of
    agricultural digitization Based on analysis, several benefits that can motivate
    framers and other actors to support digitization of agricultural industry are
    identified and summarised below. The presented benefits have potential to maximise
    the farm''s productivity and enhance product quality, but they should not be considered
    a panacea for challenges associated with smart agriculture [222]. • Improved agility:
    digital technologies improve the agility of farm operations. Through real-time
    surveillance and forecast systems, farmers or agricultural experts can rapidly
    react to any potential fluctuations in environmental and water conditions to save
    crops [221]. • Green process: digital technologies make the farming process more
    environmentally friendly and climate-resilient by significantly reducing the usage
    of in-field fuel, nitrogen fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides [224]. • Resource
    use efficiency: digital platforms can improve resource use efficiency by enhancing
    the quantity and quality of agricultural output and limiting the usage of water,
    energy, fertilizers, and pesticides [3]. • Time and cost savings: digital technologies
    enable significant time and cost savings by automating different operations, such
    as harvesting, sowing, or irrigation, controlling the application of fertilizers
    or pesticides, and scheduling the irrigation [225]. • Asset management: digital
    technologies allow real-time surveillance of farm properties and equipment to
    prevent theft, expedite component replacement and perform routine maintenance
    [10]. • Product safety: digital technologies ensure adequate farm productivity
    and guarantee a safe and nutritious supply of agri-food products by preventing
    fraud related to adulteration, counterfeit, and artificial enhancement [218].
    4.17. Considerations and future prospects The upcoming initiatives would result
    in significant improvements in the agricultural sector. But in order to make things
    sustainable for small and medium-scale growers, roadblocks mentioned in section
    5 need to be addressed first. Awareness campaigns highlighting the significance
    of smart agriculture at every level of the agricultural value chain and promoting
    innovative ways (such as gamification) to encourage stakeholders to take on an
    active role in the digital revolution can mitigate some of the mentioned roadblocks
    [9]. Government level initiatives, grants and endowments, public-private partnerships,
    the openness of data, and regional basis research work can also assist in coping
    with potential roadblocks. Lastly, a roadmap can be adopted while developing a
    smart agriculture system, starting from basic architecture with few components
    and simpler functionality, gradually adding components and functionality to develop
    a complex system with the full potential of digitization [21]. These considerations
    can pave the way for successful implementation of agriculture 4.0. The future
    prospects of digital technologies in smart agriculture involve using explainable
    artificial intelligence to monitor crop growth, estimate crop biomass, evaluate
    crop health, and control pests and diseases. Explainable AI fades away the traditional
    black-box concept of machine learning and enables understanding the reasons behind
    any specific decision [15]. Description of big data through common semantics and
    ontologies and the adoption of open standards have great potential to boost research
    and development towards smart farming . Similarly, to ensure enhanced connectivity
    and live streaming of crop data, 5G technology need to be extensively explored
    [6]. 5G technology will minimize internet costs and augment the overall user experience
    of farm management and food safety by performing accurate crop inspections remotely
    [226]. Furthermore, it will significantly bridge the gap between stakeholders
    by keeping them well informed on produce availability. Lastly, blockchain in combination
    with IoT and other technologies can be implemented to address the challenges related
    to data privacy and security [227]. 4.18. Transition to Agriculture 5.0 The industrial
    revolutions have always brought a breakthrough in the agricultural sector. As
    formally discussed in previous sections, agriculture 4.0 has great potential to
    counterbalance the growing food demands and prepare for future by reinforcing
    agricultural systems with WSN, IoT, AI, etc. While the realization of agriculture
    4.0 is still underway, there is already a talk about agriculture 5.0. Agriculture
    5.0 extends agriculture 4.0 with inclusion of industry 5.0 principles to produce
    healthy and affordable food while ensuring to prevent degradation of the ecosystems
    on which life depends [228]. The European Commission formally called for the Fifth
    Industrial Revolution (industry 5.0) in 2021 after observing that industry 4.0
    focuses less on the original principles of social fairness and sustainability
    but more on digitalization and AI-driven technologies for increasing the efficiency
    and flexibility [229]. Industry 5.0 complements and extends industry 4.0 concept
    to recognize the human-centricity, sustainability, and resilience [230]. It involves
    refining the collaborative interactions between humans and machines, reducing
    environmental impact through circular economy, and developing high degree of robustness
    in systems to achieve optimal balance between efficiency and productivity. The
    enabling technologies of industry 5.0 are Cobots (collaborative robots), smart
    materials with embedded bio-inspired sensors, digital twins, AI, energy efficient
    and secure data management, renewable energy sources, etc [229].. In agriculture
    5.0 settings, farm''s production efficiency and crop quality can be enhanced by
    assigning repetitive and monotonous tasks to the machines and the tasks which
    need critical thinking to the humans. For this purpose, similar to manufacturing
    sector cyber physical cognitive systems (CPCS) that observe/study the environment
    and take actions accordingly should be developed for agricultural sector. This
    may include collaborative farm robots which will work in the fields and assist
    crop producers in tedious tasks such as seed sowing and harvesting etc. Likewise,
    digital twins in agriculture 5.0 can also offer significant value by identifying
    technical issues in agricultural systems and overcoming them at a faster speed,
    detecting crop diseases, and making crop yield predictions at a higher accuracy
    rate. This shows that agriculture 5.0 has potential to pave a way for climate
    smart, sustainable and resilient agriculture but as of now, it is in the developing
    phase. 5. Conclusions Increased concerns about global food security have accelerated
    the need for next-generation industrial farms and intensive production methods
    in agriculture. At the forefront of this modern agricultural era, digital technologies
    offered by Industry 4.0 initiative are suggesting a myriad of creative solutions.
    The scientific community and researchers integrate disruptive technologies in
    conventional agriculture systems to increase crop yields, minimize costs, reduce
    wastes, and maintain process inputs. An SLR discussing the prevailing state of
    these technologies in the agriculture sector is presented in this study. After
    applying SLR protocol, 148 articles were considered from the time frame of the
    year 2011 to 2021. Various research questions pertaining to i) current and continuing
    research trends, ii) functionality, maturity level, farm type and tools and techniques
    used, iii) primary roadblocks, and iv) added value of digital technologies; were
    put forward and answered. Several conclusions are drawn such as integration of
    big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and
    digital twins in agriculture is only in its infancy, and most use cases are in
    the prototype phase. Likewise, 21 roadblocks are identified and classified at
    technical and socioeconomic levels. To ensure the digitization of agricultural
    industry, these roadblocks must be analyzed and overcome. The added value of digital
    technologies in agriculture industry are also identified and presented in the
    study. Overall, this study contributes to the research being carried around agriculture
    4.0. The primary limitation of this review is twofold: firstly, only three online
    repositories are considered for literature search (Scopus, IEEE and Science Direct),
    and secondly additional keywords and synonyms might return more studies. In both
    scenarios, it is highly unlikely that the overall findings would change. For the
    future work, additional research databases and aspects can be considered to provide
    holistic overview of agricultural industry in terms of digitization. Moreover,
    studies targeting agriculture 5.0 in general will also be included. Declaration

    \ rights and content Highlights • Review of neurocomputing methods in surface\
    \ water hydrology and hydraulic sciences. • Detailed analysis on six relevant\
    \ topics in surface water hydrology and hydraulics. • Past and current research\
    \ trends, main findings, and gaps for future exploration. • Problem-specific guidelines\
    \ and recommendations for future development. Abstract Neurocomputing methods\
    \ have contributed significantly to the advancement of modelling techniques in\
    \ surface water hydrology and hydraulics in the last couple of decades, primarily\
    \ due to their vast performance advantages and usage amenity. This comprehensive\
    \ review considers the research progress in the past two decades, the current\
    \ state-of-the-art, and future prospects of the application of neurocomputing\
    \ to different aspects of hydrological sciences, i.e., quantitative surface hydrology\
    \ and hydraulics. An extensive literature survey, by running over more than 800\
    \ peer-reviewed papers, outlines and concisely explores the past and recent tendencies\
    \ in the application of conventional neural-based approaches and modern neurocomputing\
    \ models in relevant topics of hydrological and hydraulic sciences. Apart from\
    \ segregated descriptions and analyses of the main facets of surface hydrology\
    \ and hydraulics, this review offers a practical summary of prevailing neurocomputing\
    \ methods used in different subfields of hydrology and water engineering. Six\
    \ relevant topics to modelling hydrological and hydraulic sciences are articulated\
    \ and analysed, including modelling of water level in surface water bodies, flood\
    \ and risk assessment, sediment transport in river systems, urban water demand\
    \ prediction, modelling flow through hydro-structures, and hydraulics of sewers.\
    \ This review is meant to be a mainstream guideline for researchers and practitioners\
    \ whose work is associated with data mining and machine learning methods in various\
    \ areas of water engineering and hydrological sciences to assist them to decide\

    \ Topics associated with hydrological sciences broadly include two primary disciplines:\
    \ hydrology and hydraulics, covering subjects which range, for instance, from\
    \ hydrological forecasts and hydraulic modelling to water resources management\
    \ and risk analyses. Soft computing and machine learning (ML), or neurocomputing\
    \ in short, have been widely applied to a wide range of scientific and technological\
    \ aspects in hydrological and hydraulic sciences. In this context, neurocomputing\
    \ serves as a cross-cutting discipline to address modelling and solve complex\
    \ and sophisticated problems that involve technical and societal aspects, data\
    \ science, computer science, information and communication technologies (Makropoulos\
    \ and Savić, 2019). Hydrological sciences tools enable the emulation of various\
    \ natural processes of the water cycle with mathematical models, mainly classified\
    \ into three categories: black-box models, conceptual models, and physically based\
    \ models. While conceptual and physically based models, such as the HBV model\
    \ (Bergström and Jönsson, 1976), SWIM (Krysanova et al., 2000), and TELEMAC-MASCARET\
    \ model (Hervouet and Pham, 2007) are based on many physical and topographical\
    \ parameters and sometimes require expensive computational efforts, black-box\
    \ models, e.g., neurocomputing models, can infer the underlying functional relationships\
    \ between the historical data and the resulting sought variables, without any\
    \ priori physical background. The neurocomputing methods, including methods based\
    \ on machine learning, have been increasingly used in the water management field\
    \ in the last decades, demonstrating their great potential and raising increasing\
    \ interest in the hydrological sciences research community (Chen et al., 2018a,\
    \ Chen et al., 2018b, Zounemat-Kermani et al., 2020a). Over the last two decades,\
    \ machine learning methods have achieved a high level of success and have become\
    \ a reliable alternative to the conventional mathematical and hard computing methods\
    \ in numerous areas of application, such as robotics and image recognition (Stone\
    \ and Veloso, 2000, Man et al., 2013). Given their computational efficiency and\
    \ flexibility, these approaches have also been intensively applied to address\
    \ various challenges related to hydrological sciences. 1.2. Theory and methods\
    \ Neurocomputing and related neural-based models, e.g., Artificial Neural Networks\
    \ (ANNs), are the fundamental and principal soft computing methods and inseparable\
    \ elements of ML models, capable of learning from different types of datasets.\
    \ The theoretical and technical aspects of various types of neurocomputing models\
    \ have already been introduced in detail in the literature (e.g., Task, 2000,\
    \ Ham and Kostanic, 2000, Govindaraju and Rao, 2000, Jain and Kumar, 2007; Ding\
    \ et al., 2013; Amezquita-Sanchez et al., 2016, Van Gerven and Bohte, 2017, and\
    \ references therein). In brief, neurocomputing models are interconnected networks\
    \ composed of different layers (input layer, hidden layer(s), and output layer),\
    \ each of which consists of several processors called artificial neurons (Fig.\
    \ 1). In general, neurons in each layer are connected to the neurons of the previous\
    \ and next layers, so that they transmit information. Each neuron receives input\
    \ signals from the other ones (through synaptic weights and biases), then processes\
    \ them with predetermined functions (activation functions), and finally sends\
    \ the processed information as output to the connected neurons in the next layer.\
    \ The activation or transfer functions convert the input signals to the output\
    \ responses. Most of the conventional ANNs implement the basic impression of using\
    \ artificial neurons and their connections through layers. Yet, other mathematical\
    \ and statistical tools, such as fuzzy logic and wavelet transforms, can be also\
    \ embedded to create combined neurocomputing models (sometimes they are referred\
    \ to as hybrid neural networks), e.g., Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)\
    \ and Wavelet Neural Network (WaveNet) (Keshtegar et al., 2018, Bakshi and Stephanopoulos,\
    \ 1993). In most of the neurocomputing networks, the transition of the data is\
    \ realised through forward transmission (feedforward) from the antecedent layers\
    \ to the subsequent layers, such as the Multi-Layer Perceptron neural network\
    \ (MLP) or the Group Method of Data Handling Network (GMDH. In other types of\
    \ neurocomputing models, information can be returned to the preceding layers in\
    \ a loop mechanism so that they can be stored and use new information during the\
    \ processing procedure, e.g., recurrent neural networks (Fig. 1a). Fig. 1b depicts\

    \ The training process of neurocomputing model is accomplished by adjusting the\
    \ network parameters, such as synaptic weights and biases, of connections between\
    \ the artificial neurons in the layers usually based upon a back-propagation process.\
    \ Various mathematical (e.g., Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm) and heuristic (e.g.,\
    \ particle swarm optimization algorithm) techniques might be utilized for training\
    \ the networks. Regardless of their nature, these training algorithms are designed\
    \ to adjust the weights and biases in a way to minimise the network's predicting\
    \ error (Barnard, 1992, Ilonen et al., 2003). Neurocomputing models are now known\
    \ as the most popular and common ML models in simulating and predicting hydrological\
    \ and hydraulic phenomena (Mosavi et al., 2018). Fig. 2 presents and classifies\
    \ the most common types of neurocomputing models used in hydrological and hydraulic\
    \ sciences in three main categories including (i) their general structure and\
    \ architecture (i.e. a feedforward structure or a recurrent structure), (ii) the\
    \ learning methodology, such as the ensemble learning or the individual (stand-alone)\
    \ learning, and (iii) the nature of the training procedure. Detailed information\

    \ 1.3. Rationale, research motivation, and framework Despite the increasing usage\
    \ of neurocomputing in hydrological and hydraulic sciences, to the authors' best\
    \ knowledge, a comprehensive review of the most recent applications of neurocomputing\
    \ models in the relevant topics is still missing. This paper reviews peer-reviewed\
    \ articles published over the last two decades (2000–2019), presenting the applications\
    \ of neurocomputing models in quantitative surface water hydrological and hydraulic\
    \ sciences. But it is worth noting that the current review does not include the\
    \ use and application of neurocomputing in the field of surface water quality\
    \ (Anmala et al., 2015, Anmala and Venkateshwarlu, 2019). The focus of this work\
    \ is twofold: • First, this study presents a comprehensive, inclusive, and general\
    \ review of the application of neurocomputing in various fields of surface hydrology,\
    \ hydraulics, and water engineering sciences (see Section 2). • Second, the current\
    \ study aims to analyse and categorise the state-of-the-art of different neurocomputing\
    \ models in six main fields of quantitative hydrological and hydraulic sciences\
    \ categorized in two facets: i) surface hydrology, and ii) hydraulics in civil\
    \ and water engineering (see Section 3). We expect this work to contribute to\
    \ problem-specific guidelines and recommendations for future usage of neurocomputing\
    \ models for addressing water-related modelling challenges (see Sections 4–6).\
    \ The remainder of this review is organized as follows. In section 2, we present\
    \ the methods adopted to build and organize this literature review and list the\
    \ specific fields of applications that we investigate to reveal the recent advances\
    \ of neurocomputing models in hydrological and hydraulic sciences. The current\
    \ status quo, research challenges, and specific directions associated with neurocomputing\
    \ applications in each of the above fields are discussed in section 3. We make\
    \ final remarks in section 4. Finally, in sections 5 and 6, research gaps, recommendations\
    \ and directions for the future researches are provided. 2. General overview and\
    \ the review methods The application of neurocomputing models in hydrology and\
    \ hydraulics has received considerable attention during the last decades, and\
    \ it is still an expanding field of research. Within the scope of this review,\
    \ scientific peer-reviewed articles were retrieved by searching on Scopus (https://www.scopus.com/home.uri)\
    \ for the combinations of the following keywords: • Keywords related to the neurocomputing\
    \ part: Neural Network/ Neural/ Neuro-/ Neural-Based/ Neurocomputing/ ELM/ NARX/\
    \ GMDH/ ANFIS/ WaveNet/ LSTM/ DBNN/ DeepESN/ GRU/ ESN/ ENN/ RNN/ CNN; • Keywords\
    \ related to the surface hydrology part: Water level/ flow discharge/ hydrology\
    \ / flow rate/ river flow/ streamflow/ open channel flow/ compound channel/ suspended\
    \ sediment/ sediment yield/ bedload/ sediment transport/ rainfall-runoff/ flood;\
    \ • Keywords related to the hydraulics part: urban water/ water demand/ hydraulic/\
    \ hydro-structure/ dam/ spillway/ outlet works/ waterworks/ weir/ sewer/ water\
    \ treatment plant/ wastewater/ overflow/ conduit/ intake/ stilling basin/ chute.\
    \ Moreover, we distinguish between two neurocomputing categories in this paper:\
    \ • Conventional neurocomputing models include the feedforward, standard, and\
    \ stand-alone versions of neurocomputing models, such as MLPNNs, GRNNs, etc. (see\
    \ Fig. 2); • Modern neurocomputing models include more advanced model techniques\
    \ such as integrative, recurrent, and deep learning networks as well as other\
    \ complementary types of neurocomputing models. Overall, the publication rate\
    \ of papers in hydrological modelling using the conventional neurocomputing models\
    \ has not been significantly increasing during the last two decades, with an average\
    \ of 11 papers published per year (from 2000 to 2019). Conversely, there has been\
    \ a noticeable increasing trend in the number of studies using modern neurocomputing\
    \ models in different subjects related to surface hydrology since 2000 (15 papers\
    \ per year, on average between 2000 and 2019, with 32 papers published in 2018\
    \ alone). Similar to the surface hydrology facet, there has been increasing attention\
    \ in employing modern neurocomputing models in hydraulic sciences. Due to the\
    \ existence of a large number of reported applications of neurocomputing models\
    \ to the vast areas of hydrological and hydraulic sciences (more than 800 papers\
    \ since the year 2000), we summarize in this section the content of those published\
    \ as Review Articles. Overview of these Review Articles and their major remarks\
    \ are summarized in Table 1. This section is primarily designed to provide readers\
    \ with an overall insight regarding the past and present status of neurocomputing\
    \ applications in hydrological and hydraulic sciences as a general perspective.\
    \ A more detailed discussion of different specific fields will be given in the\
    \ next section. Table 1. An overview of the application of neurocomputing models\

    \ This paper presents a comprehensive review of Extreme Learning Machine models\
    \ and their application in river flow forecasting. According to the review articles\
    \ as summarised in Table 1 for existing research in using neurocomputing in hydrological\
    \ and hydraulic sciences, it is apparent that the majority of the neurocomputing\
    \ models have been developed and applied to surface water hydrology problems,\
    \ in particular, river flow modelling. In conclusion, considering the state-of-the-art\
    \ of neurocomputing applications in hydrological and hydraulic sciences, it emerges\
    \ that there has been a tremendous interest in using modern types of neurocomputing\
    \ models rather than the traditional versions. Fig. 3 depicts the general trends\
    \ of using neurocomputing models in hydrological and hydraulic sciences. As can\
    \ be seen in Fig. 3, four separate chronological stages might be recognized in\
    \ terms of the number of published papers during the last two decades (2000–2019).\
    \ Based on past trends, we might expect the commencement of a new stage of using\
    \ neurocomputing in hydrological and hydraulic sciences roughly in a five-year\
    \ period. The main reason for this may be related to the emerging of new neurocomputing\
    \ technologies and their applications in a period of five years. Download : Download\

    \ of neurocomputing in hydrology and hydraulics Surface water hydrology and hydraulics\
    \ includes a vast variety of subjects related to water engineering, water resources\
    \ management, hydrology, hydrogeology, hydrometeorology, hydraulics, sanitary\
    \ engineering, and river engineering. In this review, the focus is laid on six\
    \ different aspects of hydrosciences, i.e., three hydrological topics, and three\
    \ hydraulic topics. The three topics in surface hydrology are: • Topic 1: Prediction\
    \ of water level in surface water bodies • Topic 2: Flood modelling, mapping,\
    \ and risk assessment • Topic 3: Modelling sediment transport in river systems\
    \ The following three topics are associated with the hydraulic facet of the current\
    \ study: • Topic 4: Urban water demand prediction • Topic 5: Modelling flows through\
    \ hydraulic structures • Topic 6: Flow and sediment modelling in sewers Each topic\
    \ is reviewed and discussed in the following subsections. 3.1. Topic 1: Prediction\
    \ of water level in surface water bodies The hydrodynamics in surface water bodies,\
    \ for instance, free-surface wetlands, lakes, reservoirs, rivers, and oceans,\
    \ are governed by nonlinear processes and often predicted through numerical simulations\
    \ using deterministic models. Large sets of physical and topographical data and\
    \ complex hydrological conditions are needed to set up such models, besides the\
    \ high computational time. The neurocomputing approaches have been emergently\
    \ used by many researchers for predicting water level and hydrodynamics in surface\
    \ water bodies because of their capability to detect the nonlinear relationships\
    \ existing in historical data series of water level and discharge in a catchment,\
    \ and their much cheaper computational cost. Complex natural and anthropogenic\
    \ processes are continued to create impacts on the surface water bodies on Earth;\
    \ information about water levels is important for understanding the impacts and\
    \ informing decision-making for many aspects of engineering interventions and\
    \ management. First, prediction of water level is crucial for optimizing water\
    \ resources management and, thus, planning multiple water uses such as hydropower\
    \ plants (HPP), irrigation agriculture and water supply (e.g., Chang and Chang,\
    \ 2006), as well as to assess flood risk and develop flood control/mitigation\
    \ strategies (e.g., Chang et al., 2014a, Chang et al., 2014b, Yu et al., 2006).\
    \ Furthermore, water level predictions are required for river and ocean navigation\
    \ (Hou et al., 2014, Ma et al., 2019) – especially concerning cargo capacity calculations,\
    \ journey duration, planning of arrival times at ports and harbours – and for\
    \ designing hydraulic structures (offshore, dams, weirs). Extensive research has\
    \ been also conducted to monitor and understand the effects of climate, evaporation,\
    \ and HPP on water level fluctuations, and to assess their various impacts on\
    \ sediments, water quality parameters and related processes, such as sediment\
    \ drying (e.g., Keitel et al., 2015) and transport of nutrients (e.g., Matta et\
    \ al., 2018). While recognising the importance in measuring/predicting water level\
    \ fluctuations, this acquisition of information must be achieved with a suitable\
    \ lead time for various applications. For example, for flood control operations\
    \ and peak mitigation, the interest lies in the short-term forecast (i.e., minutes,\
    \ hours); while for navigation planning or for water quality assessments, it is\
    \ more relevant to the mid-term or long-term forecast (i.e., days or even months).\
    \ As an example of the early studies, See and Openshaw (2000) applied different\
    \ soft computing approaches and developed a complex hybrid system for river level\
    \ forecasting. The dataset was taken from the River Ouse in northern England,\
    \ choosing a prediction horizon of 6 h. Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) was used as\
    \ a pre-classifier to develop individual MLPs, which have been linked using a\
    \ fuzzy logic model and genetic algorithm optimization (GA). While the hybrid\
    \ system demonstrated its suitability for flood forecasting and high-water level\
    \ detection, the fuzzy model was still not able to reproduce the lower levels\
    \ and, thus, required further experimentation. Coulibaly (2010) explored to use\
    \ of the Reservoir Computing method, namely Echo State Network (ESN), to predict\
    \ monthly averaged water levels for up to 10 months ahead in four Great Lakes\
    \ in the USA. The author compared the results with other two approaches (the Bayesian\
    \ Neural Network, BNN, and the classical Recurrent Neural Network, RNN) and found\
    \ out that the ESN performed well for up to 6 months ahead while the RNN gave\
    \ better results than the ESN for longer lead times (8–12 months ahead). On the\
    \ other hand, ESN could be further improved by including additional factors such\
    \ as evaporation and precipitation. It was also less computationally demanding\
    \ and demonstrated higher usage efficiency. Panda et al. (2010) compared a physically-based\
    \ hydrodynamic model, i.e., MIKE 11HD, and a Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN)\
    \ trained with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to predict water levels in the\
    \ River branch Kushabhadra, Bay of Bengal, India. The previous five-time lags\
    \ of the hourly water level data at the upstream gauges were used as input to\
    \ determine the downstream gauge level at the current time. FFNN showed superior\
    \ performance, and the time to peak and the peak values were much closer to the\
    \ measurements than those predicted by the computationally more expensive MIKE\
    \ 11HD model. Chang et al., 2014a, Chang et al., 2014b compared one static and\
    \ two dynamic RNN type of models for water level prediction in flood control and\
    \ mitigation in urban areas. Respectively, they set up a FFNN, an Elman Neural\
    \ Network (ENN), and a Nonlinear Autoregressive Exogenous (NARX) neural network\
    \ model to predict in the short-term (10–60 min) the multi-step-ahead water levels\
    \ in a floodwater storage pond (FSP) in the Yu-Cheng Pumping Station located in\
    \ Taipei City, Taiwan. Their results demonstrated that the FFNN, depending only\
    \ on ‘static’ observed data, was inferior to the ENN and the NARX, which incorporated\
    \ the observed data with time delay units through recursive inner connections\
    \ from the hidden layer or from the output layer, respectively. Nevertheless,\
    \ better performance was achieved by the NARX under the scenario of including\
    \ not only the rainfall data of the neighbouring gauges as inputs, but also the\
    \ current FSP water level. The study presented in Ma et al. (2019) investigated\
    \ the capability of FFNN and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) in predicting water\
    \ levels at critical gauges of the Rhine River Basin (Germany), in order to support\
    \ inland navigation logistics planning. The basic idea was to predict hourly and\
    \ daily water levels at a specific gauge for up to 10 days ahead, only considering\
    \ the historical data measurements at the same gauge and the upstream gauges.\
    \ The LSTM model outperformed the FFNN on the longer term predictions (from 2\
    \ up to 10 days), and the greatest improvement was obtained when the hydrological\
    \ model chain hindcasts of the German Federal Institute of Hydrology (BfG) from\
    \ 2008 until 2015 were included as an additional predictor to the inputs. Table\
    \ 2 summarizes the researches related to the water level prediction using neurocomputing\
    \ models. Table 2. Summary of the reviewed studies in applying various types of\
    \ neurocomputing models for predicting water level in surface water bodies. Author(s)/Year\
    \ Model Motivation Remarks See & Openshaw, 2000 MLP, SOM, NF Hourly river level\
    \ predictions up to 6 h ahead in the Ouse River, northern England A hybrid forecasting\
    \ system was developed for potential flood forecasting and warning systems, using\
    \ a SOM prior to training and a fuzzy logic model integrated with a standard MLP\
    \ based on current river levels and their changes. The system better predicted\
    \ the high water levels than the lower water levels. Makarynskyy et al., 2004\
    \ FFNN Hourly prediction of sea-level variations up to 24 h ahead, and forecast\
    \ of half-daily, daily, 5-daily and 10-daily mean sea levels (three steps ahead)\
    \ Saliency analysis was adopted as an optimization method to find the best network\
    \ architecture. The forecasts of the third time step ahead were less accurate\
    \ compared to the previous steps. Khan & Coulibaly, 2006 MLP, SVM Averaged monthly\
    \ water level predictions up to 12 months ahead in Lake Erie, USA SVM could be\
    \ more advantageous than MLP, due to its higher generalization capacity and smaller\
    \ number of free parameters used, but the training of a large dataset was computationally\
    \ more expensive. Coulibaly, 2010 BNN, ESN, RNN Averaged monthly water level predictions\
    \ up to 10 months ahead of the Great Lakes, USA ESN outperformed the BNN and RNN\
    \ benchmark models and was demonstrated to be computationally more efficient.\
    \ ESN could be further improved by including additional independent input variables.\
    \ Panda et al., 2010 FFNN Hourly water level predictions in the River branch Kushabhadra,\
    \ Bay of Bengal, India The authors compared the physically based hydrodynamic\
    \ model MIKE 11HD and a FFNN, where FFNN outperformed MIKE11HD in predicting the\
    \ flood peaks. Chang et al., 2014a, Chang et al., 2014b ENN, FFNN, NARX Real-time\
    \ water levels in the floodwater storage pond (FSP) of a sewer-pumping system\
    \ in Taipei City, Taiwan Three different ANN types (static and dynamic) were compared\
    \ to predict short-term (10–60 min) FSP water levels for urban flood control.\
    \ The NARX model (dynamic) outperformed the others. Seo & Kim, 2016 ANN, ANFIS\
    \ Daily river stage of two streamflow gauging stations in South Korea The hybrid\
    \ models (an integration of the Wavelet Packet decomposition and data-driven models,\
    \ WPANN and WPANFIS) might overcome certain issues of ANN and ANFIS when dealing\
    \ with nonstationary data. Ghorbani et al., 2017 MLP Water level predictions on\
    \ a monthly time scale in Lake Egirdir, Turkey Firefly Algorithm (FFA) – i.e.,\
    \ heuristic optimization tool – was integrated with the Multilayer Perceptron\
    \ (MLP-FFA). The further inclusion of a significative hydrometeorological variable\
    \ yielded more accurate predictions. Kaloop et al., 2017 ANFIS, WNN Hourly water\
    \ level change (WLC) predictions for one month at three tide gauges in Canada\
    \ A WLC hourly prediction model for maritime applications based on a short period\
    \ (approx. 2 months) of water level measurements was developed using the ANFIS\
    \ approach, which outperformed the existent WNN models. Sung et al., 2017 FFNN\
    \ Hourly water level predictions up to 3 h ahead in a tributary of the Han River,\
    \ South Korea The predictions were satisfactory only up to 2 h ahead. In general,\
    \ when the water levels at the main river gauging stations were integrated into\
    \ the input data, the model gained higher accuracy. Liang et al., 2018 LSTM, SVM\
    \ Daily water level predictions of Dongting Lake, China Grey Relational Analysis\
    \ (GRA) was adopted to select the input data of the LSTM model, which delivered\
    \ better results than the SVM (benchmark). Ma et al., 2019 FFNN, LSTM Daily water\
    \ levels up to 10 days ahead in the Rhine River Basin, Germany The LSTM model\
    \ showed its capability to predict daily water levels for up to 10 days ahead\
    \ in some critical gauges of the Rhine. Analysing the findings from the reviewed\
    \ papers implies that some novel neurocomputing models such as LSTM and ESN are\
    \ able to overcome the vanishing gradient problem that is typical to RNN (Coulibaly,\
    \ 2010, Liang et al., 2018). Generally, including hydrological records and/or\
    \ using hybrid models (e.g., physically based models in combination with neurocomputing\
    \ approaches and/or optimization methods) can significantly improve water level\
    \ predictions, compared with the conventional neurocomputing models (See and Openshaw,\
    \ 2000, Ma et al., 2019). 3.2. Topic 2: Flood modelling, mapping, and risk assessment\
    \ Flooding is one of the most common natural hazards across the world. According\
    \ to the EM-DAT international disaster database (CRED 2018), flooding is responsible\
    \ for over one-third of global economic loss and two-thirds of the people affected\
    \ by all types of natural hazards. Managing flood risk is, therefore, an important\
    \ task for both relevant governments and non-governmental organisations across\
    \ the globe. Flood prediction and forecasting are essential to facilitate risk\
    \ assessment and increase the preparedness to subsequently mitigate damages from\
    \ flooding. Flood prediction is usually performed using physically based models,\
    \ data-driven approaches, or a combination of the two. A physically based modelling\
    \ approach usually employs a catchment-scale hydrological models to predict rainfall-induced\
    \ runoff, a 1D hydraulic model for flood routing and a 2D hydraulic model to simulate\
    \ inundation. It is a well-established approach that has been widely used, e.g.,\
    \ in the UK Flood Forecasting Centre (Robson et al. 2017). The data-driven approaches,\
    \ which usually require much less computational resources, are suited for real-time\
    \ operational flood forecasting as an alternative to the physically-based models.\
    \ Neurocomputing models are among the most popular methods for data-driven flood\
    \ forecasting, which have traditionally been widely used for predicting runoff\
    \ hydrograph, and a comprehensive review can be found in Mosavi et al. (2018).\
    \ Herein, the application of neurocomputing models in real-time flood forecasting\
    \ is firstly reviewed. Chang et al. (2010) developed a Clustering-based Hybrid\
    \ Inundation Model (CHIM) for forecasting flood inundation depths. In their model,\
    \ the flood inundation information (including locations and depths) simulated\
    \ by HEC-1 and SWMM models were categorised into clusters using a k-means clustering.\
    \ Then FFNN was employed to predict the inundation depth for each cluster. For\
    \ the test case in Central Taiwan, the model was much faster than a physically\
    \ based flood forecasting model and was able to generate a 1-h-ahead flood inundation\
    \ map within a few seconds with the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for peak flood depths\
    \ predicted as small as 0.06 m. Another reported method for flood inundation prediction\
    \ using neurocomputing combined NARX neural network with SOM (Chang et al., 2014a,\
    \ Chang et al., 2014b). Rather than dividing flood inundation information into\
    \ clusters, the hybrid SOM-NARX method firstly used SOM to organise the flood\
    \ inundation maps into a two-dimensional matrix, with each matrix associated with\
    \ a total inundated volume. Subsequently, the inundated volume predicted by NARX\
    \ was used to find the most likely inundation map from the matrix. The hybrid\
    \ SOM-NARX method was shown to outperform the CHIM. Recently, this method was\
    \ further improved by replacing NARX with a Recurrent NARX model (Chang et al.\
    \ 2018). Kia et al. (2012) applied FFNN to predict flow hydrographs from elevation,\
    \ topographic slope, flow accumulation, geology, land use, soil, and rainfall\
    \ data. Then the inundation area was generated based on river cross-sections.\
    \ Although the aforementioned studies are promising, they cannot provide results\
    \ as accurate and as rich in information as a physically based model does. For\
    \ instance, no neurocomputing or even general machine learning-based models have\
    \ been reported to be able to predict flood depths at a high temporal resolution\
    \ (minutes), or flood velocity maps. In the past two decades, neurocomputing models\
    \ have also been used for deriving spatial information for flood prediction and\
    \ risk management, including long-term prediction of flood risk, e.g., flood susceptibility\
    \ mapping. Tien Bui et al. (2016) proposed an integrative model based on metaheuristic\
    \ algorithms and Neuro-Fuzzy (NF) model (namely MONF). Their model took a number\
    \ of independent factors, including elevation, slope, curvature, stream power\
    \ index, topographic wetness index, distance to river, normalized difference vegetation\
    \ index, lithology, stream density, and rainfall as the input vectors, to predict\
    \ a flood susceptibility map as the output. The model showed high accuracy and\
    \ efficiency for both of the training and the validation datasets. Their study\
    \ also showed that the vegetation index had the highest predictive power for flood\
    \ susceptibility. Their method outperformed Random Forest (RF), SVM, and Adaptive\
    \ Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). In Razavi Termeh et al. (2018), three\
    \ different ensemble-ANFIS models, as well as RF and SVM, were applied and compared\
    \ for mapping flood susceptibility. In their models, the ensembles were constructed\
    \ by training multiple models using the same method. They found that ensemble-ANFIS\
    \ with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) gave more accurate results than others.\
    \ Shafizadeh-Moghadam et al. (2018) used an ensemble of multiple types of models\
    \ in which Feedforward Back Propagation (FFBP) ANN is one of the individual models.\
    \ They suggested that the ensemble produced more stable and generalised results\
    \ with higher predicting ability. However, they also suggested that there was\
    \ no guarantee that an ensemble of models could always outperform an individual\
    \ model. The method generally required a large amount of spatial information,\
    \ e.g., topography, vegetation type, and lithology about the catchment under consideration.\
    \ Obtaining these datasets over an entire catchment has been a challenging task,\
    \ but with the advances of remote sensing, such a task is becoming increasingly\
    \ feasible. A summary of the papers being reviewed in this section is given in\
    \ Table 3 with the focus on the latest published papers. Table 3. Summary of the\
    \ reviewed studies involving the application of various types of neurocomputing\

    \ Remarks Chang et al., 2001 RBNN Flood forecasting The model was applied to successfully\
    \ forecast flooding three hours ahead with reasonable accuracy. Dawson et al.,\
    \ 2006 MLP Flood estimation The results indicated that neural networks were able\
    \ to estimate flood statistics for ungauged catchment. Chang et al., 2010 FFNN\
    \ Flood inundation forecasting The ANN model could generate flood inundation maps\
    \ within a few seconds with a MAE as small as 0.06 m. Kia et al., 2012 FFNN Flood\
    \ inundation simulation A combined system of GIS tools and neural networks was\
    \ used for creating flood inundation maps. Chang et al., 2014a, Chang et al.,\
    \ 2014b SOM, NARX Flood inundation nowcasting The SOM was applied for the first\
    \ time in this context, and promising results were obtained for nowcasting flood\
    \ inundation. Tien Bui et al., 2016 Integrative NF Flood susceptibility mapping\
    \ Metaheuristic optimization could improve the performance of the neuro-fuzzy\
    \ model. Razavi Termeh et al., 2018 ANFIS Flood susceptibility mapping Ensemble\
    \ ANFIS generally performed better than an individual (non-ensemble) approach.\
    \ Shafizadeh-Moghadam et al., 2018 FFNN Flood susceptibility mapping Ensemble\
    \ methods had greater generalisation ability and higher predicting capability.\
    \ Chang et al., 2018 SOM, NARX Flood inundation forecasting The recurrent NARX\
    \ model produced better results than the SOM model. Sarker et al., 2019 CNN Flood\
    \ mapping The applied convolutional network provided promising results in mapping\
    \ flood areas from Landsat images across Australia. For flood prediction, mapping,\
    \ and risk assessment, the strength of neurocomputing lies in its high computational\
    \ efficiency (given the model has already been trained), and therefore enables\
    \ real-time flood forecasting with moderate or low computational demand. The drawback\
    \ of the existing neurocomputing models is their incompetence to capture the dynamic\
    \ features of the flooding process and its reliance on large existing hydrometric\
    \ datasets. A promising way forward lies in the combination of ANN-based models\
    \ with physically based models to overcome these issues. 3.3. Topic 3: Modelling\
    \ sediment transport in river systems Sediment behaviour is complex, dynamic and\
    \ non-stationary as well as not uniformly related to the streamflow behaviour\
    \ (Chien and Wan, 1999, van Rijn et al., 2001). Fast moving flow can pick up sediments\
    \ by turbulence and carry them in suspension. The suspended sediments may sink\
    \ and deposit on the riverbed when moving flow becomes slow. Suspended sediment\
    \ concentration (SSC) is often closely related to the dynamics of streamflow.\
    \ However, this relationship is seldom unequivocal and can vary by several orders\
    \ of magnitude due to such factors as hysteresis, seasonality, e.g., during a\
    \ storm event the stream can carry much more sediment than it carries during a\
    \ low flow period. As there is no unique mathematical relation between the SSC\
    \ and the streamflow, predictive simulation of SSC remains a challenge (e.g.,\
    \ Zhou, 2011, Goll, 2017, Banda, 2018, Zhao, 2019). SSC is of paramount importance\
    \ in waterway engineering as the amount of deposited sediment and time frame determine\
    \ when dredging is required to ensure sufficient water depth for shipping or reservoir\
    \ operation (Vollmer and Goelz, 2006, Zhang, 2018). Furthermore, suspended sediment\
    \ may strongly affect water quality when polluted sediments are remobilised through\
    \ dredging activities, as is the case for Upper Rhine in Germany (Goll, 2017,\
    \ Zhang, 2018). Simplified approaches for the current practical applications are\
    \ based on the classical sediment rating curve (SRC) method, which determines\
    \ a functional relation for SSC and the streamflow based on measurements. A fast\
    \ estimation of SSC depending on the measured streamflow is possible with the\
    \ SRC. However, SRC has a limited capability to capture nonlinear processes with\
    \ regard to streamflow and other hydrologic processes (Melesse et al., 2011, Rajaee,\
    \ 2011, Rajaee et al., 2009). For complex river systems, neurocomputing models\
    \ have proven their suitability. Being a data-driven approach, neurocomputing\
    \ modelling offers an effective way to handle non-uniform data from dynamic and\
    \ nonlinear systems (Alp and Cigizoglu, 2007, Nourani et al., 2014a, Nourani et\
    \ al., 2014b). The neurocomputing models may be considered as an alternative when\
    \ the physically based models show poor accuracy or demand a high computational\
    \ cost (Wieprecht et al., 2013). There has been a lot of researches on neurocomputing\
    \ models for predicting sediment concentration, including assessments of the model\
    \ accuracies (see Table 4). In the study of Nagy et al. (2002), a FFNN model was\
    \ developed to determine sediment concentration in rivers, and better results\
    \ were obtained for 80 datasets compared with several commonly applied sediment\
    \ discharge formulas. Rajaee et al. (2009) investigated several neurocomputing\
    \ (e.g., FFNN & NeuroFuzzy, NF), Multiple Linear MLR, and SRC models for predicting\
    \ time series of sediment concentration in two different rivers. Their results\
    \ showed the superiority of FFNN and NF models compared with the MLR and SRC methods\
    \ in reproducing sediment concentration measurements. Melesse et al. (2011) studied\
    \ FFNN, Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), MNLR (Multivariate\
    \ Non-Linear Regression), and MLR models to compute daily suspended sediment loads\
    \ for three major rivers in the USA (Mississippi, Missouri and the Rio Grande).\
    \ They found that FFNN produced better predictions in most of the cases compared\
    \ with MLR, MNLR, and ARIMA. Table 4. Summary of the reviewed studies in applying\
    \ various types of neurocomputing models for modelling suspended sediment transport\
    \ in rivers. Author(s) / Year Model Motivation Remarks Nagy et al., 2002 FFNN\
    \ Prediction of SSC in rivers The FFNN performed better than discharge formulas.\
    \ Cigizoglu and Alp, 2006 GRNN, FFNN Daily discharge (Q) and SSC prediction GRNN\
    \ and FFNN were superior compared to the traditional sediment rating curve formula.\
    \ Cigizoglu and Kisi, 2006 FFNN, RDNN, LR Daily Q and SSC applied prediction RDNN\
    \ provided the better results, and was superior to the conventional FFNN. Rajaee\
    \ et al., 2009 FFNN, NF Time series of daily Q and SSC in 2 rivers FFNN and NF\
    \ performed better than MLR and SRC in reproducing SSC measurements. Melesse et\
    \ al., 2011 MLP Daily and weekly predictions of SSL in 3 US rivers MLP outperformed\
    \ MLR, MNLR, and ARIMA in most cases. Daily predictions were better than weekly.\
    \ Rajaee, 2011 WNN, FFNN Daily SSL modelling in the US river WNN performed more\
    \ favourably than FFNN, MLR, and SRC. Liu et al., 2013 WNN, FFNN Highly nonlinear\
    \ and non-stationary SSC time series one day ahead prediction WNN performed better\
    \ than FFNN and the traditional sediment rating curve method. Nourani et al.,\
    \ 2014a, Nourani et al., 2014b WNN SSL modelling WNN was suitable to handle non-uniform\
    \ data from dynamic and nonlinear hydrological systems. Zounemat-Kermani, 2016\
    \ MLP, PSO-MLP, ANFIS SSC dynamics in streamflow All of the applied neurocomputing\
    \ models performed better than the statistical models. Joshi et al., 2016 FFNN\
    \ Stage discharge suspended sediment relationships for melt runoff FFNN was suitable\
    \ for the estimation of daily SSC. Kisi & Zounemat-Kermani, 2016 MLP, ANFIS Suspended\
    \ sediment modelling ANFIS model was superior to the MLP. Kumar et al., 2016 FFNN,\
    \ RBNN Daily SSC ANN and LS-SVR methods were better than the other models, such\
    \ as MLR. Zounemat-Kermani et al., 2016 MLP Forecast/estimate daily SSC MLP and\
    \ SVR performed better than MLR and SRC. Zounemat-Kermani et al., 2018 FFNN, RBNN,\
    \ ANFIS, WNN Estimating incipient motion velocity of bed sediments WNN followed\
    \ by integrative GA-ANFIS, gave the better results. Zhang, 2018 FFNN, WANN Prediction\
    \ of daily SSC FFNN performed better than WNN and SRC. Khan et al., 2019 MLP Prediction\
    \ of SSC in rivers The simple ANN models successfully predicted the SSC values.\
    \ Rajaee (2011) suggested a Wavelet-ANN (WNN) model for predicting daily suspended\
    \ sediment load (SSL) in the Yadkin River in the USA, which decomposed each time\
    \ series into discrete wave transforms for use as inputs in the ANN. In comparing\
    \ the accuracy of WNN with MLR and SRC models, WNN performed the best, and furthermore,\
    \ it could satisfactorily reproduce hysteresis phenomena. Liu et al. (2013) concluded\
    \ that the WNN model outperforms the conventional models, such as MLP and SRC,\
    \ in short-term (one-day) forecasting of nonlinear and non-stationary SSC time\
    \ series. Zounemat-Kermani et al. (2016) predicted the daily sediment concentration\
    \ based on an eight-year data series from hydro-metric stations in Delaware, Arkansas,\
    \ and Idaho in the USA using MLP models. Their results demonstrated better performance\
    \ of MLP models incorporated with the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno training\
    \ algorithm and recommended this as a suitable option for modelling hydrological\
    \ processes. Joshi et al. (2016) applied FFNN to model stage-discharge suspended\
    \ sediment relationships for melt runoff from the Himalayan Gangotri glacier,\
    \ India in the ablation season (May-September). Their results revealed the suitability\
    \ of FFNN to estimate daily sediment concentration in glacier melt runoff. Zhang\
    \ (2018) applied FFNN and appropriate WNN models to forecast long-term daily sediment\
    \ concentration based on predicted discharges. Khosravi et al. (2018) applied\
    \ several novel data mining methods, including standard and hybrid models in predicting\
    \ river sedimentation. It was reported that the hybrid models provide reliable\
    \ and robust predictions. In the last two decades, neurocomputing models have\
    \ been applied and extended to simulate and predict sediment transport in rivers.\
    \ When compared to 1D, 2D, or 3D physically based numerical models that solve\
    \ the shallow water flow and sediment transport equations, neurocomputing models\
    \ are considerably more efficient from the computational point of view (Zhang\
    \ 2018). Besides, many further studies have demonstrated that neurocomputing models\
    \ perform better in predicting daily sediment transport compared to other mathematical\
    \ methods (e.g., Cigizoglu and Alp, 2006, Cigizoglu and Kisi, 2006, Kumar et al.,\
    \ 2016, Liu et al., 2013). Among the common neurocomputing methods considered\
    \ here, the FFNN, WNN, and MLP have been widely applied in modelling sediment\
    \ transport, and shown their superiority in comparison to the traditional and\
    \ statistical models, such as SRC, MLR or ARIMA. 3.4. Topic 4: Urban water demand\
    \ prediction Accurate prediction of water demand in urban settings is the key\
    \ to inform optimal planning and management decisions in water distribution systems,\
    \ improve utilities’ operations, and support the design of demand-side management\
    \ programs (Donkor et al., 2012). Several types of models have been tested in\
    \ the literature to capture existing relationships between water demand and its\
    \ potential determinants, including natural and climatic factors, socio-demographic\
    \ factors, and responses to water demand management strategies (for recent comprehensive\
    \ reviews, see House-Peters and Chang, 2011, Donkor et al., 2012, Cominola et\
    \ al., 2015). In the last two decades, neurocomputing models (e.g., FFNN, RBNN,\
    \ MLP, CNN) have been increasingly adopted to develop forecasting models of water\
    \ demand, mainly because of their ability to capture the nonlinear relationship\
    \ between water demand and the aforementioned determinants, as well as because\
    \ they require fewer assumptions than other parametric and more conventional methods\
    \ based on regression techniques or time series analysis (Ghalehkhondabi et al.,\
    \ 2017, House-Peters and Chang, 2011). Several studies in the literature (see\
    \ Table 5) have demonstrated the suitability of various types and architectures\
    \ of neural-based methods to accurately forecast urban water demand across different\
    \ spatiotemporal scales. Most of these studies focus on predicting water demand\
    \ at the city scale and in the short- or medium-term, with a temporal resolutions\
    \ that spans from hourly (e.g., Herrera et al., 2010, Coelho and Andrade-Campos,\
    \ 2019) or daily (e.g., Adamowski et al., 2012, Al-Zahrani and Abo-Monasar, 2015)\
    \ to weekly and monthly (e.g., Jain et al., 2001, Firat et al., 2009, Firat et\
    \ al., 2010), often with an emphasis on peak demand during summer months (Bougadis\
    \ et al., 2005, Adamowski, 2008, Adamowski and Karapataki, 2010). Only a few examples\
    \ focused on long-term forecasting (Li and Huicheng, 2010). Table 5. Summary of\
    \ the reviewed studies in applying various types of neurocomputing models for\
    \ predicting urban water demand at various spatial and temporal scales. Author(s)/Year\
    \ Model Motivation Remarks Jain et al., 2001 FFNN Short-term forecasting of weekly\
    \ water demand for the Indian Institute of Technology (Kanpur) with ANNs The best\
    \ ANN outperformed seven benchmark models based on regression and time series\
    \ analysis. Water demand was found to be mainly influenced by maximum air temperature\
    \ and rainfall occurrence. Liu et al., 2003 FFNN (embedded in the WDF-ANN model)\
    \ Forecasting of the average daily domestic water demand The WDF-ANN model showed\
    \ R2 and correlation coefficient between observed and forecasted water demands\
    \ higher than 0.9. Bougadis et al., 2005 FFNN Short-term forecasting of weekly\
    \ peak water demand for the city of Ottawa (Canada) ANN outperformed regression\
    \ and time-series methods, with R2 reaching values up to 0.8. The effect of rainfall\
    \ amount was found to be more significant than the rainfall occurrence. Msiza\
    \ et al., 2007 MLP, RBNN Comparing the performance of ANN and SVM models to forecast\
    \ urban water demand Different ANN and SVM models are compared. The best ANN-based\
    \ method was demonstrated to outperform the best SVM-based method. Adamowski,\

    \ better than MLR and time series analysis techniques. Ghiassi et al., 2008 DAN2\
    \ Urban water demand forecasting The DAN2 model reached a MAPE lower than 1% for\
    \ monthly, weekly, and daily forecasts. MAPE slightly increased to 2–3% for hourly\
    \ forecasts. Weather information improved hourly forecasts. Firat et al., 2009\
    \ GRNN, FFNN, RBNN Forecasting monthly water consumption The GRNN model with the\
    \ monthly water bill, population, and monthly average temperature input outperformed\
    \ the other methods. Adamowski and Karapataki, 2010 MLP, RPNN Comparing the performance\
    \ of different types of ANN and MLP models to forecast peak weekly water demand\
    \ The Levenberg Marquardt neural-based models outperformed standard MLP, and it\
    \ provided the best solutions, with R2 higher than 0.9. The effect of rainfall\
    \ occurrence was found to be more significant than the rainfall amount. Firat\
    \ et al., 2010 GRNN, CCNN, FFNN Forecast monthly water consumption time series\
    \ Tests on data from the city of Izmir (Turkey) demonstrated that CCNN provided\
    \ the best solutions. Herrera et al., 2010 FFNN Predicting the hourly urban water\
    \ demand Support vector regression was the best performing models, followed by\
    \ multivariate adaptive regression splines, projection pursuit regression, and\
    \ random forests. FFNN performance was lower than that of the above models. Li\
    \ and Huicheng, 2010 NFNN Forecasting urban annual water demand in Dalian (China)\
    \ NFNNs were combined with MLR models. The combined model predicted annual water\
    \ demand with a relative error lower than 10%. Babel and Shinde, 2011 MLP Identifying\

    \ prediction accuracies (threshold static metric higher than 98%) were found for\
    \ short-term prediction, by using one lag of the historic daily demand as the\
    \ only ANN input. Adamowski et al., 2012 MLP, WA-ANN Comparing the performance\
    \ of different predictive models to forecast daily urban demand for an urban area\
    \ in Montreal (Canada) WA-ANN outperformed other benchmark methods, as assessed\
    \ with multiple metrics: R2, Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient, RMSE,\
    \ and relative RMSE. Campisi-Pinto et al., 2012 FFNN (coupled with wavelet-denoising)\

    \ The hybrid model coupling DAN2 with FS achieved the best performance (lowest\

    \ MLP (coupled with DWT and MSA) Forecasting urban monthly water demand of Instanbul\
    \ (Turkey) with extended lead time Stand-alone MLP could not predict monthly water\

    \ stand-alone MLP and coupled DWT-MLP. Mouatadid and Adamowski, 2017 ELM, MLR,\
    \ FFMLP, SVM Comparing the performance of different linear and non-linear methods\
    \ to forecast daily urban water demand for the city of Montreal (Canada) ELM achieved\
    \ the best performance (R2 and RMSE) for urban water demand forecasting with 1-\
    \ and 3-day lead time. Zubaidi et al., 2018 FFNN (coupled with GSA and BSA) Short-term\
    \ forecasting of urban water demand considering weather variables The model coupling\
    \ GSA with FFNN achieved better forecasting performance than the BSA-FFNN model.\
    \ Coelho and Andrade-Campos, 2019 FFNN Short-term forecasting of hourly water\
    \ demand for a water network in Portugal Models based on FFNN overall performed\
    \ better than benchmark naïve and exponential smoothing models when external predictors\
    \ (e.g., anthropic and weather variables) were included. Hu et al., 2019 CNN combined\
    \ with Bidirectional LSTM Short-term forecasting of daily urban water demand The\
    \ hybrid model combining CNN with Bidirectional LSTM provided more accurate forecasts,\
    \ compared to the single models. Pacchin et al., 2019 MLP Comparing the performance\
    \ of different predictive models to forecast hourly urban water demand Data-driven\
    \ and pattern-based techniques achieved similar short-term forecasting accuracy\
    \ in calibration. Models based on moving-window techniques showed better accuracy\
    \ in validation. The numerical results obtained in the state-of-the-art studies\
    \ demonstrate that different types of neural-based models can provide more accurate\
    \ forecasts than benchmark linear or nonlinear methods on specific case studies.\
    \ For instance, the outcomes of a recent study by Mouatadid and Adamowski (2017)\
    \ demonstrated that Extreme Learning Machines outperformed MLR, FFMLP, and SVM\
    \ could accurately forecast daily urban water demand for the city of Montreal\
    \ (Canada). Furthermore, the performance of neurocomputing methods can be enhanced\
    \ by coupling neural networks with wavelet denoising (Campisi-Pinto et al. (2012)\
    \ combined FFNN with wavelet denoising to reduce the variance of the model input\
    \ dataset) or methods that aid the search for optimal input variables and network\
    \ settings (e.g., GSA and BSA in Zubaidi et al. (2018); DWT and MSA in Altunkaynak\
    \ and Nigussie (2017)). These promising insights are supported by the numerical\
    \ outcomes of comparative studies that rigorously assessed the performance of\
    \ neural-based methods against benchmark methods (e.g., Msiza et al., 2007, Adamowski\
    \ and Karapataki, 2010, Odan and Reis, 2012, Pacchin et al., 2019). In addition\
    \ to that, a few studies attempted to develop comprehensive models that are able\
    \ to forecast urban water demand across different temporal scales and lead times\
    \ (Ghiassi et al., 2008, Tiwari and Adamowski, 2013), showing that accuracy levels\
    \ well above 90% can be reached. While such results overall support the use of\
    \ neurocomputing methods to forecast urban water demand, some challenges and opportunities\
    \ for further research can still be listed. First, most of the findings from the\
    \ reviewed studies can be considered as case-specific and are hard to generalize\
    \ to other applications. For instance, while there is consensus on the influence\
    \ of maximum temperatures on water demand, there is no full agreement on which\
    \ weather-related variables best inform neural-based model predictions (e.g.,\
    \ rainfall amount vs. rainfall occurrence; Adamowski, 2008). Secondly, several\
    \ other socio-demographic factors constitute potential drivers/determinants of\
    \ water demand. Yet, it is still unclear which of these determinants influence\
    \ water demand at different spatial and temporal scales, and gathering some of\
    \ them is not under the control of water utilities (Donkor et al., 2012). Accurate\
    \ short-term water demand forecast at the urban scale can be obtained even with\
    \ the inclusion of lagged historical demand (Babel and Shinde, 2011), but socio-demographics\
    \ become relevant when household-scale models are developed (Liu et al., 2003).\
    \ More in general, the identification of optimal neural-based model predictor\
    \ set would prevent developing unnecessarily complex models that include redundant\
    \ or non-informative variables likely to cause a decrease in the model performance\
    \ (Coelho and Andrade-Campos, 2019). Thirdly, while different ANN architectures\
    \ have been demonstrated to compete and outperform more classical statistical\
    \ methods (Ghalehkhondabi et al., 2017), hybrid approaches, i.e., combined methods\
    \ such as the MSA-MLP (Altunkaynak and Nigussie, 2017), GSA-FFNN (Zubaidi et al.,\
    \ 2018) and CNN with LSTM (Hu et al., 2019) are recently gaining interest and\
    \ opening up opportunities for further investigation, with applications to both\
    \ short-term and long-term (extended lead time) urban water demand forecasting.\
    \ In addition, the digitalization of the water sector and the deployment of smart\
    \ meter technologies are opening up new opportunities for the development of fine-scale\
    \ descriptive and predictive demand models (Cominola et al., 2015, Cominola et\
    \ al., 2019). Bennett et al. (2013) demonstrated that neural-based methods, such\
    \ as FFNN, BPNN and other ANN architectures, could forecast the household water\
    \ demand at the end-use level, with data from over 200 households in Southeast\
    \ Queensland (Australia). The Hidden Layer Sigmoid Activation Linearly Activation\
    \ Output FFNN model developed by Bennett et al. (2013) accounted for socio-economic,\
    \ demographic, and appliance efficiency variables. Finally, further testing of\
    \ neurocomputing water demand forecasting methods in water distribution network\
    \ optimization approaches (e.g., Salomons et al., 2007) is needed to assess their\
    \ usability in such integrated models and account for the effect of their uncertainties.\
    \ Table 5 reports and summarizes the reviewed studies that applied various types\
    \ and architectures of neurocomputing methods to develop models for predicting\
    \ urban water demand. 3.5. Topic 5: Modelling flow through hydraulic structures\
    \ Hydraulic structures are known as works and structures that are associated with\
    \ any water bodies (submerged or partially submerged) including the rivers, coastal\
    \ regions and estuaries, which may be constructed to retain, convey, or disrupt\
    \ the natural flow of water. Accordingly, hydraulic structures can be classified\
    \ into several categories, including water retaining structures (e.g., dams),\
    \ water conveying structures (e.g., channels, spillways, flumes) and other special-purpose\
    \ hydro-structures (e.g., fishways, water intakes, irrigation canals) depending\
    \ on their purpose and impact on the natural streamflow (Chen and Chen, 2015).\
    \ The proper design, control, and rehabilitation processes of hydraulic structures\
    \ necessitate accurate and rapid simulations of flows. These can be carried out\
    \ either via hard computing procedures (e.g., numerical models) or soft computing\
    \ techniques (e.g., neurocomputing). In this section, the application and suitability\
    \ of different types and configurations of neurocomputing models to simulate flow\
    \ through hydraulic structures are investigated. Zeng and Huai (2009) used a three-layer\
    \ MLPNN model to predict the friction factors in open channel flow, considering\
    \ the Reynolds number and the relative roughness as input parameters. The MLP-simulated\
    \ results were compared with the results obtained from empirical formulae. Comparison\
    \ of results showed that the MLPNN model was more accurate in predicting the nonlinear\
    \ relationship between the friction factor and effective input parameters. Sahu\
    \ et al. (2011) made an attempt to predict the total flowrate in compound channels\
    \ using an MLPNN model. Comparison of the estimated discharges obtained using\
    \ different models demonstrated the superiority of MLP over the conventional models\
    \ (e.g., the coherence method and the exchange discharge method). In another study,\
    \ Zounemat-Kermani and Scholz (2013) employed ANFIS and MLPNN to study the volume\
    \ of air required in low-level outlet works of dams. ML methods were utilized\
    \ to estimate the discharge of vent air in different gate openings for embankment\
    \ dams. The results indicated that the fuzzy rule-based neural network model performed\
    \ better than the standard MLP and MLR models. More recently, Zounemat-Kermani\
    \ et al., 2019a, Zounemat-Kermani et al., 2019b examined the precision of three\
    \ ML models (namely, Gene-Expression Programming (GEP), Chi-square Automatic Interaction\
    \ Detector (CHAID), and Support Vector Machine (SVM)) and two types of neural\
    \ networks (Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) and MLPNN) for the estimation of flow\
    \ rate over triangular arced labyrinth weirs. The findings of the study showed\
    \ that the MLP managed to estimate the flow rate over the weir with the highest\
    \ accuracy based on statistical measures. Mahdavi-Meymand et al. (2019) investigated\
    \ and challenged the capability of standard and integrated versions of different\
    \ types of neurocomputing models, including ANFIS, Wavelet Neural Network (WNN),\
    \ MLPNN, and RBNN to estimate the spillway aerator air demand in dams. Analysis\
    \ of the model outputs revealed that ANFIS integrated with a genetic algorithm\
    \ achieved the best performance. To sum up, Table 6 provides a summary of studies\
    \ for predicting flow through hydraulic structures using various types of neurocomputing.\
    \ According to the findings of the studies being reviewed, neurocomputing models\
    \ have been successfully exploited in simulating flow through hydraulic structures\
    \ and started to play an important role in the current engineering research and\
    \ practice. Table 6. Summary of the reviewed studies applying various types of\

    \ sediment modelling in sewers In the recent years, different mathematical and\
    \ numerical approaches have been used for modelling flow and sediment transport\
    \ in sewer networks and sewage collection systems. However, the majority of the\
    \ applied models and simulation techniques are known as deterministic hard computing\
    \ techniques (Cataño-Lopera et al., 2017). Such models and techniques require\
    \ detailed information on the hydraulic characteristics of the flow/sediment as\
    \ well as the knowledge of the sewer network geometries, some of which are difficult\
    \ to acquire or are simply unavailable (Zounemat-Kermani et al., 2020b). In this\
    \ respect, a number of studies have been conducted to apply soft computing methods\
    \ such as neurocomputing for predicting flow or sediment transport in sewers (e.g.,\
    \ short-term predictions of wastewater). Consistent with the topic of this study,\
    \ some of the most pertinent studies using neurocomputing in modelling flow and\
    \ sediment transport in sewers are reviewed as follows. El-Din and Smith (2002)\
    \ presented a feedforward MLPNN for short-term prediction of wastewater outflow\
    \ rate of a sewer network entering a wastewater treatment plant. The established\
    \ MLP used observed rainfall data as inputs and produced promising results. It\
    \ was demonstrated that the MLP model could be integrated with a real-time control\
    \ algorithm for minimizing the total pollution from the wastewater treatment plant.\
    \ Fernando et al. (2006) employed a FFNN model to forecast the incidents of wastewater\
    \ overflows in a combined sewerage system. Their results showed that the proposed\
    \ model provided promising results in forecasting sewer overflow rates. One of\
    \ the main findings was that precise forecasting of overflow rates was highly\
    \ dependent on the antecedent real-time flow rate data measured at the overflow\
    \ structure. In other words, the FFNN model failed in producing satisfactory results\
    \ without having access to the past records of flow rates. Mounce et al. (2014)\
    \ assessed the potential of MLPs in predicting the hydraulic performance of combined\
    \ sewer overflows as an alternative method to hydraulic models. The applied MLP\
    \ models were capable of predicting the depth of sewer overflows with less than\
    \ 5% error in more than one hour ahead. They concluded that neural networks are\
    \ useful alternatives to fully physically based models, removing manual modelling\
    \ overheads, and geometric data requirements for model calibration. Ebtehaj et\
    \ al. (2016) applied three neurocomputing models, i.e., Radial Basis Neural Network\
    \ (RBNN), integrative Particle Swarm Optimization RBNN (PSO-RBNN) and hybrid RBNN\
    \ (combined with decision trees, DT), to predict sediment transport in sewer collectors.\
    \ It appeared that the hybrid DT-RBNN predicted more accurate results than the\
    \ other two RBNN methods. Zhang et al., 2018a, Zhang et al., 2018b evaluated different\
    \ neurocomputing models, including MLP, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), LSTM and WNN,\
    \ for predicting the water level of a combined sewer overflow structure. Comparison\
    \ of the predicted results indicated that the LSTM and GRU presented superior\
    \ capabilities for time series prediction. It was also found that the conventional\
    \ MLP neural network could only provide reasonable short-term predictions (just\
    \ one- and two-step ahead). However, the WNN model managed to improve predictions\
    \ of multiple steps ahead. Overall, the LSTM and GRU outperformed WNN and MLP\
    \ and produced satisfactory results for multi-step-ahead prediction. The LSTM\
    \ model showed slightly better performance than GRU, but the GRU model presented\
    \ certain advantages, such as quicker learning process and simpler architecture.\
    \ Safari (2019) investigated bedload sediment transport in sewer pipes with clean\
    \ bed and non-deposition condition using Generalized Regression Neural Network\
    \ (GRNN). Results from the model performance indicators showed that GRNN outperformed\
    \ conventional regression models. Table 7 summarizes the key researches related\
    \ to the application of neurocomputing models in predicting flow rate and sediment\
    \ transport in sewer systems. Table 7. Summary of the reviewed studies involving\
    \ the application of various types of neurocomputing models for modelling flow\
    \ and sediment in sewers. Author(s)/Year Model Motivation Remarks El-Din & Smith,\

    \ model was found to be efficient in providing accurate predictions of inflow.\
    \ Fernando et al., 2006 MLP Forecasting the occurrences of wastewater and sewer\
    \ overflows Accurate forecasting of overflow rates could be achieved by MLP when\
    \ records of real-time overflow were available. Azamathulla et al., 2012 ANFIS\
    \ Prediction of sediment transport in sewer pipes The ANFIS model gave acceptable\
    \ results in comparison to the existing empirical models. Ebtehaj and Bonakdari,\
    \ 2013 MLP Prediction of sediment transport in sewer pipes Compared with other\
    \ empirical formulations, the MLP provided more accurate results. Mounce et al.,\
    \ 2014 MLP Predicting combined sewer overflows The trained MLP model provided\
    \ a fair prediction of the depth of combined sewer overflows. Ebtehaj et al.,\
    \ 2016 RBNN, DT-RFNN, PSO-RBNN Predicting sediment transport in sewer pipes The\
    \ hybrid DT-RBNN (a combination of neural network and decision tree) produced\
    \ more accurate results than the other models. Najafzadeh & Bonakdari, 2016 GMDH,\

    \ conventional neurocomputing models, both LSTM and GRU presented accurate predictions.\
    \ Ebtehaj et al., 2018 Hybrid MLP, RBF Sediment transport prediction in clean\
    \ sewer collectors The Hybrid MLP outperformed the standard RBF model. Zhang et\
    \ al., 2018b ENN, LSTM, NARX Forecasting overflow in sewers The recurrent LSTM\
    \ model was superior to the other neurocomputing models. Safari, 2019 GRNN Modelling\
    \ sediment transport in sewer pipes GRNN model outperformed the conventional regression\
    \ models. Al-Ani and Al-Obaidi, 2019 MLPNN Prediction of sediment accumulation\
    \ for trunk sewer MLPNN model found to be practical and gave better results compared\
    \ to the MLR model. Zaji and Bonakdari, 2019 RBNN Modelling the discharge and\
    \ velocity field in sewer structures The RBF method performed significantly better\
    \ than the multiple nonlinear regression model. As indicated in Table 7 (by closely\
    \ looking at the chronological order of the studies as listed), there is a clear\
    \ increasing trend in the application of neurocomputing approaches in modelling\
    \ sewer systems in the last five years. Majority of studies focus on predicting\
    \ flow or sediment transport in sewers based on the hydraulics of flow and geometries\
    \ of structures. These researches have effectively demonstrated the competence\
    \ of neurocomputing approaches in modelling the hydraulics of sewer networks.\
    \ 4. Summary and conclusion remarks 4.1. General findings This study is focused\
    \ on critically analysing and classifying the state-of-the-art applications of\
    \ neurocomputing approaches in modelling surface water hydrology and hydraulics,\
    \ published as peer-reviewed articles over the last two decades (2000–2019). The\
    \ main concluding remarks are provided as follows: (1) In the past two decades,\
    \ neural-based and neurocomputing models have been proven to be flexible and promising\
    \ tools for modelling a variety of problems in hydrological and hydraulic sciences.\
    \ In addition, in comparison with the traditional statistical models, stochastic\
    \ methods, and empirical formulations, these models have great potential in providing\
    \ more accurate and reliable predictions. (2) Although they are capable of identifying\
    \ the relationship between the input and output (target) variables using a black-box\
    \ strategy, neurocomputing models cannot provide a straightforward and explicit\
    \ function for articulating the physical essences behind the modelling process.\
    \ On the other hand, other types of machine learning models such as Gene Expression\
    \ Programming (GEP) and Regression Trees (RT) do not suffer from this specific\
    \ issue and may be considered as alternative options in certain cases. (3) Approaches\
    \ to developing neurocomputing models differ substantially in relation to a number\
    \ of factors, such as input vector decomposition, selection of network type, adoption\
    \ of network architecture and choice of proper learning scheme. Existing works\
    \ in the literature indicate that the use of decomposition techniques such as\
    \ wavelet methods improves the performance of the adopted neurocomputing models,\
    \ especially for sophisticated and high-dimensional hydroscience applications,\
    \ such as flood modelling. (4) Fuzzy-based neurocomputing models, e.g., NFNN and\
    \ ANFIS, demonstrate great potential in capturing the nonlinearity of complex\
    \ hydrosystems dynamics. (5) Employing a recurrent structure for the network (namely\
    \ RNN), for example, NARX, and LSTM, improves the performance of feedforward models\
    \ in predicting time series of hydrological problems. RNN facilitates time delay\
    \ units through feedback connections, being computationally more efficient and\
    \ biologically more plausible than feedforward structures. (6) Most of the works\
    \ being reviewed suggest that integrating meta-heuristic and nature-based optimization\
    \ algorithms may enhance the accuracy of the training process of the standard\
    \ neurocomputing models. However, the use of these optimization algorithms increases\
    \ the computation cost. (7) Regarding the application of different neurocomputing\
    \ approaches in different problems of hydrological and hydraulic sciences, it\
    \ can be concluded that modern neurocomputing models, such as Extreme Learning\
    \ Machine, Deep Learning models, integrative networks, and Wavelet Neural Network,\
    \ are likely to perform better than the conventional models, such as Multi-layer\
    \ Perceptron and Generalized Regression Neural Network. However, it is not possible\
    \ to distinguish one particular type of modern neural network-based models as\
    \ a prominent candidate for all different applications. 4.2. Findings related\
    \ to surface water hydrology and hydraulics Besides the overall review of the\
    \ pertaining literature, six topics within the surface water hydrology and hydraulic\
    \ sciences were appraised and evaluated in detail from the neurocomputing perspective.\
    \ Specific findings and concluding remarks are given as follows: (1) The selection\
    \ of a specific neurocomputing approach for time-dependent problems in hydrology\
    \ (e.g., water level prediction, flood modelling, and sediment transportation)\
    \ is highly dependent on the scope of the study. Commonly, traditional FFNNs can\
    \ perform well in the short-term predictions and should be preferred in such cases\
    \ for their easy implementation, while RNN and WNN models are in general more\
    \ suitable for longer-term-predictions. (2) Multi-dimensional physically based\
    \ numerical models for complex hydrological and hydraulic phenomena, such as sediment\
    \ transport in rivers and sewers, need many physical parameters (e.g., settling\
    \ velocities, initial grain size distributions, critical shear stresses for erosion\
    \ and deposition) which are ideally determined through laboratory experiments\
    \ requiring substantial time and effort, especially for fractional sediment transport.\
    \ Meanwhile the overall accuracy of these models is still limited in many cases.\
    \ Neurocomputing provides a reliable alternative with fewer required inputs and\
    \ CPU time to predict the nonlinear and non-unique behaviour of sediment transport,\
    \ without necessity of investigating in detail the nature of all physical processes\
    \ involved and their interactions. (3) Neurocomputing models have proven to be\
    \ superior with regard to the prediction of daily suspended transport when compared\
    \ with other mathematical models. This is due to the fact that, in these models,\
    \ the value of the dependent variable computed in the previous time step(s) can\
    \ be used as an (additional) input for the current time step, contributing to\
    \ a better simulation of hysteresis phenomena. In addition, neurocomputing can\
    \ provide more reasonable predictions for extremely high or low values (Zhu et\
    \ al., 2007), because specific algorithms using distributed neurons and nonlinear\
    \ transforms are involved. (4) Some studies showed that the neurocomputing models\
    \ can detect water level peaks better than a hydrodynamic model (e.g., Panda et\
    \ al., 2010). While in other applications, the lower or higher peaks were under-\
    \ or overestimated (as in See and Openshaw, 2000) or slightly delayed (as in Ma\
    \ et al., 2019). (5) The review of the methods for urban water demand prediction\
    \ suggests that a variety of neural-based models constitute viable alternatives\
    \ to other linear or nonlinear models, often achieving better performances as\
    \ measured by heterogeneous error metrics. Their flexibility and computational\
    \ efficiency make them suitable for identifying the underlying dependencies between\
    \ water demand and potential drivers/determinants (Cominola et al., 2018), which\
    \ can vary for different case studies or spatiotemporal scales. (6) The application\
    \ of physically based models for predicting water level in rivers, flooding, wastewater\
    \ overflows, and flow rate in sewers requires accurate physical data, such as\
    \ topography and bathymetry, and usually demands high computational costs. Neurocomputing\
    \ methods can effectively overcome these drawbacks and can predict water level\
    \ and flow rate at a much lower computational cost without the necessity of knowing\
    \ any physical information about the study area, provided that historical hydrological\
    \ data series are available. (7) In general, the inclusion of historical re-forecast\
    \ modelling information, a smart pre-processing of input and output data, the\
    \ integration of different neurocomputing methods and/or the combination of neurocomputing\
    \ methods with physically based models can improve model performance. Specifically,\
    \ for water level prediction along a gauged stream, including the historical data\
    \ at the target gauge can increase the accuracy of the results and it is usually\
    \ recommended. This is also valid with regard to the supervision of the model\
    \ training, e.g., considering time delays units through recursive inner connection\
    \ (Chang et al., 2014a, Chang et al., 2014b). (8) In modelling surface water hydrology\
    \ (e.g., water level prediction) and hydraulic (e.g., flow over hydraulic structures)\
    \ problems, data pre-processing plays an important role in detecting the most\
    \ relevant variables for the problem under consideration (e.g., feature selection\
    \ analysis, also to avoid redundant information); in some cases, the inclusion\
    \ of additional predictor(s) such as precipitation, temperature, slope, in the\
    \ input dataset can lead to a higher accuracy and better performance of the model(s).\
    \ 5. Research gaps, lacunae, and limitations Neurocomputing methods usually require\
    \ long historical data series and high-quality data to deliver good results. Also,\
    \ being black box models, inner physical relations cannot be explicitly identified,\
    \ and this could be the limitation for some applications. In other words, one\
    \ major limitation of neurocomputing models is their need for long time series\
    \ data for training and testing. It is evident from the literature review that\
    \ for hydrological and hydraulic simulations with long series of data, neurocomputing\
    \ works very well. However, this type of models is much less competent in applications\
    \ without sufficient data. For instance, few studies have addressed neurocomputing\
    \ for estimating flood dynamics and sediment concentrations in poorly gauged or\
    \ ungauged catchments. In sediment transport modelling, there are only very few\
    \ studies about long-term forecasts. Many studies are focused on exploring the\
    \ capability of models based on a historical re-forecast, i.e., they first prepare\
    \ the input combinations using the entire data series and later divide them into\
    \ calibration and validation data sets to set up and test the models. As a consequence,\
    \ the resulting input used to forecast the value at a particular moment is computed\
    \ using information from the ‘future’; such information is clearly not available\
    \ in the realistic forecasting process (Zhang et al., 2015, Zhang, 2018). Therefore,\
    \ the historical re-forecast modelling can be used to compare capabilities of\
    \ models or one-step advance predictions, but is not suitable for long-term predictions.\
    \ Development of neurocomputing methods in operational hydrodynamics and morphodynamics\
    \ forecasting has gained particular interest over the past years. But there are\
    \ yet few neurocomputing models that are able to support long-term prediction\
    \ with acceptable accuracy. Some of the recurrent neural networks such as ESN\
    \ and LSTM (e.g., Coulibaly, 2010, Ma et al., 2019) have been shown to be promising,\
    \ but further research in this direction is still needed. Related to the application\
    \ of neurocomputing for water demand prediction, existing limitations are primarily\
    \ linked to the generalisation of the developed models and the accuracy of the\
    \ results, rather than the model implementation. For instance, the models presented\
    \ in the literature have been mostly trained and validated on specific case studies,\
    \ targeting the prediction of water demand at different spatial and temporal scales,\
    \ forecast horizons, and considering a variety of different predictors. The obtained\
    \ results are, thus, often hard to cross-compare and seldom valid for a different\
    \ setting. Future comparative studies should perform sensitivity analysis and\
    \ assessment of the portability of state-of-the-art models to different case studies,\
    \ along with their robustness with respect to uncertainties in the input set,\
    \ sampling resolution of their input/output variables, required forecast horizon,\
    \ and model parameterization. 6. Recommendations and future directions In the\
    \ retrospectives of most published researches related to the application of neurocomputing\
    \ models in hydrological and hydraulic sciences (see Table 1, Table 2, Table 3,\
    \ Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7), two interesting facts related to their\
    \ historical trends may be highlighted. Firstly, unlike the use of neurocomputing\
    \ models for hydrological predictions, their application to predicting flow through\
    \ hydraulic structures does not have a long history and it is mostly limited to\
    \ the last decade. Secondly, the majority of the published works have used the\
    \ prevailing and conventional version of neurocomputing models, namely MLPNN,\
    \ for various applications. Hence, there is still a wide scope for researchers\
    \ to pursue this specific topic using novel neurocomputing models, such as deep\
    \ learning and integrative models. In general, a robust supervision of neurocomputing\
    \ models is essential to support their successful application to tackle hydrological-\
    \ and hydraulic-related challenges, e.g. through data pre-processing using SVM,\
    \ feature-selection and/or optimization algorithms. From this review, the following\
    \ recommendations may be made for future research in terms of developing or applying\
    \ neurocomputing models for different types of hydroscience problems: (1) Substantial\
    \ researches have been reported in the development and application of neurocomputing\
    \ models in hydrological and hydraulic sciences. A number of different machine\
    \ learning approaches have been used and achieved different level of success,\
    \ such as tree-based and vector-based models. Conducting a comprehensive survey\
    \ on the susceptibility of soft computing models (e.g., machine learning models)\
    \ versus hard computing models (e.g., numerical methods) in hydrological sciences\
    \ is highly encouraged. (2) Although this paper provides a detailed review of\
    \ the application of neurocomputing in six different topics in hydrological and\
    \ hydraulic sciences, it is inevitable that some related subjects have to be excluded,\
    \ which should be included in the future studies, e.g., groundwater modelling,\
    \ irrigation systems, water quality simulation, precipitation forecast, evaporation\
    \ estimation, and rainfall-runoff processes. (3) A forward step in developing\
    \ and deploying neurocomputing models is to integrate these models into physically\
    \ and geospatial-based models. In that case, both the pre-processing and post-processing\
    \ parts of the models can be directly linked to the geographic information system\
    \ (GIS) in the information layer. (4) Hybridization and integration of neurocomputing\
    \ models and other types of soft computing concepts should be considered for enriching\
    \ the original neurocomputing simulation models and overcoming the restrictions\
    \ of the individual models. Several studies have been carried out to develop hybrid\
    \ neurocomputing models in the recent years, and this has led to some novel combined\
    \ models showing improved performance for different types of problems. It is worth\
    \ noting that, in some cases, combining different soft computing methods would\
    \ not necessarily enhance the performance of the resulting hybrid models; more\
    \ research effort is needed to develop more efficient and accurate hybrid models\
    \ in the future. (5) Limited studies have been recorded in the application of\
    \ DL models, such as ESN and CNN models to predict water level fluctuations in\
    \ rivers, flooding, sediment transport, flow through the hydraulic structures,\
    \ and flow rate in sewer systems as well as assessing water quality; further research\
    \ in this direction is also encouraged. Declaration of Competing Interest The\
    \ authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal\
    \ relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this\
    \ paper. Acknowledgement The first author, as a Georg Forster Research fellow,\

    \ on the applications of machine learning for runoff modeling\nBabak Mohammadi1\
    \ \nReceived: 2 August 2021 / Accepted: 13 October 2021 / Published online: 19\
    \ October 2021 \n© The Author(s) 2021\nAbstract\nThe growing menace of global\
    \ warming and restrictions on access to water in each region is a huge threat\
    \ to global hydro-\nlogical sustainability. Hence, the perspective at which hydrological\
    \ studies are currently being carried out across the world \nto quantify and understand\
    \ the water cycle modeling requires a further boost. In the past few decades,\
    \ the theoretical under-\nstanding of machine learning (ML) algorithms for solving\
    \ engineering issues, and the application of this method to practical \nproblems\
    \ have made very significant progress. In the field of hydrology, ML has been\
    \ using for a better understanding of \nhydrological complexities. Then, using\
    \ ML-based approaches for hydrological simulation have been a popular method for\
    \ \nrunoff modeling in recent years; it seems necessary to understand the application\
    \ of ML in runoff modeling fully. Current \nresearch seeks to have an overview\
    \ for rainfall–runoff modeling using ML approaches in recent years, including\
    \ integrated \nand ordinary ML techniques (such as ANFIS, ANN, and SVM models).\
    \ The main hydrological topics in this review study \ninclude surface hydrology,\
    \ streamflow, rainfall–runoff, and flood modeling via ML approaches. Therefore,\

    Introduction\nIn recent years, methods involving data-driven models and \nmachine\
    \ learning (ML) have been developed to predict run-\noff (Nourani et al. 2011,\
    \ 2021; Mohammadi et al. 2020a, \nc). The relationship between hydrologic cycle\
    \ variables and \nrunoff in theoretical system models is approached directly \n\
    without considering the physical processes involved (Okkan \net al. 2021; Alizadeh\
    \ et al. 2021). Also, this type of black-\nbox model may consider some unpredictable\
    \ hydrological \nterms during the modeling process, and they can be under-\nstood\
    \ as the hydrological phoneme in view of data-driven \nknowledge. Nonetheless,\
    \ such ML (black-box) methods have \nbeen proved to have impressive accuracy in\
    \ runoff simulat-\ning (Mohammadi and Mehdizadeh 2020; Sang 2013; Abbot \nand\
    \ Marohasy 2012).\nIn hydrological modeling studies, accurate runoff mod-\neling\
    \ is the main research topic that affects water resources \nplanning, including\
    \ dam design, water resource allocation \nplans, catchment area management, and\
    \ flood management \n(Nourani et al. 2009; Zhou et al. 2019; Chadalawada et al.\
    \ \n2020; Mohammadi et al. 2020b). It is scientifically proven \nthat due to the\
    \ physical processes and natural changes related \nto the river system, then the\
    \ prediction of the river system \nand its runoff behavior is particularly difficult\
    \ to analyze. \nIn hydrological applications, the need to improve the reli-\n\
    ability and accuracy of hydrological variable prediction has \nattracted much\
    \ attention (Niu et al. 2019). In the process \nof the research plan carried out\
    \ by hydrometeorological \nresearchers, no one has been determined yet. Due to\
    \ dif-\nferent physical phenomena, such as the pattern, periodicity \nor randomness\
    \ in model input and target data, and natural \nrandomness in general, a method\
    \ that can usually be used to \nsimulate hydrological processes under different\
    \ conditions \nis ML approaches (Sharafati et al. 2020; Mohammadi et al. \n2021a).\
    \ Considering this point of view can also be assumed \nthat there is no general\
    \ model that performs better than other \nmodels under various hydrological conditions\
    \ and differ-\nent catchment characteristics (Adnan et al. 2021). Due to \nmodel\
    \ instability and runoff dynamics, including extreme \nevents in historical data,\
    \ a large number of models cannot \n * Babak Mohammadi \n \nbabak.mohammadi@nateko.lu.se\n\

    \ Schumann 2020). \nBecause of these limitations, researchers prefer to study\
    \ and \ndevelop more robust and general models to improve perfor-\nmance using\
    \ available historical data. Besides, researchers \nmust consider the benefits\
    \ of complex and rapidly evolving \ncomputing power that can enhance modeling\
    \ methods and \nthreshold accuracy in hydrological forecasting applications. \n\
    In addition, the researchers also applied complex modeling \ntheorems and newly\
    \ developed ML approaches (Oppel and \nSchumann 2020; Tripathy and Schwefel 1982).\n\
    For instance, Mohammadi et al. (2020a) showed ML \nmodels have excellent performance\
    \ for simulating stream-\nflow time series in four rivers in Canada and the United\
    \ \nStates. They implemented four different types of data-\ndriven models by the\
    \ name of bi-linear, multi-layer percep-\ntron (MLP), MLP coupled by particle\
    \ swarm optimization \n(MLP-PSO), and MLP-PSO coupled with the multi-verse \n\
    optimizer (MLP-PSOMVO). Their results ranged R2 \nbetween 0.90 to 0.99, and they\
    \ resulted in ML models can \nunderstand SF phoneme, and then they can have a\
    \ suitable \nrunoff simulation. Tikhamarine et al. (2020a) compared \nsome different\
    \ types of ML models, including, MLP, and \nLeast Squares Support Vector Machine\
    \ (LSSVM), and \nMLP and LSSVM integrated with PSO and Harris Hawks \nOptimization\
    \ (HHO) optimization algorithms. They pre-\nsented the best results were related\
    \ to LSSVM–HHO and \nLSSVM–PSO by NS = 0.737. Safari et al. (2020) employed \n\
    Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RRKHS), radial basic \nfunction (RBF), and Multivariate\
    \ adaptive regression splines \n(MARS) approach for streamflow simulating in the\
    \ Haldizen \nwatershed (Turkey). They reported the RRKHS had the best \nperformance\
    \ by NS = 0.944 for runoff modeling. Some of \nreviewed articles provided by Table 1.\n\
    In the past two decades, the motivation for applying \nmachine learning techniques\
    \ to predict river flow (stream-\nflow) has attracted significant attention to\
    \ hydrology (Jothip-\nrakash and Magar 2012; Kentel 2009; Terzi and Ergin 2014;\
    \ \nValipour and Montazar 2012a, b). Machine learning has \nmade big changes in\
    \ hydrological forecasting issues and han-\ndling the complexity of missing data\
    \ issues in hydrological \nscience (Wen et al. 2019). ML-based methods such as\
    \ opti-\nmization algorithms, logical methods, classification meth-\nods, statistical\
    \ learning methods and probability methods \nare widely used. The three subcategories\
    \ of machine learn-\ning are particularly widely used in the hydrology and runoff\
    \ \nfields: (i) adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) \n(Jang 1993), (ii)\
    \ artificial neural networks (ANN) (Haykin \n2004), and (iii) support vector machine\
    \ (SVM) (Cortes and \nVapnik 1995).\nIn hydrological research, the most widely\
    \ used ML meth-\nods are ANFIS, ANN, and SVM models. The current study \nfocuses\
    \ on reviewing journal articles with high impact fac-\ntors written about runoff\
    \ modeling in different worldwide \ncase studies. Also, this study seeks to provide\
    \ the advantages \nand disadvantages of mentioned models in different regions.\
    \ \nThe schematic flowchart of current research is shown in \nFig. 1.\nRainfall–runoff\
    \ modeling via machine \nlearning\nApplication of the ANFIS in runoff simulation\n\
    This method was developed first in 1993 by Jang (1993). \nDifferent researchers\
    \ have developed various methods/mod-\nels to simulate precipitation and runoff\
    \ processes, so reliable \nmodels suitable for effective planning and management\
    \ of \ncatchment areas must be selected. ANFIS is one of these \npopular methods,\
    \ and it is a type of artificial neural network \nbased on the Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy\
    \ system. Figure 2 shows \nthe structure of the ANFIS model.\nThe aim of creating\
    \ a model has always been for maxi-\nmizing its application, for having a high\
    \ accuracy result and \novercoming the complexity of the modeling process. Gener-\n\
    ally considering the greater uncertainty is a reason for reduc-\ning the complexity\
    \ of the model and increase the robustness \nof the model. Zadeh (1965) introduced\
    \ a fuzzy set theory, \nthe main advantage of applying this theory is that it\
    \ allows \nhaving a minimum uncertainty of modeling process. This \nwas done by\
    \ looking at input variables related to prefer-\nences to make the modeling unique,\
    \ or by looking at interval \ndata rather than input variables in the form of\
    \ complex data \nto make the modeling more explicit (Wedding 1997). They \nexist\
    \ because of the ambiguity and inaccuracy of the system \ninput data (Kreinovich\
    \ et al. 2000).\nThe fuzzy theory has been widely used for improving \naccuracy\
    \ of runoff modeling process in various studies. In \nanother study by Chang and\
    \ Chen (2001), they considered a \ntype of the fuzzy network, which was a combined\
    \ approach \nvia fuzzy system and ANN (namely, CFNN). This model \n(CFNN) was\
    \ employed for developing some hydrological \nmodels and it created a rainfall-based\
    \ model for predicting \nthe amount of streamflow. The form of triangular was\
    \ used \nas a membership function for the original CFNN, which is \nreplaced by\
    \ the Gaussian function in this study. Understand-\ning and predicting hourly\
    \ runoff successfully was the biggest \nadvantage of the proposed model (Chang\
    \ and Chen 2001).\nThe ANFIS model is also widely used for runoff mod-\neling;\
    \ for example: El-Shafie et al. (2007) developed \nthe ANFIS model. It is recommended\
    \ to forecast the \nmonthly runoff (El-Shafie et al. 2007). The characteristic\
    \ \nof the ANFIS model is that it can handle the inaccuracy \nand uncertainty\
    \ in the input of the streamflow database, \nbecause the input data can be split\
    \ by a fuzzy subspace \nand into a linear function for predicting streamflow.\

    \ \nrainfall–runoff method, because HIS proved it can be imple-\nmented by minimum\
    \ required parameters in the minimum \ntime (Nayak et al. 2007). Özger (2009)\
    \ simulated the run-\noff time series with Takagi Sugeno Fuzzy Inference System\
    \ \n(TS). The TS rule was based on a set of linear functions for \nrunoff forecasting.\
    \ All the uncertainty and complexity of \nthe proposed model were considered in\
    \ the TS relationship \nfunction, the correlation between the observation and\
    \ the \nprediction values was acceptable (Özger 2009).\nBecause of the complexity\
    \ and the non-linearity behav-\nior of the runoff phenomenon and also, due to\
    \ the lack of \nsuitable historical data in all regions, it is difficult to model\
    \ \nthe required runoff with physics-based models. Pramanik \nand Panda (2009)\
    \ studied two machine learning methods \n(ANFIS and ANN) that use upstream flow\
    \ data to esti-\nmate downstream flows. For evaluating the performance \nof ANFIS\
    \ and ANN, the daily runoff from the reservoir \nupstream of the dam was used.\
    \ Two methods are used to \nevaluate models with different input combinations\
    \ to obtain \nthe best accuracy of runoff modeling. The importance of \ntwo upstream\
    \ tributaries in assessing dam runoff was also \nevaluated. Studies have shown\
    \ that the performance of the \nconjugate neural gradient network is better than\
    \ the Leven-\nberg–Marquardt and gradient descent algorithms and ANFIS \nshowed\
    \ it could have more accurately runoff estimation in \noutlier data conditions\
    \ (Pramanik and Panda 2009).\nKatambara and Ndiritu (2010) reported a hybrid con-\n\
    cept fuzzy inference model to simulate the streamflow in \nthe South Africa. The\
    \ development of the fuzzy concept \nhybrid model successfully applied for simulating\
    \ dynamic \nbehavior of streamflow. The study described developing a \nhybrid\
    \ model of fuzzy calibration concepts and examined \nits ability to reproduce\
    \ natural and human processes. The \nperformance of this model proved  a satisfactory result\
    \ about \nmodeling of hydrological system complexity and its impact \non daily\
    \ streamflow. The performance of streamflow simula-\ntion in the downstream direction\
    \ was improved, and an inde-\npendent process fuzzy model was successfully implemented.\
    \ \nThe conclusion showed that for complex river systems with \na lack of data,\
    \ the fuzzy concept hybrid model can be used as \nan capable machine learning model\
    \ for reliable streamflow \nsimulation and operation analysis (Katambara and Ndiritu\
    \ \n2010).\nSanikhani and Kisi (2012) developed two different \nANFIS models for\
    \ simulating monthly streamflow values. \nFirst, two types of ANFIS models were\
    \ proposed in the men-\ntioned study, namely ANFIS with sub-clusters (ANFISSC)\
    \ \nand ANFIS with separated grids (ANFISGP). Both proposed \napproaches were\
    \ used to predict the flow rate 1 month in \nadvance, and the impact of periodicity\
    \ on the model's pre-\ndiction performance is examined. Another step of this study\
    \ \nevaluated the effectiveness of the ANFIS method in assess-\ning the flow rate.\
    \ The results show that the ANFISSC model \nis slightly better in predicting rivers.\
    \ ANFISGP model (San-\nikhani and Kisi 2012). Greco (2012) studied the gradual\
    \ \npattern of the spread of runoff process on a daily scale. The \nmentioned\
    \ study employed a hybrid of the autoregressive \n(AR) model and via the fuzzy\
    \ inference system. The AR \nmodel is specifically used to identify the mainstream,\
    \ and \na set of fuzzy rules is determined based on the knowledge \nof the basic\
    \ physical characteristics of the rainfall process, \nwhich limits the number\
    \ of relevant parameters of the model. \nThe daily inflow into the catchment area\
    \ after 5 days is cal-\nculated based on the weighted average of the precipitation\
    \ \ndata of six rain gauges distributed in the catchment area, \nwhich are collected\
    \ every day or more than 5 days. The \nmissing values for precipitation time series\
    \ data were filled \nby resetting the precipitation recorded during several obser-\n\
    vation months, resulting in wrong runoff peak times. The \nresults showed that\
    \ the introduced approach had a suitable \nperformance in runoff simulating for\
    \ both minimum and \nmaximum water level conditions. The results prove that it\
    \ \nis not a residual analysis of white noise, indicating that the \nmodel does\
    \ not fully identify the causal relationship between \nrainfall and runoff (Greco\
    \ 2012).\nAccording to a review article on using the ANFIS meth-\nods to predict\
    \ runoff, the fuzzy inference system is used \nbecause it can handle missing data and\
    \ complex data that \ncharacterize the runoff time series. It is difficult to\
    \ describe \naccurately, so an approximation method (fuzzy set) was \nproposed\
    \ for obtaining a reasonable result in runoff mod-\neling. In addition, several\
    \ studies stated that the advantages \nof ANFIS allowed them to have a high accuracy\
    \ result for \nrunoff modeling in different time scales.\nApplication of ANN in runoff\
    \ simulation\nThe ANN is a large-scale distributed parallel information \nanalyzing\
    \ theory, which has some performance character-\nistics similar to the human brain\
    \ biological neural network \n(Haykin 2004). It is inspired by human cognition\
    \ and neu-\nrobiology by a mathematical model, ANNs are technologi-\ncally advanced,\
    \ and they can do lots of huge computing \nin minimum time. The base of ANN’s\
    \ structure follows \nsome rules: (i) exchanging of information occurs in the\
    \ \nindependent elements by the name of neurons, (ii) signals \nare transmitted\
    \ between neurons via the transfer functions, \n(iii) every transform function\
    \ corresponds to the weight \nrepresenting its adhesive strength, and (iv) each\
    \ neuron \nusually employees for a non-linear transfer function to \nits network\
    \ input for determining the output. Generally, \nan artificial neural network\
    \ consists of three parts: (a) an \ninput layer containing multiple input nodes,\
    \ (b) one or \nmore hidden layers containing trigger functions, and (c) \n \n\
    Sustainable Water Resources Management (2021) 7:98\n1 3\n98 \nPage 6 of 11\nmultiple\
    \ output layer nodes. The current is modeled using \nforward feedback (FFBP),\
    \ RBF, and generalized regres-\nsion neural network (GRNN) algorithms. FFBP is\
    \ argu-\nably the most widely used ANN for engineering problems \nregarded as\
    \ non-linear general approximations (Hornik \net al. 1989). Figure 3 shows the\
    \ ordinary ANN’s structure.\nA new dynamic ANN method developed by Chiang \net al.\
    \ (2004) simulated rainfall–runoff by the impact of \ntime dimension on the dataset.\
    \ The proposed method has \na profound effect on network learning. They compared\
    \ the \nevaluation results of the dynamic ANN with an ordinary \nstatic ANN. The\
    \ proposed method showed a more stable \ninput current prediction and positive\
    \ performance than \nstatic ANN. Furthermore, the repetitive real-time learn-\n\
    ing algorithm helped for updating the ANN again and \nagain for the training phase,\
    \ which had advantages when \nrecording time changes in the process of rainfall–runoff\
    \ \nmodeling (Chiang et al. 2004). Cigizoglu (2005) reported \nan investigation\
    \ on the effectiveness of GRNN for daily \nrunoff modeling. Cigizoglu used GRNN\
    \ as a boosting \ntool for enhancing ability of ordinary FFBP. GRNN can \nhandle\
    \ the local minimum problem, and it was a suitable \nboosting approach for improving\
    \ the accuracy of runoff \nprediction. This is because GRNN predictions are limited\
    \ \nto the extreme values of the observation, which prevents \nthe training of\
    \ network for providing predictions that are \nphysically impossible (Cigizoglu\
    \ 2005).\nTo study new measures for improving the precision of \nmachine learning-based\
    \ runoff models, Hu et al. 2005 devel-\noped the ANN by the name of target programming\
    \ neural \nnetwork for simulation of the streamflow phenomenon and it \nhas a\
    \ successful result. They did three fundamental improve-\nments: (a) Clearly integrating\
    \ the previous hydrological \nknowledge into the training of the neural network;\
    \ (b) A \nmodification on the objective function of ANN; and (c) \nReducing the\
    \ network's sensitivity to input variables errors \n(Hu et al. 2005).\nWu et al.\
    \ (2005) predicted runoff in the river basin by \napplication of a multi-layer\
    \ neural network. Two models \nhave been developed: (i) four steps ahead or 1 hour\
    \ ahead \n(with a resolution interval of 15 min) for streamflow fore-\ncasting\
    \ and (ii) flood forecasting in advance times using \nupstream station’s maximum\
    \ streamflow data. They used a \ndata set such as the precipitation with seven\
    \ lag times and \nthe streamflow data with three lag-time values to predict \n\
    the runoff in four steps (1 h with a resolution of 15 min). \nHowever, it is found\
    \ that the model's accuracy gradually \ndecreases as the number of prediction\
    \ steps increases. \nTherefore, the result of one-step prediction is more accurate\
    \ \nthan the result of two-step prediction. In addition, research \nshowed that\
    \ the proposed technique effectively solved runoff \npeak time prediction, especially\
    \ in predicting flow and water \nvolume in near real time (Wu et al. 2005).\n\
    Kişi (2007) used different ANN algorithms to exam-\nine short-term daily runoff\
    \ forecasts. Four different ANN \nalgorithms were applied on the streamflow time\
    \ series data, \nnamely backpropagation, Levenberg–Marquardt, cascade \ncorrelation,\
    \ and conjugate gradient, algorithms. The results \nshowed that the Levenberg–Marquardt\
    \ algorithm requires \nonly a small part of the time required (by minimum data\
    \ \nrequirement) for the other three algorithms to train the ANN, \nthen LM provided\
    \ a more accurate result for runoff time \nseries prediction (Kişi 2007). Jain\
    \ and Kumar (2007) devel-\noped a new coupled ANN model for having the better\
    \ train-\ning for the ordinary ANN. The proposed method includes \na general modeling\
    \ framework, which was a hybridization \nFig. 3  The structure of the \nordinary\

    Sedighi et al. (2016) employed ANN and SVM for run-\noff simulating in a snow-covered\
    \ watershed (in Iran). First, \nthey showed the machine learning model can be\
    \ used in \nsnow-covered regions by acceptable accuracy for runoff \nmodeling.\
    \ Second, they resulted in the best condition ANN \nsimulated runoff by the coefficient\
    \ of determination equal \n0.77 for validation section (Sedighi et al. 2016).\
    \ Another \nstudy was provided by Toth and Brath (2007) on the runoff \nreal-time\
    \ prediction capabilities by ANN models. Results \nof two runoff real-time simulations\
    \ showed the yield can \nbe achieved by increasing the lead time and analyzing\

    \ run-\noff). Compared with data-driven methods that focus on flood \nforecasting,\
    \ conceptual formulas can significantly improve \nforecasting, especially when\
    \ the availability of calibration \ndata is limited (Toth and Brath 2007).\nMutlu\
    \ et al. (2008) employed two different types of ANN \nmodels, namely MLP and RBF,\
    \ to predict the streamflow of \nfour different stations. Different lag times\
    \ were considered \nas input of models and compared based on their ability to\
    \ \npredict river flow. These models performed satisfactorily \nin predicting\
    \ the streamflow of several discharge stations. \nHowever, the MLP model is better\
    \ than the RBF model \n(Mutlu et al. 2008). Kagoda et al. (2010) used RBF in 2010\
    \ \nto generate a one-day runoff forecast. Because some river \nbasins may not\
    \ always have the data needed to apply many \ncomplex machine learning models\
    \ successfully. Researchers \nhave shown that depending on the situation, RBF\
    \ can more \naccurately predict the time curve area by selecting the objec-\n\
    tive function; for example, when predicting small currents is \nimportant. The\
    \ results show that artificial neural networks \ncan do a lot in predicting rivers\
    \ (Kagoda et al. 2010).\nThe ANN model and its implementation in river predic-\n\
    tion are summarized by the literature review mentioned \nabove. ANNs have some\
    \ obvious shortcomings and limi-\ntations, such as local minimums, learning rates\
    \ process, \nover-fitting problems, and trivial manual interventions such \nas\
    \ learning. However, the researchers by considering some \nANN settings can fix\
    \ all mentioned issues and have a high \naccuracy in the runoff modeling process.\n\
    Application of SVM in runoff simulation\nRecently, many researchers have explored\
    \ the ability of SVM \nin the runoff modeling process. Dibike et al. (2001) used\
    \ the \nSVM for rainfall–runoff simulation, they used the daily rain-\nfall, evapotranspiration,\
    \ and streamflow data from three dif-\nferent catchments with different precipitation\
    \ rates to obtain \nappropriate data formats for SVM and ANN. Three kinds of \n\
    kernel functions are used, namely polynomial kernel, RBF \nkernel, and neural\
    \ network kernel. In the defect detection \nprocess, the core parameters such\
    \ as the parameter ε and \nthe capacity factor C corresponding to the defect dead\
    \ zones \nare set to the optimal value. During the review period, using \nthe\
    \ average SVM method, the accuracy of runoff estimation \nwas 15% higher than\
    \ that of the ANN model. In short, they \nemphasized the difficulty in determining\
    \ the optimal value \nof the parameter C, called it a \"heuristic process\", and\
    \ sug-\ngested automating this process (Dibike et al. 2001). Figure 4 \nshows\
    \ the structure of the ordinary SVM model.\nBray and Han (2004) emphasized the\
    \ use of SVM to \ndetermine the appropriate model structure and related \nparameters\
    \ to simulate runoff. Their training and testing data \nwere compiled using rainfall\
    \ and river flow datasets from the \nBird Creek catchment area. They used scaling\
    \ factors for \nprecipitation and streamflow dataset, due the different units\
    \ \nand values in the used data. They provided a flowchart for \nthe model selection\
    \ and  modification of LIBSVM software \nto study the relationship between different\
    \ model structures, \nkernel functions (linear, polynomial, radial, and sigmoidal),\
    \ \nscaling factors, model parameters (C and epsilon), and the \nFig. 4  The structure\
    \ of the \nordinary SVM model\n \nSustainable Water Resources Management (2021)\
    \ 7:98\n1 3\n98 \nPage 8 of 11\ncomposition of the input vector (Bray and Han\
    \ 2004). The \nSVM was demonstrated for statistically reducing error \nof rainfall–runoff\
    \ modeling on the various time scales. \nThis method has been used by the Indian\
    \ Meteorological \nDepartment (IMD) and tested its effectiveness. The SVM-\nbased\
    \ seasonal downscaling (SD) model of high precipita-\ntion is developed for each\
    \ IMD, using principal components \nextracted from predictors as input, and simultaneous\
    \ obser-\nvation of precipitation in IMD as output. The performance \nof SD is\
    \ better than the traditional reduction model (Tripathi \net al. 2006). Then,\
    \ SVM-based SD is used to derive IMD’s \nfuture precipitation forecast, which\
    \ uses the second-genera-\ntion coupled global climate model (CGCM2) for statistical\
    \ \ndownscaling of artificial neural networks for climate impact \nresearches.\
    \ They concluded that SVMs were ideal for down-\nscaling problems because they\
    \ have good generalization per-\nformance in capturing the non-linear regression\
    \ relationship \nbetween measured values and predicted values, even though \n\
    SVMs do not have any physically understanding about the \nhydrological phenomenon.\
    \ Researchers have been develop-\ning many methods to simulate and predict the\
    \ streamflow \nof rivers in different regions. Therefore, it is necessary to \n\
    determine an appropriate and reliable model for proper plan-\nning of water resources\
    \ management. \nLi and Cheng (2014) used SVM, ANN, and ELM for \nstreamflow forecasting\
    \ in Manwan Reservoir (in Yunnan \nProvince of China) and Hongjiadu Reservoir\
    \ (in Guizhou \nProvince of China). They proved all three machine learning \n\
    approaches had suitable performance for streamflow fore-\ncasting, and SVM simulated\
    \ streamflow by correlation of \n0.917 in validation phase. Also, they resulted\
    \ machine learn-\ning approaches by coupling with wavelet transform can have \n\
    better streamflow simulation (Li and Cheng 2014). Asefa \net al. 2006 employed\
    \ the SVM method to perform seasonal \nand hourly predictions of streamflow on\
    \ several scales. The \nresults showed a successful ability for the SVM model\
    \ for \nmodeling water management problems. The SVM’s consid-\nered input was\
    \ much less than the physical-based model. \nIn addition, the seasonal streamflow\
    \ forecasting had been \nimproving by including meteorological variables as input\
    \ \nof models (Asefa et al. 2006).\nAs previous studies showed, the fluctuation\
    \ of the atmos-\nphere and ocean will affect the variability of rivers. There-\n\
    fore, Carrier et al. (2013) proposed a long-term traffic fore-\ncast using a data-driven\
    \ kernel-based multi-class model. \nThis study uses instruments and reconstructed\
    \ waveform \ndata in SVM. The novelty is that it improves the delay \nof flow\
    \ prediction (Carrier et al. 2013). The SVM model \ncan make suitable predictions\
    \ for selected instruments \nwithin a lead time of 1–5 years. Compared to using\
    \ a sin-\ngle swing, the use of a swing index helps to achieve higher \npredictability.\n\
    He et al. (2014) used three different types of ML-based \napproaches by the name\
    \ of ANFIS, ANN, and SVM for \nstreamflow modeling in a semi-arid climate. The\
    \ model \nexamines the various combinations of the lag times in \nstreamflow time\
    \ series data and selects the most suitable \ninput variables for the modeling\
    \ process via ML approaches. \nThe result of evaluation on performance metrics\
    \ showed that \nthe SVM model was superior in comparing to the ANN and \nANFIS\
    \ models in predicting streamflow in semi-arid areas. \nEvaluation of the various\
    \ documents on the SVM model led \nto several observations (He et al. 2014):\n\
    (i) One of the abilities of the machine learning approaches \nis that in addition\
    \ to the mean square error of the training \nsamples, it also minimizes the generalized\
    \ error of the \nmodel. (ii) According to Mercer's hypothesis, the corre-\nsponding\
    \ optimization problem is like a bulging (convex), so \nthere is no local minimum.\
    \ (iii) A large number of research-\ners reported that the RBF is the most suitable\
    \ kernel func-\ntion. The reasons are as follows: First, the adjustment param-\n\
    eters of RBF kernel are less than the sigmoid and polynomial \nkernels, which\
    \ increases the complexity of model selection. \nCapture the situation where the\
    \ relationship between class \nlabels and attributes is non-linear rather than\
    \ linear kernel. \nThird, the RBF kernel usually works well under the general\
    \ \nsmoothing assumption. (iv) Generally, SVM is more suit-\nable for long-term\
    \ runoff simulation than short-term runoff \nsimulation. This shows the SVM approach\
    \ potency and pos-\nsibility to define hydrological time series analysis with\
    \ the \nnon-linear factors.\nConclusion\nStreamflow simulation is essential for\
    \ hydrological studies, \nirrigation management, environmental sustainability,\
    \ water \nresources planning and management. Due to the dynamic \nbehavior of\
    \ streamflow and its interaction with other hydro-\nlogical variables, streamflow\
    \ modeling process needs a \nmodel that can understand these nonlinear complexities\
    \ \nwell. So, researchers have been focusing on developing the \nmodel that can\
    \ overcome the complexities of the hydro-\nlogical cycle (like ML approaches).\
    \ Then, this study tried \nto analyze the applications of machine learning for\
    \ runoff \nmodeling based on literature reviews. The ML method is \npresented\
    \ as a powerful tool to provide evidence for runoff \nmodeling in different regions\
    \ with high accuracy. This study \nevaluated literature reviews on the application\
    \ of ANFIS, \nANN, and SVM for the runoff time series forecasting on \nunder different\
    \ climate effects. Other available climatic vari-\nables (i.e., precipitation)\
    \ and the lag times (delay) of runoff \ntime series were used as the inputs of\
    \ predictors models. \nAnother purpose of this study was to consider ordinary\
    \ \nML models used in different climate conditions for runoff \nSustainable Water\
    \ Resources Management (2021) 7:98 \n1 3\nPage 9 of 11 \n98\nsimulating, for finding\
    \ possible alternatives for runoff mod-\neling in various climates. The modeling\
    \ process via ML has \na huge impact on various factors that affect modeling per-\n\
    formance. One of the most important of them is that deter-\nmining effective input\
    \ parameters as the key elements to \nachieve optimal performance of ML models.\
    \ In addition, \nthe reviewed articles also showed an overview of optimiza-\n\
    tion algorithms that are combined with ML models to form \nhybrid models with\
    \ high accuracy. This study recommends \nthat future potential researchers use\
    \ the newly developed \noptimization algorithms for optimizing the ability of\
    \ ML \nmodels. Several examples in this study demonstrated the \nprediction, classification,\
    \ and regression capabilities of ML \nrelated to runoff modeling problems. These\
    \ examples also \nshowed that the non-linear nature of ML should be used \nwith\
    \ caution, as this can lead to over-fitting problems. The \nresults of the literature\
    \ reviewed here indicate that ML has \nmany uses in computational hydrology (especially\
    \ in runoff \nforecasting). Future researchers can conduct research based \non\
    \ this framework to develop some new hybrid mechanisms \nand extend machine learning\
    \ technology to overcome the \ncomplexity of hydrological predictions. The machine\
    \ learn-\ning model can provide higher accuracy prediction for runoff \nsimulation, and\
    \ making ML as an efficient tool for water \nresources management. Future potential\
    \ researchers can use \nhybrid-based models via hydrological and ML models for\
    \ \nusing advantages of physical-based and ML-based models \nfor runoff simulation\
    \ studies.\nFunding Open access funding provided by Lund University.\nOpen Access\

    \ economical ways of irrigation have build up to fulﬁll the sweet water requirements\
    \ for the habitants of\nthis world. In other words, water consumption should be\
    \ frugal enough to save restricted sweet water resources. Te major portion\nof\
    \ water was wasted due to incompetent ways of irrigation. We utilized a smart\
    \ approach professionally capable of using ontology\nto make 50% of the decision,\
    \ and the other 50% of the decision relies on the sensor data values. Te decision\
    \ from the ontology and\nthe sensor values collectively become the source of the\
    \ ﬁnal decision which is the result of a machine learning algorithm (KNN).\nMoreover,\
    \ an edge server is introduced between the main IoT server and the GSM module.\
    \ Tis method will not only avoid the\noverburden of the IoTserver for data processing\
    \ but also reduce the latency rate. Tis approach connects Internet of Tings with\
    \ a\nnetwork of sensors to resourcefully trace all the data, analyze the data\
    \ at the edge server, transfer only some particular data to the\nmain IoT server\
    \ to predict the watering requirements for a ﬁeld of crops, and display the result\
    \ by using an android\napplication edge.\n1. Introduction\nAgriculture is the\
    \ major resource of living wage in Pakistan.\nA smart, intelligent, and fully\
    \ automated agricultural system\nwas required and extremely desirable in some\
    \ last decades\nwhen our population grew exponentially in comparison to\nthe natural\
    \ resources we have in our country, Pakistan. For\nthis purpose, an IoT-based\
    \ smart watering system has been\nachieved in the recent years of constant threat\
    \ of losing\nwater. Tis agricultural industry has two particulars. Te\nplastic\
    \ tunnel farming is divided into low, high, and walk-in\ntunnels. It is convenient\
    \ to sow, spray, and harvest in the\nhigh tunnel than in low and walk-in tunnels\
    \ due to its\nbroader size. Traditional farming, on the contrary, is the\nmost\
    \ unpredictable and becomes the cause of more water\nwastage. Te issue we are\
    \ going to deal with in this paper\nregarding smart irrigation is any application\
    \ designed and\nused for the smart watering system still needs to be more\neﬃcient\
    \ and timely. Technically, it means that just cloud\ncomputing is not enough for\
    \ a large-scale IoT application.\nTere should be something like more eﬃcient and\
    \ fast\napplication using a better architecture to handle diﬀerent\ntypes of data\
    \ coming from diﬀerent sources (sensors). Te\nmain purpose of a quick and smart\
    \ irrigation system is the\nconsumption of water so frugally to execute the need\
    \ of\nwater more timely for a ﬁeld of plants and to save inadequate\nsweet water\
    \ reservoirs. To handle this rigorous matter, many\nsensor-based smart irrigation\
    \ systems with their mobile\napplications have been designed in diﬀerent times,\
    \ but still,\nthere is a question on their reliability when data grow and\nthus\
    \ the latency rate of IoTdevices. Like in preceding papers,\nthe input parameters\
    \ humidity, temperature, soil moisture,\nand light intensity were used, and a\
    \ decision of watering\nplants or not was made on the basis of a fuzzy logic [1].\
    \ Te\nsame fuzzy logic has been applied to many healthcare sys-\ntems, in which\
    \ use of biosensors helped monitoring tem-\nperature, blood pressure, oxygen,\
    \ and infection status of the\nwound [2]. Similarly, in ﬁre alarming applications,\
    \ this\nHindawi\nComplexity\nVolume 2021, Article ID 6691571, 16 pages\nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2021/6691571\n\
    technology helped a lot in 2018 [3] and 2019 [4]. Now, we\ncome up with a new\
    \ technology that is the combination of\nmachine learning technique and semantics\
    \ for some input\nparameters such as climate type, crop type, and soil type with\n\
    the sensors’ output: temperature, humidity, and soil\nmoisture.\nA smart irrigation\
    \ system with the application of edge\ncomputing is required because the research\
    \ studies on ir-\nrigation systems until now are not much eﬃcient that they\n\
    could not be implemented on large-scale systems and have\nless eﬃciency due to\
    \ overburdenized sensors for all sensing\ndata. So, a new intelligent and smart\
    \ system should be\ndesigned.\nOur research found some grounds due to which\n\
    improvements in the existing system are mandatory:\n(i) Existing smart irrigation\
    \ systems either spotlighting\non lesser parameters like soil moisture, air moisture/\n\
    humidity or they are presenting a fuzzy logic\n(implemented in matlab) to produce\
    \ an output\ndecision or some are using simple machine learning\nalgorithm to\
    \ predict about water need for plants. A\nsystem which does not encounter the\
    \ latency rate\ncannot provide the reliable solution.\n(ii) Skipping important\
    \ parameters such as soil strata\nand crop type can lead to an imperfect watering\n\
    system for plants.\n(iii) Unwanted data loading on the IoT server due to\ncontinuous\
    \ throw of sensor data becomes a cause of\nless eﬃciency of the IoT server. An\
    \ intelligent ir-\nrigation system should never halt due to overburden\nof data.\n\
    (iv) As newest expertise has come into sight due to\nprogression in each and every\
    \ ﬁeld, therefore, we\nalso have to change our classical method of irri-\ngation\
    \ to advanced, smart, and perfect and simple\nknowledge database for plant’s data\
    \ to powerful\nontology-based semantics.\nTere are some main aspects, which we\
    \ are going to\nconcentrate on in our anticipated approach:\n(i) Tree sensors\
    \ are used in our approach: a soil\nmoisture sensor, humidity and temperature\
    \ sensor,\nand light sensor. Furthermore, ontology is used for\nplant species\
    \ data, diﬀerent soil types, and diﬀerent\nclimate types.\n(ii) Tis approach focuses\
    \ on an intelligent technique,\ni.e., machine learning, to decide watering require-\n\
    ments for a particular plant, and by considering\nmany other suitable parameters\
    \ for the plant\ngrowth, i.e., climate, weather, and soil type, we are\ngoing\
    \ to design a smart irrigation system in a dif-\nferent and more eﬃcient way.\n\
    (iii) Our proposed smart system by design focuses on\nsystem reliability as if\
    \ a sensor for some reason is not\nworking at a particular time and was working\
    \ an\nhour before, then the value it measured before an\nhour will be used by\
    \ our trained model to produce\nthe result because no drastic change can occur\
    \ in\nother parameters in just an hour. It makes our\nsystem user friendly and\
    \ more eﬃcient.\n(iv) Te proposed approach is structured to come upon\nthe problems\
    \ of the obsolete irrigation method\nsmartly.\n2. Related Works\nTraditional tunnel\
    \ farms, all over the world, use drip irri-\ngation or a sprinkler irrigation\
    \ method. Tese are better than\nnormal ﬂooding methods. Various irrigation methods\n\
    provide diﬀerent water consumption levels and energy\ncompetence [5]. Te surface\
    \ irrigation and level irrigation\nmethods provide low water and energy eﬃciency.\
    \ Te\nsubirrigation, overhead irrigation, and sprinkler irrigation\nmethods provide\
    \ low-to-medium eﬃciency. Te sprinkler\nand drip irrigation methods provide similar\
    \ energy eﬃ-\nciency, but drip irrigation is more water eﬃcient than\nsprinkler\
    \ irrigation [6].\nTo increase crop production and decrease costs eﬃ-\nciently,\
    \ the management of freshwater smartly is indis-\npensable. Te powerful use of\
    \ technologies provides the\nprecise amount of water required for plants. Te SWAMP\n\
    project [7] in Europe has developed an IoT-based smart\nwater management platform\
    \ for ideal irrigation with a\nproactive approach on four pilots in Brazil and\
    \ Europe. Te\nSWAMP\narchitecture,\nthe\nplatform,\nand\nthe\nsystem\ndeployed\
    \ presented by the European people include a\nperformance analysis of FIWARE components.\
    \ Tey aim to\nreengineer some of its components to provide greater\nscalability\
    \ by using less number of computational assets.\nTe amount of land irrigated in\
    \ the US is approximately\nthe same as their farmers used to irrigate ten years\
    \ earlier,\nbut the important thing is water they are using nowadays for\nthis\
    \ purpose is quite less than previously used. Tey are\ngrowing plenty of fruits,\
    \ vegetables, nuts, and whole grains\nthat fulﬁll their inhabitant’s requirements\
    \ whole year. Two\ntypes of irrigation traditional technologies have been used\
    \ in\nthe US since 2013 [8]. First one is used in the gravity systems;\nit makes\
    \ up 35 to 42% of irrigation systems in the United\nStates. It delivers water\
    \ from its source to a crop area by\nﬂooding through land-forming measures, including\
    \ canals,\nwaterways, basins, and furrows. Examples are the furrow\nsystem\ncontrolled\n\
    ﬂooding\nsystems\nand\nuncontrolled\nﬂooding systems. Te second type of irrigation\
    \ technology is\nused by the pressure systems. In pressure systems, tubing or\n\
    pipes are used to pump water, and irrigation is done through\nan applicator such\
    \ as a sprinkler or perforated pipe.\nChina’s development has been aﬀected by\
    \ three major\nissues regarding agriculture, landscape, and farmers [9]. Te\n\
    solution to these glitches is agricultural transformation.\nTough this transformation\
    \ is not so easy and quick, in-\ntroducing the cloud computing with Internet of\
    \ Tings to\ntheir agriculture is going to help them in solving the issue.\nHowever,\
    \ cloud computing, IoT, and SOA technologies, are\nhelping in the they have built\
    \ huge data involved agricultural\nharvesting. Cloud computing is linked to IoT,\
    \ and both\n2\nComplexity\ncollectively can enhance the agricultural production\
    \ to solve\nthe matters regarding agriculture, landscape, and farmers.\nIn India,\
    \ diﬀerent traditional methods are designed and\napplied regionally in India over\
    \ the past decades to cope up\nthe necessities of their people in a sustainable\
    \ way. Te three\nirrigation methods that exist in India are diversion channels,\n\
    small-scale water bodies such as tanks to store rainwater, and\nwells to collect\
    \ groundwater. Tese methods are for small-\nscale as well as large-scale applications.\
    \ As the population of\nIndia is increased enough, the needs on the water increase\n\
    for various drives such as irrigation, domestic, hydroelec-\ntricity, industrial,\
    \ mining, and regeneration. However, India\nhas the largest irrigated area in\
    \ the whole world, and the\nirrigated area is only about 40% of the cropped area\
    \ [10].\nOne of the main reasons for this low irrigated land is the\nmajor use\
    \ of traditional irrigation methods, which leads to\nlow water use eﬃciency of\
    \ about 35–40% [11].\nTe use of traditional methods without the reach of cloud\n\
    computing and edge computing causes the unstable watering\nsystem for the plants.\
    \ Consequently, a well-organized and\njudicious watering system is the major intention.\
    \ During\nsome last decades, irrigation systems with the use of some\nsensor networks\
    \ with diﬀerent IoT approaches are initiated\nwhich basically provides the solution\
    \ but still they need some\nimprovements. Table 1 shows their water-saving percentages,\n\
    techniques used by them, and the sensors used by them.\nIn 2008, Bernard used\
    \ the rain sensor and estimated the\neminence of pasture with and without the\
    \ sensor. He tried to\nﬁgure out irrigation water use. He experienced common\n\
    Bermuda grass to achieve 34% water saving. Xiao et al. [13] self-\ndesigned the\
    \ sensor network for the irrigation system, and they\nachieved water saving of\
    \ about 65.22%. Dukes [20] described\nthat water saving of about 40% to 70% can\
    \ be achieved by using\nsmart controllers but for real-world scenarios of bigger\
    \ ﬁelds;\nthis value can be lessened to 10% [19].\nGuti´errez et al. [14] designed\
    \ and tried to implement a\nmechanized irrigation system to use water eﬃciently.\
    \ Tey\nused a wireless network of some sensors to manage water\nsaving of about\
    \ 90% as compared to conventional irrigation\nmethods. Similarly, Kumar et al.\
    \ [5] presented a similar work in\nthe same year and Parameswaran and Sivaprasath\
    \ [6] and\nRawal [16] latterly introduced a few similar sensor-based so-\nlutions.\
    \ Nelson in 2015 used a few sensor data such as tem-\nperature and soil moisture\
    \ and WSAN to automate the\nirrigation process with decreased water consumption.\
    \ Saab\net al. [17] tried and thrived an on-ﬁeld survey of a smart phone\nirrigation\
    \ setting up. He investigated and tested that application\nin Mediterranean environments\
    \ achieved 25% of water saving.\nRecently, another input to these contributions\
    \ was made by\nSaqib (2020), i.e., a network system for the HC12 module is\nintended\
    \ to improve the communication range.\n3. Architecture of the Proposed System\n\
    Te anticipated irrigation system is entrenched with the\npotential smart decisions\
    \ taking capability to water plants\nby considering the factors such as crop type,\
    \ soil type,\nclimate type, temperature, humidity, and soil moisture.\nOntology\
    \ is implanted to query about the decision for a\nparticular plant type, climate\
    \ type, and soil type, while\nremaining factors such as temperature, humidity,\
    \ and soil\nmoisture are sensed by our sensor network. Final decision\nfor watering\
    \ plants or not relies 50% on the ontology result,\nand the other 50% is based\
    \ on our trained machine learning\nmodel. Te smart architecture of our watering\
    \ system is\ngiven in Figure 1.\nOur proposed architecture of IoT has four layers,\
    \ appli-\ncation layer, processing layer, transport layer, and the per-\nception\
    \ layer, rather than basic IoTarchitecture which consists\nof three layers (application\
    \ layer, network layer, and perception\nlayer). Te perception layer is known as\
    \ the physical layer,\nwhich means it has sensors for assembling data. It senses\n\
    temperature, soil moisture, and humidity from air. Te\ntransport layer is the\
    \ source of transferring sensed data col-\nlected previously to the processing\
    \ layer through networks such\nas wireless, 2G, 3G, and LAN. Te processing layer\
    \ stores,\nscrutinizes, and processes huge amounts of data coming from\nthe transport\
    \ layer. It utilizes technologies such as databases,\ncloud computing, and edge\
    \ computing. Te application layer is\nfor providing application-speciﬁc services\
    \ to the end user. Our\nsystem deals with the sensors, GSM module, edge server+IoT\n\
    server, and additionally an android application. Tese are the\nperception layer,\
    \ transport layer, processing layer (cloud\ncomputing and intelligent computing),\
    \ and the application\nlayer, respectively.\n3.1. Sensor Data. At ﬁrst, data are\
    \ gathered by the sensors as\npresented in Figure 2. Soil moisture, humidity,\
    \ and tem-\nperature data are collected in this phase. Te perception\nlayer has\
    \ all sensors, actuators, and the microcontroller. Rest\nis the part of remaining\
    \ three layers. Transport and pro-\ncessing layers collectively provide schedule\
    \ for watering\ncrops, their supervision, and other suggestions. After\ngathering\
    \ the data, the next stage is to accumulate data at\ndata centers for analyses.\n\
    Te detailed design inspection of the physical components\nused is presented in\
    \ the ﬁgure. All the components are with no\ntrouble available in the market and\
    \ cheap also. So, the device to\nbe deployed in the real environment can be made\
    \ easily\navailable. Tis implantable device has the layer of sensors used,\ni.e.,\
    \ humidity, light, and moisture sensors. Te microcontroller\nﬁxed in the Arduino\
    \ board receives the analog signals from\nthese sensors, and after every 30 seconds,\
    \ these values are\ntransferred to the data center through GSM module SIM808.\n\
    Te ﬁnal results from our decision-making process can be\nvisualized by the user\
    \ all the way through an android appli-\ncation, after which the user can direct\
    \ our system’s actuators,\nand ﬁnally, water is released from the valve or closed.\n\
    Te next section briefs the working of our ML smart\ndecision system deployed at\
    \ the IoT server which speedily\ntimetables the watering plan for plants. Tis\
    \ setting up also\nevolves the soil type, climate type, and crop type. In our\n\

    (SDM) is designed for incorporating and handling of the real-\nworld data. In\
    \ the semantic data model, the logical levels are\napplied for the categorizing\
    \ of concepts and evaluation of the\ninformation. On the basis of the results\
    \ extracted from prop-\nositional logic systems set in the ontology, one can make\
    \ a smart\ndecision.\nTere are concepts in our ontology to make prediction of\n\
    the level of water need on the basis of crop type, climate type,\nand soil type.\
    \ Tese parameters collectively constitute the\nstructured data that why we can\
    \ query decision on their bases\nfrom the given ontology. Te sensed data and the\
    \ decision\nresulted in SPARQL (RDF query language) together comprise\nthe full\
    \ ground vital to make a watering system run. For in-\nstance, if, due to the\
    \ climate type and soil strata type, a par-\nticular plant requires water, it\
    \ would be contingent to water the\nplant. Tis action of watering crops is the\
    \ consequence of the\nactuation that is performed on the valve. Likewise, it could\
    \ be\nturned oﬀ as directed by the ﬁeld speciﬁcation.\nSensor data are pulled\
    \ together at diﬀerent levels of a\nlarge area. Te observed properties or the\
    \ sensed data such as\ntemperature, humidity, and luminance are measured at the\n\
    yard level, while soil moisture (superﬁcial and deep) is\nmeasured at the quadrant\
    \ level. Tese data in the form of\nRDF and the desired knowledge (crop species,\
    \ climate types,\nand soil types) from ontology are sent to the control agent.\n\
    Te control agent also receives data about plant requirement\nfor quantity of water\
    \ in speciﬁc soil texture.\nTe ontology on which our system depends is vast and\n\
    complex due to the wide range of factors/features engaged in\ntaking decision\
    \ for watering plants or not (Appendix A). An\nabstract view of ontology is shown\
    \ in Figure 3. Tere are\ndiﬀerent climate zones of Pakistan, and they are distin-\n\
    guished into four diﬀerent types such as highland zone, arid\nzone, lowland zone,\
    \ and coastal zone. As the humidity level\nis diverse in diverse areas, irrigation\
    \ in these climatic zones\nhas wide-ranging water needs.\nIn addition to temperature\
    \ and humidity, another fea-\nture, soil type, also inﬂuences the level of water\
    \ need to be\ngiven. Te clay which is known as well-drained like loamy\nsoils\
    \ is the excellent soil type for wheat [21]. Tere are four to\nﬁve diﬀerent types\
    \ of soil considering their structure and\ntexture. In the same way, each crop\
    \ has its some speciﬁc\nwater needs as some require more water such as sugarcane\n\
    and rice than others such as wheat and cotton.\nTe architecture of our decision\
    \ support system is shown\nin Figure 4. Te information about crop types is giving\
    \ the\nwatering requirements of the crop by utilizing plant on-\ntology. Ten,\
    \ data sensed from pasture/crop land, soil type,\nand climate type is used for\
    \ depiction on the actual watering\nsupplies for the ﬁeld. Water instructions\
    \ or suggestions will\nbe shown as recommendations on the mobile phone via an\n\
    android app, and as a resultant of a button click from the\nfarmer’s smart phone,\
    \ actuations will be executed on the\nvalves positioned in the ﬁeld.\n3.3. Used\
    \ Analysis Technique. Water requirement level can\nbe predicted by any machine\
    \ learning approach such as\nrandom forest, decision trees, KNN, naive Bayes,\
    \ and\nsupport vector machine as all of these are classiﬁcation\ndilemma-handling\
    \ algorithms. Te modeling practice we are\nusing lies underneath supervised machine\
    \ learning, known\nas KNN (with k \x88 5). It uses the whole dataset to predict\
    \ an\nunseen data instance. It searches through the whole dataset\nto ﬁnd “k”\
    \ number of neighbors which are the most close\nneighbors to that data instance.\
    \ Tis is done by actually\nﬁnding the correspondence between the instance data\
    \ with\nthe whole dataset, where “k” is the number of neighbors\nfound closer\
    \ to instant data. If the value of “k” is set to 3, then\nthree most similar neighbors\
    \ will take part in assigning class\nlabel to instant data. It then allocates\
    \ the most common class\nlabel (among those k-training instances) to the test\
    \ data.\nShemim et al. utilized three feature selection algorithms,\nCBFS, FPRS,\
    \ and KFRS, for the dataset, and then KNN is\nused to classify featured classes\
    \ [21]. Bzdok et al. also dis-\ncussed about supervised learning algorithms including\
    \ KNN\nin 2018 [22].\n3.3.1. Algorithm for KNN\nStep 1: calculate the Euclidean\

    \ Proposed Architecture\nOur system to be implemented uses an Arduino UNO\n(ATmega328P)\
    \ controller. Te data sensed by the sensors\n(perception layer) are received by\
    \ the microcontroller, they\nare transferred to the edge server (1st processing\
    \ layer) via\nGSM SIM808 (transport layer), in which basic scrutiny\noccurs, and\
    \ just the immediate data required to predict the\nresultant water level are transferred\
    \ to the main IoT server\nComplexity\n5\n(2nd processing layer) where our trained\
    \ machine learning\nmodel is deployed. Tis model, after detailed analysis, tells\n\
    the rank of water need for a ﬁeld. Te following section\nelaborates the hardware\
    \ setting.\n4.1.HardwareSettingfortheUser. Embedded sensors used in\nthe IoT-based\
    \ system are the source of sensing inventively\nand cost-eﬀectively, and they\
    \ can record and analyze real-\ntime data (Sarwar, Bajwa, Ramzan et al. 2018 and\
    \ Munir,\nBajwa and Cheema 2019) [23]. Te proposed smart IoT\nsystem as shown\
    \ in Figure 5 employs some sensors to gather\ndata from the environment, and a\
    \ GSM module SIM808 is\nused to transfer the values to the edge server. A data\
    \ SIM\ncard is inserted in it to get facilitated by the real-time data\ntransportation.\
    \ As we can see in Figure 6, a hygrometer\nsensor is used for soil moisture, while\
    \ for the moisture from\nair, AM2302 DHT22 (temperature/humidity) sensor is used.\n\
    Teir details are described in the following.\n4.1.1. HL-69 Soil Hygrometer Sensor.\

    \ sensor is to provide better reading than\nother soil moisture sensors. Tis sensor\
    \ is used for real-time\nmonitoring soil moisture of plants in a tunnel farm.\
    \ Te\nvoltages of the sensor output change accordingly to the water\ncontent in\
    \ the soil. Tere are some key factors of HL-69 soil\nhygrometer sensor. If soil\
    \ moisture is greater, then the\noutput voltage decreases, but if the soil is\
    \ dry, then the\noutput voltage increases. Te hygrometer soil moisture\nsensor\
    \ provides an analog signal as an output which has to be\nconverted to digital\
    \ by Arduino. Tis sensor includes two\npieces: one is an electronic board and\
    \ another one is two\npads that detect the water content. LM393 comparator chip\n\
    is located on the electronic board. Te electronic board of the\nHL-69 soil hygrometer\
    \ sensor has a ﬁxed bolt hole used for\neasy installation. It contains two lights:\
    \ red and green; red\nlight shows the power indicator, and the green light shows\n\
    the digital switching output indicator.\n4.1.2. AM2302 DHT11 Sensor. Te DHT22\
    \ sensor is a\ncommon temperature-humidity sensor that is used to de-\ntermine\
    \ temperature and humidness in air. Te DHT22\nsensors are made up of two parts:\
    \ a humidity sensor and a\nthermistor. Tere are some key factors of the DHT22\
    \ sensor\nwhich are as follows: the cost of the DHT22 sensor is low.\nDHT22 sensor\
    \ is good for 0–50% temperature readings with\n2–5% accuracy and a humidity range\
    \ from 20 to 80% with 5%\naccuracy. Te I/O voltage for the DHT22 sensor is between\n\
    3 V and 5 V. While requesting data, the maximum current use\nduring conversion\
    \ is 2.5 mA. DHT22 sensor contains 4 pins\nwith 0.1 spacing between them. Te body\
    \ size of the DHT22\nsensor is approximately 15.1 mm ∗25 mm ∗7.7 mm.\n4.1.3. BH1750\
    \ FVI Light Sensor. BH1750 is a common\ndigital light sensor that can determine\
    \ the light intensity.\nBH1750 is a calibrated digital light sensor, and it can\n\
    measure even small traces of light and can convert it into a\n16-digit numeric\
    \ value. It is commonly used in mobile\nphones to exploit the screen brightness\
    \ based on the en-\nvironmental lighting. BH1750 measures the light intensity\
    \ in\nthe range of 0 to 65,535 lux (L). In the smart irrigation\nsystem for tunnel\
    \ farming, we used the H-resolution mode\nof the BH1750 sensor. Tere are some\
    \ key factors of BH1750\nsensor which are as follows: the chip of the BH1750 sensor\
    \ is\nBH1750FVI. Te power supply of the BH1750 sensor is 3.3 V\nto 5 V. Te BH1750\
    \ sensor is a built-in 16 bit AD converter\nthat converts detection of light into\
    \ a 16-digit numeric value.\nActual watering\nrequirements\nWatering \ninstruction?\n\

    \ farming is so smart\nthat develops and employs the assistance of true decision-\n\
    making capability of machine learning. Te architecture and\nthe hardware details\
    \ of the system are given in the preceding\nsection. All the sensors (temperature\
    \ and humidity, light\nsensor, and the soil moisture sensors) were deployed to\
    \ the\nactual ﬁeld to analyze the reaction of the proposed system.\nTe data transferred\
    \ to the edge server through the GSM\nmodule and through an Android application\
    \ whereas the\nresults can also be seen by a farmer. A user can then perform\n\
    some actuation to open or close the valve.\n5.1.PreparingtheTrainingDataset. Te\
    \ system is completely\nautomated as the sensor data receiving from the ﬁeld are\n\
    processed according to our trained model of machine\nlearning, i.e., trained by\
    \ the characteristic sensor values\nshown in the following. Table 2 shows ﬁve\

    \ sensor and temperature and humidity sensed by\nAM2302 DHT22. Te output of a\
    \ HL-69 hygrometer varies\nfrom 0 to 870, while the humidity level of the AM2302\n\
    DHT11 sensor varies in the air from 20 to 80%, and its\ntemperature value ranges\
    \ from 0 to 50.\nHere is our sampled training dataset shown in Figure 7\nbased\
    \ on our rules set in Table 2, which we have provided to\nour machine learning\
    \ algorithm to predict water needs for\nthe given crop types.\n5.2. Training of\
    \ the KNN Model. We have implemented the\ncode in Anaconda, created for python\
    \ programs, and have\ntrained our model on the fact that, on a particular tem-\n\
    perature, water requirements of diﬀerent crops, which we\nare taking into consideration,\
    \ can be given.\nRice > sugarcane > maize > cotton > wheat.\nTis general rule\
    \ can be elaborated more speciﬁcally by\nidentifying ranges for temperature, humidity,\
    \ and soil\nmoisture for all the given types of crops to recognize its class.\n\
    Here is the rule summary in Table 3.\nIn Table 3, labels “HN,” “N,” “A,” “NN,”\
    \ and “HNN” are\nsecond hand for classes highly needed, needed, average, not\n\
    needed, and highly not needed correspondingly. Likewise,\nworking rules for watering\
    \ considering climate and soil are\ngiven in the following.\nSand and gravel >\
    \ clay > silt > loam > organic soil.\nHot and dry > hot and humid > cold and humid.\n\
    5.3. Deploying the Trained Model. Our trained model has\nbeen developed using\
    \ Scikit-learn. To make it available to\nproduction and to make it useful for\
    \ end users so that they\ncould extract real values from it, we have deployed\
    \ it. In this\nregard, we need to have three components shown in\nFigure 8.\n\
    Te developed and trained model for predicting the\nwater level as a “model.pkl”\
    \ ﬁle is ready, and model eval-\nuation is provided in the results section. Te\
    \ web service we\nhave used for this purpose is the Flask API. Lastly, we need\n\
    cloud as a service provider, and Heroku server fulﬁlled our\nrequirement in this\
    \ proposed system.\n5.4.ImplementationUsingEdgeComputing. In the process of\n\
    deploying the trained model through Flask API, we actually\ndeﬁne routes to where\
    \ an HTTP request handles. One route\nis for handling one HTTP request. Te data\
    \ are travelled in\nthe system from one side (perception layer) to other (edge\n\
    server).\nTe piece of code in Figure 9 is responsible for sending\nthe sensor\
    \ data from the sensor-Arduino side (i.e., per-\nception layer) to edge server\
    \ Firebase (i.e., processing layer).\nSecond last line of the code is establishing\
    \ a link to which\ndata (temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and phone no.)\n\
    are transferred. Tese data are received by our edge server by\na route “/submit”\
    \ deﬁned in the application of Flask API as\nshown in Figure 10. Whenever data\
    \ from sensors send to the\nestablished link of HTTP request, it triggers the\
    \ following\npiece of code to run. In this piece of code, the sensor values\n\
    and the SIM card no. (phone no.) are inserted in our da-\ntabase server (Firebase).\n\
    As we can see in Figure 11, each phone no. is repre-\nsenting a diﬀerent device.\
    \ Any data coming from a particular\ndevice are stored under the hierarchy of\
    \ its phone no. Each\nrecord under a device has a key value associated with it,\n\
    which actually contains the sensor data values. Whenever a\nparticular record\
    \ arrives at the edge server, its key value\nstores in the parameter “latestKey”\
    \ under its phone no.\nWhen another entry of record happens, its key value replaces\n\
    the previous one. In this way, our database is designed to\nhave the record of\
    \ most recent data entered in it.\nFirebase can be omitted from the system, and\
    \ data can\ndirectly be sent to the Heroku server (IoTserver), i.e., cloud\ncomputing.\
    \ Tat is really a bad practice due to overburden\nof the IoT server with useless\
    \ data. Since sensors are\nsending each and every instant value to the IOT server\
    \ and\nIOTserver is responsible for scrutiny of data coming from a\ndevice (which\
    \ means three sensors values every 30 sec-\nonds), and then applying model to\
    \ predict value for water\nrequirement. It will deﬁnitely aﬀect the speed and\
    \ eﬃciency\nof the system. Tis is the main concept of introducing edge\ncomputing.\n\
    Te piece of code in Figure 12 is triggered by the smart\nmobile/tab when the user\
    \ clicks to predict results for water\nrequirements. It utilizes the trained model\
    \ to predict the\nwater requirements and return the value to the server. Tis\n\
    value is sent to the user, and he/she can see the result on his/\nher phone via\
    \ the app.\n5.5. Android Application. An android platform is provided\nto the\
    \ farmers. Te input parameters (crop type, climate\ntype, and soil type) are put\
    \ on view in a dropdown, and users\ncan select from these and can send the command\
    \ to the\ndevice implanted to the ﬁeld.\nCodes for crop types, soil types, and\
    \ climate types are\ntransferred from the mobile app interface in Figure 13(a)\
    \ to\nthe server to which ontology is attached. Decision extracted\nfrom the ontology\
    \ section along with the sensor values then\nreaches the main IoT server where\
    \ our machine learning\nalgorithm is installed. Our training dataset also contains\
    \ the\nencoded values for labels for diﬀerent classes which are\nconverted to\
    \ the text (class label) at the front end in the\nandroid app as in Figure 13(c).\
    \ Tese codes are shown in\nTable 4.\nTable 2: Classes of sensor data.\nSoil moisture\n\

    \ screen shown in Figure 13(a), sugarcane as a crop type,\nhot and dry as a climate\
    \ type, and loam as a soil type. After\nclicking the button “Send” from the Figure\
    \ 13(b) interface,\nthe sensor readings come across to the server.\nTe values\
    \ for humidity, temperature, and soil moisture\nand the encoded result for soil\
    \ type, climate type, and crop\ntype values are considered by our trained ML model\
    \ to\nrecognize the watering need for the speciﬁc crop. So, with\nthe 50% result\
    \ coming from ontology and the sensor values,\nour system foretells to water the\
    \ crops and displays a note on\nthe farmer’s mobile screen as shown in Figure\
    \ 13(c).\nTe highlighted text “Highly need water” is mainly the\noutput of our\
    \ machine learning algorithm already discussed\nin the previous section. As shown\
    \ in Table 4, our training\ndataset holding the labels ranges from −1 to 3. Tese\
    \ are\neﬀectively the degree of water necessity to a speciﬁc plant at\nspeciﬁc\
    \ time.\n5.6. Performance Evaluation. We have performed tests on\nour sample data,\
    \ which we have obtained randomly from\nabout 500 instances. We provided these\
    \ instances to train\nour KNN model for the proposed system to forecast class\n\
    Figure 12: Data transfer from edge server to IoT server with prediction results.\n\
    Figure 11: Edge server handling data from sensors via the HTTP request.\n12\n\
    Complexity\nlabels. We used two statistical measures to estimate the\nperformance\
    \ of our KNN model, i.e., precision and recall.\nFigure 14 shows the accuracy\
    \ report of the results of the\nKNN model providing k \x88 5.\nTe accuracy report\
    \ of the trained model is given in\nFigure 1 and also presented graphically. Predicted\
    \ results for\nclass label “Needed” are lacking in precision. Tis perfor-\nmance\
    \ is dependent on the “k” value that is the no. of nearest\nneighbors involved\
    \ in the predicting class. Figure 15 shows\nthe confusion matrices without normalization\
    \ and with\nnormalization.\nTo increase accuracy, we should choose the “k” value\n\
    precisely. As per general rules for the KNN algorithm, the\nvalue of “k” for the\
    \ problem of two classes should be an odd\nvalue, and for more than two classes,\
    \ the “k” value should\nnot be the multiple of the number of the resultant classes.\n\
    As in our case, we have ﬁve labeled classes to be predicted,\nso we will choose\
    \ “k” accordingly. In order to choose a\nsuitable value for “k”, we have to plot\
    \ “k value versus mean\nerror” graph to identify the error trend. So, we plot\
    \ it by\nusing “matplotlib.pyplot” in Figure 16.\nAs we can see, the mean error\
    \ initially increases up to\n0.5 as the “k” value increases, but there is a sudden\
    \ fall\nwhich occurs after that to the value of 0.3 when the “k”\nvalue reaches\
    \ 10 to 11. After that, rise in error rate starts,\nand it continues to increase\
    \ with the increase in the “k”\nvalue. It means that our “k” value should be “11”\
    \ that is the\nmaximum value of ‘k’ for which mean error remains\nlowest. So,\
    \ for the value of k \x88 11, we again ﬁnd the ac-\ncuracy report to check if\
    \ the performance of our model is\ngetting better or not.\nFigure 17 shows the\
    \ signiﬁcant improvement in the\nperformance of the model as accuracy rate increases\
    \ when\nwe set the “k” value to 11. Te precision value for class “Not\nNeeded”\
    \ is increased from 0.33 to 1.0 which means ac-\ncuracy rate increases from 33%\
    \ to 100%. Similarly, for class\n“Average,” the precision value increases from\
    \ 0.25 to 0.33\nwhich means that accuracy rate increases from 25% to 33%.\nTis\
    \ is how tuning of the model can be possible. By tuning\ntraining data values\
    \ and by adjusting the “k” value, we can\nhave a better model for our system.\
    \ Tis is the main reason\nwhy we choose KNN algorithm for our proposed system.\n\

    \ for smart irrigation constitutes\nthree modules: ﬁrst module is the sensor network,\
    \ which\nis required to sense parameters inﬂuencing the water\nneed. We have used\
    \ sensors DHT22, light sensor\nBH1750, and HL-69 hygrometer to sense temperature,\n\
    soil moisture, light, and humidity in air. In the third\nmodule, we use edge and\
    \ main IoTservers to transfer and\nreceive data via HTTP requests. In the second\
    \ module,\nwe applied KNN on the sample dataset to train the model\nand used it\
    \ for eﬃcient decision-making of water re-\nquirements. Our trained model classiﬁes\
    \ the input into\nﬁve possible classes based on input values such as highly\n\
    not required, not required, average, required, and highly\nrequired. We have fully\
    \ implemented the proposed\nsystem in Anaconda.\nCurrently, our system employs\
    \ KNN for decision-\nmaking, but other intelligent data-extracting techniques\
    \ can\nalso be used for decision-making. So, the presented irriga-\ntion system\
    \ can reproduce in future by using other decision-\nmaking techniques such as\
    \ random forest. Moreover, the\nedge computing architecture can be further improved\
    \ by\nmaking the edge server responsible for processing data and\ndepicting the\
    \ result from the machine learning algorithm. In\nother words, the trained model\
    \ for KNN can be deployed at\nthe edge server so that nearby devices to a particular\
    \ edge can\nget facilitated by that edge server. It will improve latency rate\n\
    remarkably.\nData Availability\nTe data used to support the ﬁndings of this study\

    • AI and DT are helpful in climate change teaching, research and SDGs implementation.
    • AI contributes to climate change adaptation similar to climate-smart technologies.
    • AI is a game-changer towards innovative solutions to pressing climate change
    threats. • AI is extensively applied to increase climate change adaptation in
    both Americas. • AI contributes to climate resilience and the post-COVID-19 recovery
    process. • DTs enhance governance and policy coherence in climate change adaptation.
    Abstract Artificial Intelligence (AI) is believed to have a significant potential
    use in tackling climate change. This paper explores the connections between AI
    and climate change research as a whole and its usefulness in climate change adaptation
    efforts in particular. Using a systematic review of the literature on applications
    of AI for climate change adaptation and a questionnaire survey of a multinational
    and interdisciplinary team of climate change researchers, this paper shows the
    various means via which AI can support research on climate change in diverse regions,
    and contribute to efforts towards climate change adaptation. The surveyed articles
    are classified under nine areas, e.g., Global/Earth Related; Water-related Issues
    and agriculture, 95% of which are related to adaptation. The areas that have attracted
    the most studies about AI applications are water-related management issues (38%).
    In terms of the survey results, the most robust agreements were noted concerning
    the capacity of digitisation and AI to strengthen governance practices and afford
    policy coherence in climate change. Evidence gathered in the study suggests that,
    provided that due care is taken, the use of AI can provide a welcome support to
    global efforts to better understand and handle the many challenges associated
    with a changing climate. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords
    Artificial intelligenceDigital technologiesClimate change adaptation 1. Introduction:
    using artificial intelligence in climate change research The notion of Artificial
    Intelligence (AI) indicates the abilities of machines to "learn from experience,
    adjust to new inputs, and perform human-like tasks" (Duan et al., 2019, p. 63)
    to "interpret external data correctly, to learn from such data, and to use those
    learnings to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible adaptation" (Kaplan
    and Haenlein, 2019, p. 17). Recent developments in AI have triggered significant
    breakthroughs and consequences across all aspects of human life. At the same time,
    the value of AI is estimated to reach up to $16 trillion by 2030 (Walsh et al.,
    2020). Even though an overarching definition for AI remains an elusive task, it
    is commonly accepted that such disruptive technological advancements open up new
    possibilities in the automation of repetitive and, usually, time-consuming tasks,
    offer new opportunities for pattern recognition in large amounts of unstructured
    data and integrate the self-learning of novel algorithms (Bhatia, 2017; Ghallab
    et al., 2016). Representing a new era in the knowledge society, AI brings new
    opportunities to interpret external datasets, imitating human cognitive functions
    and addressing complexities linked to human thought or feelings (Kaplan and Haenlein,
    2019; Russell and Norvig, 2016; Martınez-Miranda and Aldea, 2005). AI has penetrated
    most aspects of our life and its massive power, coupled with big data, is evolving
    geometrically. AI is bound to alter production processes across all business sectors
    and foster advanced, innovative and long-term solutions to pressing sustainability
    challenges. Under the scope of sustainability-orientated research AI is employed
    through supervised, unsupervised or semi-supervised machine learning models, pertaining
    to algorithms that predict, identify and/or inherent patterns from labeled, unlabelled
    or semi-labeled input data, respectively (Nishant et al., 2020; García et al.,
    2019). Generalised linear models, decision trees, cognitive computing, support
    vector machines, Bayesian and artificial neural networks are some AI models gaining
    traction in the past few years (Shrestha and Mahmood, 2019; Şerban and Lytras,
    2020). Natural computing is a subfield aimed at algorithm optimisation utilising
    biophysical material as computational media and simulating environmental phenomena
    in computers (Brabazon et al., 2015). Expert systems are also emerging themes
    linked with AI''s capacity to solve complex problems of the natural world, such
    as climate change impact assessments, and aid decision-making by relying on specific
    knowledge and inference derived from databases and inference engines (Leo Kumar,
    2019; Nishant et al., 2020). Walsh et al. (2020) pinpoint key attributes describing
    the interactions between the global climate system and human psychology. Such
    attributes refer to our inability to comprehend the impacts of climate change
    due to their extreme scale and duration, our (mere) reliance on predictive models
    that encapsulate risks and uncertainty, the remoteness of climate change impacts
    in terms of space as well as time, and the inherent common-pool resource constraints
    of anthropogenic GHG emissions that hamper collective mitigation actions. These
    properties explain why climate change affects livelihoods and incurs multidimensional
    impacts, spanning from rising temperatures and increased frequency of extreme
    weather events to the aggravation of socioeconomic inequalities and human diseases.
    In this context, the computational architecture and power that AI encapsulates
    are particularly fitting in grappling with such pressing climate change threats,
    a domain of global environmental changes described by massive data availability,
    processing and forecasting challenges (Stein, 2020). Multi-sensor-driven AI tools
    and blockchain platforms can optimise circular economy loops (Kouhizadeh and Sarkis,
    2018; Kouhizadeh et al., 2019; Adebiyi-Abiola et al., 2019; Wang and Qu, 2019),
    giving room to sustainability transitions that reduce the carbon footprint and
    uncontrolled disposal of solid waste (Sankaran, 2019) as well as our dependence
    on primary (non-renewable) resources. Likewise, neural or sensor networks, machine
    learning, and cognitive computing can bring profound energy management and optimisation
    capabilities and smart urban planning and design (Şerban and Lytras, 2020). Utilising
    such AI advances can yield unprecedented advantages in analysing interconnected,
    large-scale databases to minimise the carbon intensity of systems, model possible
    climate change impacts and maximise resource efficiency through smart grids and
    connected smart appliances. Neural networks and smart algorithms, in particular,
    can also contribute to developing joint actions aimed at preserving the ecosystem''s
    health and biological diversity, combat desertification, soil degradation and
    marine pollution (e.g. Keramitsoglou et al., 2006; Mohamadi et al., 2016; Kwok,
    2019; Nunes et al., 2020; Vinuesa et al., 2020). It is well-established in the
    literature that emphasising carbon neutrality in electricity production and distribution,
    transportation, agriculture, as well as construction and buildings can have tremendous
    benefits in climate change mitigation and, in this respect, AI can be a critical
    agent of change (e.g. see Stein, 2020). AI applications may also upscale climate
    engagement of the public and stimulate collective action by predicting or visualising
    climate change risks and aid decision-support efforts by monitoring extreme weather
    disasters (remotely and) in real-time (Alemany et al., 2019; Huntingford et al.,
    2019; Walsh et al., 2020). For example, AIDR (Artificial Intelligence for Digital
    Response) assists relief organizations by analysing big data, that is, tweets,
    to detect the location and impacts of floods (Imran et al., 2014). There are other
    AI models that can immensely help disaster relief by mapping floods, locating
    refugee camps using satellite data (Logar et al., 2020) and determining the populations
    requiring the most help (Omdena and WFP, 2020). Indeed, AI advancements in climate
    big data processing allow for the identification of much more comprehensive future
    climate change scenarios and intelligent early warning systems. Projects like
    EnviroAtlas offer actionable insights into climate change implications on societies,
    ecosystems and healthcare (Manogaran and Lopez, 2018). For instance, ambient intelligence
    using sensor networks provides real-time climate data (Dingli et al., 2012; Ribeiro
    and José, 2013) and brings new opportunities in monitoring climate change impacts
    and disease forecasting and surveillance (Booth, 2018; Waits et al., 2018; Manogaran
    and Lopez, 2018). AI is also useful for assessing impacts of climate change on
    agriculture. Crane-Droesch, A. (2018) has developed a machine learning based model
    that can predict corn production under different climate change scenarios. Jakariya
    et al. (2020) has developed a mobile application using machine learning methods
    that can assess vulnerability of farmers in coastal Bangladesh based on an individual''s
    responses to a questionnaire. Nevertheless, AI applications aiming to endorse
    environmental sustainability are challenged by the rebound effects of high energy-intensive
    structures, undermining efforts to achieve carbon-neutrality and avoiding overexploitation
    of primary resources. For example, server operating systems that execute essential
    AI computational tasks (or store big data) entail considerable energy for cooling
    and unhindered operation. At the same time, their production, service and final
    disposal require vast amounts of non-renewable materials (such as lithium, nickel
    or cobalt) and efficient e-waste management, respectively (Kaplan and Haenlein,
    2020). By performing a comprehensive review of the available literature, Nishant
    et al. (2020) also point out as significant challenges posed by AI-based applications
    the overreliance on historical data in machine learning models, undesirable human
    responses to AI interventions, the underlying cybersecurity risks and possible
    adverse impacts of AI applications as well as a lack of holistic metrics for AI
    performance measurement. Moreover, before launching AI deployments, it is crucial
    to increase the awareness of risks associated with likely failures of AI systems
    in a society progressively more dependent on this technology (Vinuesa et al.,
    2020). Related challenges in climate big data in the global earth observation
    system are outlined in Faghmous and Kumar (2014), Lee and Kang (2015) and Nativi
    et al. (2015). Crucially, underlying gaps in ethical, transparency, equality and
    safety standards stemming from such challenges call for regulatory insights and
    appropriate legislation frameworks to address counterproductive outcomes from
    AI penetration patterns (Kaplan and Haenlein, 2020; Vinuesa et al., 2020; Petit,
    2018). Overall, digital technologies (DTs) are transforming societies and accelerating
    achievements faster than any previous innovation over last two decades (United
    Nations, 2020). Digitalization and digital economies additionally trigged by the
    COVID-19 pandemic (MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy, 2021) significantly
    contribute to climate actions (Balogun et al., 2020; Li et al., 2021; Dwivedi
    et al., 2022). DT itself can potentially directly reduce global emissions up to
    15% by 2030 and additional 35% by impacting on transformation of systems as well
    as business and consumers decisions (Falk et al., 2020). Given the above and taking
    into account that AI research and development can be a significant game-changer
    towards advanced, innovative and long-term solutions to pressing climate change
    threats, this study aims to review AI applications for climate change adaptation.
    We used a systematic review of the literature on these subjects based on an online
    survey to achieve this. The paper is structured as follows. The next section describes
    the relation between AI and Climate Change Adaptation. Further, Section 3 presents
    the methods used, namely an expert-driven systematic literature review complemented
    by a global online survey. Section 4 discusses the main results. Section 5, the
    conclusions section, summarises implications of the paper and outlines future
    prospects. The paper ends with two Appendixes. Appendix 1 (Systematic Literature
    Review with a data matrix which summarises examples of the articles used and their
    references) and Appendix 2 which includes the survey instrument deployed in the
    study. 2. Artificial intelligence and climate change adaptation AI and its subset
    of machine learning have drawn significant attention in recent years. The influence
    of such technology on human life has increased due to the improved connectivity,
    data storage and processor speed. AI is frequently used in many sectors such as
    health and transport (Huntingford et al., 2019); renewable energies (He et al.,
    2021); education (Shaikh et al., 2021); construction industry (Abioye et al.,
    2021); ocean dynamics (Zhao et al., 2021); environmental quality control (Liu
    et al., 2021a); biodiversity (Li, 2020); agriculture (Liu et al., 2021b). Yet,
    for climate change adaptation, AI is used in the cities and mobility sustainability
    (Balogun et al., 2020); housing cooling system (Ahmed et al., 2021); water sustainability
    (Doorn, 2021); energy sustainability (Ahmad et al., 2021). Although AI and machine
    learning are helpful in climate change adaptation, their combined use was previously
    neglected due to the lack of power and computer capacities, which is particularly
    important as climate change is a data-intensive issue with various subsets. However,
    recent advancements enable scientists to incorporate AI into climate change adaptation
    (Huntingford et al., 2019). AI may be used in multiple ways to increase adaptation
    to climate change, to the same extent that climate-smart technologies do (Tran
    et al., 2020). Firstly, systems may be designed to monitor meteorological measurements
    using high resolution and spatial data. Secondly, machine learning can be used
    to draw links between location, time, and changes of the meteorological measurements.
    After that, interpreted data can be fed into artificial intelligence systems that
    provide automated warnings to people about erratic weather patterns and extreme
    weather events caused by climate change (Huntingford et al., 2019). Scientists
    are now able to combine machine learning with climate models. Machine learning
    is valuable, as it helps to solve previous problems by offering accurate results
    that are less expensive than older models. Previous models faced difficulties
    dealing with large amounts of data. However, machine learning can efficiently
    process data faster, which is beneficial in predicting extreme weather events,
    and models are now being redesigned or modified to include machine learning (Rolnick
    et al., 2019). Climate change has a significant societal impact that translates
    to ecological and socioeconomic issues in a given country. Machine learning has
    uses in alerting citizens by identifying and prioritising areas of high risk.
    Besides, it may provide annotation by using raw data and promoting exchange, making
    it easier for data to be shared, allowing people to develop adaptation methods
    by deciding on the highest risks and using shared information to generate solutions
    (Rolnick et al., 2019). With regards to ecology, AI is used to monitor live ecosystems
    and track biodiversity. By tracking species and their numbers, conservationists
    can decide areas of high priority and low priority. Furthermore, machine learning
    is used in the form of image-based sensors to monitor biodiversity. These are
    automatically triggered by movement, and cameras capture pictures that can be
    used to classify species (Rolnick et al., 2019). AI has great potential in the
    energy industry. The reduction of fossil fuels used requires that the energy crisis
    be addressed, which, in turn, will reduce the climate change impacts and make
    adaptation easier (Walsh et al., 2020). A key example is Google using machine
    learning to increase wind generation efficiency and predict power output, increasing
    the value of their wind energy by a 20% factor (Elkin and Witherspoon, 2019).
    Promotion of alternative energy sources aids in lowering carbon emissions. In
    similar ways, AI and machine learning can be used to regulate building energy
    and thus can be applied to the construction of intelligent cities (Rolnick et
    al., 2019; Walsh et al., 2020) 3. Methods This paper seeks to identify the nexus
    between AI and climate change adaptation in a sample of countries known to be
    investing resources on AI for various climate change adaptation purposes primarily
    based on a systematic literature search that was implemented, adapting the model
    used by Leal Filho et al. (2019). The following data collection and analysis steps
    were conducted sequentially: Identify data sources; select pieces of pertinent
    literature; perform critical evaluation of studies; distil synthesis of acquired
    prior studies and document essential findings. This systematic method facilitates
    the aggregation of a significant volume of information in the search, thereby
    offering detailed and reliable information for diverse stakeholders in the AI-climate
    change adaptation domain. Care was taken to select reliable sources for the research
    data since top quality resources are essential requirements for a good literature
    search (Balogun et al., 2020). Literature searches were based on some of the most
    reputable online databases of scientific research data, including Web of Science,
    Scopus, and Google Scholar. We also consulted reports from specialised organisations
    (e.g. research centres and societies, UN bodies, and the OECD). In addition, the
    scope of literature sources was extended to include search engines (e.g., Google)
    to ensure that relevant publications which are not included in scientific databases
    were not omitted. The parameters analysed in such literature include (i) Theme/Category,
    (ii) AI Application, (iii) Implications, (iv) Region. Some of the syntaxes used
    include: ⁎ Global/Earth ⁎ Disaster Response ⁎ Water-related issues ⁎ Agriculture
    ⁎ Water-related management issues ⁎ Agricultural, Land or Tree ⁎ Energy ⁎ Wildfire
    ⁎ Specific AI Techniques Further, to complement the above mentioned systematic
    literature review, a global online survey based on a questionnaire was administered,
    with a focus on DTs and AI for climate change adaptation. The structured questionnaire
    survey was made available to respondents for approximately two weeks in February
    2021 through the online Google forms platform tool. The survey design was deployed
    with a view to catering for a ''rapid turnaround in data collection'' (Creswell
    and Creswell 2018, p. 149). It was supplemented by a critical expert literature
    analysis (Machi and McEvoy 2016), which provided a robust foundation for the execution
    of this research. Overall, the survey instrument comprised sixteen closed-ended
    questions, of which three questions offered scope for a brief qualitative analysis.
    The survey questions were designed to probe aspects of research relevance at the
    intersection of AI and climate change management. The questions were organised
    into the categories of ''general questions'' (e.g. What is your climate change
    research orientated towards?) and ''technical questions'' (e.g. In which areas
    do you see a promising use of DTs and AI in climate change context?). The data
    collection instrument was developed through an iterative process that solicited
    input and feedback from a multinational and interdisciplinary team of climate
    change researchers. Following the instrument''s conceptual development, the data
    collection instrument was pre-tested, which led to minor adjustments, but overall
    confirmed its adequacy (Bryman 2016, pp. 260–261). The purposive sampling ensured
    that the survey instrument was appropriate for the envisaged target group, which
    comprised academics working in disciplines related to climate change, including
    mitigation and adaptation. Additionally, a snowball sampling was used to leverage
    the research networks of the authors and ''capitalise on the connectedness of
    individuals in research networks'' (Bryman 2016, p. 415). The participation in
    the survey was solicited by email during the above stated data collection time
    frame. The subsequent descriptive statistical analysis allowed the researchers
    to characterise the prominent trends (Punch 2014; Creswell 2013, 2014). Selected
    respondent comments, to which our analysis refers in some places of this paper,
    resulted from those three questions which allowed respondents to provide qualitative
    answers. The qualitative responses were analysed through a content analysis using
    coding and categorisation (Creswell and Creswell, 2018). The inferential analysis
    of the data was performed using the statistical software SPSS. 4. Results and
    discussion 4.1. Systematic literature review The systematic literature review
    has assessed the current research areas in applying AI and climate change. Appendix
    1 provides a summary of the identified research publications, which are categorised
    under the Adaptation or Mitigation category. Each article is further classified
    under the following main areas: 1 = Global or Earth Related; 2 = City or Urban
    Related; 3 = Disaster Response; 4 = Water-related Issues; 5 = Agricultural, Land
    or Tree; 6 = Energy; 7 = Wildfire; 8 = Specific AI Technique (s). Around 95% of
    these studies are related to climate change adaptation, whereas 5% of them refer
    to mitigation. In particular, the use of AI for adaptation is frequently performed
    for monitoring climate dynamics, and in predicting the adverse impacts of climate
    change in cities and the urban environment. Making other areas, AI is deployed
    to develop sophisticated modelling and forecasting for evaluating vulnerabilities
    of different regions of the world. This approach is considered relevant to policy
    and decision-makers in environment planning and action plan formulation, in light
    of potential disasters and adversities to human health. From a risk management
    perspective, the use of AI in this context is useful in anticipating scenarios
    that could be dealt with, by formulating measures to reduce possible climate change
    impacts, and even avoid potential losses due to climate-associated problems where
    conceivable. The assessed studies were either reviews (4), case studies (17),
    or experimental studies (35). The case studies involved Asia (8), Europe (6),
    Australia (2), and North America (1), respectively. Nearly half of the literature
    assessed (27 out 56) focused heavily on the significant role of AI in understanding
    future outlooks, where issues related to forecasting, projection, and modelling
    of extreme weather events, resource use, and the even impact of conservation and
    adaptation efforts were predominant. In terms of humanitarian responses in the
    wake of extreme weather events, fewer than ten studies addressed the application
    of AI in disaster risk reduction and response. Similarly, little attention was
    given to AI''s role in unlocking the blue economy''s potential, as only six studies
    underscored its application in inland and natural coastal capitals. amongst the
    literature assessed, AI was noted to have gained traction in terms of its application
    in biotechnology, agronomy, and plant science, particularly at a time when drought
    and pest-resistant crop varieties are most sought in many places around the world.
    The place of AI in the clinical characterisation of mental health cases emerged
    only once where virtual reality (VR) is relevant in assessing, treating, and managing
    posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). These findings echo the broad application
    areas previously studied, but extend previous studies by representing the spread
    and reach of AI application in climate change adaptation (Walsh et al., 2020)
    Fig. 1 reveals that 38% of studies pertinent to water-related issues under climate
    change, including flood prediction and irrigation management, have attracted the
    most research attention on examining the application of AI for adaptation. Download

    Distribution of main research areas on AI application by the identified research
    publications. These studies have examined the vulnerability of various regions
    to potential floods linked to climate change, and evaluated measures to adapt
    based on AI applications. The combined categories of agriculture, land and wildfire
    represent 31% of the sampled literature. These studies broadly reveal how AI is
    deployed to predict pertinent events that create challenges and risks to the inhabitants;
    possible solutions are derived. About 27% of the articles provide some reviews
    and assessments on the use of AI technologies to support climate change adaptation
    in disaster management, regional and global deployment potentials in general.
    The remaining 5% suggest the possible innovative deployment of AI for energy management,
    particularly to enhance renewable energy that mitigates greenhouse gas emissions
    and climate change. Contrary to previous studies, this highlights the relative
    concentrated application of AI in relation to disaster management (Stein, 2020).
    4.2. Survey The systematic literature review was complemented by a survey of 104
    respondents from 51 countries. The respondents came from all continents (Fig.
    2), with a majority coming from Africa at 32%, followed by Europe (31%). The lowest
    percentage contribution came from the Oceanic-Australia block, which contributed
    3%. Furthermore, the respondents varied among countries and the rate was 68% male
    and 30% female, whereas about 2% did not state their gender. Download : Download

    of respondents. It was positive that Africa had the most survey participants.
    It is one of the continents is disproportionately affected by climate change;
    therefore, as part of building the adaptation capacity on the continent, participation
    in such studies is vital. Moreover, results from the systematic review indicated
    that comparatively few case studies from the continent are document. Thus, number
    of African respondents to the survey can offer valuable insights to make up for
    the absence of case studies from the region. Even though South America, Australia
    and Oceania did not have a high number of participants, these continents are also
    expected to suffer several adverse climate change effects; hence adaptation capacity
    may be increased by integrating AI and other related DTs. Respondents provided
    various types of replies to the questions posed (Table 1). The most robust agreements
    were noted concerning the capacity of digitisation and AI to ''strengthen governance
    practices and policy coherence in climate change'' (90%), to ''strengthen environmental
    sustainability and reduce climate vulnerability'' (89%), and to ''deliver economic
    and environmental benefits in climate change management'' (88%). These reflect
    the positive intentions of AI reported in the literature (Stein, 2020). Table

    4.11 1.09 However, there was also a recognition of the ''need to keep the public
    well informed, with full transparency and accountability'' (90% of respondents
    agreed or strongly agreed), ''the use of digitalisation and AI needs to be paralleled
    by privacy and data protection procedures'' (89%), and that the ''limitations
    in digital connectivity disproportionately affect developing countries'' (85%),
    which demonstrates a balanced view of both the benefits and implications of digitisation
    and AI in climate change research and practice. Whereas the former of these reflect
    the extant literature, the latter points to broader awareness of the inequalities
    that has hitherto not been so explicit (Walsh et al., 2020). Responses on the
    relevance of DTs and AI to climate change action were mixed across the continents
    (Fig. 3a). Respondents from Australia demonstrated the most affirmative responses
    (where 100% of respondents replied ''very important and frequently used'' or ''important
    and sometimes used''). North America and South America offered the subsequent
    highest affirmative responses (80% and 75%, respectively). Download : Download

    digital tools and AI to (a) climate action (b) project cooperation (c) climate
    change management in the next ten years (d) organisational expenditure on digitalisation
    for climate change. The only continent with respondents reporting ‘no meaning
    to my work and uses at all’ was Africa (5%). These findings might reflect limited
    national resources and the stage of technology diffusion in climate change action
    across the continents. For instance, many farmers in Africa still rely on rainfed
    agriculture, increasing vulnerability to impacts of climate change (Serdeczny
    et al., 2017). Moreover, digital data on local climate projections and weather
    forecasts to support optimal farming practices in the region is scarce (Balogun
    et al., 2020), aligning with the findings of this study. However, such findings
    are consistent with the aforementioned finding related to the unequal access to
    resources such as AI and DTs which is hitherto largely absent in the extant literature
    (Walsh et al., 2020). Similarly, the adoption of DT for climate change adaptation
    in North America has been documented in earlier studies. An example is the United
    States'' Southeast Climate Consortium''s (SECC) agrometeorological program aiding
    the management of climate risks in the past decade. With this initiative, digital
    tools are used to simplify and communicate complex climatic concepts to enhance
    farmers'' understanding and awareness of climate impacts on agriculture (AgroClimate,
    2015). In contrast to previous studies, this finding highlights the differential
    application of AI and DTs across countries in relation to climate change adaptation
    (Alemany et al., 2019). The relevance of DTs and AI to project cooperation was
    affirmative across all continents (Fig. 3b). As noted, the most affirmative responses
    were in Oceania and Australia, with 100% of respondents reporting ''very important
    and frequently used''. The answer ''has some importance and occasionally used''
    was most commonly reported in North America (13%), Europe (12%), and Asia (10%).
    These findings reflect the widespread use of communications technologies in project
    activity across all continents, and is an aspect not typically reported in previous
    studies about the use of AIs and DTs in climate change adaptation (e.g. Stein,
    2020). In its study of the application of digitalisation for sustainable development
    in the global north and south, Balogun et al. (2020) reported the prevalence of
    DTs (e.g., big data analytics) in all continents to enhance urban resilience.
    Also, Mckinley et al. (2021) highlighted the emergence of innovative digital tools,
    methods, and approaches to support a wide range of project cooperation, including
    aspects of climate change action. The extended employment of DTs is evident during
    the COVID-19 pandemic to facilitate stakeholder engagement, project cooperation,
    communication, research and teaching (Leal Filho et al., 2021a). Notably, the
    relevance of DTs and AI for future climate change management (Fig. 3c) is overwhelmingly
    expected to ‘increase’ or ‘greatly increase’ by respondents in all regions. In
    terms of predicted future institutional investments in digitisation (Fig. 3d),
    findings indicated affirmative results from Oceania (100%), North America (85%),
    Africa (64%), and Europe (63%). In contrast, respondents from the following indicated
    no further investments: Australia (100%), South America (58%) and Asia (57%).
    These results might reflect current commitments to maintain technological advancements
    in ongoing climate change activity (e.g. in Oceania) or potential maintenance
    and utilisation of previous institutional investments in technology (e.g. as demonstrated
    in China and other parts of Asia in recent years). These findings add new insight
    into the perception of ongoing investment in AI, an area currently unexplored
    in the literature (Walsh et al., 2020), but indicative of future intent and activity.
    The survey indicated that 54% of respondents disagreed that DTs will strengthen
    the governance practice and policy coherence in climate change (Fig. 4a). In comparison,
    36% agreed that DTs could be of assistance in the development of climate change
    governance policies, which can be linked to the detachments that often exist between
    policymakers and advancements in scientific fields. Furthermore, the governance
    sphere is a complicated field that is often a contested terrain among policymakers
    and politicians alike. Therefore, it is imperative that even though DTs can be
    proven tools in improving governance, vested interest also needs to be taken into
    account during policy formulation. From a continental angle, respondents from
    Oceania and Australia totally agreed with the view; however, this analysis needs
    to be treated with caution due to the small size of the sample from the two continents.
    These findings sit in contrast to previous findings as they provide a more sceptical
    picture of how AI can be applied in policy and governance fields (Rolnick et al.,
    2019). Download : Download high-res image (639KB) Download : Download full-size

    coherence, (b) deliver economic and environmental benefits, (c) strengthen environmental
    sustainability and reduce climate vulnerability, and (d) mitigate the inequalities
    from climate change. Concerning that the timely implementation of DTs and AI deliver
    economic and environmental benefits in climate change management (Fig. 4b), most
    respondents agree (particularly from South America and Europe) or strongly agree
    (particularly from Oceania and Europe). Only the responses from Australia are
    neutral. Regarding the capacity of DTs to reduce climate change vulnerability,
    40% and 45% of respondents strongly agreed and agreed, respectively, that DTs
    might reduce climate change vulnerability, with the highest percentage coming
    from North America, besides the 100% from Australia and Oceania (Fig. 4c). This
    aligns with the outcome of the literature review and confirms opportunities to
    use AI and digital tools to find practical adaptive approaches to climate change.
    Such tools include machine learning applications in climate change. This position
    was established by O''Gorman and Dweyer (2018). They asserted that machine learning
    helps reduce uncertainties associated with climate models, thus further affirming
    that AI can be a valuable tool in climate change. The exact position is also articulated
    and highlighted by Vinuesa et al. (2020), who assert that AI can be integrated
    with improving renewable energy capabilities and energy efficiency, thus reducing
    the total greenhouse gas emissions and carbon footprint. Finally, concerning DTs
    being a tool to reduce inequalities (Fig. 4d), 38% of respondents agreed that
    digital tools could reduce inequalities due to climate change. Thus, most respondents
    in all regions (except Australia) expect DT and AI to strengthen governance practices
    and policy coherence in climate change. The survey respondents still hold considerable
    fear regarding the threat posed by DTs and AI to humankind, as confirmed by 30%
    of respondents indicating that AI and related technologies pose some danger (Fig.
    5a). The highest percentage of concern came from Australia (100%), Oceania (50%),
    and South America (38%). In comparison, respondents'' in Africa only reflected
    a minor level of anxiety at 22%. Fears related to impacts on employment (Fig.
    5b) are nuanced and noticeable across all continents, although at close to 60%
    Europeans are more cautious than North Americans. Generally, apprehension stems
    from the belief that AI may create a superhuman with capabilities beyond human
    beings (Yu et al., 2018), eventually overtaking human beings and lacking consciousness
    (Dehaene et al., 2017). Respondents also strongly felt that connectivity and infrastructure
    issues could negatively affect the capacity of developing countries to take full
    advantage of advancements in AI and other digital tools (Fig. 5c). Download :

    response on risks posed by AI on (a) mankind (b) employment (c) limitations of
    developing countries (d) personal privacy. The fear of AI is further confirmed
    by respondents agreeing across all continents that there is a need for privacy
    and data protection procedures when applying AI (Fig. 5d). Fig. 5d shows agreement
    and convergence regarding digitalisation, and AI needs to be paralleled by privacy
    and data protection procedures for all regions. The Australia region, and Oceania,
    both with 100%, are the most positive or affirmative, if compared to the South
    America and European region, with more than 80% and 60%, respectively. Although
    Asia and North America are both positive, they had relatively lower values (both
    over 35%) than Australia and Oceania. Although Africa is considered a relatively
    backward region in the use and exploitation of advanced technologies, especially
    digitisation and AI, it presented a relatively higher value (more than 50%) when
    compared to North America and the Asian region. Whilst some of these fears have
    been previously reported, the extent and reach of these fears has not previously
    been reported on a global level (Stein, 2020). This is an important dimension
    to consider in further implementation and exploitation of AI for climate change
    adaptation. From the survey, 40% and 44% of respondents from across all the continents
    agreed that leveraging DTs and AI can be valuable tools in increasing research
    in climate change-related issues and the implementation of SDG13 (Fig. 6a and
    b). On a continental level, 68% of respondents from South America felt that AI
    and related digital tools could assist as tools of research and assist in the
    implementation of SDG13. This view is supported by Belayneh et al. (2016), who
    assert that AI can easily be leveraged in drought forecasting, which can subsequently
    reduce the cost of food insecurity interventions as well as assist in saving lives.
    The use of AI in climate research and action is further advocated in Huntingford
    et al. (2019), who encouraged the use of models and data-driven machine learning
    to provide warnings and decision-making support, notably drought predictions.
    Similar opportunities for AI about disaster management and mitigation are noted
    by Sun et al. (2020) and Sayad et al. (2019), respectively. Our study findings
    are similar to Vinuesa et al. (2020), which established that AI could act as an
    enabler in achieving environmental-related outcomes, including SDG13. Download

    Leveraging digital tools and AI can assist in (a) teaching, and research (b) accelerating
    progress towards implementation of SDG13, (c) faster and broader scale deployment
    (d) enhancing climate resilience and post COVID-19 recovery. On the other hand,
    40% and 41% of respondents respectively, believed that AI and DTs would not be
    good tools to aid research in climate change and the implementation of SDG13 as
    some of the AI techniques are high energy demanders, and particularly where non-carbon
    neutral energy sources are used (Vinuesa et al., 2020). The research results allow
    the authors to highlight the existence of imbalances on the understanding of technological
    advances, or whether digitalisation and AI will be deployed much faster and on
    a broader scale than in the past (Fig. 6c). These disagreements, mainly in Africa,
    maybe associated in part due to limited use of technologies and digitisation in
    various productive sectors, limited information on the current dynamics of technologies
    and AI, and reduced opportunities for technological production and transformation
    (Van Rensburg et al., 2019; Cariolle, 2020). Furthermore, another set of risks
    can be classified as cyber physical and structural imbalances (Jelinek et al.,
    2021) thus limiting equitable AI adoption by all countries. However, the significant
    climate sensitivity, exposure, and reduced adaptive capacities in Africa consequently
    translate into major vulnerability (Ahmadalipour et al., 2019; Leal Filho et al.,
    2021b). This may require advanced technological options such as AI to detect,
    predict, record, and report extreme weather events, sudden events, predictability
    of impacts, and mitigation and adaptation options. Nevertheless, North and South
    America, with more than 80% and 75%, respectively, were more optimistic about
    the rapid advances in digitisation and accelerated implementation of AI. Such
    optimism could mean acquiring most of the knowledge, production capacity, technological
    transformation, and digitisation of these regions. Consistent with responses to
    other questions, answers are skewed in favour of the expectation that the use
    of DTs and AI will be critical for a climate-resilient and sustainable COVID-19
    pandemic recovery, with a clear majority of respondents in all regions (except
    Australia) expressing this expectation (Fig. 6d). The Australian region, with
    100%, is less favourable compared to all regions. A more positive affirmation
    was verified in the Oceania region, with 100%, and North America, with more than
    65%. With more than 50%, Africa was more favourable than the Asian region (more
    than 40%) and Europe (more than 35%). We understand that the less favourable position
    of the Australian region (100%) can be justified likely due to (1) the existence
    of similar tools that can play and support climate resilience and sustainable
    COVID −19 pandemic recovery, and (2) climate change and COVID-19 pandemic are
    consequences of human behaviour, which can be positively changed, if there is
    a will, decision, commitment, and all this anchored to well-founded and effective
    policies. The practical application of AI can be a valuable tool shown by Buckland
    et al. (2019). They established that ANNs could be applied in future predictions
    of future natural or human-induced disturbances of climatic systems. The practical
    application of AI is also further demonstrated in Mohamadi et al. (2016), where
    a trained AI system can track the desertification of regions. Furthermore, McGovern
    et al. (2017) indicated that AI could assist in improving forecast models as several
    AI techniques can extract information through blending observational data and
    forecast model information; hence quality outcomes can be derived. Furthermore,
    evidence exists that shows that AI will assist in better understanding the climate
    change phenomenon as well as modelling the impacts thereof (Vinuesa et al., 2020);
    however, this will not be possible in situations where DT distribution is already
    uneven between rich and developing countries (WHO, 2019). Duan et al. (2019) advocate
    for governments worldwide to develop relevant policies that will be a reference
    point in the use of AI to avoid unintended negative consequences on society. This
    assertion further highlights the fear which has gripped both the scientific community
    and the general population regarding AI. In this sense, it may be constructive
    to synthesise the prospects involving AI and DTs as a kind of balancing act whereby
    their perceived potential risks are juxtaposed against their current and future
    capacity to mitigate climate-related risks, i.e., through enhanced options for
    climate change adaptation, disaster risk reduction, preparedness, wildfire prediction
    and prevention (Dehaene et al., 2017; Huntingford et al., 2019; Sayad et al.,
    2019; Sun et al., 2020; Luetz and Rumsey, 2021; Zhao et al., 2020). 5. Conclusions
    This research has tried to analyse the connections between AI and climate change
    adaptation. One of the main findings from the study is that respondents from North
    America and South America are already extensively applying and utilising DTs and
    AI as tools to increase climate change adaptation. This was evidenced by the high
    levels of optimism as indicated by 80% of respondents from North America and 75%
    from South America agreeing that these tools are essential hence being frequently
    used. These positions from the two continents can be attributed to the availability
    of appropriate infrastructure that facilitates the use and deployment of such
    technologies. However, the situation was different for African respondents, where
    some respondents indicated that they seldom use DTs or AI as part of their climate
    adaptation tools box. Thus, the lack of enthusiasm in applying DTs and AI in dealing
    with climate change adaptation in Africa may be a result of the lack of the required
    infrastructure to deploy these technologies. This trend, in turn, offers an opportunity
    for technology developers to provide additional support to African countries,
    so as to bridge the technology gap. The study has also identified the fact that
    there is still considerable fear about the potential risks posed by AI concerning
    humanity, as some respondents felt that AI is an existential threat to humanity.
    Others felt that they fear that robots might take their job. Also, some respondents
    expressed some concerns regarding the potential intrusion on privacy that comes
    from the deployment of AI, mainly if left unregulated and unchecked. Third trend
    shows the need to set up suitable legal-ethical frameworks that may regulate the
    use of AI across different spheres as a whole, and their use in a climate change
    context in particular. Furthermore, besides the fear of AI''s negative consequences
    on humanity, our study established that 44% still believe that AI can be a vital
    tool in teaching and in research, enhancing climate resilience, and supporting
    the post-COVID-19 recovery process. Our study also ascertained that from the respondent''s
    views, DTs were also valuable tools that can be deployed towards supporting research
    on issues related to climate change adaptation and the implementation of SDG13.
    Our study also further established that DTs can also enhance governance and policy
    coherence in climate change response and adaptation. This paper has some limitations.
    The first one is that the literature review contains relatively recent data since
    AI is a topic that has evolved over the past few years. A second limitation is
    the sampling since only 104 people from 51 countries took part in it. A further
    limitation of the paper is that, as  far as the aspects related to the literature
    review are concerned, there is a possibility that not all the papers on the topic
    were considered in the analysis. However, despite the limitations, the study provides
    a welcome addition to the literature. It explores the connections between AI and
    climate change and offers a rough profile of how it is being practised in various
    countries. The implications of this paper are two-fold. Firstly, it sheds some
    light on the extent to which the literature reports on the connections between
    AI and climate change. Secondly, by means of the survey, it describes some pressing
    issues connected with AI, especially its contribution to strengthen governance
    practices and policy coherence in climate change, and the need to keep the public
    well informed, with full transparency and accountability. As breakthroughs continue
    to be made in various fields of AI and DTs, practitioners in climate change can
    take advantage of these developments and deploy AI more systematically, taking
    better advantage of its potential to support increased climate change adaptation.
    Furthermore, in future studies, comprehensive research on the use of AI for mitigating
    climate change can be performed to analyse and predict measures to reduce carbon
    emissions to stabilise the climate. Overall, provided that due care is taken,
    the use of AI can provide a welcome support to global efforts to better understand
    and handle the many challenges associated with a changing climate. CRediT authorship

    modelling approach for one-week and one to two-month) city water demand forecasting
    in situations with limited data availability. Models showed to be effective in
    assessing the uncertainty associated with water demand forecasts in terms of confidence
    bands, which is helpful in operational water demand forecasting. AI/ML models

    Adamowski (2015) 51 Applying Artificial Intelligence to Improve Resilience and
    Preparedness Against the Negative Impacts of Flood Events A 4 Several ML models
    are developed and evaluated for classifying floods, i.e., flash floods, lakeshore
    floods, based on the weather forecast. The results show that the Random Forest
    technique provides the highest classification accuracy, followed by the J48 decision
    tree and Lazy methods. AI/ML models for flood forecasting and management Saravi

    Phases and Tasks in Paddy Rice Smart Farming IV. Application of Big Data and Machine
    Learning in Rice Production Tasks V. Results and Conclusion Show Full Outline
    Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: Big Data (BD),
    Machine Learning (ML) and Internet of Things (IoT) are expected to have a large
    impact on Smart Farming and involve the whole supply chain, particularly for rice
    production. The increasing amount and variety of data captured and obtained by
    these emerging technologies in IoT offer the rice smart farming strategy new abilities
    to predict changes and identify opportunities. The quality of data collected from
    sensors greatly influences the performance of the modelling processes using ML
    algorithms. These three elements (e.g., BD, ML and IoT) have been used tremendously
    to improve all areas of rice production processes in agriculture, which transform
    traditional rice farming practices into a new era of rice smart farming or rice
    precision agriculture. In this paper, we perform a survey of the latest research
    on intelligent data processing technology applied in agriculture, particularly
    in rice production. We describe the data captured and elaborate role of machine
    learning algorithms in paddy rice smart agriculture, by analyzing the applications
    of machine learning in various scenarios, smart irrigation for paddy rice, predicting
    paddy rice yield estimation, monitoring paddy rice growth, monitoring paddy rice
    disease, assessing quality of paddy rice and paddy rice sample classification.
    This paper also presents a framework that maps the activities defined in rice
    smart farming, data used in data modelling and machine learning algorithms used
    for each activity defined in the production and post-production phases of paddy
    rice. Based on the proposed mapping framework, our conclusion is that an efficient
    and effective integration of all these three technologies is very crucial that
    transform traditional rice cultivation practices into a new perspective of intelligence
    in rice precision agriculture. Finally, this paper also summarizes all the challenges
    and technological trends towards the exploitation of multiple sources in the era
    of big data in agriculture... (Show More) A Big Data-ML-Task applications framework

    global population of 7.8 billion (2020) persons is expected to reach 9.7 billion
    by 2050 [1]. It is expected that the world would require 70% more food than what
    available at the moment with less natural resources like land and water due to
    urbanization, soil erosion, climatic changes, water shortages and excessive use
    by livestock. It is estimated that there is about 33% wastage of agriculture production
    due to poor logistics and storage [2]–[4]. As result, the key for coping strategies
    in the contexts of climate change and food security is to implement precision
    agricultural or smart farming. Precision agriculture is a technology-enabled approach
    to farming management that observes, measures, and analyzes the needs of individual
    fields and crops [5]. Smart farming is defined as the application of information
    and data technologies for optimizing complex farming systems. It focuses on how
    the collected agriculture related information can be used in a smart way, rather
    than the storage of data, access to data and the application of these agriculture
    data. Big data and machine learning algorithms are two main important components
    in paddy rice smart farming. Big Data can be defined as a data that can be described
    using three key concepts: volume, velocity, and variety. Volume refers to size
    of the data, variety refers to the various types of data (e.g., text, numbers,
    images, videos and audios) and Velocity refers to the increasing speed at which
    big data is created (e.g., live stream data). Machine learning focuses on the
    development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.
    Applying smart farming technologies will definitely assist farmers in various
    tasks to increase crop productions. In order to narrow down the scope of this
    paper, we focus on paddy rice smart farming as rice is an increasingly important
    staple food in Asia Pacific region and other parts of the world. The changes over
    time in land use and soil salinity levels have significant impact on the production
    of rice yields [6]. In addition to that, unpredictable weather conditions and
    inefficient techniques to predict weather conditions are amongst the few factors
    that reduce rice yields production [7], [8]. For instance, most farmers in Myanmar
    face heavy rains during the rice growing season and that crop damage and yield
    losses due to heavy rains cause extensive losses among farmers [9]. As a result,
    the ability to predict weather or climate trends and environmental factors (e.g.,
    soil nutrient) is very important in enhancing paddy farmers’ productivity [7].
    The current practices, which heavily rely on fertilizers and pesticides to increase
    productivity are not supporting the sustainable rice yields production because
    these activities are not environmentally friendly farming systems [10]. In addition
    to that, the timing for rice yields harvesting also influences the production
    of rice yields as the best timing for paddy harvesting showed a linear relationship
    with grain loss [11]. As a result, monitoring the growth of paddy is very crucial
    to sustain rice yields production. Rice production in coastal areas is frequently
    affected by typhoons. The lack of ability to manage impacts from natural events
    and disasters that include contamination of water bodies, loss of harvest, and
    destruction of irrigation systems and other agricultural infrastructure is another
    shortcoming that requires attention [12], [13]. With smart farming, the application
    of data mining and analytical techniques designed so far for prediction, detection
    and development of appropriate disaster management strategy based on the collected
    data from disasters can be used to manage these impacts and consequently support
    agriculture or farming activities with more effectively and efficiently. Variation
    within farms and region based on resource endowments, location topography and
    farmers circumstances make it difficult to apply the same strategy in maximizing
    rice yields productivity. Towards the end of the twentieth century, precision
    agriculture began to be utilized that applies information technologies to capture
    and integrate data from multiple sources (e.g., farmers, sensors) in order to
    have a more robust strategy associated with crop management and thus can be used
    to maximize agriculture productivity [14]. Unsustainable rice yields production
    [6], inefficient techniques to predict weather conditions, lack of ability to
    manage calamities [7], [8], [12], variation within farms and region [14] and poor
    logistics and storage [2]–[4] are among the reasons why smart farming should be
    adopted to sustain and optimize rice yields productivity. In this paper, we conduct
    a systematic literature review (SLR) of the latest research on intelligent data
    processing technology involved in rice smart farming focusing on the rice production
    and post-production phases of the agriculture supply chain. We describe the main
    datasets or features extracted for data modelling. We then elaborate role of machine
    learning algorithms in smart agriculture, by analyzing the applications of machine
    learning in various scenarios in the rice production and post-production phases
    of the agriculture supply chain. This paper also presents a framework that maps
    the activities defined in rice smart farming, datasets or features used in data
    modelling and machine learning algorithms used to analyze these features for each
    activity defined in the early stage of agriculture supply chain. The remainder
    of this article is organized as follows. Section II provides the literature review
    of the most recent reviews conducted related to smart farming. Section 3 describes
    the existing frameworks related to agriculture supply chain. Section 4 provides
    an in-depth analysis of the type of big data used in rice smart farming agriculture
    focusing on the variety of sources used, the variety of machine learning algorithms
    used and finally the variety tasks involved in the rice production and post-production
    phases of smart farming. The research work presented in this section is classified
    based on the sources and types of data that are used, the types of tasks involve
    in smart farming and also the type of machine learning algorithms used to model
    these data. Section 5 presents a framework that maps the activities defined in
    smart farming, datasets or features used in data modelling and machine learning
    algorithms used to analyze these features for each activity defined in the early
    stage of agriculture supply chain. Finally, Section 6 concludes this paper and
    presents challenges and technological trends towards the exploitation of multiple
    sources in the era of big data in agriculture. SECTION II. Literature Review A
    survey has been conducted to look into the global coverage in terms of innovation
    related to smart farming and the usage of machine learning in smart farming. The
    survey was conducted by using two methods; looking at the trends of number of
    scholarly works over time related to Smart Farming, Machine Learning in Smart
    Agriculture, Artificial Intelligence in Smart Agriculture and Internet of Things
    in Smart Agriculture, and reviewing all review studies that were conducted on
    several elements of I4.0 and its applications in smart farming for improving the
    productivity. Firstly, the trends of number of scholarly works over time related
    to Smart Farming, Machine Learning in Smart Agriculture, Artificial Intelligence
    in Smart Agriculture and Internet of Things in Smart Agriculture, can be obtained
    by using the Lens website (https://www.lens.org). Lens provides open datasets
    of patent documents, scholarly research works and any inventions related to machine
    learning, artificial intelligence, internet of things and smart farming disclosed
    in patents [15]. The Lens serves global patent and scholarly knowledge as a public
    resource to make science- and technology-enabled problem solving more effective,
    efficient and inclusive. This knowledge may help show ways forward such as new
    or repurposed ideas and inventions, better strategies and targeted partnerships
    for collective action. Based on these four keywords used in searching for trends
    in smart farming research, the usage of Machine Learning (ML) in smart farming,
    the usage of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in smart farming and the usage of Internet
    of Things (IoT) in smart farming, Fig. 1 through Fig. 4 display the increasing
    trends of number of scholarly works over time related to these keywords. For instance,
    based on these Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, several scholarly works have
    been filed and recorded and the number of scholarly works filed has increased
    between the year of 2018 and 2019. FIGURE 1. The trends of scholarly works over
    time related to Smart Farming. Show All FIGURE 2. The trends of scholarly works
    over time related to Machine Learning in Smart Farming. Show All FIGURE 3. The
    trends of scholarly works over time related to Artificial Intelligence in Smart
    Farming. Show All FIGURE 4. The trends of scholarly works over time related to
    Internet of Things in Smart Farming. Show All Secondly, in the past, few review
    studies were conducted on several elements of I4.0 and its applications in smart
    farming for improving the productivity in agriculture sectors as mentioned in
    Table 1. These studies have focused on I4.0 applications in the smart farming
    covering specific aspects like Internet of Things, Cloud Computing and Big Data
    Analytics (Machine Learning). Table 1 shows several reviews that were conducted
    recently that are related to smart farming or precision agriculture. Several reviews
    conducted were focusing on the application of machine learning algorithms in smart
    farming [16], [17]. For instance, Sharma et al. investigated the current state
    of research on machine learning (ML) applications in Agriculture Supply Chain
    (ASC) that includes the application of ML in four different phases in ASC; pre-production,
    production, processing and distribution [16]. It was concluded that all three
    ML algorithms can be leveraged to develop a sustainable ASC. A Machine Learning-Agriculture
    Supply Chain performance framework was introduced in which the machine learning
    algorithms are mapped into all four different phases in ASC based on the type
    of data used. However, these data are not explained and categorized comprehensively.
    TABLE 1 Review Papers: Elements of I4.0 and its Applications in Smart Farming
    Mekonnen et al. conducted a review on the application of various machine learning
    methods in analyzing data captured from sensors within the agricultural ecosystem
    [17]. In this review, a limited number of machine learning algorithms is listed
    based on the data that are captured using different types of Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSN) (e.g., ZigBee WSN, GSM and GPS WSN, LoRa WSN, Wifi and MQTT Sensor based
    with Raspberry pi and Arduino) and also remotely sensed data (multispectral or
    hyperspectral data) and vegetation indices. Based on the trend obtained from this
    review, there will be an increased use of more advanced techniques like distributed
    (or edge) deep learning. Several reviews also conducted focusing on the application
    of deep learning algorithms only in smart farming [18]–[21]. One of the findings
    from these reviews is that the deep learning algorithms are proven to be better
    in providing high accuracy results compared with other machine learning algorithms
    in terms of accuracy when applied to various agricultural problems, such as disease
    detection and identification, fruit or plants classification and fruit counting
    among other domains. The evolution of agriculture systems involves the adoption
    of incoming data from various sources [27] and also the application of big data
    applications in smart farming [26]. Together these big data technologies and the
    capability of machine learning algorithms in forecasting certain outcomes will
    cause major changes in the scope and organization of smart farming [16], [17],
    [26]. Lytos et al. conducted a survey paper that covers the state-of-the-art big
    data architectures and agriculture systems in order to bridge the knowledge gap
    between agriculture systems and exploitation of big data. However, in this review,
    the authors list out the name of the databases and features used in the agriculture
    systems only without outlining how these data are processed or analyzed. The quality
    and type of dataset collected from sensors greatly influence the performance of
    the forecasting algorithm in predicting the crop yields. For instance, in optimizing
    the performance of forecasting crop yields, Fabrizio Balducci et al. have investigated
    the performance of several machine learning algorithms based on different subsets
    of features extracted from the environmental sensors [29]. There are quite a number
    of reviews conducted related to Internet of Things (IoT) technologies [38]. The
    emergence of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies has also improved the performance
    of a real-time monitoring of the data related to smart farming [20]. IoT are mainly
    used in monitoring crop, soil and weather, forecasting disease and crop yields,
    controlling irrigation machinery and autonomous vehicles and robots [22]. Based
    on several reviews, it can be concluded that incorporating precision livestock
    farming technologies (Sensors), big data analytics, and the IoT in smart farming
    practices puts forth a possible solution to assist us to improve agriculture productivity
    and meet projected global agricultural product demands [23]–[25], [28]. The increasing
    amount and variety of data captured and obtained by these emerging technologies
    in IoT offer the smart farming strategy new abilities to predict changes and identify
    opportunities. However, to the best of our knowledge, no such studies are conducted
    to review comprehensively the present mapping of datasets or features and machine
    learning algorithms based on different types of tasks involved in the paddy rice
    production and post-production phases of the ASC. There are several related works
    conducted about the applications of machine learning on the paddy rice smart farming.
    Several researches have been conducted that apply machine learning algorithm (e.g.,
    Support Vector Machine (SVM) [46], [98], [127], Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
    [94], [95], and hybrid approaches [103], [124]) in paddy rice sample recognition
    and classification using high-resolution images. Remotely sensed, vegetation indices
    and climate data are commonly used to predict paddy rice yield estimation [34],
    [35], [48], [76], [77], [109] and to monitor paddy rice growth [63], [73], [84]
    using artificial neural networks and its variants and also linear regression approaches.
    In addition to that, hyperspectral and high-resolution images have been used to
    accurately and affectively monitor paddy rice disease [40], [41], [87], [88],
    [118] and assessing quality of paddy rice [93], [104], [105] by using deep learning
    algorithms. In this paper, we will present a framework that maps three elements
    which include a) Paddy rice production and post-production activities defined
    in the ASC, b) datasets or features related to agriculture components captured
    from sensors, and c) machine learning algorithms used to analyze these features
    for each activities defined in the early stage of ASC. This is done by Identifying
    the phases and tasks involved in the paddy rice smart farming that require intelligent
    data processing technologies. Describing the main datasets or features captured
    and used by intelligent data processing technologies in each task identified in
    the paddy rice smart farming. Elaborating the roles of machine learning technology
    in paddy rice smart agriculture, by analyzing the applications of machine learning
    in various tasks and phases in the paddy rice smart farming. SECTION III. Phases
    and Tasks in Paddy Rice Smart Farming This paper focuses on the smart farming
    technologies used in paddy growth and production. This section elaborates the
    selected phases and tasks involved in the paddy rice smart farming [16]. The applications
    of machine learning algorithms and smart technologies in the agriculture supply
    chain can be divided into 4 phases and include pre-production, production, post-production
    and finally distribution phases [16], [30], [31]. However, in this work, we focus
    on several tasks that require intelligent data processing technologies that can
    be fully utilized to improve the production of paddy rice. Thus, this review focuses
    on the rice production and post-production phases. In the rice production phase,
    several activities are conducted sequentially such as planting, managing water,
    monitoring soil fertility, managing weed and finally managing pests and diseases.
    Then, in the rice post-production phase, the activities can be divided into harvesting,
    drying, storage and milling and processing. Based on these phases and tasks, we
    will look into the features or datasets that are applied by machine learning algorithms
    in this rice production processes. The SLR framework used for presenting the review
    findings is presented in Fig. 5. Fig. 5 highlights two main categories which are
    the paddy growing activities and the smart farming activities associated with
    the paddy growing activities. The paddy growing activities can be divided into
    production and post-production phases. The first step in rice production phase
    is planting. Rice crops can either be direct seeded or transplanted. Next, ensuring
    the rice plant to get adequate water is very important since rice is extremely
    sensitive to water shortages. Managing good practices for smart paddy irrigation
    is very critical to maximize water efficiency and yield. Smart irrigation for
    paddy rice deals with maintaining a predetermined water height in paddy fields
    automatically based on the growth stages of the paddy rice [32], [33]. Managing
    weeds is crucial to reduce the amount of weed pressure in the field. Next, monitoring
    soil fertility is also very essential to optimize the growth of a rice plant.
    At the same time, timely and accurate diagnosis of paddy diseases and managing
    pests are highly required to reduce loses. Monitoring paddy rice disease involves
    activities such as detection and recognition of diseases from paddy plant leaf
    images [37], [39] or classifying, detecting, and predicting infestation patterns
    of the Brown Planthopper in rice paddies [40], [41]. Generally, monitoring the
    growth of paddy rice involves analyzing the growth of paddy rice based on climate
    data or remotely sensed data and vegetation indices. This also includes developing
    an approach for mapping rice-growing areas at field level using phenology-based
    rice crop classification or paddy growth stages classification [34]–[36]. Predicting
    paddy rice yield estimation involves tasks such as yield assessment of paddy fields
    using machine learning algorithms [42] or mapping rice planted area using the
    hyperspectral data or remotely sensed data and vegetation indices [43]. FIGURE
    5. Rice production and post-production phases in paddy rice smart farming. Show
    All In the rice post-production phase, paddy harvesting activities include reaping,
    stacking, handling, threshing, cleaning, and hauling. Harvesting paddy should
    be performed efficiently as the speed of paddy harvesting showed a linear relationship
    with grain loss [11]. When rice is harvested, it will contain up to 25% moisture.
    High moisture level during storage can lead to grain discoloration, encourage
    development of molds, and increase the likelihood of attack from pests. It can
    also decrease the germination rate of the rice seed. Assessing the quality of
    paddy rice can be performed by using any machine learning algorithms. Assessing
    the quality of paddy rice usually involves activities such as assessing the quality
    of the rice [44] or investigating the impact of climate change on paddy rice production
    [45]. Next, drying process will involve the process of drying paddy by using traditional
    or mechanical systems. It is important to dry rice grain as soon as possible after
    harvesting (ideally within 24 hours). After that, these dried rice grain will
    be stored to prevent grain loss caused by adverse weather, moisture, rodents,
    birds, insects and micro-organisms like fungi. Finally, the last activity in the
    post-production phase is the milling process which remove the husk and the bran
    layers, and produce an edible, white rice. Paddy rice sample recognition and classification
    can be applied to perform the milling process. In paddy rice sample recognition
    and classification, the main task is to separate and classify objects of rice
    sample based on color and texture features with the help of image processing and
    machine learning techniques [46], [47]. SECTION IV. Application of Big Data and
    Machine Learning in Rice Production Tasks A. Big Data Used in Rice Production
    Tasks Data that are commonly used in paddy rice smart farming can be categorized
    into sensor data, remotely sensed data and vegetation indices, drone based data
    and finally paddy rice leaf analysis data. Table 2 tabulates the types of data
    and features used in paddy rice smart farming according to the smart farming activities
    described in Fig. 5. TABLE 2 Types of Data and Features Used in Paddy Rice Smart
    Farming TABLE 3 Applications of Smart Technologies (e.g., Internet of Things (IoT))
    in Various Scenarios in the Paddy Rice Pre-Production and Production Phases of
    the ASC 1) Sensor Data Firstly, the typical types of sensor data captured that
    can be used in monitoring paddy rice growth or yield estimation of paddy rice
    are data related to meteorological. Meteorological data (or climate data) can
    be used to monitor paddy rice growth [45], [48] and disease [41]. For instance,
    Guruprasad et al. conducted a yield estimation modeling paddy crop at different
    spatial resolution (SR) levels based on weather and soil data as input features.
    These features include day and night temperature (min, max, mean), diffused irradiance,
    precipitation (cumulative), relative humidity, wind speed, rainfall, pH, soil
    moisture and temperature (0-40cm) [48]. It was observed that the disease incidence
    on paddy rice growth is also directly affected by the level of temperature, wetness
    duration [50], [51]. Paddy rice production is also affected by the level of precipitation.
    For instance, the paddy rice production was found to be affected by the decreasing
    post-monsoon precipitation as this time coincides with the sensitivity of the
    paddy fruiting and ripening stages [54]. Besides that, winds may also affect the
    growth and production of paddy rice plants as strong winds are very detrimental
    to the growth and production of rice plants, especially when they occur during
    the flowering and ripening phases of rice [49]. Rainfall was found to be the main
    climate driver of the paddy rice yield [111]. The suitable soil pH for rice cultivation
    is at pH 6.0 [52] or 6.25 [53]. Analyzing the nitrogen level of paddy rice can
    also be used to assess the quality of paddy rice [105]. 2) Remotely Sensed Data
    and Vegetation Indices Secondly, remote sensing data or remotely sensed data and
    vegetation indices can be used in different ways in estimating paddy yield, monitoring
    paddy growth and diseases. Many studies are based on the mapping of rice-growing
    are [35], [43] [57], mapping cropping patterns [57]–[59], mapping paddy vulnerability
    to flooding [58]. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors
    have a total of 36 spectral bands and seven of them are related to vegetation
    and land surfaces that include several ranges [60]. Seven of the most used spectral
    bands includes Red (620–670 nm) - Band 1 Near Infrared One (NIR1) (841–875 nm)
    - Band 2 Blue (459–479 nm) - Band 3 Green (545–565 nm) - Band 4 Near Infrared
    Two (NIR2) (1230–1250 nm) - Band 5 Shortwave Infrared One (SWIR1) (1628–1652 nm)
    - Band 6 Shortwave Infrared Two (SWIR2) (2105–2155 nm) - Band 7 Based on these
    spectral bands, several measurements can be derived and computed such as Land
    Surface Water Index (LSWI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Normalized Difference
    Vegetation Index (NDVI), Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), Leaf
    Area Index (LAI) (see Table 2). LSWI is sensitive to the total amount of liquid
    water in vegetation and its soil background. LSWI was developed by considering
    two bands of the shortwave infrared (SWIR) and the NIR regions of the electromagnetic
    spectrum to compute the estimation of water content of the land surface [61].
    LSWI is computed based on Eq. 1; LSWI= ρNIR−ρSWIR1 ρNIR+ρSWIR1 (1) View Source
    where ρ NIR is the reflectance in the NIR, ρ SWIR1 is the reflectance in the Shortwave
    Infrared One. LSWI can be used to detect and classify paddy rice phenology in
    paddy fields with complex cropping patterns [35], [62]. It was also used to assess
    the damage of regional rainfed paddy rice after severe floods [44] and monitoring
    rice growth [63]. Liou and Sha found that the value of LSWI increases and becomes
    higher that NDVI and EVI [44]. EVI can be used to quantify vegetation greenness
    [64]. Son et al. have constructed a time-series EVI and LSWI data in order to
    perform the phenology-based rice crop classification [35]. EVI can be measured
    as follows; EVI=G× ρNIR−ρRed ρNIR+( C 1 ×ρred− C 2 ×ρBlue)+L (2) View Source where
    ρ NIR is the reflectance in the NIR, ρ Red is the reflectance in the red, ρ Blue
    is the reflectance in the blue, C1, C2, and L are coefficients and G is the gain
    factor. The coefficients adopted in the MODIS-EVI algorithm are; L=1 , C 1 =6
    , C 2 =7.5 , and G=2.5 . EVI is normally combined with other vegetation indices
    (e.g., NDVI, LSWI) to predict paddy rice yields’ estimation [35], [58] [59], [62],
    assess damage of regional rainfed paddy rice [44] and monitor rice growth [62],
    [63]. The results of applying MODIS-based paddy rice phenological detection algorithm
    in classifying paddy growth stages are found to be encouraging and can be used
    to monitor paddy rice agriculture at a larger scale [62], [63]. Indices that correlate
    with vegetation cover are also used in estimating paddy yield and monitoring paddy
    growth such as the NDVI, which is mostly used to predict paddy rice yields’ estimation
    [43], [57], [59], assessing damage of regional rainfed paddy rice [44] and monitoring
    rice growth [63]. NVDI is used to measure the level of greenness and biomass of
    vegetation. NDVI measurements are most often taken from satellites in orbit around
    the Earth. NDVI can be computed based on differences in the response patterns
    of vegetation in the red and NIR ranges as follows [65]; NDVI= ρNIR−ρRed ρNIR+ρRed
    (3) View Source where ρ NIR is the reflectance in the NIR and ρ Red is the reflectance
    in the red and this NDVI ranges between -1 (no vegetation) and +1 (green vegetation).
    Both the NDVI and EVI are most commonly used vegetation indices to monitor the
    health of vegetation on the fields [35], [43], [57], [59], [66]–[69]. However,
    some researchers have reported that EVI is often preferred than NDVI as EVI is
    more responsive to biophysical variables, such as LAI [35], [67]. For instance,
    EVI is more robust in capturing the difference in well-vegetated areas [67]. MNDWI
    is computed based on differences in the response patterns of vegetation in the
    green and SWIR1 ranges for the enhancement of open water features [70] and can
    be measured as follows; MNDWI= ρGreen−ρSWIR1 ρGreen+ρSWIR1 (4) View Source where
    ρ NIR is the reflectance in the NIR, ρ SWIR1 is the reflectance in the Shortwave
    Infrared One. The integration of NDVI and MNDWI from Sentinel-2A image has shown
    increased accuracy of predicting the paddy rice yield estimation [57]. LAI is
    a dimensionless quantity that characterizes plant canopies that typically can
    be defined as the ratio of one sided leaf area per unit ground area ( m 2 / m
    2 ) and can be considered as a measure of paddy crop growth and productivity since
    it characterizes plant canopy structure and gives an idea of the amount of biomass
    available in a field. LAI can be measured using a plant canopy analyzer [71].
    Some works have been conducted to estimate paddy rice LAI with a fixed point continuous
    observation of near infrared reflectance using a calibrated digital camera [71],
    [72]. Estimating paddy rice LAI can also be done using machine learning methods
    [69] and also statistical methods [73] based on hyperspectral data. The leaf area
    index (LAI) and plant nitrogen concentration (PNC) were also used to estimate
    the nitrogen nutritional index (NNI) in paddy rice [74]. Hyperspectral images
    (Red, Blue, Green and Near Infrared One) can also be used to predict paddy rice
    yield estimation [75]–[77], assess the quality of paddy rice [69], [71], [72],
    [78], [79] and monitor paddy rice disease [80], [81]. Another remotely sensed
    data that is widely used in smart farming called C-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar
    (SAR) data. C-Band SAR data can be obtained from the Sentinel-1A satellite which
    provides a collection of data in all-weather, day or night. C-Band SAR data has
    been used in a wide range of applications that include sea and land monitoring.
    For instance, C-Band SAR has been used in predicting paddy rice yield estimation
    [82], monitoring paddy rice growth [83] and monitoring paddy rice disease [40].
    3) Drone Based Data Next, drone based data include all imageries captured using
    the drone technology. The high resolution images captured using drone can be used
    to estimate the paddy rice yield [42], [84]–[86], monitor paddy rice disease [37],
    [39], [87]–[92], classify paddy rice samples [46], [47], [93]–[101] and also assess
    the quality of paddy rice [102]–[104]. For instance, a near real-time deep learning
    approach for detecting rice phenology has also been designed based on high resolutions
    images taken by using drones [86]. For instance, a SVM classifier can be used
    to perform segmentation and classification of paddy rice samples [46]. The prediction
    of nitrogen deficiency of rice crop can also be done to access the quality of
    the rice using deep learning methods [104]. B. Applications of Machine Learning
    Algorithms in Paddy Rice Smart Farming This section elaborates the roles of machine
    learning technology in paddy rice smart agriculture, by analyzing the applications
    of machine learning algorithms and smart technologies in various scenarios in
    the paddy rice production and post-production phases of the ASC. As mentioned
    earlier, intelligent data processing technologies can be applied in various scenarios
    in all the paddy rice production and post-production phases of the ASC and these
    tasks include smart irrigation for paddy rice, predicting paddy rice yield estimation,
    monitoring paddy rice growth, monitoring paddy rice disease, assessing quality
    of paddy rice, paddy rice sample recognition and classification. The state-of-the-art
    for the tasks involved in the smart paddy rice farming is illustrated in Fig.
    6. First, all the acquired data (Sensor, Remotely sensed data and vegetation indices,
    and drone based data) will be cleaned, fusioned or integrated. Then, the dimensionality
    of the data can be reduced using feature selection, construction, transformation
    and weighting processes [162]–[164]. Next, once the data are prepared, then they
    will be divided into training and testing data depending on the types of task
    (e.g., classification, regression or clustering) or machine learning algorithms
    (e.g., estimation, linear and non-linear methods) used to model the data. Finally,
    model evaluation and interpretation will be performed to extract knowledge that
    supports the tasks in the smart paddy rice farming (e.g., Paddy Yield Estimation,
    Monitoring Paddy Growth, Assessing the Quality of Paddy Rice, Determining Paddy
    Rice Classes and Monitoring Paddy Rice Diseases). FIGURE 6. State-of-the-art for
    the tasks involved in the smart paddy rice farming. Show All 1) Smart Irrigation
    System for Paddy Rice Automatic drip irrigation system requires a lesser amount
    of water to maintain a predetermined water height in paddy fields [32], [33] and
    this system can be controlled based on the captured climate data (e.g., temperature,
    humidity, light and rain) from sensors. Using a wireless sensor and actuator network
    (WSAN) to build a smart irrigation system for paddy fields can also conserve significant
    amount of water [106], [107]. Automatic irrigation system can cause a significant
    increase of rice production by making more arable land available for paddy rice
    plantation [33]. Besides that, smart sensors for climate and soil [36], [36],
    Radio-frequency identification (RFID), load Sensor and Global Positioning System
    (GPS) are also used in estimating paddy rice yield [113], [114]. Table 3 tabulates
    the applications of smart sensors (Internet of Things (IoT)) in various tasks
    involved in paddy rice smart farming. 2) Predicting Paddy Rice Yield Estimation
    Most researches model the paddy rice estimation based on the hyperspectral and
    climate data in predicting paddy rice yield estimation (see Table 4). These studies
    conducted using various types of remotely sensed data and vegetation indices to
    predict paddy rice yield estimation [34], [35], [57], [58], [67]. Thus, one of
    the issues is determining the best combination of data obtained from remotely
    sensed data and vegetation indices to improve the accuracy of predicting paddy
    rice yield estimation. For instance, the integration of NDVI and MNDWI from Sentinel-2A
    image with temporal backscatter increased the accuracy by 0.08 [57]. Combining
    hyperspectral data (e.g., NDVI and MNDWI) will also increase the accuracy of estimating
    the paddy rice yield by using Classification And Regression Trees (CART) [57].
    CART is one of the variants of Decision Tree (DT) classifiers that can be used
    for classification or regression predictive modeling problems [57], [66], [144].
    DT is one of important types of algorithm for supervised learning, particularly
    in predictive modeling [78], [81], [126]. DT are constructed via an algorithmic
    approach that optimizes the splitting of a data set based on different conditions
    of the data features. In addition to that, using multi-features fusion method
    can also improve the accuracy of predicting paddy rice yields using a deep learning
    approach [112]. TABLE 4 Applications of Machine Learning Algorithms in Predicting
    Paddy Rice Yield Estimation Partial Least Squares (PLS) algorithm can be found
    in many researches conducted to estimate the paddy rice yields [34], [35], [75].
    For instance, short wave infrared region was found to be very essential for estimating
    the paddy yield using PLS algorithm [34]. PLS was developed based on the principal
    component regression that can be used to build models that can predict more than
    one dependent variable [63], [69], [136]. PLS was also found to produce higher
    R2 of 0.984 compared to Principal Components Regression (PCR) in predicting paddy
    rice yield estimation [75]. PCR is based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
    that is used to analyze the multiple regression data that suffer from multicollinearity
    [132] (e.g., predicting paddy rice yield estimation [75]). Before any modelling
    can be performed, PCA can be used to extract features of the datasets [128]. PCA
    is a well-known technique used for reducing the dimensionality of the datasets
    [129]. This is done to increase the interpretability but at the same time minimizing
    information loss [130], [131]. A few variants of deep learning algorithms have
    also been used to predict paddy rice yield estimation based on NDVI [109], climate
    data [48], [110]–[112], [155] and hyperspectral data (Bands 1~4) [75]–[77] with
    higher accuracy results. These deep learning algorithms include Artificial Neural
    Network (ANN) [48], [77], [110], [111], Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) [76],
    [109], [112], Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) [155]). For instance, neural network
    algorithms achieved better overall accuracy compared to Random Forest (RF) and
    Support Vector Machine (SVM) using either the hyperspectral or climate data [48],
    [109], [110]. Inspired by the way biological nervous systems, ANN is basically
    an information processing technique that works like the way human brain processes
    information [150]. An ordinary neural network may consist of hidden layers and
    weights while CNN has filters which collectively make up the convolution layers.
    CNN is most commonly applied to analyze images and it is a class of deep neural
    networks. CNN is suitable to be used for spatial data such as images. In contrast,
    RNN is suitable to be used for temporal data which is also called sequential data.
    Compared to ANN, RNN is able to learn time-series data since it has a recurrent
    connection on the hidden state and this looping constraint ensures that sequential
    information is captured in the input data [151], [155]. Although, deep learning
    algorithms are known to be very effective and robust to forecast yields paddy
    rice yield estimation, [76], [77], [109], [111], [155] they require a large amount
    of time-series data to improve the prediction performance [112]. RF requires two
    parameters namely the number of trees and the number of features to split the
    data set based on different conditions [143]. RF has been found to be effective
    in predicting paddy rice yield estimation and monitoring paddy rice growth [48],
    [82]. Several works related to applying SVM in paddy rice smart farming have been
    reviewed in this paper [48], [109]. However, they produced lower accuracies compared
    to deep learning algorithms. SVM is a supervised machine learning model that can
    be used for binary classification tasks [146]. The objective of the SVM is to
    find the optimum hyperplane in an N-dimensional space that can distinctly classifies
    the data points. Unsupervised learning algorithm can also be used to predict the
    paddy rice estimation using the hyperspectral data [58]. For instance, Iterative
    Self-Organizing (ISO) has been used to generate paddy cropping pattern to predict
    paddy rice yield estimation [58]. ISO is an unsupervised learning algorithm that
    can be used to generate rice cropping patterns [58]. The ISO algorithm is a modification
    of the k -means clustering algorithm. The merging and splitting of clusters are
    based on a predefined threshold by the user. If the difference of distance in
    multispectral feature space is less than the predefined threshold, the merging
    or splitting of clusters will be performed [153]. There are several optimization
    approaches that produce estimates of unknown variables or parameters based on
    a series of measurements observed over time, such as the Extended Kalman Filter
    (EKF), Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) and Moving horizon estimation (MHE) [133],
    that can be used to predict paddy rice yield estimation. Moving Horizon Estimator
    with Pre-Estimation (MHE-PE) is an optimization-based estimator introduced and
    use an auxiliary estimator to describe the dynamics of the state over the horizon
    [134], [135]. MHE-PE is found to be more effective compared to MHE [68] for crop
    start date estimation in tropical area [68]. Some of the limitations found in
    these studies include the resolution limitations, topographic effects and limited
    and small size of time-series data that lead to estimation errors. For instance,
    the low fractional coverage of small-size rice paddies in the complex and hilly
    landscapes could also lower the probability of identification using the OTSU’s
    algorithm [108]. OTSU’s method is an image segmentation algorithm that segments
    a gray level image with only one modal distribution in gray level histogram [100],
    [148]. Stepwise classification (SW) is another classification approach that applies
    a strategy that combines two heterogeneous data sets in a novel way, and this
    can be used in estimating rice yields production [67]. Table 4 tabulates the applications
    of machine various learning algorithms found in some of works to predict paddy
    rice yield estimation. 3) Monitoring Paddy Rice Growth Monitoring the growth of
    paddy rice can be performed by mapping paddy rice and assessing the growth stages
    of the paddy rice. One of the issues or challenges in monitoring paddy rice growth
    using machine learning algorithms is to determine the optimum features combination.
    With optimum features combination, the overall accuracy of the classification
    results can be improved [115]. For instance, the optimum features combination
    can be achieved by using the robust adaptive spatial temporal fusion model (RASTFM)
    [116]. NDVI [63], [66], [69], [115], EVI [63] and Hyperspectral bands 1~4 [73],
    [78] are the most commonly used in monitoring the growth of paddy rice. The Multilayer
    Perceptron (MLP) [63], a class of feedforward ANN, and RF [69], [115] algorithms
    show better accuracies [69], [115] compared to PLS, SVM [63], [78], [83] and Support
    Vector Regression (SVR) [69] in performing the paddy growth stages classification.
    SVR is characterized by the use of kernels, sparse solution, and the original
    control of the margin and the number of support vectors [141]. SVR trains using
    a symmetrical loss function, which equally penalizes high and low misestimates
    and it has been proven to be an effective algorithm in estimating real-value [69].
    Least-squares support-vector machines (LS-SVM) is found to produce better results
    compared to Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and PLS, in estimating LAI of paddy
    rice from optimal hyperspectral bands [73]. LS-SVMs are least-squares versions
    of SVM which can be used for classification and regression analysis problems [73],
    [123], [140]. MLR is a statistical technique that uses several independent variables
    to predict the outcome of the dependent variable [34], [73], [111], [137]. Multiple
    regression is an extension of linear (OLS) regression that applies only one independent
    variable. Besides remotely sensed data, vegetation indices, climate and soil data
    obtained from smart sensors are also used in monitoring paddy rice growth [36],
    [36] (see Table 3). Table 5 tabulates the applications of machine various learning
    algorithms in monitoring paddy rice growth. TABLE 5 Applications of Machine Learning
    Algorithms in Monitoring Paddy Rice Growth 4) Monitoring Paddy Rice Disease The
    color of the paddy rice leaves will change when they are infected by any disease
    and these colored spots are created on leaves. For that reason, most of the researches
    used high-resolution images in monitoring the paddy rice disease [37], [39], [41],
    [87]–[92], [117]–[120] and hyperspectral images [80], [81] to detect and assess
    the paddy rice diseases. The ANN algorithm and its variants, CNN, are found to
    be very effective in classifying task for monitoring the paddy rice diseases [39]–[41],
    [81], [87], [88], [90], [118]. For instance, the ANN achieved better classification
    results compared to FC and SVM algorithms [39] and the calibrated CNN model still
    showed good classification ability in a small-scale sample set and it was selected
    as the best classification model compared to DT, k -NN and SVM [81]. However,
    CNN requires a large number of samples for training purposes [88], [112]. In fuzzy
    classification (FC) applications, once a set of classes has been defined, one
    can determine the degree of membership of every object x under consideration [149].
    Fuzzy classification allows object x to belong to two or more classes. k -Nearest
    Neigbour ( k -NN) algorithm is also very effective in detecting diseases from
    paddy plant leaf images and identifying Brown Planthopper in paddy field and other
    classification problems [37], [81], [92], [96], [117]. Given an unknown sample,
    k -NN finds k samples that are nearest to this unknown sample based on certain
    distance functions (e.g., Euclidean or Cosine distance methods) and take the average
    of the response variables from these k samples as the label (class) of the unknown
    samples [145]. k -NN can be used for paddy rice sample classification [59], [99],
    [103]. Compared to SVM, k -NN produces better accuracy in detecting and recognizing
    diseases from paddy plant leaf images [37]. Some combined approaches show promising
    results that involve deep learning approaches [40], [41] and SVM algorithms [40],
    [91]. For instance, a combination approach of two machine learning algorithms
    (e.g., CNN+SVM ) has been used to identify the cultivated paddy regions (e.g.,
    Using CNN), and to detect areas damaged (e.g., Using SVM) by Brown Planthopper
    attacks [40]. Other works include building a semantic framework that models an
    ontology related to rice plant knowledge and applying this framework to help farmers
    to identify rice diseases, receive early warnings of possible spreadable diseases,
    and receive treatments based on multiple observations [121]. Minimum Distance
    Classifier (MDC) achieved better accuracy compared to k -NN in classifying high-resolution
    images for monitoring paddy rice disease [117]. MDC classifies unknown sample
    data to classes which minimize the distance between this sample data and the class
    in multi-feature space [147]. One of the works reviewed has applied MDC to classify
    images in the task of monitoring and controlling rice diseases using Image processing
    techniques [117]. There are also researches conducted on developing expert systems
    using optimized fuzzy inference system (OFIS) [122] and forward chaining [89]
    for monitoring paddy rice disease. Table 6 tabulates the applications of machine
    various learning algorithms in monitoring paddy rice disease. TABLE 6 Applications
    of Machine Learning Algorithms in Monitoring Paddy Rice Disease 5) Assessing Quality
    of Paddy Rice The quality of paddy rice can be assessed using the hyperspectral
    data [74], [79], climate and soil data [105] and also high-resolution images of
    the paddy rice [93], [104], [123]. SVM and CNN algorithms are the two most commonly
    used machine learning algorithms for assessing the quality of paddy rice [79],
    [93], [104], [105], [123]. CNN is found to be more effective compared to SVM algorithm
    in assessing the quality of the paddy rice [93]. However, a combination of classical
    artificial neural networks and SVM also has been used to predict nitrogen deficiency
    of rice crop [104]. Fuzzy c-means (FCM) has also been used to assess the quality
    of the paddy rice. FCM is a method of clustering which allows one piece of data
    to belong to two or more clusters [74], [154]. Table 7 tabulates the applications
    of machine various learning algorithms in assessing quality of paddy rice. TABLE
    7 Applications of Machine Learning Algorithms in Assessing Quality of Paddy Rice
    6) Paddy Rice Sample Classification Machine learning algorithms are normally combined
    with computer vision techniques to perform paddy rice sample classification with
    more effectively. Applying computer vision and machine learning techniques to
    recognize and classify rice varieties is a method that can be used to increase
    the accuracy of classification process in real applications. Several studies have
    been conducted that apply and examine several morphological and textural features
    of rice seeds’ images to evaluate their efficacy in identification of rice varieties
    [97] and classification of paddy rice adulteration levels [96]. In most studies
    related to the application of machine learning algorithm for paddy rice sample
    classification, deep learning algorithms are found to be very effective in classifying
    rice samples [94]–[97], [99], [101], [124]. The classification of the paddy rice
    samples can be improved with PCA-based reduced features [96], [103], [124]. PCA
    can be combined with other classifiers to improve the accuracy of paddy rice sample
    classification [96], [103], [124] and also to perform qualitative analysis in
    monitoring paddy rice disease [80]. Deep learning algorithms (e.g., BPNN, CNN)
    produced better accuracy compared to SVM algorithm [46], [101] in classifying
    paddy rice samples [95], [96]. When the label or number of varieties are not available,
    an unsupervised learning algorithm, such as clustering algorithm, can also be
    used to cluster paddy rice samples. For instance, k -Means clustering algorithm
    provides clusters with considerable separability as measured using separability
    index measures [103] based on the PCA-based reduced features. In k -means clustering,
    n observations are partitioned into k clusters in which each observation is assigned
    to the nearest cluster centroid. The k -means clustering is also known as a method
    of vector quantization [152]. By using the k -means clustering method in paddy
    rice sample classification, the H channel data can provide clusters with considerable
    separability as measured using separability index measures [103]. k -means clustering
    also can be used as part of the approach to classify the annual cropping patterns
    of paddy crop based on k number of classes [59]. Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost)
    has been used to classify paddy rice samples. AdaBoost algorithm combines multiple
    weak classifiers to form a single strong classifier [91], [95], [142]. AdaBoost
    is also known as ensemble method as it consists of multiple weak classifiers.
    However, deep learning algorithms are found to be more superior than AdaBoost
    algorithm in classifying paddy rice samples [91], [95]. A multi-classifier cascade
    based rice spike detection method has also been proposed that consists of SVM,
    CNN and k -Means algorithm [99]. Other works include training machine learning
    algorithms to predict weight and size of rice kernels [125], application of machine
    learning algorithm in detecting adulterated admixtures of white rice based on
    mass spectrometry data [126] and classifying organic rice samples using original
    rice elements [127]. Table 8 tabulates the applications of machine various learning
    algorithms in paddy rice sample classification. TABLE 8 Applications of Machine
    Learning Algorithms in Paddy Rice Sample Classification SECTION V. Results and
    Conclusion Based on the reviews of several works in this paper, a new framework
    is proposed that maps three entities that include big data, machine learning and
    paddy rice smart farming tasks. In this review, the types of machine learning
    algorithms used are highly dependent on the availability of data. At the same
    time, the type of data required depends directly on the type of tasks stated in
    each production and post-production phases of paddy rice smart farming. These
    machine learning algorithms are used to perform the intelligent data processing
    that will assist farmers in various tasks mentioned in the production and post-production
    phases. Based on the findings summarized in the previous sections, machine learning
    algorithms and smart technologies can be used to improve the overall efficiency
    of the paddy rice production system. The potential benefits lead to an improvement
    in the return of investment (ROI) for all paddy rice production systems by minimizing
    the losses or costs involved in the production of paddy rice. As a result, we
    use these findings found in the literature to map these three components (e.g.,
    datasets, machine learning algorithms and tasks stated in the production of paddy
    rice) and develop a Big Data-ML-Task applications framework that can be used by
    the practitioners. The proposed framework shown in Fig. 7 has three main components,
    the types of datasets, types of ML algorithms, the types of tasks in paddy rice
    smart farming and paddy rice supply chain performance. FIGURE 7. Mapping of big
    data, machine learning and paddy rice smart farming tasks. Show All With smart
    irrigation system, the usage of water can be reduced and at the same time fully
    utilized to increase the paddy rice yield [32], [106], [107]. Automatic irrigation
    system also may cause a significant increase of rice production by making more
    arable land available for paddy rice plantation [33]. The task of estimating the
    yield of paddy rice precisely is very important for national food security and
    development evaluation. The development of an integrated aerial crop monitoring
    solution using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) has motivated researchers to apply
    vegetation indices retrieved from hyperspectral images to estimate paddy rice
    yield [77]. Several studies have estimated the paddy rice yield based on time-series
    climate data [48], [110]–[112], [155]. Rainfall was found the main climate driver
    of the rice yield [111]. Other studies considered hyperspectral data to estimate
    the yield of paddy rice [34], [35], [57], [58], [67], [68], [75], [76], [108],
    [109]. Deep learning algorithms were found to be more effective compared to other
    machine learning algorithms for modeling paddy rice yield [48], [76], [77], [109]–[112],
    [155]. Maximum quality of paddy rice harvested can be obtained by using sensors
    to monitor humidity, temperature, pH, soil moisture and light intensity in real
    [113], [114]. Monitoring the growth of paddy rice is critical for understanding
    the growing status and yield estimation of paddy rice. For instance, the self-sufficient
    level (SSL) for paddy rice in Malaysia is only 70%. As the world population is
    increasing, intensifying paddy rice farming is more preferable over the expansion
    of agriculture land due to limited arable land [156]. Monitoring the growth of
    paddy rice is difficult for traditional farmers due to climate change, soil conditions,
    age of the farmers and time consumed to monitor the whole area. With remotely
    sensed data, creating paddy rice crop growth map is possible using the hyperspectral
    images [66] and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data [83], [115]. For example,
    the paddy rice growth based on rice growth parameters (e.g., rice height and biomass)
    can be monitored with the backscattering coefficient from RADARSAT-2 data [83].
    The paddy rice leaf chlorophyll contents can also be retrieved from the rice canopy
    hyperspectral imagery to analyze the paddy rice plant growth [63]. Leaf area index
    (LAI) is commonly used as a surrogate for productivity in precision agriculture
    (PA) and is widely used in plant growth [69], [73]. In short, the applications
    of machine learning algorithms have enabled us to timely and accurately monitor
    paddy rice planting area for national food security and management [115]. Using
    smart sensors to monitor soil pH, lux and temperature also provides insight in
    understanding the stages of paddy rice growth [36], [36]. Due to the lack of knowledge
    and awareness of suitable management to rectify rice plant leaf diseases, the
    rice production is being reduced in recent years [157]. The manual detection of
    plant diseases based on naked eye observation of experts is very time consuming,
    expensive and sometimes it produces an error when identifying the disease type
    [158]. Machine learning (ML) algorithm can be used to provide early warnings to
    anticipate rice blast and detect its presence, thus supporting the applications
    of biocidal chemical compounds or biological organisms used to kill parasitic
    fungi or their spores. Based on several studies reviewed in this paper, the applications
    of ML, in detecting the presence of rice blast, has also provided suitable solutions
    for preventive remedial actions targeting the mitigation of yield losses and the
    reduction of fungicide use [159]. This review will be beneficial for modelers,
    farmers and stakeholders, to guide them in model development and selection for
    the most suitable models for the effective paddy rice disease detection and forecasting.
    The identification of paddy diseases may also assist farmer in providing them
    the remedies based on the types of disease [160]. The quality of paddy rice production
    depends highly on the quality of soil properties. These soil properties include
    soils’ pH and moisture, nitrogen and organic carbon content of the soil. For instance,
    a CNN produced promising results in assessing the nitrogen deficiency of paddy
    rice crop [104]. These soil properties can be captured using sensors or retrieved
    from the hyperspectral images [74]. SVM and CNN are the two most common machine
    learning algorithms used in assessing the quality of paddy rice. Compared to SVM,
    CNN produced better assessment accuracy [93]. Besides soil properties [105], some
    studies have conducted the assessment of the paddy rice quality based on the high-resolution
    images of the paddy rice leaf [93], [104], [123] and the hyperspectral images
    of the paddy rice field [74], [79]. Improving the management and productivity
    of the paddy rice farming is important to strengthen the food security initiatives.
    Due to variation in economic value of different varieties of rice, rice quality
    identification is very important in the international and national rice market
    [97], [100], [101]. The quality of the rice is used to evaluate the milling process.
    Rice sample may consist of full rice, broken rice, damaged rice, paddy, stones
    and foreign objects. Image processing and machine learning techniques can be used
    to separate and classify objects of rice sample [46]. Other than hyperspectral
    images [98], most of the studies related to paddy rice sample classification use
    high-resolution images and apply machine learning techniques such as SVM [46],
    [96], [98]–[100], [127] and deep learning algorithms [94]–[98], [101], [124].
    Combining efficient feature extraction method (e.g., PCA) [103] with neural network
    algorithm (e.g., Back-propagation Neural Network (BPNN)) shows better accuracy
    results in paddy rice sample classification [96], [124] and also better clustering
    results for paddy rice grade identification [103]. Other image pre-processing
    such as histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) also affects the performance of
    the classifiers [94], [99]. Combining features in paddy rice sample classification
    also improves the classification accuracies [96]. Multi-classifier cascade can
    also be used to improve the performance of the paddy rice sample classification
    [99]. In order to get a good model, low bias and variance are required in order
    to have high accuracies or lower errors. An optimal balance of bias and variance
    would never overfit and underfit the model. Reducing variance of the final classifier
    model can be achieved by fitting multiple final models or using hybrid approaches
    [99], [103], [124] or increase the training size. In addition to that, example
    of low-bias machine learning algorithms include DT, k -NN and SVM. Based on the
    findings of this review, the performance of all these three machine learning algorithms
    are very competitive in predicting paddy rice yield estimation [109], monitoring
    paddy rice growth [78], [83], monitoring paddy rice disease [37], [40], [81],
    [91], [117], [119], [120], assessing quality of paddy rice [79], [104], [123]
    and paddy rice sample classification [46], [98], [99], [127]. SECTION VI. Conclusion
    This paper provides a structured overview of the recent applications of machine
    learning algorithms and smart devices for paddy rice smart farming. In addition
    to that, this paper has proposed a framework that maps big data, machine learning
    and paddy rice smart farming tasks. The review study reveals considerable benefits
    to the production of paddy rice that have applied the machine learning techniques
    and smart devices in the paddy rice smart farming. As with any research, here,
    we also summarize the following guidelines based on the findings obtained from
    this review for future works. First, there is a need to explore further the capability
    of ensemble models or hybrid models based on deep learning methods using multi-source
    data, as these have been shown to improve the performance of the base model. However,
    deep learning methods require large number of samples to come up with efficient
    models. For instance, in predicting paddy rice yield and monitoring paddy rice
    disease using the deep learning approach, a large amount of time-series data is
    required to improve the prediction performance [88], [112]. Since most of the
    studies conducted for paddy rice sample classification are based on image processing,
    the optimization of the classification accuracy (e.g., using hybrid or ensemble
    approach) is another issue that requires more explorations. For instance, more
    works on the variety of wavelet transforms for texture analysis and different
    classification techniques (decision tree, random forest) for paddy rice sample
    classification can be explored [96]. Second, a limited number of investigations
    conducted in the area of the application of machine learning algorithm based on
    multi-sources data as the findings from existing studies have shown that a more
    comprehensive understanding can be obtained by integrating multi-sources data
    or determining the optimum features combination. We can produce better modelling
    results comprehensively by analysing these complex relationships among multi-sources
    data or by finding the optimum features combination. For instance, using only
    spectral reflectance, shape and texture of paddy rice will not provide better
    results and additional ground truth data is required in order to classify and
    differentiate paddy rice accurately [161]. Using multi-features fusion (e.g.,
    combining Landsat and SAR Time Series Data) can also improve the accuracy of predicting
    paddy rice yield using a deep learning approach [112]. Limited works are found
    in exploring and combining multiple sources of data (e.g., Sensored data (climate
    and soil properties), Remotely sensed data, vegetation indices and drone-based
    data (e.g., high-resolution images)) to improve the modelling of data for smart
    irrigation for paddy rice, predicting paddy rice yield estimation, monitoring
    paddy rice growth, monitoring paddy rice disease, assessing quality of paddy rice,
    paddy rice sample classification. Finally, a more comprehensive analysis needs
    to be conducted to investigate the efficiency of processing software to perform
    image preprocessing for modelling. For example, Monitoring the growth of paddy
    rice based on spectral reflectance has limitations of the processing software
    and the complicated steps to process the images [66]. More researches need to
    be conducted to acquire high resolutions remotely sensed time series imagery data
    in both time and space through effective and efficient image segmentation process
    using data blending approaches [108]. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords

    \a\nAbstract: The innovation in science and technical knowledge has prompted an\
    \ enormous amount of\ninformation for the agrarian sector. Machine learning has\
    \ risen with massive processing techniques\nto perceive new contingencies in agricultural\
    \ development. Machine learning is a novel onset for the\ninvestigation and determination\
    \ of unpredictable agrarian issues. Machine learning models actualize\nthe need\
    \ for scaling the learning model’s performance. Feature selection can impact a\
    \ machine\nlearning model’s performance by deﬁning a signiﬁcant feature subset\
    \ for increasing the performance\nand identifying the variability. This paper\
    \ explains a novel hybrid feature extraction procedure,\nwhich is an aggregation\
    \ of the correlation-based ﬁlter (CFS) and random forest recursive feature\nelimination\
    \ (RFRFE) wrapper framework. The proposed feature extraction approach aims to\
    \ identify\nan optimal subclass of features from a collection of climate, soil,\
    \ and groundwater characteristics\nfor constructing a crop-yield forecasting machine\
    \ learning model with better performance and\naccuracy. The model’s precision\
    \ and eﬀectiveness are estimated (i) with all the features in the dataset,\n(ii)\
    \ with essential features obtained using the learning algorithm’s inbuilt ‘feature_importances’\n\
    method, and (iii) with the signiﬁcant features obtained through the proposed hybrid\
    \ feature extraction\ntechnique. The validation of the hybrid CFS and RFRFE feature\
    \ extraction approach in terms of\nevaluation metrics, predictive accuracies,\
    \ and diagnostic plot performance analysis in comparison\nwith random forest,\
    \ decision tree, and gradient boosting machine learning algorithms are found to\
    \ be\nprofoundly satisfying.\nKeywords: correlation ﬁlter; crop yield prediction;\
    \ hybrid feature extraction; machine learning;\nrecursive feature elimination\
    \ wrapper; precision agriculture\n1. Introduction\nThe advancement in science\
    \ and machine learning has accounted for a colossal amount of\ninformation in\
    \ the agrarian ﬁeld subjecting to examination and incorporating procedures such\
    \ as crop\nyield forecasting, investigation of plant diseases, enhancement of\
    \ crops, etc. Machine learning has\nascended with enormous processing strategies\
    \ to conceive new opportunities in multi-disciplinary\nagrarian innovations. Though\
    \ machine learning strategies handle immense sums and variations of\ninformation,\
    \ accomplishing a superior performing model is a pivotal plan that needs to be\
    \ focused.\nFurther, this actualizes the need for scaling the learning model’s\
    \ performance. Feature extraction is\na technique for determining a signiﬁcant\
    \ subgroup of features utilizing various statistical measures\nAgriculture 2020,\
    \ 10, 400; doi:10.3390/agriculture10090400\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/agriculture\n\
    Agriculture 2020, 10, 400\n2 of 27\nfor model construction [1]. It can impact\
    \ a machine learning model’s performance by enlisting a\nsubstantial feature subset\
    \ for boosting the performance and categorizing the variability. The most\nprevailing\
    \ feature selection measures are the ﬁlter methods, which are generally faster,\
    \ and the wrapper\nmethods that are more reliable but computationally expensive.\n\
    Together with colossal data advances and improved measure reinforcement, machine\
    \ learning\nhas risen to determine, assess, and envision intensive information\
    \ techniques in an agriculture\noperative environment. Exuberant upgrades in machine\
    \ learning have tremendous potential results.\nMany researchers and authorities\
    \ in present agribusiness are looking at their speculation at an\nincreasingly\
    \ prevalent scale, helping to accomplish progressively exact and steady forecasts.\
    \ Precision\nagriculture is also known as “site-speciﬁc agriculture”, an approach\
    \ to deal with farm management\nutilizing information technology. Precision agriculture\
    \ assures that the crops and soil receive precisely\nwhat they require for optimum\
    \ health and proﬁtability [2]. Present-day agrarian frameworks can\ndiscover signiﬁcantly\
    \ more machine learning methods to use enhancements more eﬃciently and adjust\n\
    to diﬀerent natural changes [3–5]. The objective of precision agriculture is to\
    \ guarantee productivity,\nmanageability, and conservation of the environment\
    \ [6]. Machine learning in precision agriculture\nendows a crop management system\
    \ that assists in yield forecasting in crops, crop disease management,\ndistinguishing\
    \ the crop weeds, acknowledging crop assortments, forecasting of agricultural\
    \ climate,\nand many others. In the machine learning procedure, insigniﬁcant features\
    \ in preparing a dataset will\ndecline the forecasting eﬃciency [7]. Due to the\
    \ extensive increase in the data amount, a pre-processing\nstrategy such as feature\
    \ selection grows into an essential and demanding step when using a machine\n\
    learning technique [8,9].\n1.1. Background\nFeature selection is characterized\
    \ as the way towards removing the excessive and unessential\nfeatures using statistical\
    \ measures from a dataset, to embellish the learning algorithm. It is an active\n\
    explorative area in artiﬁcial intelligence applications. The predominant aim of\
    \ feature extraction is\nto achieve an appropriate subgroup of features for deﬁning\
    \ and delineating a dataset. In machine\nlearning, feature selection strategy\
    \ gives us a method for lowering calculation time [10], enhancing\nforecasting\
    \ results, and improving perception of the data. In other words, feature selection\
    \ is an\nextensively used pre-processing procedure for higher-dimensional data.\
    \ It incorporates the following\nobjectives:\n•\nEnhancing forecasting precision\n\
    •\nLowering the dimensions\n•\nRemoving superﬂuous or insigniﬁcant features\n\
    •\nImproving the data interpretability\n•\nEnhancing the model interpretability\n\
    •\nDecreasing the volume of the required information.\nThe feature extraction\
    \ processes can be classiﬁed based on various standards, as depicted in\nFigure\
    \ 1. Depending on the training data employed, they are grouped as supervised,\
    \ unsupervised,\nand semi-supervised. Based on their inter-relationship with the\
    \ learning models, they are classiﬁed as\na ﬁlter, wrapper, and hybrid models.\
    \ Depending on the search strategies, it is organized as a forward\nincrease,\
    \ backward deletion, and random models [11]. Additionally, considering the output\
    \ type,\nthey are classiﬁed as feature ranking and subset selection models. For\
    \ higher-dimensional features,\nthis issue cannot be resolved by consolidating\
    \ all potential outcomes.\nFilter techniques can recognize and eliminate insigniﬁcant\
    \ features, but they cannot expel repetitive\nfeatures because they do not consider\
    \ conceivable dependencies between features [12]. The ﬁlter method\nevaluates\
    \ the signiﬁcance of a feature subgroup entirely depending on the intrinsic characteristics\n\
    of data such as correlation, variance, F measure, entropy, the ratio of information\
    \ gain, and mutual\ninformation [13,14].\nAgriculture 2020, 10, 400\n3 of 27\n\
    Figure 1. Overview of feature selection methods for machine learning algorithms.\n\
    The wrapper-based feature selection method [15] encompasses a feature selection\
    \ algorithm over\nan induction algorithm. The wrapper approach is mainly helpful\
    \ in solving issues such as generating a\nﬁtness function when it cannot be eﬃciently\
    \ expressed with an accurate analytical equation. Various\nsearch algorithms such\
    \ as forward and backward elimination passes, best-ﬁrst search, recursive feature\n\
    elimination [16] can be utilized to discover a subset of features by means of\
    \ augmenting or limiting the\ncorresponding objective function. Wrapper techniques\
    \ are usually identiﬁed by the immense caliber of\nthe selected features; however,\
    \ they have a higher computational cost.\nAnother intermittently investigated\
    \ methodology for feature selection is hybrid methods.\nThey involve strategies\
    \ endeavored to have an acceptable compromise between the computational\neﬀort\
    \ and eﬃciency [17–19]. These methods encompass those techniques that integrate\
    \ both ﬁlter and\nwrapper methods. It accomplishes the balance of precision and\
    \ computing time.\n1.2. Literature Review\nIt has been analyzed that the agriculturist’s\
    \ income rises or falls depending on the outcomes\nthey acquire from their harvests.\
    \ In an interest to enhance and support the process of determination\nand resolution,\
    \ it is vital to perceive the deﬁnite prevailing association between the crop\
    \ yield and\nnumerous factors impacting it [20]. The factors are present in a\
    \ higher level of intricacy in time\nand space, and the decisions are to be perceived\
    \ considering the eﬀects of soil [21], climate [22],\nwater availability [23],\
    \ landscapes, and several others that are concerned in assisting the crop yield\
    \ [24].\nGenerally, a considerable part of agribusiness-based frameworks cannot\
    \ be delineated by the essential\nstage-wise condition or by a deﬁnite equation,\
    \ particularly at the stage when the dataset is convoluted,\nstrident, deﬁcient,\
    \ or assorted. Structuring of these frameworks is complicated and imminent but\
    \ has\nexceptional importance for analysts for forecasting and simulation.\nFeature\
    \ selection methods have been enforced in prediction and classiﬁcation problems\
    \ to choose\na reduced list of features, which makes the algorithm to perform\
    \ faster and produce precise results.\nSome speciﬁc issues are continuously handled\
    \ with an extraordinary number of features. In the\nliterature, some hybrid feature\
    \ selection methods for agrarian frameworks combing both the ﬁlter\nand wrapper\
    \ approaches are proposed. Muhammed et al. have proposed the identiﬁcation and\n\
    Agriculture 2020, 10, 400\n4 of 27\ncategorization of citrus diseases in the plant\
    \ [25] depending on the improved accentuated segmentation\nand feature extraction.\
    \ The procedure encompasses two phases: (1) detection of lesion spots in plants\n\
    and (2) classiﬁcation of citrus disease. The optimal features are deﬁned by enforcing\
    \ a hybrid feature\nextraction process, which includes the principal component\
    \ analysis score, entropy, and skewed\ncovariance vector. Yu et al. explored a\
    \ new procedure of “reduced redundancy improved relevance”\nframework-based feature\
    \ selection to choose an eﬃcient wavelength spectrum for the hyperspectral\nimages\
    \ of cotton plants, enabling the categorization of foreign substances in cotton\
    \ plants [26].\nPrediction of moisture content between wood chips using the least\
    \ square Support Vector Machine\n(SVM) kernel feature selection method has been\
    \ endorsed by Hela et al. [27].\nWenbin et al. deﬁned an eﬃcient mutual information-based\
    \ feature selection algorithm integrating\ninformation theory and rough sets [28].\
    \ The evaluation function can choose candidate features that\ncomprise of high\
    \ pertinence concerning the class and low redundancy among the selected characteristic\n\
    features, in such a way that the redundancy is removed. Hosein et al. introduced\
    \ a new feature\nextraction method, which is the combination of an advanced ant\
    \ colony optimization algorithm (ACO)\nwith an adaptive fuzzy inference system\
    \ (ANFIS) [29]. It enabled them to choose the best subgroup of\nfeatures from\
    \ the various observed soil characteristics that leverage the soil cation exchange\
    \ capacity\n(CEC), which is a valuable property representing the soil fertility\
    \ status. Feature selection is highly\nessential for dimensionality reduction\
    \ in the case of hyperspectral images. Ashis et al. endorsed a\nsupervised hybrid\
    \ feature extraction procedure combining the Self-adaptive diﬀerential evolution\n\
    (SADE) algorithm with a fuzzy K-neighbor classiﬁer wrapper [30] for the hyperspectral\
    \ remote sensed\nimages of agricultural data over Indiana, Kennedy Space Center\
    \ of Florida, and Botswana. Somayeh et\nal. proposed a hybrid Genetic Algorithm—Artiﬁcial\
    \ Neural Network feature extraction method to\nidentify the signiﬁcant features\
    \ for the pistachio endocarp lesion problem [31]. Pistachio endocarp\nlesion (PEL)\
    \ is one of the most signiﬁcant causes of the damage of the pistachio plant. The\
    \ study was\nframed to identify the biotic and abiotic agents that impact the\
    \ existence of PEL.\nThe works discussed until now attempts to consider the advantages\
    \ of the ﬁlter and wrapper\nmethods and associate them appropriately. In addition,\
    \ each proposed strategy utilizes its own selection\nprocedures and assessment\
    \ measures. As observed, the hybrid-based feature extraction procedures\nhave\
    \ been examined limited for agrarian datasets, and the current processes involve\
    \ constraints\neither in their assessment measures or the number of characteristic\
    \ features processed. Concerning\nthe reasons as mentioned above, a new hybrid-based\
    \ feature extraction process, unlike the other\nhybrid measures, is proposed,\
    \ which uses a correlation-based ﬁlter stage—CFS and the random forest\nrecursive\
    \ feature elimination wrapper stage—RF-RFE. CFS can eﬀectively screen redundant,\
    \ noisy,\nand irrelevant features. CFS also enhances performance and reduces the\
    \ size of improved knowledge\nstructures eﬃciently than other ﬁlter measures.\
    \ It is also computationally inexpensive, which provides\na better feature subset\
    \ to ease the performance of wrapper, which is usually computationally expensive.\n\
    RF-RFE based wrapper, though computationally expensive, gives high-quality feature\
    \ outputs. Since in\nthe proposed approach, the RF-RFE wrapper is combined with\
    \ the ﬁlter approach, the computational\ntime is reduced. Another advantage of\
    \ RF-RFE is that it does not demand any reconciliation to develop\ncompeting results.\n\
    1.3. Aim of the Paper\nIn this paper, a new hybrid-based feature extraction procedure\
    \ combining correlation type ﬁlter\nCFS and a recursive feature elimination-based\
    \ wrapper RF-RFE is developed. The proposed technique\nis applied to the paddy\
    \ crop dataset to determine a prime collection of features for forecasting crop\n\
    yield. Until now, the hybrid feature selection combination of CFS ﬁlter and RF-RFE\
    \ wrapper has not\nbeen enforced to recognize the signiﬁcant subset of features\
    \ for yield prediction in crop development.\nThe empirical results determine that\
    \ the proposed method selects signiﬁcant features amongst other\nalgorithms by\
    \ removing those that do not contribute to enhanced prediction results. The remainder\
    \ of\nthe paper is systemized as follows. Section 2 explains the methodology for\
    \ the proposed hybrid feature\nAgriculture 2020, 10, 400\n5 of 27\nabstraction\
    \ method depending on the CFS RF-RFE wrapper, the data considered for the study\
    \ along\nwith the signiﬁcant agrarian parameters and the details about the various\
    \ machine learning models\nexperimented and the evaluation metrics used. Section\
    \ 3 demonstrates the experimental framework\nand outcomes of the developed hybrid\
    \ feature extraction process on the agricultural dataset with\nvarious machine\
    \ learning methods. Section 4 presents a discussion of results and future works.\
    \ Finally,\nSection 5 winds up with the conclusion of the proposed work.\n2. Materials\
    \ and Methods\n2.1. Proposed Hybrid Feature Selection Methodology\nThe two predominant\
    \ feature extraction processes in machine learning are ﬁlter and wrapper\nmethods.\
    \ Wrappers frequently give better outcomes than ﬁlter processes, as feature extraction\
    \ is\nadvanced for the speciﬁc learning algorithm that is utilized [32]. Due to\
    \ this, wrappers are very\nexpensive to run and can be obstinate for substantial\
    \ databases comprising numerous features.\nMoreover, as the feature selection\
    \ process is tightly connected with the learning algorithm, wrappers\nare less\
    \ frequently used than ﬁlters. In general, ﬁlters execute rapidly than the wrapper;\
    \ as a result,\nﬁlters portray a vastly improved possibility of scaling to databases\
    \ with a substantial number of\nfeatures. Filters can aﬀord the same beneﬁt as\
    \ wrappers. When an enhanced precision for a speciﬁc\nlearning algorithm is recommended,\
    \ a ﬁlter can provide a smart beginning feature subset for a wrapper.\nIn other\
    \ words, the wrapper will be provided with a reduced feature set by the ﬁlter,\
    \ thus helping\nthe wrapper to scale eﬃciently for bigger datasets. The hybrid\
    \ approach, which is an association of\nwrapper and ﬁlter methods, utilizes the\
    \ ranking information from the ﬁlter method.\nFurther, this enhances the search\
    \ in the optimization algorithm, which is used by the wrapper\nmethods. This method\
    \ exploits the advantage of both the wrappers and the ﬁlters. By connecting\n\
    these two methods, we can enhance the predictive eﬃciency of pure ﬁlter methods\
    \ and curtail the\nexecution duration of pure wrapper methods. In this section,\
    \ the proposed feature extraction procedure\nis explained, which conforms to the\
    \ hybrid CFS ﬁlter—RF-RFE wrapper approach. A framework\nrepresenting the proposed\
    \ approach is explained in Figure 2.\nFigure 2. A framework of the proposed hybrid\
    \ feature selection approach.\nAgriculture 2020, 10, 400\n6 of 27\nGenerally,\
    \ the hybrid ﬁlter-wrapper feature selection method comprises typically of two\
    \ phases:\n•\nThe initial phase utilizes the ﬁlter method to minimize the size\
    \ of the feature set by discarding the\nnoisy insigniﬁcant features.\n•\nThe ﬁnal\
    \ phase utilizes the wrapper method to identify the ideal characteristic feature\
    \ subgroup\nfrom the reserved feature set.\nIn the ﬁrst step during the ﬁlter\
    \ stage, the features are arranged depending on a correlation-based\nheuristic\
    \ evaluation function. This process objective is to distinguish the characteristic\
    \ features\nthat are persistent with the information framework. The features are\
    \ categorized based on their\nsigniﬁcance. With the purpose of conﬁning the exploration\
    \ into the space of all conceivable feature\nsubgroups, this process permits a\
    \ decent estimate of features as a beginning for the next step. In the\nsecond\
    \ phase, i.e., the wrapper phase, the objective is to assess the features examining\
    \ them as a\nsubgroup rather than in the explicit case. Then, they are enforced\
    \ to random forest-based recursive\nfeature elimination selection process. Figure\
    \ 3 explains the proposed hybrid feature selection system\narchitecture. The following\
    \ subsections delineate each phase of the proposed strategy.\nFigure 3. Architecture\
    \ diagram of proposed hybrid CFS and RF-RFE feature selection approach.\n2.1.1.\
    \ Filter Stage—Correlation Based Feature Selector (CFS)\nA ﬁltering process assesses\
    \ the quality of feature subsets depending on statistical measurements\nas evaluation\
    \ criteria. In machine learning, one of the processes of selecting features for\
    \ forecasting\nresults can be attained based on the correlation among the features,\
    \ and that such a feature selection\nstrategy can be useful to regular machine\
    \ learning algorithms. A feature is beneﬁcial if it is conforming\nto a class\
    \ or predicts the class [32]. A characteristic feature (Xi) is observed to be\
    \ pertinent if and only if\nthere prevail some probability (P) xi and y such that\
    \ P(Xi = xi) > 0 as in Equation (1),\nP(Y = y\n\f\f\fXi = xi) , P(Y = y)\n(1)\n\
    Experimental proof from the feature selection literature demonstrates that in\
    \ addition to the\ninsigniﬁcant features, superﬂuous features need to be removed\
    \ as well. A feature is recognized as\nsuperﬂuous if it is exceedingly associated\
    \ with one or more other features.\nMoreover, this resulted in a hypothesis for\
    \ feature extraction, which is a useful, acceptable\ncharacteristic feature subgroup\
    \ that incorporates features that are signiﬁcantly associated with class but\n\
    dissociated with one other. In this scenario, the features are speciﬁc tests that\
    \ measure characteristics\nidentiﬁed with the variable of importance. For instance,\
    \ a precise forecast of an individual’s achievement\nin a subject can be obtained\
    \ from a composite of various tests estimating a wide assortment of qualities\n\
    rather than an individual test, which estimates a restricted set of qualities.\
    \ In a given feature set if the\nassociation among the individual feature and\
    \ an extrinsic variable is recognized, and the inter-relation\nAgriculture 2020,\
    \ 10, 400\n7 of 27\namong every other pair of the features is given, then the\
    \ association among the complicated test\ncomprising of the total features and\
    \ the extrinsic variable can be determined from Equation (2),\nr =\nPn\ni=1(xi\
    \ − x)(yi − y)\nqPn\ni=1(xi − x)2\nqPn\ni=1(yi − y)2\n(2)\nThe above equation\
    \ deﬁnes the Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcient. Where xi and x deﬁnes the\nobserved\
    \ and average values of the features considered. yi and y deﬁnes the observed\
    \ and average\nvalues of the dataset class. If a group of n features has just\
    \ been chosen, the correlation coeﬃcient can\nbe utilized to assess the connection\
    \ between the group and the class, incorporating inter-correlation\namong the\
    \ features. The signiﬁcance of the feature group increases with the correlation\
    \ between the\nfeatures and classes. Additionally, it diminishes with an increasing\
    \ inter-correlation. These thoughts\nhave been examined in the literature on decision\
    \ making and aggregate estimation [33]. Deﬁning the\naggregated correlation coeﬃcient\
    \ among the features and output variables as rny = p(Xn, Y) and the\naggregate\
    \ among varying features as rnn = p(Xn, Xn). The group correlation coeﬃcient calculating\
    \ the\nrelevance of the feature subset is given as follows in Equation (3),\n\
    J(Xn, Y) =\nnrny\np\nn + (n − 1)rnn\n(3)\nThis shows that the association between\
    \ a group and an external feature is an operation of the\ntotal number of individual\
    \ characteristic features in the group. The formula from [34] is obtained\nfrom\
    \ the Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcient by standardizing all the variables. It has\
    \ been utilized in the\ncorrelation-based feature selection algorithm enabling\
    \ the addition or deletion of one feature at a time.\nThe following pseudo-code\
    \ in Algorithm 1 explains the selection procedure using CFS ﬁlter.\nAlgorithm\

    \ the individual and the extrinsic variable, the higher is the\ncorrelation among\
    \ the combination and external variables.\nAgriculture 2020, 10, 400\n8 of 27\n\
    •\nThe lower the inter-correlation among the individual and the extrinsic variable,\
    \ the lower is the\ncorrelation among the combination and extrinsic variable.\n\
    For eﬃcient prediction, it is obvious to remove the redundant features from the\
    \ dataset. If another\nfeature manages an existing feature’s forecasting ability,\
    \ then it can be removed safely. Further,\nto improvise the forecasting performance\
    \ of the system, the reduced feature set obtained is passed on\nthe next step\
    \ of wrapper-based feature selection.\n2.1.2. Wrapper Stage—Random Forest Recursive\
    \ Feature Elimination (RF-RFE)\nWrapper methods use forecasting accuracy to validate\
    \ the feature subset. Wrappers use the\nlearning machine as a black box in scoring\
    \ the feature subsets depending on their forecasting ability.\nRecursive feature\
    \ elimination [34] is fundamentally a recursive process that ranks features based\
    \ on a\nsigniﬁcance measure. RFE is a feature ranking procedure depending on a\
    \ greedy algorithm. As per\nthe standard of feature ranking, in all iterations,\
    \ RFE will start eliminating from the full feature set\nthe least signiﬁcant features\
    \ one after the other to obtain the most signiﬁcant features. The recursion\n\
    is required since, for a few processes, the pertinent signiﬁcance of speciﬁc characteristic\
    \ features can\nvary considerably on assessing beyond an alternate subgroup of\
    \ features in the course of step-wise\nelimination. This is concerned primarily\
    \ with profoundly correlated features. Depending on the order\nin which the features\
    \ are discarded, the ﬁnal feature set is constructed. The feature selection procedure\n\
    itself comprises just acquiring the initial n features from this ranking.\nRandom\
    \ forest falls under the ensemble-based prediction or categorization process.\
    \ Substantially\nit grows several distinct prediction trees and utilizes them\
    \ together as a combined predictor. The ﬁnal\nprediction of a given dataset is\
    \ determined by implementing an absolute rule among the choices\nof the respective\
    \ predictors. Further, to create unassociated and distinctive insights, every\
    \ tree is\ndeveloped utilizing just a smaller dataset of the preparation set.\
    \ Besides, to maximize the dissimilarity\namong the trees, the algorithm includes\
    \ random contingency in the pursuit of optimal splits [35].\nThe wrapper stage\
    \ of the proposed hybrid approach depends on the extent of the signiﬁcance of\
    \ the\nvariable provided by the random forest. For each individual tree in the\
    \ random forest, there exists a\nsubgroup of the feature set which is not utilized\
    \ at the time of training since every tree is developed on\na bootstrap sample.\
    \ These subgroups are generally termed as out-of-bag, which gives the unbiased\n\
    measure of predicting the errors.\nRandom forest evaluates the signiﬁcance of\
    \ characteristic features inﬁltrating the framework\nas follows:\n•\nIn all iterations,\
    \ each feature is shuﬄed, and over this shuﬄed data set, an out-of-bag estimation\n\
    of the forecasting error is made.\n•\nNaturally, when trying to alter this way,\
    \ the insigniﬁcant features will not change the prediction\nerror, inverse to\
    \ the signiﬁcant features.\n•\nThe corresponding loss in eﬃciency among the actual\
    \ and the shuﬄed datasets is accordingly\nassociated with the eﬃciency of the\
    \ shuﬄed features.\nThe following pseudo-code in Algorithm 2 explains the feature\
    \ selection using RF-RFE.\nIn the RF-RFE approach, the proportion of characteristic\
    \ feature signiﬁcance is connected with the\nrecursive feature elimination algorithm.\
    \ RF-RFE wrapper model is developed based on the perception\nof building a model\
    \ (here the model is random forest) frequently and select either the best or worst\n\
    operating feature. Removing the feature aside and recurring the process with the\
    \ remaining features.\nThis operation is carried out until all the features in\
    \ the dataset are consumed. The features are then\nranked depending on the order\
    \ in which they are eliminated. In other words, this performs a greedy\noptimization\
    \ search to determine the best performing feature subset. The following section\
    \ describes\nthe dataset and various agronomical factors impacting crop yield.\n\

    \ Description\nMachine learning has surged collectively with enormous intelligence\
    \ progress and better methods\nto create unique contingencies to determine, assess,\
    \ and appreciate information pervasive techniques\nfor agrarian frameworks. Machine\
    \ learning algorithms need an appropriate amount of data for eﬃcient\nprocessing.\
    \ Data with beﬁtting attributes simpliﬁes the eﬀort of examining uniformity by\
    \ eliminating\nthe features that are superﬂuous or excess concerning the learning\
    \ objective. This section explains in\ndetail the various agrarian factors to\
    \ be considered for yield prediction along with the study area and\ndataset description.\n\
    2.2.1. Agronomical Variables Impacting Yield of Crops\nThere are a variety of\
    \ factors identiﬁed for crop yield and the vulnerabilities required for their\n\
    development. The most crucial factors that aﬀect crop yield are the climate, soil\
    \ productiveness,\nand groundwater characteristics. These factors can epitomize\
    \ an enormous risk to farmers when they\nare not checked and supervised precisely.\
    \ Moreover, considering the ultimate objective to maximize\nthe yield of the crop\
    \ and curtail the hazard, it is vital to see explicitly the factors that aﬀect\
    \ crop yield.\nThe following factors play a crucial role in crop enhancement.\n\
    Climate\nA preeminent and the most overlooked variable that aﬀects crop yield\
    \ is climate. Climatic\nconditions extend past just wet and dry. While rainfall\
    \ is the indispensable segment of the atmosphere,\nthere exist few other distinct\
    \ perspectives to recognize such as wind speed, humidity, temperature,\nand the\
    \ widespread prevalence of pests during certain climatic conditions [36]. Conﬂicting\
    \ patterns\nin climate lead to an excessive risk to crop and may prompt favorable\
    \ conditions for speciﬁc weeds\nto grow.\nSoil Productivity\nThere exist several\
    \ nutrient supplements such as nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus that constitutes\n\
    plant macronutrients and magnesium, zinc, calcium, iron, sulfur, etc.\nthat constitutes\
    \ plant\nmicronutrients [37]. Every one of them is proportionally fundamental\
    \ to the crop yield, regardless\nof the way that they are required in diﬀering\
    \ amounts. The accountability of nutrients for crop\nAgriculture 2020, 10, 400\n\
    10 of 27\nyield is indispensable for crop growth enhancement, protein formation,\
    \ photosynthesis, and so forth.\nThe unavailability of these nutrients can reduce\
    \ the crop yield by conversely impacting the relevant\ngrowth factors.\nGroundwater\
    \ Characteristics and Availability\nWater receptivity speciﬁcally inﬂuences the\
    \ crop yield, and yield eﬃciency can change\ncomprehensively given the varying\
    \ precipitation pattern, utilizing both amount and time span.\nAlmost no measure\
    \ of rainfall can result in crop death; at the same time, ample precipitation\
    \ can cause\nadverse eﬀects [38]. The essential and synthetic parameters of groundwater\
    \ perform an essential role\nin surveying the quality of water. The hydrochemical\
    \ analysis uncovers the nature of water that is\nappropriate for irrigation, agriculture,\
    \ industrial use, and drinking purposes.\n2.2.2. Crop Dataset and Study Area Description\n\
    The crop data required for the proposed study is obtained from the various village\
    \ blocks including\nArcot, Sholinghur, Ponnai, Ammur, Kalavai, and Thimiri of\
    \ the Vellore district of Tamil Nadu in\nIndia. The crop considered for the study\
    \ is paddy. This district lies between 12◦15′ to 13◦15′ north\nlatitude and 78◦20′\
    \ to 79◦50′ east longitude. Paddy is one of the signiﬁcant economic crops grown\n\
    in this district, and hence this district is examined for analysis. Unlike the\
    \ regular soil and climatic\nparameters, the dataset comprises of distinctive\
    \ climatic, soil, groundwater characteristics together\nwith the fertilizer amount\
    \ absorbed by the plants of the experimented region. Table 1 explains, in brief,\n\
    the various parameters used for the experimental study. The data is observed for\
    \ a time span of\n20 years. The dataset contains paddy yield utilizing the region\
    \ cultivated (in hectares), production of\npaddy (in tonnes), and crop yield obtained\
    \ (kilogram/hectare). The data relevant to environmental\naspects such as precipitation,\
    \ air temperature, potential evapotranspiration, evapotranspiration of\nreference\
    \ crop, and exceptional climatic features such as frost frequency of ground, diurnal\
    \ temperature\nrange, wind speed, humidity has been used which is obtained from\
    \ the Indian water portal metadata\ntool. The data of soil and groundwater properties\
    \ comprises of soil pH, topsoil density, amount\nof macronutrients existing in\
    \ the soil, and the distinct groundwater characteristics such as type of\naquifer,\
    \ transmissivity, rock layer permeability, water conductivity, and the number\
    \ of micronutrients\nexisting in the groundwater before and after the monsoon\
    \ period. Unlike the standard parameter set,\nthe proposed work includes considering\
    \ all the parameters from various aspects, including climate,\nhydrochemical properties\
    \ of groundwater, soil, and fertilizer amount, to construct an eﬃcient feature\n\
    subset enhancing the prediction of crop yield achieving better precision than\
    \ the traditional approach.\nAgriculture 2020, 10, 400\n11 of 27\nTable 1. List\

    S. No—Serial Number.\nAgriculture 2020, 10, 400\n13 of 27\nThe following section\
    \ describes the various machine learning models and evaluation metrics used\n\
    for the assessment of the proposed feature selection method.\n2.3. Machine Learning\
    \ Models and Evaluation Metrics\nThe proposed CFS ﬁlter RF-RFE wrapper hybrid\
    \ statistical feature selection algorithm is tested by\nimplementing it with the\
    \ following machine learning algorithms, namely:\n•\nRandom forest\n•\nDecision\
    \ tree\n•\nGradient boosting.\n2.3.1. Machine Learning\nDecision trees are an\
    \ information-based supervised machine learning algorithm [39]. They are a\ntree\
    \ structure similar to a ﬂow diagram, where every interior node indicates an analysis\
    \ performed\non the attributes, branch depicts the output of the test, and the\
    \ label of a class is deﬁned by every\nterminal node [40]. The signiﬁcant objective\
    \ of the decision tree is to identify the distinct features that\nrepresent the\
    \ essential data concerning the target element, and then the dataset is split\
    \ along these\nfeatures such that the sub dataset’s target value is as pure as\
    \ possible. For evaluating the proposed\nhybrid feature selection method, a decision\
    \ tree regressor with a maximum depth of four and best\nsplitter value is constructed.\
    \ Random forest is an ensemble-based [41] supervised machine learning\nalgorithm,\
    \ which combines several decision trees. The random forest algorithm is not biased,\
    \ as there\nare several trees, and each is prepared on a subgroup of data. For\
    \ evaluating the proposed hybrid\nfeature selection with random forest, the regressor\
    \ model is instantiated with 550 estimator decision\ntrees and 40 random states.\
    \ Boosting algorithms are a subclass of ensemble algorithms and one of\nthe most\
    \ widely used algorithms in data science [42], converting weak learners to strong\
    \ learners.\nGradient boosting [43] sequentially trains several models, and every\
    \ new model consistently reduces\nthe loss function of the entire procedure utilizing\
    \ the gradient descendant process. The principal\nobjective of this algorithm\
    \ is to build a new base learner, which is maximally correlated with the loss\n\
    function’s negative gradient, which is related to the entire ensemble.\nThe algorithm’s\
    \ predictive performance with the crop data set is observed using the proposed\n\
    hybrid feature selection method. A machine learning model’s eﬃciency is deﬁned\
    \ by assessing a\nmodel against various performance metrics or using various measures\
    \ of evaluation. The various\nperformance metrics examined for the assessment\
    \ of the developed work are:\n•\nMean Square Error (MSE),\n•\nMean Absolute Error\
    \ (MAE),\n•\nRoot Mean Squared Error (RMSE),\n•\nDetermination Coeﬃcient (R2),\n\
    •\nMean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).\n2.3.2. Metrics of Evaluation\nEvaluation\
    \ metrics deﬁne the performance of the model. A signiﬁcant aspect of the evaluation\n\
    measure is their capability to diﬀerentiate among the results of various learning\
    \ models. The various\nperformance metrics used for evaluation for this study\
    \ are explained in this subsection.\nMean absolute error: Given an array of predictions,\
    \ mean absolute error calculates the average\nimportance of the errors [44]. It\
    \ is the arithmetical mean of the absolute variation between the actual\nobservation\
    \ and the forecasted observation and is deﬁned as follows in Equation (4).\nMAE\
    \ = 1\nn\nXn\nj=1\n\f\f\f\fyj − y′\nj\n\f\f\f\f\n(4)\nAgriculture 2020, 10, 400\n\
    14 of 27\nHere n is deﬁned as the size of the sample, yj depicts the original\
    \ target measure and y′\nj deﬁnes\nthe forecasted target measure.\nMean Squared\
    \ Error: Mean squared error is a signiﬁcant criterion to determine the estimator’s\n\
    performance. Further, this deﬁnes how close a regressor line is to the dataset\
    \ points [45]. The formula\nfor calculating mean squared error is deﬁned as follows\
    \ in Equation (5).\nMSE = 1\nn\nXn\nj=1\n\x10\nyj − y′\nj\n\x112\n(5)\nRoot mean\
    \ square error: It is an estimation of the residuals or forecasted error’s standard\n\
    deviation [46]. To be more precise, it explains how well the information is concentrated\
    \ on the best ﬁt\nline. The formula for calculating the root mean squared error\
    \ is deﬁned as follows in Equation (6).\nRMSE =\ns\nXn\nj=1\n(yj − y′\nj)2\nn\n\
    (6)\nDetermination Coeﬃcient: The statistical measure R-squared or determination\
    \ coeﬃcient is\nutilized to determine the accuracy of the ﬁt of the regression\
    \ framework [47]. To be more deﬁned\ndetermination coeﬃcient deﬁnes how the developed\
    \ framework is superior to the baseline framework.\nIt is deﬁned in Equation (7)\
    \ as follows:\nR2 =\n\n\nn(P xy) − (P x)(P y)\np\n[n P x2 − (P x)2][n P\
    \ y2 − (P y)2]\n\n\n2\n(7)\nMean Absolute Percentage Error: This represents\
    \ how far the model’s prediction deviates from\nits corresponding output. It is\
    \ the average of the percentage errors. It is the sum of the individual\nabsolute\
    \ errors divided by each period individually. It is deﬁned in Equation (8) as\
    \ follows:\nMAPE = 1\nn\nXn\nj=1\nyj − y′\nj\nyj\n(8)\n2.3.3. Cross-Validation\n\
    During the development of the deep learning models, the dataset is subjectively\
    \ split into training\nand test set, where the maximum amount of information is\
    \ taken as a training set. Despite the fact the\ntest dataset is small, there\
    \ exists a possibility of leaving out some critical data that may have upgraded\n\
    the model. In addition, there exists a concern for signiﬁcant data variance. To\
    \ deal with this issue,\nk-fold cross-validation is utilized. It is a process\
    \ that is utilized to evaluate the deep learning models by\nre-sampling the training\
    \ data for upgrading the performance. Arbitrarily splitting a time series data\n\
    for cross-validation may results in a temporal dependency problem, as there is\
    \ a speciﬁc dependence\non past observation, and also data leakage from response\
    \ to the lag variable will undoubtedly occur.\nIn such cases, forward-chaining\
    \ cross-validation is performed for time series data. It performs by\nbeginning\
    \ with a small subset of information originally for training, predict for the\
    \ following data,\nand deciding the precision of the predicted data. The same\
    \ predicted data points are encased as a\npart of the subsequent training data\
    \ subset, and the respective data points are predicted. For the\nproposed approach,\
    \ ﬁve-fold forward chaining cross-validation is implemented. The cross-validation\n\
    is implemented using python’s Sklearn machine learning library. The results of\
    \ cross-validation are\ntabulated in Table 2.\nThe dataset is normalized using\
    \ min-max scaling. The training and the test sets are split using\nthe train_test_split\
    \ function of Sklearn. The size of the training and the test dataset is determined\n\
    by the test_size parameter, which is set as 0.3 for the experiment, indicating\
    \ that 70% of the data is\nreserved for training, and 30% of the data is ﬁxed\
    \ for testing. The best value of “K” for cross-validation\nAgriculture 2020, 10,\
    \ 400\n15 of 27\nis determined using the cross_val_score function. K deﬁnes the\
    \ number of groups the given data is to\nbe split into. The dataset is split into\
    \ ﬁve subsets. The error metric determined is the R2 score, which is\naﬃxed in\
    \ every iteration and attains the optimal value determining the overall model\
    \ accuracy.\nTable 2. Dataset testing with 5-fold forward chaining cross-validation.\n\

    \ selection method for various machine learning frameworks such as gradient\n\
    boosting, random forest, and decision tree.\n3. Results\nThis section briefs about\
    \ the experimental results obtained utilizing the proposed hybrid statistical\n\
    feature extraction procedure over the existing machine learning algorithms. Feature\
    \ selection is an\nautomated process of choosing the most relevant attributes\
    \ or signiﬁcant features from a dataset\nthat enhances a predictive model’s performance.\
    \ The proposed CFS ﬁlter RF-RFE wrapper hybrid\nstatistical feature selection\
    \ algorithm is tested by implementing it with the following machine learning\n\
    algorithms, namely:\n•\nRandom forest\n•\nDecision tree\n•\nGradient boosting.\n\
    Some of the machine learning algorithms comprise of a beneﬁcial inbuilt method\
    \ termed as\nfeature importance. These methods are generally utilized for forecasting,\
    \ for observing the most useful\nvariables on the model. This information can\
    \ be used to engineer new features, eliminate the noisy\nfeature data, or to continue\
    \ with the existing models. This measure is used as one of the reference\nvalues\
    \ for evaluating the developed hybrid feature extraction framework. The evaluation\
    \ of the model\nis done in three phases.\n•\nIn the ﬁrst phase, the models are\
    \ constructed using all the features or variables in the dataset,\nand the prediction\
    \ results are validated using various statistical evaluation measures.\n•\nIn\
    \ the second phase, models are constructed using the algorithm inbuilt ‘feature_importances’\n\
    methods, where only signiﬁcant features alone are selected, and the prediction\
    \ results are evaluated.\n•\nIn the third phase, the models are built utilizing\
    \ the developed hybrid feature extraction method.\nThe most signiﬁcant features\
    \ as per the proposed approach are selected, and the prediction results\nare evaluated.\n\
    3.1. Machine Learning Algorithms Performance Estimation in Terms of Evaluation\
    \ Metrics\nFor validating the proposed hybrid feature selection method, a gradient\
    \ boosting tree with 500\nregression estimators, and a learning rate of 0.01 is\
    \ constructed. The eﬃciency and accuracy measures\nfor all the experimented models\
    \ are determined with:\n•\nAll the features,\n•\nSelective features obtained through\
    \ inbuilt feature importance method and\n•\nFeatures obtained through proposed\
    \ hybrid feature selection methods.\nAgriculture 2020, 10, 400\n16 of 27\nThe\
    \ evaluation metrics are used to deﬁne the executing model’s performance. The\
    \ residuals\nwhich are obtained during the experiments are the variations between\
    \ the predicted and actual values.\nBy observing the residual spread magnitude,\
    \ the eﬃciency and the precision of the model are deﬁned.\nThe evaluation measures\
    \ obtained through the developed hybrid feature extraction process is found to\n\
    be better than the other experimented methods, which are depicted in Tables 3–5.\n\

    \ Plots\nConcerning validation of the regression results of the machine learning\
    \ models, using the\nfeatures from the developed hybrid feature extraction process,\
    \ the regression diagnostic plots [48]\nare constructed. Regression diagnostic\
    \ plots enhance the exploratory performance of the regression\nmodel through a\
    \ set of accessible procedures to evaluate the legitimacy of the model. This assessment\n\
    might be an investigation of the model’s hidden statistical hypothesis or evaluation\
    \ of model structure\nby considering plans that have less or diverse illustrative\
    \ factors. They also assist in investigating\nsubgroups of perceptions, searching\
    \ for samples that are either ineﬀectively represented by the model,\nsuch as\
    \ the outliers or those having a comparatively massive impact on the regression\
    \ model forecasts.\nResiduals are generally leftovers of the resultant variable\
    \ after ﬁtting a model to data. However,\nAgriculture 2020, 10, 400\n20 of 27\n\
    residuals could indicate how ineﬀectively a model represents the data. They also\
    \ uncover unexplained\npatterns in the information by the experimented model.\
    \ Utilizing these statistics, we can review if the\nregression hypotheses are\
    \ met and also enhance the model in an explorative manner. The diagnostic\nplots\
    \ represent residuals in four diﬀerent ways, which are presented in Figure 8.\
    \ This section compiles\nthe results obtained from the various machine learning\
    \ models using the proposed hybrid CFS ﬁlter\nand RF-RFE wrapper feature selection\
    \ method and also evaluated the forecasting models against\nvarious error measures.\
    \ The following section discusses the results and future scope.\nFigure 8. Residual\
    \ diagnostic plots for regression analysis: (a) residuals vs. ﬁtted plot, (b)\
    \ normal Q–Q\nplot, (c) scale-location plot, (d) residuals vs. leverage plot.\n\
    4. Discussion\nAs a point, this section discusses the results obtained from the\
    \ proposed model and also it briefs\nthe future scope of the current study.\n\
    The residuals vs. ﬁtted graph facilitates to observe the non-linear residual patterns.\
    \ There can be\na non-linear relation among the actual and the predictor variable,\
    \ and such patterns could appear in\nthese plots in case if the model does not\
    \ catch them initially. The evenly distributed residuals about the\nhorizontal\
    \ line without any deﬁnite patterns demonstrate non-linear relationships. Figure\
    \ 8a shows\nthat the model data has met the linear regression assumptions well.\
    \ There exists no distinctive data\npattern referring to the linear spread of\
    \ data.\nThe Q–Q plot analyses if the residuals follow a normal distribution with\
    \ minimum deviation.\nIt is better if the residuals interlined well on the straight\
    \ line with minimum deviation. If the residual\ntends to possess a higher magnitude\
    \ than expected from a normal distribution, then the p-values and\nconﬁdence intervals\
    \ fail to suﬃciently account for complete data variability. Figure 8b depicts\
    \ that\nAgriculture 2020, 10, 400\n21 of 27\nthe residuals are almost carefully\
    \ plotted to the diagonal line indicating the normal distribution of\nthe residual.\
    \ The scale location plot observes if residuals are dispersed evenly within the\
    \ range of\nthe predictor. It enables us to verify the hypothesis of equal variance,\
    \ i.e., homoscedasticity [49]. It is\nbetter to have a horizontal line with arbitrarily\
    \ distributed points. Figure 8c indicates that the residuals\nare spread randomly.\
    \ The residuals vs. leverage points enable to identify the most inﬂuential data.\n\
    All the outliers cannot be inﬂuential i.e., they may or may not create much importance\
    \ to the regression\nline. Cook’s distance enables to create a margin. The outliers\
    \ with the highest Cook’s distance score\nor those occurring outside the cooks’\
    \ distance are the inﬂuential outliers. Figure 8d delineates that\nthere exist\
    \ no inﬂuential outliers. Thus, the regression diagnostic plots deﬁne the enhanced\
    \ model\nperformance with the developed hybrid feature extraction process. A ﬁnal\
    \ reduced set of parameters\nafter the proposed hybrid feature extraction process\
    \ is listed in Table 7.\nIn addition to the feature extraction methods, an exploratory\
    \ data analysis process, namely\nfactor analysis is carried out to identify the\
    \ inﬂuential variables or latent variables. It assists in data\ninterpretation\
    \ by decreasing the number of variables. Factor analysis is a linear statistical\
    \ model that\nexplains the variance among the observed variables, and the unobserved\
    \ variables are called factors.\nFactors are associated with multiple observed\
    \ variables comprising of similar response patterns. It is a\nprocess of investigating\
    \ whether the variables of interest x1, x2 . . . xn are linearly related to the\
    \ minimal\nnumber of factors f1, f2 . . . fn. The primary objective of factor\
    \ analysis is to minimize the observed\nvariables and identify the unobserved\
    \ variables. Moreover, this can be achieved by utilizing the factor\nextraction\
    \ or factor rotation. Further, the proposed work factor analysis is implemented\
    \ in python\nusing the factor_analyzer package. Before implementing the factor\
    \ analysis, it is necessary to assess\nthe factorability of the dataset. Besides,\
    \ this is determined using the Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO) test,\nwhich measures\
    \ the data suitability for factor analysis. It deﬁnes the adequacy for the entire\
    \ model\nand every observed variable. The KMO value varies from 0 to 1, where\
    \ less than 0.1 is considered\ninadequate. The overall KMO for the crop dataset\
    \ is observed to be 0.82, indicating its eﬀectiveness\nin proceeding for factor\
    \ analysis. The number of factors is deﬁned based on the scree plot using\nthe\
    \ eigenvalues. The scree plot process deﬁnes a straight line for every factor\
    \ and its eigenvalue.\nThe variables whose eigenvalues are greater than one are\
    \ considered as factors.\nFrom the scree plot in Figure 9, it is observed that\
    \ there are 32 factors whose eigenvalues are greater\nthan 1. These factors deﬁne\
    \ a cumulative variance of 57%. Factor analysis explores massive datasets\nand\
    \ determines underlying associations, deﬁning the group of inter-related variables.\
    \ However,\nmore than one interpretation can be made from the same data factors.\
    \ This method generates 32\ndecisive factors that are close to the number of features\
    \ determined by our proposed feature extraction\nmethod. The overall performance\
    \ and the comparative results represent the fact that the proposed\nfeature extraction\
    \ process produces enhanced performance results than the other feature extraction\n\
    process. Hence improves the predictive capability of the frameworks and their\
    \ eﬃciency with lower\nerror measures of MAE, MSE, and RMSE and higher value of\
    \ determination coeﬃcient. The diagnostic\nplots also result in delineating the\
    \ enhanced exploratory performance of the models.\nAgriculture 2020, 10, 400\n\

    \ Scope\nHowever, in this study, we have considered a varied set of parameters,\
    \ including climatic, soil,\nand groundwater factors for forecasting crop yield.\
    \ In the future, we can consider more extrinsic\nvariables related to pesticides\
    \ and weed infestations. Further improvement of the statistical ﬁlter-based\n\
    selection using the adaptive prototype-based selection for improved performance\
    \ can be considered.\nA more deﬁned hybrid feature selection measure with the\
    \ combination of deep learning wrappers with\nless complexity can be considered\
    \ as an exciting area of research. As a part of the future work, we can\nconsider\
    \ building an ensemble feature selection model by combining the CFS Filter approach\
    \ with the\nartiﬁcial neural network (ANN) based wrapper approach for agricultural\
    \ applications. In another future\nwork, we can also consider building a stacked\
    \ generalization model-based crop yield forecasting model,\nusing the features\
    \ extracted through this proposed approach. Further, this stacked generalization\n\
    model can be built by using ANN as the meta-learner. The following section concludes\
    \ the paper.\n5. Conclusions\nAgriculture is a predominant sector among the most\
    \ arduous departments incorporating the\noutcome of the analytical evaluation.\
    \ Undoubtedly within an explicit sector, circumstances are\nconsistently varying,\
    \ starting with one sector to another. There exists unstable weather, diverse\
    \ soil\ncharacteristics, persisting crop diseases, and pest infestations that\
    \ inﬂuence crop yield and precision\nagriculture. There is an overwhelming capacity\
    \ for machine learning to reform agribusiness by\nintegrating various factors\
    \ to forecast yield. Machine learning models secure a high degree to analyze\n\
    the factual information, translate the data achieved, giving more in-depth knowledge\
    \ into the process.\nTo streamline the predictive model’s learning process and\
    \ for the eﬃcient representation of the dataset,\nfeature selection using various\
    \ statistical measures is a crucial and signiﬁcant stage. In this paper,\na hybrid\
    \ feature extraction process to address the feature extraction problem in machine\
    \ learning\nmodels is proposed. A real-time dataset of soil, water, and climatic\
    \ parameters from the Indian\nwater portal and directorate of rice development\
    \ Patna is used for the current study. The models are\nconstructed in predicting\
    \ the paddy crop yield for the interesting study area based on the climate,\n\
    soil, and hydrochemical properties of groundwater. A list of 45 features was considered\
    \ for model\nconstruction. Out of them, the most signiﬁcant features for foreseeing\
    \ the yield of crops in an interesting\nstudy area is determined using a hybrid\
    \ feature extraction strategy. The proposed hybrid statistical\nfeature extraction\
    \ method is a mixture of CFS and RF-RFE wrapper, respectively. The ﬁlter method\n\
    is initially implemented using correlation measures to eliminate the superﬂuous\
    \ and non-essential\nfeatures, which results in a reduced subgroup of features.\
    \ These essential features obtained can be\nsubjected to the construction of an\
    \ intelligent agrarian model for the crop prediction procedure.\nAgriculture 2020,\
    \ 10, 400\n25 of 27\nThe advantage of the CFS ﬁlter among the other ﬁlter methods\
    \ is the signiﬁcantly shorter\ncomputation time. A wrapper method is then enforced\
    \ on the reduced subgroup of features to ﬁnd the\nfeature set with high predictive\
    \ accuracy. One of the essential highlights of the RF-RFE wrapper is\nthat it\
    \ does not need any ﬁne-tuning to obtain competing results. Experimental results\
    \ also conﬁrm\nthat the developed hybrid feature extraction method is superior\
    \ to the other existing inbuilt feature\nselector methods. In addition, the eﬃciency\
    \ of the results with fewer error measures shows improved\nprediction accuracy\
    \ of the machine learning models.\nAuthor Contributions:\nConceptualization, D.R.V.P.M.;\

    Abstract This paper reviews the most important information fusion data-driven
    algorithms based on Machine Learning (ML) techniques for problems in Earth observation.
    Nowadays we observe and model the Earth with a wealth of observations, from a
    plethora of different sensors, measuring states, fluxes, processes and variables,
    at unprecedented spatial and temporal resolutions. Earth observation is well equipped
    with remote sensing systems, mounted on satellites and airborne platforms, but
    it also involves in-situ observations, numerical models and social media data
    streams, among other data sources. Data-driven approaches, and ML techniques in
    particular, are the natural choice to extract significant information from this
    data deluge. This paper produces a thorough review of the latest work on information
    fusion for Earth observation, with a practical intention, not only focusing on
    describing the most relevant previous works in the field, but also the most important
    Earth observation applications where ML information fusion has obtained significant
    results. We also review some of the most currently used data sets, models and
    sources for Earth observation problems, describing their importance and how to
    obtain the data when needed. Finally, we illustrate the application of ML data
    fusion with a representative set of case studies, as well as we discuss and outlook
    the near future of the field. Previous article in issue Next article in issue

    1. Introduction The Earth is a highly complex, dynamic, and networked system where
    very different physical, chemical and biological processes interact, to form the
    world we know [1], [2], [3]. The description of such a complex system needs of
    the integration of different disciplines such as Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics
    and other applied sciences, leading to what has been coined as Earth System Science
    (ESS) [4]. The analysis of the Earth system involves studying interacting processes
    occurring in several spheres (atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, geosphere,
    pedosphere, biosphere, and magnetosphere) as well as the anthroposphere. Earth
    system science provides the physical basis of the world we live in, with the final
    objective of obtaining a sustainable development of our society1. Traditionally,
    Earth system models characterize processes and their relations by encoding the
    known physical knowledge. This involves deriving models from first principles,
    which typically involves physics-based mechanistic modeling. Such Earth system
    models are complex constructs, and can be designed at different scales, but provide
    and encode the fundamental basis for understanding, forecasting, and modeling.
    Models are often confronted with observations for refinement and improvement.
    In the last five decades, the field of Earth Observation (EO) from space has allowed
    monitoring and modelling the processes on the Earth surface, and their interaction
    with the atmosphere, by obtaining quantitative measurements and estimations of
    geo-bio-physical variables, and has permitted to detect extremes, changes, and
    anomalies. By combining EO data from stations, sensors, and ancillary model simulations,
    we can now monitor our planet with unprecedented accuracy, spatially explicitly
    and temporally resolved. In the last decade, however, we have witnessed two important
    changes: the big data and the Machine Learning (ML) revolutions, which have impacted
    many areas of Science and Engineering, but also the Earth sciences [23]. Both
    combined are leading to paradigm shifts in the way we now study the Earth system:
    • The big data revolution. Nowadays, we observe and model the Earth with a wealth
    of observations and data measured from a plethora of different sensors measuring
    states and physical variables at unprecedented spatial, spectral, and temporal
    resolutions. They include remote sensing systems, mounted on satellites, airplanes,
    and drones, but also in-situ observations (increasingly from autonomous sensors)
    at, and below, the surface and in the atmosphere. Data from numerical, radiative
    transfer and climate models, and from reanalysis, are also very effective for
    tackling specific problems in Earth science. The data deluge is ever-growing in
    volume (hundreds of petabytes already), speed (estimated around 5 Pb/yr), variety
    (in sampling frequencies, spectral ranges, spatio-temporal scales and dimensionality),
    and uncertainty (from observational errors to conceptual inconsistencies). • The
    Machine Learning revolution. Besides, ML techniques have emerged as a fundamentally
    effective way to model and extract patterns out of big data in a (semi)automatic
    manner. Earth science has been also impacted by such revolution in many different
    ways. For example, machine learning models are now routinely used to predict and
    understand components of the Earth system: 1) classification of land cover types,
    2) modelling of land-atmosphere and ocean-atmosphere exchange of greenhouse gases,
    3) detection of anomalies and extreme events, and 4) causal discovery have greatly
    benefited from ML approaches. ML has been also used to complement physical models
    developed in the last 50 years, which are now able to assimilate the measured
    data and yield more accurate estimates/predictions of the evolution of the system
    (or parts thereof), such as the Atmosphere or the Ocean. Hybrid modeling and physics-aware
    machine learning are nowadays emerging fields too, and promise data-driven and
    physically consistent models for the future study of the Earth system. All in
    all, the access to such unprecedented big data sources, increased computational
    power, and the recent advances in ML offer exciting new opportunities for expanding
    our knowledge about the Earth system from data. EO is now at the center of the
    data processing pipeline. Either data assimilation, canonical ML, or advanced
    hybrid modeling needs to successfully exploit at maximum the diversity and complementarity
    of the different data sources. The use of information fusion is thus essential
    to obtain robust models in this discipline, with physical coherence and high accuracy,
    able to describe the different processes the Earth system. In any information
    fusion process involving EO data, heterogeneous data coming from very different
    sources are considered. It is thus understood that we are able to extract descriptors
    (features, covariates) that describe them, following a specific problem-dependent
    procedure, so these features can be further processed by applying algorithms.
    Depending on the problem tackled, these data features can present different spatio-temporal
    resolution, high dimension, or any other characteristic that makes their direct
    processing using algorithms (ML in this case) difficult. The different processes
    and methods for data fusion in EO can be broadly classified depending on the level
    where the fusion is done: at a sub-feature (data transformations to harmonize
    sources), at the feature level (direct fusion of data sets or their resulted features
    into the ML algorithms), or at the decision level (different processing paths
    with fusion at the decision level). In this paper, we review the current state
    of information fusion data-driven algorithms based on ML techniques, for problems
    in EO data analysis. The proposed review and perspective paper has a clear practical
    intention: we first describe the most relevant previous works in the field, structuring
    the description into different applications of EO. We also describe the most relevant
    and important data sets and sources for EO problems, i.e., what are the most important
    data sources currently available for EO studies, and how a researcher can obtain
    them. Finally, a carefully selected set of case studies will complete the work
    by illustrating in a practical way different aspects of ML information fusion
    for EO problems. We conclude the paper with a general outlook and discussion about
    the near future of this particular field. Following the objective of this paper,
    we have structured this work into three main blocks after this introduction, and
    a final section of conclusions, discussion and outlook. First, we provide a complete
    and updated literature review of ML information fusion in EO, including previous
    reviews and overview works, a taxonomy of the field and a review of illustrative
    previous works related to ML for information fusion. The second block of the paper
    is devoted to describe the existing data sources useful for EO, including satellite
    data, in-situ observations and different models applied to EO problems. The third
    block of the paper presents different case studies focused on ML information fusion
    in real EO problems. The final part of the paper consists of a discussion, conclusion,
    and perspective section, where the current challenges on the field, recent trends
    and possible future research are outlined. 2. Machine learning information fusion
    in Earth observation: a comprehensive literature review Earth observation is a
    huge research area, involving extremely different problems, applications and cases
    in all the spheres of the Earth system. The challenge of summarizing all the work
    that has been done in the whole area is therefore unmanageable. We, however, focus
    on ML information fusion for EO, which alleviates somehow the difficulty, though
    it is still very hard to summarize all the work on this field, and there are different
    ways to tackle this task. We have decided to structure this section based on applications
    and problems faced with ML information fusion in EO problems. We have therefore
    based this discussion of previous works on existing applications and problems
    tackled with ML information fusion. First, just to show the huge previous work
    carried out in the whole EO area in the last years, we discuss some previous reviews
    and overview works in topics somehow related to EO, but covering more specific
    or partial aspects, not directly related to ML information fusion. We present
    afterwards a taxonomy of ML information fusion approaches, and finally we carry
    out a complete description of previous works dealing with ML information fusion
    in EO problems, classified by different problems or application areas. 2.1. Previous
    reviews and overviews in EO The importance of Earth modeling and the current interest
    in related applications have led to a huge amount of research work in the last
    years, some of them focused on information fusion techniques, in different areas
    of the topic. The interest is of a such magnitude that a considerably high number
    of reviews and overviews have been published, the large majority within the last
    5 years. Table 1 summarizes the body of literature in the intersection of ML,
    Earth sciences, and information fusion applications. Table 1. Summary of Information
    Fusion works that use Machine Learning in Earth observation applications. For
    each group of applications (first column) we have summarized the main points concerning
    the type / level of information fusion (second column) and the different ML techniques
    used (on the third one). The last column groups the corresponding references for

    [71] The first review article focused on information fusion for Earth observational
    data is [5]. This seminal review paper summarized the main concepts related to
    information fusion in a general, coarse grain, approach. Another early review
    on topics involving Earth sciences is the one in [6], mainly focused on a broad
    description of computational intelligence methods applied to this field, with
    special emphasis on the importance of data fusion. The subsequent review articles
    are much more specific, focused on detailed parts of ESS or on data source/methods.
    Many of these reviews deal with different aspects of remote sensing. Regarding
    this, Torabzadeh et al. [7] has presented a review of fusion spectroscopy images
    and laser systems for forest ecosystem characterization, while Chen et al. [8]
    has recently analyzed the state-of-the art of spatio-temporal fusion models for
    remote sensing, by means of a comparison among the most important existing ones.
    Also within the framework of remote sensing, Gómez-Chova et al. [9] has presented
    a review on multi-modal classification techniques for remote sensing images, and
    Schmitt and Zhu [10] presented a review specifically focused on data fusion techniques
    and algorithms for remote sensing. Image fusion methods and algorithms have been
    fully described in several recent review papers too: Ghassemian [11] presented
    a general review of image fusion for remote sensing, and Garzelli [12] carried
    out a review on image fusion from the super-resolution paradigm. In [13], [14],
    the main methods and algorithms for hyperspectral and multispectral data fusion
    in remote sensing have been reviewed, whereas in [15] the basis, state-of-the-art
    and challenges of multisource and multitemporal data fusion algorithms are discussed.
    Two recent review papers deal with Big Data methods in Earth sciences: Guo et
    al. [16] is focused on big data techniques from satellite data sources, whereas
    Gibert et al. [17] introduces environmental data science algorithms and methods,
    in a wide number of ESS applications. Finally, some reviews on deep learning with
    focus on Earth sciences have been recently published, such as [18], [19], [20],
    [21], which describe the most recent deep learning approaches in remote sensing
    applications, or Zhang et al. [22] with a broader perspective in the big data
    area. Finally, it is worth mentioning the perspective paper [23] which, focused
    on describing the most important challenges and future directions in data-driven
    ESS, suggest that multisource information fusion and hybrid modeling will play
    a fundamental role in the near future. 2.2. A taxonomy of ML information fusion
    approaches A variety of information fusion schemes have been proposed in the context
    of EO. Broadly speaking, information fusion is concerned on the multisource data
    combination and support decision making. Each fusion method is designed for a
    specific problem so it is challenging, if not impossible, to define a full taxonomical
    overview of the field. The main building blocks, however, have to do with the
    exploitation of i) disparate inputs, ii) data (pre)processing approach, iii) fusion
    mechanism, and iv) outputs post-processing. Actually, fusion approaches are usually
    named depending on the type of modalities, so a simple taxonomy of fusion problems
    can be defined in terms of when, at what level, and how the fusion is done. This
    is why we distinguish between the following types of fusion approaches: 1. sub-feature
    level, which usually involve different spatial-temporal scales fused following
    appropriate transforms of the data with the aim to harmonize sources into common
    “multidimensional grids”; 2. feature level, where a direct fusion of the data
    sets is simply stacked and fed into the ML of choice. This direct stacking can
    be more sophisticated if optimal feature combinations, and data source transformations,
    are learned from data to end up stacking feature representations; 3. decision
    level, where one performs different processing paths for each modality, followed
    by fusion at the decision level. This assumes that the outputs can be combined
    to improve the achieved accuracy. Different methods exist here that optimally
    operate on the combination of output activation functions. The best way to understand
    such differences is however to present different real examples in the literature,
    as follows. 2.3. Literature review In this section we review the most important
    previous works on ML information fusion in EO problems. In terms of ML algorithms,
    the field mainly exploits either classifiers (of land use or land cover), or anomaly,
    target and change detection algorithms (for screening or identifying one class
    of interest and discard the rest), or regression methods (to estimate a particular
    variable of interest from either sensory data mounted on satellites, airborne
    or drones). We have structured this section in different subsections by application
    area or problem type, taken into account the most usual problems in which ML information
    fusion techniques have obtained significant results. 2.3.1. Surface temperature
    The accurate estimation of surface temperature (inland and sea) from different
    sensors, both grounded and satellites, is extremely important in a number of problems,
    including agricultural studies, energy balance, land desertification and climate
    change applications, among others. In the literature, it is possible to find different
    studies applying data driven and ML techniques together with information fusion
    methods to estimate surface temperature. In [24] a feature level information fusion
    algorithm which hybridizes local atmospheric variables information from a ground
    station with synoptic information from numerical models is proposed for temperature
    prediction at Barcelona airport, Spain. An ensemble of Support Vector Regression
    (SVR) algorithms is used to carry out the information fusion and to obtain the
    temperature prediction. In [25], a hybrid wavelet ML feature level fusion approach
    is proposed to obtain high-resolution land surface temperature, mixing Landsat
    8 thermal bands and MODIS (moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer) pixels.
    Wavelets SVR, adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and neural
    networks are the artificial intelligence methods tested in this problem. In [26],
    a problem of high-spatiotemporal-resolution land surface temperature reconstruction
    is tackled, by applying a weighted combination kernel-based and fusion methods,
    in order to improve the spatial and temporal resolutions of satellite images.
    This method can be classified as a sub-feature level approach. Specifically, MODIS
    and Landsat 8 datasets have been considered for the experimental evaluation of
    the proposed method, obtaining more accurate images than the kernel method on
    its own. Recently, in [27] a feature level information fusion process from different
    sources (measuring points) and a gated neural network was proposed to estimate
    the sea temperature at Bohai Sea, China. 2.3.2. Droughts and water quality Closely
    related with surface temperature estimation, the analysis of drought and water
    quality using ML and data fusion techniques has been recently proposed. In [28],
    a high resolution soil moisture drought index was proposed. This index is based
    on measurements of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer on the Earth Observing
    System over the Korea, improved by MODIS and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission
    satellite sensors information, which was used to carry out a high-resolution feature
    level downscaling with a Random Forest (RF) algorithm to 1 -km measurements. In
    [29] a SVR algorithm was proposed to obtain an accurate estimation of evapotranspiration
    by fusion of three process-based evapotranspiration algorithms: MOD16, PT-JPL
    and SEMI-PM, to produce a feature level information fusion approach. In [30],
    the study of drought events was carried out by applying new fusion approaches
    from high-resolution satellite and reanalysis data at feature level. The work
    in [31] is focused on determining whether the fusion of several remotely-sensed
    drought factors could be effectively used for monitoring drought events in Australia.
    This problem is tackled as a regression task with information fusion at feature
    level, where three ML approaches have been tested, RF, SVR and artificial neural
    networks. Regarding ML fusion methods for water quality studies, in [32] a Genetic
    Programming approach is applied to fusion data from different satellite sources,
    such as MODIS or Landsat Thematic Mapper. The objective is to generate daily estimates
    of different water quality parameters such as chlorophyll-a concentrations or
    water transparency, for a freshwater lake (Albufera) in Valencia, Spain. Also,
    Jiang et al. [33] proposes a general framework based on computer vision feature
    representation, for the fusion of multisource spatiotemporal data for hydrological
    modeling (sub-feature level information fusion), following by the application
    of artificial neural networks and SVR algorithms. Finally, a review of fusion
    methods in water quality can be found in [34]. 2.3.3. Cloud detection and classification
    Cloud detection and classification is an EO area where ML information fusion has
    been successfully applied. In [35] a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has been
    applied to a problem of cloud classification using ground-based images. This proposal
    uses a two-stream structure which contains the vision subnetwork and multimodal
    subnetwork. In another layer of the network (fusion layer), the visual and multimodal
    features from the two subnetworks are extracted and then integrated using a weighted
    strategy. This is therefore a decision level method. The results have been tested
    in a specific database of multimodal ground-based clouds. In [36] a cloud detection
    method based on CNN was proposed. The idea is to extract multi-scale and high-level
    spatial features by using a symmetric encoder-decoder module. The feature maps
    of multiple scales are then passed to a multi-scale feature fusion module, designed
    to fuse the features of different scales for the output in another decision level
    process. A final binary classifier is able to obtain the final cloud and cloud
    shadow mask. The method was validated on a large number of optical satellite images
    around the world, with different spatial resolutions ranging from 0.5 to 50 m.
    2.3.4. Land use applications Land use is another important area of interest in
    EO where information fusion has emerged lately. Recently, there have been many
    different works on land use tasks which combine different data sources or fusion
    algorithms with ML, in order to obtain robust approaches with optimal performance.
    For example, Wang et al. [37] proposes the fusion of multispectral HJ1B imagery
    (from China’s HJ-CCD B satellite) and ALOS (Advanced Land Observing Satellite)
    PALSAR L-band (Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar) data for land
    cover classification, using sub-feature level information fusion, Support Vector
    Machine (SVM) and RF algorithms. In [38] an investigation focused on extraction
    of buildings from middle and high resolution satellite images is carried out,
    by fusing the information of different spectral indices with ML algorithms and
    sub-feature level information fusion techniques. In [39] a deep CNN paradigm has
    been applied to a problem of automatic-land use classification from satellite
    images. Besides, in [40] a cellular automata – Markov model is proposed in order
    to generate land use images from fusing images belonging to different years. This
    approach considers a sub-feature level information fusion mechanism, and has been
    successfully tested in reconstructing land use images in Hefei (China), from satellite
    data from the last 30 years. In [41] a feature level approach for fusing soil
    data coming from legacy soil surveys with direct soil information from remote
    sensing images was proposed. In [42], several decision level and feature level
    fusion approaches were developed to tackle the problem of local climate zones
    classification based on a multitemporal and multimodal dataset, including image
    (Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2) and vector data (from OpenStreetMap) using ensemble
    classifiers and deep learning approaches. Finally, in [43] a feature level fusion
    of information from Google Earth and ML algorithms, including SVMs and regression
    trees, was proposed for a problem of palm oil mapping in Malaysia. 2.3.5. Image
    classification and segmentation Image classification is another field closely
    related to very different remote sensing applications, where ML information fusion
    has been successfully applied. In [44] a decision level method which combines
    SVM and fuzzy C-means clustering for fusing hyperspectral images information is
    proposed. In this approach, the SVM is used to generate a spectral-based classification
    map, whereas the fuzzy C-means is used to provide an ensemble of clustering maps.
    In [45] a feature level fusion of hyperspectral and light detection and ranging
    (LiDAR) images is proposed, under the hypothesis that LiDAR provide a source of
    complementary information, which can be really useful to improve classification
    of hyperspectral data. Specifically, the derived features from the two sources
    are fused via either feature stacking or graph-based feature fusion, and the fused
    features are fed to a deep CNN with logistic regression to produce the final classification
    map. The fusion of hyperspectral data and LiDAR is also treated in [46], and mixing
    hyperspectral data, LiDAR and other data sources with CNN in [47]. Finally, in
    [48] an unsupervised feature extraction method based on deep multiscale spectral-spatial
    feature fusion for hyperspectral images classification is proposed. The method
    is based on pre-trained filter banks and on a new unsupervised cooperative sparse
    autoencoder method to fuse together the deep spatial feature and the raw spectral
    information (sub-feature level fusion). 2.3.6. Renewable energy Renewable energy
    resources are fully related to ESS, since the main renewable sources (wind, solar,
    ocean) are fully conditioned by atmospheric or oceanic conditions. Due to their
    intermittent intrinsic nature, renewable energy sources present difficulties to
    be integrated in the energy mix, and usually need prediction techniques to this
    end. Interestingly, the main renewable energies are affected by climate change,
    which produces a redistribution of the renewable resources. In general, the study
    of renewable resource prediction is a hot topic in which the fusion of different
    sources of information has also been explored. In fact, information fusion in
    renewable energy has been mainly exploded in solar energy prediction systems.
    Solar energy resource prediction is fully connected to the prediction of clouds,
    which is a difficult problem from the meteorological point of view, in which information
    from different data sources is able to improve the prediction systems. In [49],
    several neural network architectures with different input data sources were proposed
    to problems of solar radiation. More recently, in [50] a solar radiation prediction
    problem from different sources data was proposed. Data from in-situ measurement
    and from the GFS model were the inputs for a temporal Gaussian Process algorithm,
    which obtained better results than alternative ML algorithms in the problem. Another
    work dealing with data from different sources in a problem of solar radiation
    prediction is [51], which proposed the prediction of intra-day solar radiation
    by means of data from irradiance measurements, satellite data and weather prediction
    models using artificial neural networks. Results in two different points of the
    Canary islands were reported. In [52] an study on the evaluation of global horizontal
    irradiance from two different reanalysis projects (ERA5 and COSMO-REA6) is carried
    out. This work uses ground and satellite-based data to estimate the accuracy of
    these reanalysis in obtaining horizontal irradiance. The results obtained show
    that reanalysis data have important absolute error when estimating the irradiation,
    due to an inefficient cloud cover estimation. However, reanalysis products are
    an important data source for prediction and estimation problems in renewable energy,
    useful for information fusion with other sources, as in [53], where data from
    ERA5 reanalysis are hybridized with satellite measurements at feature level, and
    all the information is processed with a RF algorithm in order to obtain an accurate
    estimation of solar irradiance at high latitudes. 2.3.7. Model-data integration
    and assimilation Any optical remote sensing data present significant amounts of
    noise and missing data due to clouds, cloud shadows, and aerosol contamination,
    which difficult its use in any subsequent application. In addition, optical remote
    sensing sensors are hampered by a limited temporal, spectral or spatial resolutions
    [54]. As an example, medium spatial resolution sensors, such as Landsat or the
    Sentinel 2, have low temporal resolutions (16 and 8 day revisit cycle respectively)
    causing missing values continue to be one of the major limitations for their operational
    use, especially in areas with moderate to high cloud occurrence. The mitigation
    of undesired inherent data noise and minimizing the amount of missing data present
    are mandatory tasks in almost any application, since they are incompatible with
    a robust remote monitoring framework of earth’s surface. Because of the importance
    of this topic, the available scientific literature is rich in methods to deal
    with these issues, and solutions vary significantly with the different levels
    of sophistication [55]. Temporal, spatial, spatio-temporal, and blending (sensor
    fusion) approaches have been very valuable tools to reduce noise and recover missing
    pixels information, being data fusion methods very interesting approaches for
    overcoming individual sensor’s limitations and combining different multiresolution
    datasets. Most of data fusion approaches need to compute complex spatial operations
    to account for inhomogeneities within coarser spatial resolution pixels [56].
    These operations are computationally demanding allowing only the application of
    these algorithms to small areas. In the context of modern data assimilation approaches,
    Sedano et al. [57] introduced a pixel-based method with a Kalman filter (KF) [58]
    to fuse time series of MODIS and Landsat vegetation indices. This KF implementation
    obtained satisfactory results but also allowed to account for realistic uncertainties
    in its calculations. Moreover, the KF does not require explicit parameter tuning
    and it scales well in large scale applications due to its pixel-based nature.
    2.3.8. Unstructured domain data fusion The number of EO platforms for capturing
    remotely sensed data has been exponentially increased, ranging from an ever-growing
    number of satellites in orbit and planned for launch, to new platforms for capturing
    fine spatial resolution data such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Moreover,
    a great interest has been recently dedicated to the new sources of ancillary data,
    to name a few, social media, crowd sourcing, scraping the internet and so on [59],
    [60]. These data have a very different modality to remote sensing data, but may
    be related to the subject of interest and, consequently, may be found useful with
    respect to specific problems. For example, social media data can provide local
    and live/real-time information suitable for accurate monitoring of our living
    environment [61], in particular in a variety of applications relevant to smart
    cities [62], [63], emergency and environmental hazards [64], [65], among others.
    2.3.9. Other applications There are other applications of ML algorithms in EO
    which exploit data fusion to improve their results. One of the first works on
    exploiting data fusion from multi-sensor sources with ML was [66], where a problem
    of ionograms inversion is tackled using data fusion techniques with neural networks.
    More recently, there have been alternative specific applications, such as [67]
    where a problem of total ozone in column prediction is tackled with SVMs and information
    fusion from different data sources, such as numerical models, ground stations
    and satellite data. In [68] a problem of eddy detection from different satellite
    sensors images was faced, using a deep learning approach for multi-scale feature
    fusion, followed by a SVM algorithm. In [69] the combination of data from multiple
    sensors was used to improve the estimation of forest biomass. Data from interferometric
    and photogrammetric based predictors, in combination with hyperspectral predictors
    were used, by applying ML algorithms such as RF, Generalized Additive Models or
    boosted algorithms. These approaches were applied to estimate biomass in a temperate
    forest near Karlsruhe, Germany. In [70] different ML classifiers were applied
    to a problem of detecting seagrass presence/absence and distinguishing seagrass
    families in the Mediterranean, from fusion of seagrass presence data and other
    external environmental variables. As a final application of ML information fusion
    in ESS, in [71], a problem of environmental event sound recognition is tackled
    by means of a staked CNN. 3. Data sources and models for Earth observation The
    study of the ESS and its many components is based on observational data from very
    different sources, and very different atmospheric and climate models and simulations,
    among other data sources (such as social media or socio-economic data, sometimes
    fused with them). Every minute, millions of sensors collect data from the whole
    planet. Their processing, fusion with physic-based models, analysis and study
    is in the core of many works on EO-related problems. In this section, we describe
    the most important data sources and models currently available for studies on
    EO. We also provide the complete reference to the majority of these data sources,
    so the interested reader knows where they can be obtained. We have structured
    the section into subsections describing satellite, in-situ (ground-based, atmosphere
    and marine observations sources), forecasting models and finally reanalysis projects.
    3.1. Satellite observations Attending to the type of energy sources involved in
    the data acquisition, two main kinds of remote sensing imaging instruments can
    be distinguished: either passive optical remote sensing, which relies on solar
    radiation as the illumination source [72], [73], [74], [75], [76], or active sensors,
    where the energy is emitted by an antenna towards the Earth’s surface and the
    energy scattered back to the satellite is measured [77], [78]. Some examples of
    passive sensors are infrared, charge-coupled devices, radiometers, and multi and
    hyperspectral sensors [79]. On the other hand, radar systems, such as Real Aperture
    RAR (RAR) or Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), are examples of systems for active
    remote sensing. Fig. 1 shows some characteristics (spatial, spectral, and temporal
    resolutions) of the main available optical and microwave satellite sensors. Download

    3.2. In-situ observations: ground, atmosphere, and ocean 3.2.1. Ground-based observations
    Ground-based observations have been traditionally the most basic source of atmospheric
    data, especially before the satellite Era. Currently, ground-based observations
    and satellites are mainly assimilated by numerical and climatic models, so its
    importance is still very high in EO applications, mainly in meteorological and
    climatological studies. • The European Climate Assessment & Dataset project (ECA&D)
    dataset [80], [81]. The ECA&D database consists of daily station series of different
    meteorological/climatological variables: daily mean temperature, precipitation,
    sea level pressure or wind speed, among others. A gridded version with daily temperature,
    precipitation and pressure fields is also available for this database. • The Climatic
    Research Unit (CRU) temperature datasets [82]. These databases, usually known
    as CRU and HadCRUT4, are global temperature datasets, providing gridded temperature
    anomalies across the world. • The Global precipitation data from the Global Precipitation
    and Climatology Center (GPCC) [83]. The GPCC provides gridded quality controlled
    station data. Another source of precipitation data is the database from the Global
    Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) [84], which provides monthly precipitation
    dataset from 1979 to the present, combining observations and satellite precipitation
    data into 2.5∘ × 2.5∘ global grids. • The Global Historical Climatology Network-Monthly
    (GHCN-M) database [85]. The CHCN-M provides gridded land precipitation and temperature
    anomalies on a 5∘ × 5∘ basis for the entire globe, from 1900 to 2015. This database
    is useful for climate monitoring activities, including calculation of global land
    surface temperature anomalies and trends. • The Goddard Institute for Space Studies
    (GISS) database [86]. The GISS surface temperature database provides a measure
    of the changing global surface temperatures, with monthly temporal resolution
    since 1880. The data is available on an 2.5∘ × 2.5∘ and two smoothing levels of
    250 km and 1200 km smoothing. A land only version is also available. The dataset
    is continuously updated, and it is necessary to take into account that there are
    missing data values within this database. There are other gridded ground-based
    databases at NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL), which can be explored
    and downloaded from ESR [87]. When it comes to large data volumes, the U.S. Government’s
    open data initiative DATA.GOV://www.data.gov collects and harmonizes all kind
    of social, economical, environmental, remotely-sensed datasets. 3.2.2. Observations
    and simulations of land-atmosphere interactions Monitoring the land-atmosphere
    interactions is currently done thanks to a global network of continuous measurements.
    This is called the FLUXNET which is a global network of micro-meteorological tower
    sites that use eddy covariance methods to measure the exchanges of carbon dioxide,
    water vapor, and energy between the biosphere and atmosphere. FLUXNET is a global
    “network of regional networks” that serves to provide an infrastructure to compile,
    archive and distribute data for the scientific community. The large-scale measurement
    network, FLUXNET integrates site observations of these fluxes globally and provides
    detailed time series of carbon and energy fluxes across biomes and climates [88].
    The data have been used to perform local or regional studies, but also to upscale
    globally the fluxes: move from point-based flux estimates to spatially explicit
    gridded fields of carbon and energy fluxes with machine learning and information
    fusion techniques [89], [90]. An interesting initiative on land and atmosphere
    data harmonization is the Earth System Data Lab (ESDL) platform, ESDL, which curates
    a big database with more than 40 variables to monitor the processes occurring
    in our Planet. They are grouped in three data streams (land surface, atmospheric
    forcings but also socio-economic data [91]) and allow running algorithms in the
    web platform. 3.2.3. Atmospheric observations Atmospheric soundings data [92],
    [93] are useful instruments to obtain an instant state of the atmosphere, i.e.
    a vertical profile of the atmosphere at a single point in time and above a particular
    position on Earth. Usually, a small instrument package called radiosonde is embedded
    into to a weather balloon, which is released from the surface and usually reaches
    the troposphere. The radiosonde is able to measure different properties of the
    atmosphere such as the vertical profile of temperature, dew point, wind speed
    and direction, among others, as it ascends. Atmospheric soundings data are very
    useful tools for EO, mainly in meteorological problems, specially in those related
    to local phenomena prediction, such as convection initialization or cloud formation,
    etc. 3.2.4. Marine observations Marine-based data sources are also freely available
    in many cases, and contribute to the study of different parts of the ESS. One
    of the main sources of physical oceanographic/Meteorology data is the data base
    of the National Data Buoy Center of the USA (NDBC) [94]. This database contains
    freely available data from dozens of ocean buoys located at the Atlantic Ocean,
    Caribbean Sea, West Coast of the USA and Alaskan Gulf. There are other important
    data sources for marine observations, such as the Pan-European Infrastructure
    for Ocean & Marine Data Management [95] in Europe or Australian Ocean Data Network
    [96] for the Asia-Pacific region. Over the last decade, the development of cutting-edge
    robotic technology has dramatically demonstrated the potential of autonomous observations
    to overcome the issue of data scarcity. For example, the ground-breaking Argo
    international program has set up an array of more than 3500 profiling floats that
    provide measurements of temperature and salinity profiles from the surface down
    to 2000 m below sea level every 10 days. As the first-ever global in-situ ocean-observing
    network in the history of oceanography, Argo provides a crucial complement to
    satellite systems, thus enabling observation, understanding and prediction of
    the ocean’s functioning and its role in the Earth’s climate. 3.3. Numerical weather
    models Weather prediction models, also known as numerical weather models, solve
    systems of differential equations (the Navier-Stokes equations, energy, mass and
    linear momentum conservation) to obtain the future state the atmosphere. Specifically,
    fluid motion, thermodynamics, radiative transfer, and atmospheric chemistry are
    taken into account, using a coordinate system which divides the whole planet into
    a grid. Thus, wind speed, heat transfer, solar radiation, relative humidity, among
    other variables are calculated within each grid node, and the interactions with
    neighboring nodes are then used to estimate the atmospheric evolution for the
    future. A few global forecasting models are run in the world, using current weather
    observations relayed from radiosondes, weather satellites and other observing
    systems as inputs (data assimilation process). Processing the vast datasets and
    obtaining the solution of the system of differential equations previously mentioned
    in each node of the global grid require of powerful supercomputers. Even in this
    case, the forecast skill of current numerical weather models extends to only about
    six days, due to the non-linear and chaotic nature of the atmosphere. Some of
    the global forecasting models currently in operation are: • The Global Forecast
    System (GFS) is produced by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction
    (NCEP) [97], [98]. • The Global Environmental Multiscale Model (GEM), often known
    as the CMC model in North America, is an integrated forecasting and data assimilation
    system developed in the Recherche en Prévision Numérique (RPN), Meteorological
    Research Branch (MRB), and the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) [99], [100],
    [101]. • The Navy Global Environmental Model (NAVGEM) is a global numerical weather
    prediction computer simulation run by the United States Navy’s Fleet Numerical
    Meteorology and Oceanography Center [102]. • The Integrated Forecasting System
    (IFS), is the global numerical model run by the European Center for Medium-range
    Weather Forecast (ECMWF) [103]. • The Unified Model (UM) is a numerical model
    of the atmosphere developed by the Met. Office (UK) [104]. It can be used for
    both weather and climate applications. • The ARPEGE (Action de Recherche Petite
    Echelle Grande Echelle) model is the operational numerical weather model at Météo
    France [105]. This system was developed and it is currently maintained in collaboration
    with the ECMWF. There are some works which have evaluated and compared the performance
    of these and other weather numerical models in different EO application contexts
    [106], [107]. Recently, the possibility of using ML algorithms as alternative
    techniques for global weather forecasting has also been discussed [108]. 3.3.1.
    Reanalysis projects A Reanalysis project is a methodology that combines existing
    past observations, by applying data assimilation techniques, with modern numerical
    weather models. Reanalysis projects usually extend over several decades and cover
    the entire planet (global) or extended regions (regional), being a very useful
    tool for obtaining a comprehensive picture of the state of the Earth system, which
    can be used for meteorological and climatological studies. There are several reanalysis
    projects currently in operation, and some others which were the precursors of
    the current ones. Two of the first reanalyses projects in operation were the NCEP/NCAR
    Reanalysis (Reanalysis-1) [109], a global reanalysis of atmospheric data spanning
    1948 to present and the NCEP/DOE Reanalysis (Reanalysis-2) project [110], spanning
    1979 to present. The Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) [111] was an effort
    to generate an uniform, continuous, and best-estimate record of the state of the
    ocean-atmosphere interaction for use in climate monitoring and diagnostics. It
    is a global reanalysis, spanning data from January 1979 through March 2011. ERA-Interim
    [112] is a global atmospheric reanalysis developed by the ECMWF. It covers from
    1979, continuously updated in real time. The spatial resolution of the data set
    is approximately 15 km, on 60 vertical levels from the surface up to 0.1 hPa.
    ERA-Interim provides 6-hourly atmospheric fields on model levels, pressure levels,
    potential temperature and potential vorticity, and 3-hourly surface fields. ERA-5
    [113] is the latest reanalysis project from the ECMWF. This reanalysis covers
    the Earth on a 30km grid and resolves the atmosphere using 137 levels from the
    surface up to a height of 80km. The Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research
    and Applications (MERRA) dataset was released in 2009 [114]. MERRA data span the
    period from 1979 through February 2016 and were produced on a 0.5∘ × 0.66∘ grid
    with 72 layers. MERRA was used to drive stand-alone reanalyses of the land surface
    (MERRA-Land) and atmospheric aerosols (MERRAero). It is also worth mentioning
    the Japanese 25-year Reanalysis (JRA-25) [115] which is the first long-term global
    atmospheric reanalysis undertaken in Asia, and it covers the period 1979–2004.
    There are also Regional reanalysis, such as the North American Regional Reanalysis
    (NARR) [116]. It is a regional reanalysis of North America containing temperatures,
    winds, moisture, soil data, and many other parameters. The high-resolution reanalysis
    system COSMO-REA6 has been developed based on the NWP model COSMO [117]. This
    is a regional reanalysis system for Continental Europe. This reanalysis data set
    currently covers the period 1995–2016 and it is currently in operation. The European
    Reanalysis and Observations for Monitoring project (EURO4M) [118] is a EU funded
    project that provides timely and reliable information about the state and evolution
    of the European climate. Finally, note that there are several works focused on
    direct comparison of several reanalysis for the evaluation of different meteorological
    phenomena [119], [120], [121]. 4. Case studies on ML information fusion in Earth
    observation In this section we show empirical evidence of the performance of different
    ML fusion algorithms, working at different fusion levels in real practical EO
    problems. We discuss here four case studies: first, we present a problem of gap
    filling of several soil moisture time series from multiple microwave satellite
    data, working at different resolutions. In the second case study, we describe
    different algorithms that blend heterogeneous satellite sources in the optical
    range at different spatial and temporal scales in the Google Earth Engine platform.
    The third case study shows how natural hazards can be better predicted and modelled
    with ML data fusion. Finally, we introduce a case study where we discuss the fusion
    methodologies of EO and social media, stressing the importance and of unstructured
    data in EO, and the difficulty of their management. 4.1. Multitemporal and multisensor
    gap-filling in remote sensing The presence of gaps in EO data limits their applicability
    in a number of applications that need continuous data. Standard techniques for
    gap filling temporal series such as linear or cubic interpolation, or auto-regressive
    functions fail to reconstruct sharp transitions or long data gaps. Also, they
    are not able to infer information from other collocated sensors measuring the
    same biophysical variable, which is the setting found, for instance, when harmonizing
    data from multiple satellites into consistent climate data records of Essential
    Climate Variables (ECVs) [122]. Another challenging setting for standard gap-filling
    approaches is the fusion of collocated microwave and optical observations for
    cloud-free estimates of vegetation descriptors, which needs to exploit the relationships
    between the two [123]. In this section, we show how we can efficiently deal with
    the spatio-temporal gaps of collocated satellite-based observations by employing
    a multi-output Gaussian Process model based on the Linear Model of Corregionalization
    (LMC) [124]. The method allows learning the relationships among the different
    sensors and build an across-domain kernel function to transfer information across
    the time series and do predictions with associated confidence intervals on regions
    where no data are available. We illustrate the procedure using soil moisture time
    series from three spaceborne microwave sensors, which are integrated in the ESA
    Climate Change Initiative (CCI) soil moisture product [125]: the ESA’s SMOS L-band
    radiometer, the AMSR2 C-band radiometer on-board JAXA’s GCOM-W1, and the ASCAT
    C-band scatterometer on-board Eumetsat MetOp satellites. The temporal period of
    study is 6 years, starting in June 2010. Each product presents different observational
    gaps due to the presence of Radio Frequency Interferences at their operating frequency
    or high uncertainty in their inversion algorithm (e.g. presence of snow masking
    observations, dense vegetation, or high topography). The problem we face here
    is that we need a gap-filling methodology able to handle several outputs together
    and force a “sharp” reconstruction of the time series so that fast dry-down and
    wetting-up dynamics are preserved (avoid smoothing). We show the application of
    the LMC multi-output GP regression at two in-situ soil moisture networks from
    the International Soil Moisture Network : REMEDHUS in Spain (17 stations [126]),
    and DAHRA in Senegal (1 station [127]). In terms of temporal coverage, they are
    representative of best-case (REMEDHUS), and wort-case (DAHRA) scenarios, where
    best satellite coverage is of 91 % and of 64 % of the study period, respectively.
    Results of the application of the proposed LMC-GP over DAHRA are shown in Fig.
    2, together with the original satellite time series and the in-situ data as a
    benchmark. It can be seen that the reconstructed soil moisture time series follow
    closely the original time series, capturing the wetting-up and drying-down events
    and filling the missing information (e.g. see the peak in October 2014 which was
    captured only by SMOS and is reproduced by the three reconstructed time series).
    Also, predictions have associated uncertainties related to the availability of
    training data for each specific sensor. It is remarkable that for AMSR2 the reconstructed
    time series back-propagate to dates before the satellite was launched (shown here
    for illustration purposes), yet they look very consistent with the real satellite
    data. Given the soil moisture products present no-data in different time and space
    locations, the method allows to provide predictions at all time stamps where at
    least there is one satellite measurement, maximizing therefore the spatio-temporal
    coverage of the data sets. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download :

    (orange dots denote the training data and green lines the predictions). The blue
    rectangle indicates the time period that is represented in the bottom figure.
    The bottom-left dashed rectangle exemplifies how the method reconstructs long
    data gaps in AMSR2 based on no-rain information from the other two sensors, assigning
    a higher uncertainty when no training data is available. The bottom-right dashed
    rectangle points out a specific rainfall event that was captured only by SMOS
    and is accounted for in the reconstruction of ASCAT and AMSR2 time series. Statistical
    scores from comparison with in-situ data at the two sites of the original and
    reconstructed time series are shown in Table 2. The analyses show that Pearson’s
    correlation coefficient (R), mean error (ME) and unbiased root-mean-squared error
    (ubRMSE) with respect to in-situ data remain within reasonable bounds and are
    not affected to a high degree by the reconstruction, even in the more extreme
    case of DAHRA. These results provide confidence in the proposed technique and
    their potential to mitigate the effect of missing information in satellite-based
    observational records. Table 2. Mean error (ME) [ m 3 m − 3 ], unbiased RMSE (ubRMSE)

    data assimilation and hybrid modeling in geosciences In this case study, we focus
    on image data fusion (blending) methods as optimal approaches for overcoming individual
    sensor’s limitations and combining different multiresolution datasets. Blending
    Landsat and MODIS has been the preferred sensor combination in the literature
    and enabled predicting gap free surface reflectances [56], [128] at Landsat spatial
    resolution (30 m). Both missions provide long time series of data with a high
    degree of consistency. The MODIS sensor, on board of Terra and Aqua platforms,
    provides global observations and a daily revisit cycle at a cost of having a coarse
    spatial resolution (250-1000 m). This resolution clearly limits its utility for
    fine-scale environmental applications, but on the other hand, MODIS high temporal
    resolution allows tracking rapid land-cover changes while maximizes the possibility
    of having cloud-free observations. We have also capitalized on using these two
    sensors, especially because the proposed approach has been specifically designed
    to exploit past temporal information to improve the results. Here, we focus on
    a KF logic method named HIghly Scalable Temporal Adaptive Fusion Model (HISTARFM).
    This algorithm was implemented in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing
    platform [129] and consists of a bias-aware Bayesian data assimilation scheme
    [130]. HISTARFM uses two Kalman estimators operating simultaneously to reduce
    the amount of noise and decrease possible biases (if present) in the predicted
    Landsat spectral reflectances. The first estimator is an optimal interpolator
    (a special case of the Kalman filter with no dynamic model) that produces estimates
    of Landsat reflectance values for a given time by combining a Landsat climatology
    (mean monthly values considering many years) and linearly blended Landsat and
    MODIS spectral information. The second coupled estimator is an additional Kalman
    filter which is in charge of correcting dynamically possible biases of the reflectance
    produced (if present) by the first estimator. Fig. 3 shows an example of the results
    of the HISTARFM algorithm over an area with massive gaps due to cloud contamination
    and sensor malfunctioning. Download : Download high-res image (2MB) Download :

    and the gap filled data set processed with the proposed data assimilation approach.
    Both images correspond with a cropland area in Texas state (US) for the date May
    2010. HISTARFM takes advantage of the GEE platform, this enables to process huge
    amounts of data significantly faster than other approaches available in the literature.
    The validation of the proposed method over 1050 sites spread out over the conterminous
    United States indicated the feasibility of the method and provided satisfactory
    results. The relative mean errors remained below 2 % (in all spectral bands) and
    the relative mean absolute errors and relative root mean squared errors ranged
    between low to moderate (10-20 %) depending on the spectral band. Moreover, the
    high degree of agreement between the validation errors and the predicted uncertainties
    by HISTARFM indicated the utility of this information for error propagation purposes.
    4.3. Natural hazard prediction and data fusion Natural hazards cause thousands
    of deaths and inflict tremendous societal damage every year. To demonstrate the
    catastrophic influence of such hazards, between 2005 and 2014, 700,000 people
    were killed, and 1.7 billion people were affected worldwide by disasters2. This
    clearly demonstrates the importance of developing accurate and efficient mapping,
    modeling, and prediction techniques to reduce the catastrophic impact of natural
    hazards. The success of information fusion techniques has revolutionized the challenging
    and vitally important applications of modeling natural hazards [131]. In this
    context, the fusion of multiple sources of data using ML techniques has been reported
    as an effective tool to greatly contribute to increasing the accuracy of the prediction
    models [132], [133], [134], [135]. To provide a bird’s-eye view over the variety
    of data fusion models for hazard modeling, a number of relevant research studies
    have been summarized in Table 3, which provides an overview of the key contributions,
    investigated data sources, and the tackled hazard type. The fusion of the multiple
    data sources, e.g., satellite imaging, radar data, laser point clouds, UAV images,
    weather stations, crowdsourcing data, social media, and GIS have shown their advantages
    to greatly enhance the robustness and performance of hazard detection and avoidance
    systems, leading to a safer planetary anytime, anywhere. Table 3. Notable Research

    and drought modeling and prediction is regarded as a very complex phenomenon which
    is known to be among the least understood natural hazards due to its multiple
    causing reasons or contributing factors operating at different temporal and spatial
    scales. Fortunately, the application of data fusion in flood and drought modeling
    has evolved significantly compared to other hazards [151], [152], [153]. To demonstrate
    the effectiveness of ML-based information fusion techniques for the challenging
    application of flood prediction, in the following, we provided a dedicated case
    study. 4.3.1. Flood prediction by integrating remote sensing and weather station
    data Floods are increasingly recognized as a frequent natural hazard worldwide.
    Increasing the accuracy of flood susceptibility mapping is of utmost importance
    for efficient land use management, policy analysis, and the advancement of the
    mitigation structures to optimally reduce the devastation. Introduction to flood
    susceptibility mapping: Hazard susceptibility mapping of flood is essential for
    mitigation due to their higher destructive power in a short period. ML-based methods
    are among the most popular methods used for accurate mapping of the flood hazard
    [154]. Several comparative studies in the literature reported promising results
    using ML methods [155], [156]. Along with employing the hybridization and ensemble
    techniques for improving the accuracy of ML models, the data fusion techniques
    have shown promising results. The aim of this case study is to demonstrate the
    performance of a data fusion approach to integrate information obtained by weather
    stations, land survey, and satellite data to improve the accuracy of the flood
    superstability mapping. Materials and methods: The study area is Gorganroud Basin,
    located in the northwest of Iran between latitudes of 36∘25 ′ to 38∘15 ′ N and
    longitudes of 56∘26’ to 54∘10’ E. In this case study, the data fusion is conducted
    by locating the flooded and non-flooded points and identifying the inundated regions
    using Sentinel-2 satellite images. Due to the lack of recorded location of flood
    occurrences, the inundation areas are identified using the Modified Normalized
    Difference Water Index (MNDWI) of Sentinel-2. Radiometrically calibrated and terrain
    corrected Sentinel-2 Level-1C dataset is stored within GEE to support the free
    cloud computing facilities for this case study [157]. Fig. 4 shows the study area.
    The inundated area is extracted by MNDWI during a period from March and April
    of 2019 when the flood affected the region (Fig. 5). Furthermore, feature selection
    using simulated annealing and modeling through RF is used to identify the hazard
    areas. The validation is done using hit and miss analysis. Download : Download

    Flooded and non-flooded points (b) inundated regions according to Sentinel-2.
    After identifying the inundated area, the number of 368 flash-flood locations
    were randomly considered from the inundated points and their locations were confirmed
    through field surveys. For modeling, the inundated points were considered as the
    dependent variable and used for modeling with RF. Modeling: After preparing the
    predictand flood/non-flood locations as input and the predicting variables as
    output, the model is developed where the values of 0 and 1 were assigned to the
    non-flood and flood occurrence locations, respectively. From the whole dataset,
    70 % of the data is considered for training while the remaining 30 % of the data
    is used for testing. A 10-fold cross-validation methodology was used to train
    the ML models. The results of the hazard modeling using RF is shown in Fig. 6.

    data and social media Earth data is routinely used to infer many aspects of Earth.
    Since most Earth data are generated using satellites or airborne platforms, they
    are often limited to a birds-eye perspective. Given the high sensor quality and
    non-invasiveness of remote sensing, such birds-eye Earth data have become a primary
    driver for understanding the morphological structure of Earth, including applications
    ranging from biology [158], [159], environmental and social sciences [160], [161],
    cartography and mapping [162], among others. Unfortunately, this non-invasiveness
    of the birds-eye perspective implies some limitations in the semantic concepts
    one can distinguish. This difference is manifested in the distinction of land-cover
    mapping from land-use mapping or as well between building function (e.g., what
    people are supposed to do in this location) and activity estimation (e.g., what
    people are observed to do in reality). While the first one is what a satellite
    or airborne platform can sense, the second one is even more important to many
    applications. In this context, additional data and measurements can greatly help
    resolve these ambiguities. Such additional (covariate) data sources include base
    map data including information like building footprints, street networks, cadastral
    information, historical information or and data contributed by citizens, for example,
    through using social media. Social media information is envisioned to augment
    the birds-eye view with ground-level features like images or text originating
    from a certain location or more abstract anthropogenic signals correlated to population
    density, wealth, or other spatial distributions of interest. In general, there
    are three categories of how location-based social media can be analyzed and fused
    with ESS data: one is based on the metadata. In computer science, metadata comprises
    all data that describes the data at hand, usually including information on time,
    identity, place, size, and user profiles. The second category of exploiting social
    media is based on text mining, trying to understand and relate the message content
    to the Earth. Finally, the third category considers social media images and video
    sequences. Similarly to the text case, many images in social networks do not relate
    to the location they are sent from. Hopefully, the totality of images and videos
    in a certain area tells something about the area or one can detect which messages
    are related to a given location. All three aspects of social media require different
    data mining, ML and data fusion approaches as they all pose very different challenges
    to the overall system. 4.4.1. Spatial statistics of metadata The most traditional
    technique relies on spatial summary statistics of messages. One assumes that the
    patterns in which messages are generated are related to interesting factors which
    influence ESS parameters of interest. For example, social media users are typically
    quiet while sleeping and have a detectably higher activity during the day [163].
    That is, messages that originate from a certain location late in the evening as
    well as in the early morning with a break of a few hours might indicate some home
    or sleep location, definitely a spatial information. Fusing with overhead imagery,
    we might be able to distinguish between a hotel (large building, social media
    activity very low during late night) and a residential building (small building,
    much green around, social media activity low during late night). In addition,
    the type of user or intention of the message is reflected in metadata to some
    extent. Marketing and job announcements of corporations, for example, tend to
    use the full capacity of social media containing as many hashtags as possible
    to reach many users, and contain many words exploiting the full capacity of the
    message. It has been shown that simple features extracted from social media metadata
    alone can increase the convergence speed and final quality of a deep learning
    model predicting urban land use modeled after local climate zones paradigm by
    a significant margin [164]. Fig. 7(a) depicts spatial density of Twitter data
    measured as the radius of a k-nearest-neighbor environment of each point. As can
    seen, Twitter usage is tightly connected to many socio-demographic factors. This
    relation has been discussed in [165] as well. Download : Download high-res image

    Statistics on the example of Twitter public stream data. 4.4.2. Text mining Text
    mining comprises a set of techniques in which natural language text is transformed
    into a numeric representation that captures some semantics of the text. Many techniques
    have been introduced in the past that are based on character and word frequencies
    including TF-IDF ranking of documents in keyword search [166], or sparse text
    mining based on word-document matrices including topic modelling and Latent Dirichlet
    Allocation (LDA) [167]. However, the limitation of these methods has usually been
    to find a good vocabulary for a given task that does not contain meaningless words
    and pre-processing text in order that different forms of words are detected as
    the same word in these methods. When it comes to spatial data, however, language
    is gradually changing with location and might jump to a completely different tongue
    when crossing borders, complicating this process even more. In the deep learning
    area, text embeddings have become feasible which are a bit less dependent on these
    basic, but very hard language pre-processing techniques, and exploit very large
    datasets to cover the variations automatically [168], [169]. These map a vocabulary
    into a Euclidean space of chosen dimension in a way such that semantically similar
    words end up near each other. Doing this in a certain way leads to the surprising
    property that the addition in the vector space becomes semantically sensible with
    some limitations [170]. But generally, one aims to become able to perform semantic
    operations in the latent space as follows: King - Man + Woman ≈ Queen Paris -
    France + Germany ≈ Berlin Such numeric representations have then been used in
    deep learning using long short-term memories (LSTMs) [171] in order to allow for
    the deep learning system to analyze sentences taking care of important semantic
    words like negations. In the last months, advanced language models based on transformer
    architectures like BERT and GPT2 have shown impressive language understanding
    and generation capacities. Their careful application to social media in the context
    of ESS is a promising direction for future research. In relation to ESS, text
    embeddings have been successfully applied to distinguish residential and commercial
    buildings [172]. In addition, standard challenge problems of text mining such
    as sentiment analysis can as well bring interesting spatial information to life.
    Sentiment analysis has been well-researched in the natural language domain and
    in the computer science and ML domain in the context of learning from sparsely
    labeled streams [173]. The idea is to assign a rating ranging from negative to
    positive to a text capturing the emotion it represents. Fig. 7(b) depicts the
    distribution of positive sentiment tweets around New York, which seems to be somehow
    skewed towards commercial centers. 4.4.3. Image mining and multimedia analysis
    In a similar vein to text mining, the whole body of image analysis and computer
    vision research can be applied to social media images too. This can help collect
    information about the Earth surface from a ground-level view, assuming that there
    are enough images taken at the location from where they are sent. Similar to the
    text case, images attached to social media messages might not be related to the
    location where they are posted. Consequently, the multimedia information available
    from social media is extremely noisy and one must take this into account [174].
    Social media images have been used to extract statistics such as object counts
    essentially augmenting message metadata and opening the field for applications
    of spatial statistics. However, images can as well be directly used in order to
    classify, for example, land-use classes [175], [176]. In this case, however, causal
    relations usually break and the system will be “right for the wrong reason”, a
    typical side-effect of overfitting. In general, the social media stream will contain
    images that might not be representative for the actual context of the post, where
    this context information can be the physical surroundings as well as the activity
    (e.g., dining) or the socio-demographic context (e.g., rich vs. poor). An end-to-end
    ML system can learn to exploit all various types of context in the images and
    this abstract context is related to the location of origin at least in the sense
    that a user has been in a given context in this location. Consequently, it is
    not surprising that social media images – though they look like they do not relate
    significantly to the surroundings as they often do not depict the surroundings
    – reveal a lot of social, spatial, and economic information and can, therefore,
    help augment typical ESS questions [177]. 4.4.4. Summary Social media comprises
    a nice yet challenging data source for Earth observation. While it is obvious
    that social media correlates to human activities and is dense in urban regions,
    it is surprising that the content of the messages and their metadata can be used
    to distinguish traditional land cover and land use ambiguities in remote sensing
    imagery. However, methods of learning from such noisy data streams with such sparse
    labels are still in its infancy and need additional breakthroughs in unsupervised
    ML, natural language processing, and spatial data science in order to provide
    full potential. 5. Conclusions, discussion and outlook In this article we have
    reviewed the state-of-the-art on Machine Learning (ML) information fusion for
    Earth observation (EO). The article, with a clear practical application, has been
    structured on literature review, data-sources and models description and some
    selected case studies where ML fusion information has obtained excellent performance
    in real problems. We have shown that the amount and diversity of the available
    data sources for EO has made information fusion a key step for successful real
    applications, with high societal, economical and environmental implications. We
    anticipate a huge impact in the upcoming years given the ever-growing increase,
    improvement, and ubiquity in sensory systems used in the EO field. The temporal,
    spatial and spectral resolutions are increasing dramatically, higher resolution
    models are now available, and social networks data promise to complement the view
    of the processes occurring in all spheres of the Earth system. We have also shown
    that ML approaches have the ability to blend and extract knowledge from these
    data, obtaining excellent results in a large number of EO problems and applications.
    There is an important challenge that the EO community has to face: the scalability
    of algorithms in the big data era. Many interesting approaches exist nowadays
    (high performance computing platforms, more efficient and sparse algorithms, green
    AI methodologies, etc.), and we expect much more advances on this in the near
    future. Besides this more technical problem, we can identify two important stepping
    stones: how to extract information in highly unstructured data, and how to achieve
    understanding through information fusion. On the one hand, the platforms and sources
    of information may vary considerably in multiple dimensions. For example, the
    types of properties sensed and the spatial and spectral resolutions of the data,
    and sometimes the temporal resolution of the corresponding sensor. This also applies
    even to the sensors that are mounted on the same platform, or that are part of
    the same satellite configuration. The rapid increase in the number and availability
    of data with an enormous amount of heterogeneity, and non-stationary properties,
    creates serious challenges for their effective and efficient processing. For a
    particular problem at hand, there may exist multiple remote sensing and ancillary
    datasets which leads to a dilemma: how best to integrate multiple datasets, probably
    unstructured and non-stationary, for maximum utility? It is currently one of the
    main challenges in EO. On the other hand, and perhaps more important, we have
    the issue of problem understanding through information fusion. Blending the information
    provided by different sources and ancillary systems not only can be an efficient
    way of improving the performance of ML algorithms in specific problems, but also
    a way of improving the understanding of the systems, usually as part of larger
    structures, and providing this way a better physical interpretation of the results
    obtained. The challenge is here to combine adequately sources of information which
    can provide very different perspectives to the problem, or even different possible
    interpretations depending on the case, and which improve the performance of the
    ML algorithms at the same time. To tackle the previous challenges, we identify
    several exciting venues that open in the immediate future of ML information fusion
    in Earth sciences and EO in particular. A promising approach is about designing
    ML models that incorporate domain knowledge internally in a more sophisticated
    approach to data assimilation. Two methodological approaches have potential in
    facilitating the fusion of data-driven and arbitrary data sources and also physical
    models: probabilistic programming and differentiable programming. Probabilistic
    programming allows for accounting of various uncertainty aspects in a formal but
    flexible way, which allows in principle to account for data and model uncertainties,
    inclusion of priors and constraints coming from ancillary data and/or process-based
    (theory-driven) modeling. Differentiable programming, on the other hand, allows
    for efficient optimization of arbitrary losses owing to automated differentiation,
    which might help make the large, nonlinear and complex modeling more tractable.
    Attaining hybrid physics-aware ML will allow us advancing in improved modeling
    in terms of consistency and interpretability. Understanding, especially from heterogeneous
    data, is harder than predicting, and ML algorithms are currently only mere (yet
    powerful) interpolation techniques: they excel in fitting arbitrary functional
    data relations but do not have a clear notion of the underlying causal relations.
    Despite the great predictive capabilities of current methods, there is still little
    actual learning in the ML information fusion pipeline. In this context, causal
    inference methods aim at discovering and explaining the causal structure of the
    underlying system. When interventions in the system are not possible, observational
    causal inference comes into play. Observation-based causal discovery aims at extracting
    potential causal relationships from multivariate datasets, and goes beyond the
    commonly adopted correlation approach, which merely obtains associations between
    variables. Today the science of “causal inference” is sufficiently advanced to
    unravel relations between multiple coupled variables beyond correlations even
    in the presence of non-linearities and non-stationarities. Observational causal
    inference could make a decisive change in the way we process, analyze and understand
    multi-source and multi-sensory data. CRediT authorship contribution statement

    \ has been successfully applied to image recognition, speech recognition,\nand\
    \ natural language processing in recent years. Therefore, there has been an incentive\
    \ to apply\nit in other ﬁelds as well. The ﬁeld of agriculture is one of the most\
    \ important ﬁelds in which the\napplication of deep learning still needs to be\
    \ explored, as it has a direct impact on human well-being.\nIn particular, there\
    \ is a need to explore how deep learning models can be used as a tool for optimal\n\
    planting, land use, yield improvement, production/disease/pest control, and other\
    \ activities. The\nvast amount of data received from sensors in smart farms makes\
    \ it possible to use deep learning as a\nmodel for decision-making in this ﬁeld.\
    \ In agriculture, no two environments are exactly alike, which\nmakes testing,\
    \ validating, and successfully implementing such technologies much more complex\n\
    than in most other industries. This paper reviews some recent scientiﬁc developments\
    \ in the ﬁeld of\ndeep learning that have been applied to agriculture, and highlights\
    \ some challenges and potential\nsolutions using deep learning algorithms in agriculture.\
    \ The results in this paper indicate that by\nemploying new methods from deep\
    \ learning, higher performance in terms of accuracy and lower\ninference time\
    \ can be achieved, and the models can be made useful in real-world applications.\
    \ Finally,\nsome opportunities for future research in this area are suggested.\n\
    Keywords: agriculture; deep learning; smart farm; support decision-making algorithms\n\
    1. Introduction\nEuropean landscapes have been transformed primarily by human\
    \ activities, so that\npristine vegetation and real wilderness are currently extremely\
    \ rare in the European Union\n(EU). Agriculture plays a particularly important\
    \ role in the development of European\nlandscapes, as it now accounts for almost\
    \ half of the total area of the EU [1]. On the other\nhand, we are already exceeding\
    \ the Earth’s capacity with the current type of agricultural\nproduction. Climate\
    \ change, degradation of soils, pollution, rising costs of groundwater\nand pump\
    \ irrigation, the transition from a fuel-based to a bio-based economy, the scarcity\n\
    of freshwater as demand increases, and other environmental and economic issues\
    \ will\nmake access to fresh food an ever-greater challenge [2,3].\nMoreover,\
    \ it has already been shown that some of the aforementioned practices such\nas\
    \ climate changes and scarcity of freshwater lead to stagnation and sometimes\
    \ even a\ndecline in production. Thus, the question arises whether transforming\
    \ all agricultural\nsystems into high-intensity farming systems alone is not counterproductive\
    \ in an attempt\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 638. https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14030638\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 638\n2 of 43\n\
    to solve the world’s food problems. It is understandable, then, that the implementation\
    \ of\npractices adapted to the reality of a given production will have positive\
    \ effects in terms of\nbetter use of resources and even a different approach to\
    \ their use.\nOne way to address this challenge is to use new technologies, supplement\
    \ workers\nwith robots and machines, and better address biodiversity parameters\
    \ and functions\nas well as ecosystem state. Smart farms include farm management\
    \ systems that use\nnew technologies to increase food safety, quality, and quantity\
    \ and reduce environmental\nimpact. Increased control of production leads to better\
    \ cost management and reduced\nwaste [2,4]. These farms use sensors to monitor,\
    \ control, and treat animals and plants [2,4,5].\nWith the help of sensors in\
    \ the ﬁeld, we can collect data such as soil mapping, climate\nchanges, weather\
    \ data, among others [2,4,5]. The combined analysis of this data can provide\n\
    information to make the appropriate management decisions. Artiﬁcial Intelligence\
    \ (AI)\nreceives signiﬁcant attention in the development of decision-making algorithms.\
    \ AI is any\ntechnique that enables machines to learn from experience, adapt to\
    \ new inputs, and mimic\nhuman behavior [6,7].\nMachine Learning (ML) is a sub-area\
    \ of AI that uses computational algorithms to\nconvert raw data from the real\
    \ world into useful models and decision advice. By using\nML models, the system\
    \ can automatically learn from previous experiences and improve\nitself. ML techniques\
    \ include Support Vector Machines (SVM), decision trees, Bayesian\nlearning, K-means\
    \ clustering, association rule learning, regression, neural networks, and\nmany\
    \ others [6]. Liakos et al. [8] presented an overview of the application of the\
    \ ML model\nin various agricultural activities of agriculture.\nDeep learning\
    \ (DL) is a subﬁeld of ML. The algorithms of DL are more complex than\ntraditional\
    \ ML models. In a network, the layers between input and output are called hidden\n\
    layers. A shallow network has one hidden layer, while a deep network has more\
    \ than one.\nWith multiple hidden layers, deep neural networks can learn the features\
    \ of data and solve\nmore complex problems [6,7]. Since the models of DL are faster\
    \ and more efﬁcient compared\nto the shallow algorithms in ML, and unlike them,\
    \ they can automatically extract features\nfrom the input data, they have been\
    \ the most widely used models in recent years [6,7].\nIn 2012, AlexNet [9] won\
    \ the LSVRC competition for classiﬁcation. Sermanet et al. [10]\nshowed that DL\
    \ models could be used for classiﬁcation, recognition, and localization and\n\
    achieved excellent results. These achievements encourage researchers to apply\
    \ DL models\nto other areas of human life, including agriculture.\nLiu et al.\
    \ [11] reviewed advances in combining edge intelligence and remote sensing\nwith\
    \ Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) in precision agriculture. This paper presented\
    \ a list\nof recent works using UAVs in combination with DL models. Since the\
    \ focus of the paper\nwas on UAV devices, this work was listed based only on the\
    \ application and model used in\nthe paper and did not include reviews and analysis\
    \ of the work.\nRegarding the diversity of environments in agriculture, the result\
    \ of a trained model\non one environment may not be transferable to others [12].\
    \ This makes the application of\ndeep learning models in agriculture more challenging\
    \ and requires more attention. This\npaper aims to review newly published works\
    \ to ﬁnd new techniques, challenges, and\npossible solutions for using deep learning\
    \ in agriculture since 2018. The following are the\nmain objectives of this paper:\n\
    •\nTo provide an overview of recent work and identify challenges related to data\
    \ acquisi-\ntion and preparation for deep learning models;\n•\nTo review of the\
    \ new DL model algorithms used in agriculture;\n•\nHighlight the challenges in\
    \ training the model;\n•\nExamine the challenges associated with applying the\
    \ trained model in the real world;\n•\nReview the new edge devices used to implement\
    \ the trained models.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 638\n3 of 43\n2. Materials and Methods\n\
    The two most reputable databases for scientiﬁc papers, the Web of Science and\
    \ Sci-\nenceDirect, were searched for relevant journal articles and conference\
    \ proceedings. The\nterm “deep learning” was used in the keywords of the screening\
    \ titles with one of the\nfollowing keywords: “agriculture”, “plant diseases”,\
    \ “weed detection”, “yield estima-\ntion”, “fruit detection”, “species identiﬁcation”,\
    \ “crop classiﬁcation”, “soil management”,\n“automation and robotics” and “irrigation”.\n\
    The articles that did not deal with Deep Learning in agriculture were excluded.\
    \ In\nthe end, forty-six articles remained. Of these, ten articles were related\
    \ to plant diseases,\neleven articles were related to fruit detection, ﬁve articles\
    \ were related to weed detection,\nsix articles were related to species detection,\
    \ three articles were related to soil management,\nﬁve articles were related to\
    \ water management, and six articles were related to automation\nin agriculture.\n\
    The following criteria were considered in the analysis of the articles:\n•\nThe\
    \ way the dataset was collected for training the model and the challenges regarding\n\
    the dataset.\n•\nThe DL models/architectures used in the article and the performance\
    \ of the models.\n•\nThe metrics that were used to evaluate the model.\n•\nThe\
    \ inference time of the model (if speciﬁed), as it is a very important critical\
    \ for the\nuse of the model in the real-time application.\n•\nThe analysis of\
    \ the failure predicted by the model.\n•\nWhether the authors used a low-cost\
    \ device to deploy the trained model.\nThese articles base on the above criteria\
    \ are discussed in Section 3.8 and listed in the\nTables 1–9.\n3. An Overview\
    \ of Deep Learning\nDL models were inspired by human neural networks in the brain.\
    \ The word “deep”\nrefers to the number of hidden layers through which the data\
    \ is transformed. Through\ntraining, they send the input through a deep network\
    \ with different layers, where each layer\nhierarchically extracts speciﬁc features\
    \ at different scales or resolutions from the data and\ncombines them into a higher-level\
    \ feature, and uses these features to make predictions [6].\nDL models are divided\
    \ into supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and rein-\nforcement learning\
    \ [6]. Supervised learning is the task of learning a function from labeled\ntraining\
    \ data. In supervised learning, all data in the dataset is a pair consisting of\
    \ an input\nobject and the desired output value. A supervised learning model analyzes\
    \ the training\ndata and produces a function that can be used for prediction [6].\
    \ The most commonly\nused DL models included in this review are Convolutional\
    \ Neural Networks (CNN) and\nRecurrent Neural Networks (RNN). Unsupervised learning\
    \ was used in three papers.\n3.1. Convolutional Neural Network\nThe CNN model\
    \ is a supervised learning model speciﬁcally designed for classiﬁcation,\nrecognition,\
    \ and segmentation. A CNN model consists of a stack of convolutional layers,\n\
    nonlinear functions, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. A convolutional\
    \ layer\ncontains a set of kernels whose parameters must be learned and is used\
    \ to extract features\nfrom the data. Each kernel slides over the height and width\
    \ of the input, and the dot\nproduct between the kernel entries and each position\
    \ of the input is computed (Figure 1).\nThe output of a convolutional layer can\
    \ be calculated by Equation (1):\nyi = X ∗ Wi + bi,\ni = 1, · · · , m\n(1)\nwhere\
    \ X is the input of the layer, yi is the output corresponding to the i-th convolutional\n\
    kernel, Wi is a matrix of the trainable weights of the i-th kernel, bi is the\
    \ i-th bias, and m is\nthe number of kernels.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 638\n4 of\
    \ 43\nAfter each convolutional layer, a nonlinear activation function is used\
    \ to introduce\nnonlinear features into the model. Rectiﬁed Linear Units (ReLU)\
    \ have become state-of-the-\nart and are the most commonly used activation function\
    \ in Deep Learning models [6]. A\npooling layer is usually located between two\
    \ convolutional layers and is used to reduce the\nnumber of parameters to minimize\
    \ overﬁtting [6,7].\nFigure 1. The left side image is the example of the convolutional\
    \ operation, and the right side is the\nexample of a max-pooling operation with\
    \ pooling size (2,2).\nThe ﬁnal layers consist of fully connected layers that\
    \ take the features extracted by the\nprevious layer and generate class probabilities\
    \ or scores. These layers are fully connected to\nall neurons in the previous\
    \ layer. Figure 2 shows the architecture of the well-known CNN\nmodel called VGG19\
    \ and the visualization of the last layer of the VGG19 model in plant\ndisease\
    \ classiﬁcation, respectively.\nconv1\nconv2\nconv3\nconv4\nconv5\nfc6\nfc7\n\

    \ CNN model VGG19. The VGG19 network contains\nconvolutional layers, max-pool\
    \ layers, fully connected layers, and a soft-max classiﬁcation layer.\n3.1.1.\
    \ Classiﬁcation/Regression by CNN\nThe CNN model can be used for classiﬁcation\
    \ or regression problems.\nFor the\nclassiﬁcation task, the last layer of the\
    \ model is chosen as a fully connected layer with\nsoftmax activation function\
    \ and for the regression task as a fully connected layer, usu-\nally with linear\
    \ function. The most popular CNN architectures for classiﬁcation include\nAlexNet\
    \ [9], GoogleNet [13], VGG [14], and ResNet [15], as well as the new lightweight\n\
    models such as MobileNet [16], and EfﬁcientNet [17]. The lightweight models enable\n\
    to use mobile and low cost edge devices such as Jetson nano (https://developer.nvidia.\n\
    com/embedded/jetson-nano-developer-kit, accessed on 8 November 2021), Raspberrypi\n\
    (https://www.raspberrypi.com/, accessed on 15 November 2021) and Google TPU Coral\n\
    (https://coral.ai/, accessed on 8 November 2021) to deploy the trained model in\
    \ robots\nand use them in the ﬁeld [11,18] (Figure 3).\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14,\
    \ 638\n5 of 43\nFigure 3. From left to right: Jetson nano, Raspberrypi, and Google\
    \ TPU Coral.\n3.1.2. Detection by CNN\nThe CNN model can also be used for object\
    \ detection. There are two types of modern\nobject detection algorithms, the two-stage\
    \ detectors such as R-CNN [19], Fast R-CNN [20],\nand Faster R-CNN [21] as well\
    \ as single-stage detectors such as You Look Once (YOLO) [22],\nSingle Shot multi-box\
    \ Detector (SSD) [23], and LedNet [24]. In the two-stage detector,\nregions of\
    \ interest are generated in one stage using a Region Proposal Network (RPN). In\n\
    the other stage, the proposed regions are evaluated for object classiﬁcation and\
    \ bounding\nbox regression using convolutional layers. Such models achieve high\
    \ accuracy rates but\nare very slow [23]. Single-stage detectors, on the other\
    \ hand, contain a single feed-forward\nconvolutional network that directly provides\
    \ the bounding boxes and objects classiﬁcation.\nThe single-stage detectors are\
    \ faster in detection but less accurate than two-stage detectors,\nand it depends\
    \ on the application which model should be chosen. Figure 4 shows the\narchitecture\
    \ of Faster R-CNN and SDD, and Figure 5 shows the result of peach detection\n\
    using the Faster R-CNN model [25].\nVGG Conv\nlayers\nRPN\nclassifier\nA. Faster\

    \ Each bounding box contains\npeach and the score above the box shows the conﬁdence\
    \ score for each detected object [25].\n3.1.3. Segmentation by CNN\nThe segmentation\
    \ task can also be performed with CNN models. In segmentation, an\nimage is divided\
    \ into groups of pixels, and each group is assigned a class. Figure 6 shows\n\
    the segmentation of the grape in the image.\nFigure 6. The left side shows the\
    \ original image and the right side shows the task of segmentation for\nand the\
    \ right side shows the task of segmentation for grapes [26]. Reprinted with permission\
    \ from\nref. [26]. Copyright 2020 Elsevier.\nThe fully Convolutional Networks\
    \ (FCN) [27], Mask R-CNN [28], and Deeplab [29] are\nDL models for segmentation.\
    \ Lottes et al. [30] used an encoder-decoder Fully Convolutional\nNetwork (FCN)\
    \ model to identify crops and weeds during ﬁeld operations. Ghiani et al. [31]\n\
    used Mask R-CNN with ResNet101 which was trained with the dataset COCO, as a back-\n\
    bone for detecting grape branches in the tree.\n3.2. Recurrent Neural Network\n\
    RNN is specially designed for handling sequential data. In RNN, the output from\
    \ the\nprevious step is fed into the current step as input. The output of an RNN\
    \ unit is determined\nusing a tanh function by Equation (2):\nht = tanh(Wxxt +\
    \ Whht−1 + bt)\n(2)\nThe main problem with RNN is the vanishing gradient, i.e.,\
    \ the gradient of the loss\nfunction approaches zero [32]. Long Short-Term Memory\
    \ networks (LSTM) [33] is a special\ntype of RNN created to solve the vanishing\
    \ problem in RNN. A standard LSTM unit\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 638\n7 of 43\n\
    consists of an input gate (3), forget gate (4), an output gate (7), and a memory\
    \ cell (6).\nFigure 7 shows an LSTM unit and an RNN unit.\nit = σ(Wixxt + Wihht−1\
    \ + bi),\n(3)\nft = σ(Wf xxt + Wf hht−1 + bf ),\n(4)\nzt = tanh(Wzxxt + Wzhht−1\
    \ + bz),\n(5)\nct = ft ∗ ct−1 + it ∗ zt.\n(6)\not = σ(Woxxt + Wohht−1 + bo)\n\
    (7)\nThe weights (W) and biases (b) are trainable parameters that are adjusted\
    \ and opti-\nmized during the training of the model.\nFigure 7. (A) LSTM unit\
    \ diagram, (B) regular RNN unit. In an RNN unit, all input data is used for\n\
    output. However, in an LSTM unit, a set of gates is used to control the information\
    \ in memory and\ndecide how long and how much information may be stored.\n3.3.\
    \ Unsupervised Learning\nUnsupervised learning is a type of learning in which\
    \ hidden structures are found in\nunlabeled data with minimal human supervision\
    \ [6]. The primary method of unsupervised\nlearning is cluster analysis, such\
    \ as K-Means clustering. Cluster analysis groups or segments\ndatasets with common\
    \ attributes. In supervised learning, labeling a large amount of\nagricultural\
    \ data to train the model is expensive and time-consuming. Deep clustering\nmodels\
    \ can be used to avoid labeling and make the model more robust. Kang and Chen\
    \ [34]\nused automatic label generation by a clustering RCNN (C-RCNN) model to\
    \ identify the\napple on the trees. Tang et al. [35] used K-means clustering to\
    \ label the dataset and\nidentify weeds in the ﬁeld. Ferreira et al. [36] used\
    \ DeepCluster and Joint Unsupervised\nLearning from Deep Representations and Image\
    \ Clusters (JULE) to identify weeds in the\nﬁeld. However, many other new deep\
    \ clustering algorithms can be explored to avoid\nlabeling in agriculture [37].\n\
    3.4. Reinforcement Learning\nReinforcement Learning (RL) is concerned with how\
    \ an agent performs appropriate\nactions in an environment to maximize the rewards\
    \ in a given situation. RL agents must\ndetermine the best strategy to maximize\
    \ their expected cumulative rewards. An interactive\nenvironment receives the\
    \ current state and the action chosen by the agent and indicates\nthe next state\
    \ and reward (see Figure 8). This interaction between the DRL agent and the\n\
    training environment is repeated until the DRL agent converges to an optimal strategy\
    \ for\nchoosing an action.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 638\n8 of 43\nFigure 8. Interaction\
    \ of the agent with the environment [38]. The agent chooses an action at in\n\
    the current state st based on a policy. The environment receives the action and\
    \ the current state\nand outputs the next state and the reward. Reprinted with\
    \ permission from ref. [38]. Copyright\n2022 Elsevier.\nDeep reinforcement learning\
    \ (DRL) combines deep learning and reinforcement learn-\ning [39]. As Bu and Wang\
    \ [39] mentioned, DRL is a promising model for building smart\nfarms. Chen et\
    \ al. [40] used Deep Q-Network to build a decision-making system for rice\nirrigation\
    \ based on weather forecasts.\n3.5. Data Acquired and Data Preparation\nAI models\
    \ convert raw data into usable models, so a training dataset is required to\n\
    train a model. The more data available, the better results are obtained. A dataset\
    \ can be\ncollected using advanced technologies such as sensors mounted on ground-based\
    \ platforms,\nsatellites, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) [41–46].\nA sensor\
    \ node is a specialized device capable of sensing physical parameters and\nprocessing\
    \ the sensed parameters using a microcontroller. In addition to processing, it\
    \ can\nalso transmit the processed data wirelessly to neighboring nodes or router\
    \ nodes using\ntransceiver [47]. Sensors mounted on ground-based platforms are\
    \ divided into hand-held,\nfree-standing in the ﬁeld (Figure 9), and agricultural\
    \ machinery-mounted sensors that can\nmeasure soil, plant, and weather characteristics\
    \ [41,42,48]. The advantages of ground-based\nsensors are that they are less expensive\
    \ than other sensors, they are not sensitive to humid\nconditions, and they are\
    \ more suitable for small farms. The disadvantage of these types of\nsensors is\
    \ that they are very time-consuming and, even when attached to farm machinery,\n\
    the information is very inefﬁcient for larger ﬁelds. Furthermore, some of these\
    \ sensors are\ninﬂexible in terms of the type of spectral data that can be collected\
    \ [49].\nFigure 9. From left to right: sensors mounted on ground-based platforms\
    \ to test vineyard stress\n(https://www.goodfruit.com/using-sensors-to-test-vineyard-stress/,\
    \ accessed on 9 December 2021),\nSentinel2 satellites (https://www.esa.int, accessed\
    \ on 3 November 2021), and unmanned aerial\nvehicles (UAVs: https://precisionagricultu.re/12-potential-uses-for-uas-in-agriculture/,\
    \ accessed\non 9 December 2021).\nSatellite remote sensing provides synoptic,\
    \ objective, and homogeneous data that\ncan be captured geographically and temporally,\
    \ and therefore could be an efﬁcient tool to\nprovide high-quality information\
    \ about agriculture over large areas, even across national\nRemote Sens. 2022,\
    \ 14, 638\n9 of 43\nborders [50]. Depending on the spatial and spectral resolution,\
    \ repetition frequency, and\ncost, the multitude of satellites and sensors orbiting\
    \ the Earth can be used to provide data\nfor many types of applications [48].\
    \ The main disadvantage of satellite imagery is that it is\nexpensive at high\
    \ spatial resolution. Another disadvantage is their ﬁxed schedule, thus the\n\
    data cannot be acquired in a speciﬁc time step. For example, the time step for\
    \ Sentinel2 is\nﬁve days. Another disadvantage of satellite images is that they\
    \ highly depend on climate\nand cannot be post-processed on cloudy days [48].\
    \ For a list of satellites launched since\n1970, we refer to [48,51].\nAn aircraft\
    \ system with no pilot on board that, once programmed, allows no outside\nintervention\
    \ during ﬂight. Originally intended for military use, they are now used in\nagriculture\
    \ to monitor crops and collect images and data from anywhere in the ﬁeld [11,49].\n\
    Unlike satellites, unmanned aerial systems can collect data at a speciﬁc time\
    \ step, and the\nresults of the collected data have a higher resolution than that\
    \ of satellites. Most unmanned\naerial systems can ﬂy in precipitation, but cloud\
    \ cover can affect the data unless a second\nsensor is used to measure the amount\
    \ of sunlight reaching the aircraft. The unmanned\naerial systems can also be\
    \ expensive, but there are models that are inexpensive. The\ndisadvantages of\
    \ unmanned aerial systems are the requirement of a human operator [49],\nlimited\
    \ ﬂight duration, the limited weight of cargo carried, energy consumption [41],\
    \ and\ndependence on weather conditions [41,52]. In addition, the processing of\
    \ data collected by\nUAS is higher than that of satellite imagery [49].\nIn addition\
    \ to using sensors, the dataset can also be collected from free online datasets\n\
    such as ImageNet, Microsoft COCO, and PlantVillage [46] or images can be generated\n\
    synthetically as described in [53] or by using simulation software in agriculture\
    \ such as\nAguaCrop and DSSAT [54]. For DL models, a large dataset is required\
    \ for training to\nextract appropriate features [55]. Collating and labeling a\
    \ large amount of data is time-\nconsuming. One strategy to overcome these challenges\
    \ is to increase the size of the dataset\nusing augmentation techniques [55].\
    \ Augmentation techniques artiﬁcially create different\nversions of a real dataset\
    \ to increase its size. These include rotation, blurring, scaling, and\nﬂipping\
    \ of images in the dataset [55,56].\nAnother strategy is transfer learning and\
    \ ﬁne-tuning the model [57]. In transfer\nlearning, the model is trained with\
    \ a large dataset such as ImageNet or COCO and then\nthe same model is reused\
    \ and re-trained for a similar task. If the dataset does not contain\nenough data\
    \ to train a model from scratch, this strategy can be used. Ghazi et al. [58]\n\
    investigated how ﬁne-tuning pre-trained models affects plant classiﬁcation results.\
    \ For\nthis purpose, the AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and VGGNet models were trained, once\
    \ from\nscratch, and another time using ﬁne-tuning from Caffe Models. The results\
    \ showed that\nﬁne-tuning the models improved their performance. Barbedo [55],\
    \ however, investigated\nhow the size and diversity of the dataset affect the\
    \ performance of DL techniques applied\nto plant diseases. The results showed\
    \ that even with transfer learning and augmentation\ntechniques, CNN might require\
    \ a large number of images to extract useful features from\nthe data. Figure 10\
    \ shows the transfer learning task.\nThe next challenge is how well the trained\
    \ datasets represent the real world. Ramcha-\nran et al. [12] trained the SSD\
    \ object detection model to identify three diseases in cassava.\nAlthough the\
    \ model was trained on the dataset collected in the ﬁeld with a camera, the\n\
    F1-score decreased by 32% on the images from other sources. Therefore, the main\
    \ focus\nwhen collecting datasets should be how well the dataset represents the\
    \ ﬁeld study.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 638\n10 of 43\nA common Large\nDataset\n\

    to a similar model, the ﬁnal layers are replaced with modiﬁed new layers, and\
    \ then the model is\ntrained with a custom dataset.\n3.6. Training and Learning\n\
    In the training step of a DL model, the dataset is divided into the training set,\
    \ the\nvalidation set, and the test set. The training set is used to train the\
    \ model. The validation\ndataset is a sample of data retained by the training\
    \ model and used for model selection. The\nmodel structure is determined using\
    \ hyperparameters. Hyperparameters are parameters\nwhose values are set before\
    \ the learning process begins, such as the number of hidden\nlayers in the model,\
    \ the number of kernels in the CNN model, and the number of nodes in\neach LSTM\
    \ layer [32]. A test set is used to test a machine learning model after it has\
    \ been\ntrained on an initial training dataset. When the test set is used during\
    \ the training of the\nmodel, it does not provide information about how the network\
    \ will perform on unseen\ndata, and the evaluation of the result has no statistical\
    \ signiﬁcance [32]. Figure 11 shows\nthe general steps from preprocessing the\
    \ data to ﬁnalizing the model for prediction.\nThe error of a model is deﬁned\
    \ as the difference between the actual value the predicted\noutput, and it must\
    \ be minimized in the training step. The function that is used to compute\nthis\
    \ error is known as the loss function. It can be categorized into two types: Classiﬁcation\n\
    and Regression Loss. The loss function used for the classiﬁcation contains Hinge\
    \ loss,\nExpositional loss, cross-entropy, Log loss, and many more. For the regression\
    \ problems,\nthe loss function such as Mean Square Error (MSE), Mean Absolute\
    \ Error (MAE), Huber\nloss, and log cosh loss can be used. Each of these gives\
    \ a different error for the same\nprediction. The choice of a loss function depends\
    \ on the algorithm. Training DL models\nare based on backpropagation [59]. Backpropagation\
    \ uses the chain rule and computes the\nloss function’s gradient concerning the\
    \ network’s weights and biases for a single input–\noutput example, adjusted network\
    \ weights, and biases. The optimization algorithm must\nbe selected to minimize\
    \ the loss function. The choice of optimization algorithm and loss\nfunctions\
    \ are critical. The same as loss function, there are several ways to optimize\
    \ the error,\nsuch as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), SGD with momentum, Root\

    Once the model is trained, the most crucial question is how good the model is.\
    \ There\nare several metrics for evaluating DL models. The most commonly used\
    \ metrics in this\nreview for the regression problems are:\n•\nMSE: is the average\
    \ of the squared differences between prediction and actual observation.\n•\nRoot\
    \ Mean Square Error (RMSE): is the square root of MSE.\n•\nMAE: is the average\
    \ of the absolute differences between prediction and actual obser-\nvation.\n\
    •\nR2: is a statistical measure calculated from the variance explained by the\
    \ model versus\nthe total variance. The higher R2 indicates, the smaller the differences\
    \ between the\nobserved data and the ﬁtted values.\nThe metrics that can be used\
    \ in evaluating a classiﬁcation or segmentation problem\nare as follows:\n•\n\
    Accuracy (AC) is the ratio of correctly predicted observation of the total observations.\n\
    •\nRecall (R): also known as sensitivity, measures how many actual positives capture\
    \ by\nthe model correctly.\n•\nPrecision (P): also known as a positive predictive\
    \ value, measures how accurate the\nprediction is in classiﬁcation, i.e., the\
    \ correct prediction.\n•\nThe Average Precision (AP) is given by the area under\
    \ the precision–recall curve\nabove. Since Precision and Recall always lie between\
    \ 0 and 1, AP also lies between 0\nand 1. The Mean Average Precision (mAP) is\
    \ calculated by taking the mean AP over\nall classes.\n•\nF1-score: is the weighted\
    \ average of Precision and Recall.\n•\nIntersection Over Union (IOU): is an evaluation\
    \ metric used to measure an object\ndetector’s accuracy on a particular dataset.\n\
    •\nArea Under the ROC Curve (AUC): measures the area underneath the entire ROC\
    \ curve.\n3.8. Brief Review of Papers\n3.8.1. Disease Detection\nPlant diseases\
    \ cause losses in agricultural production and endanger food security. The\nmost\
    \ common practice in pest and disease control is to spray the crop area evenly\
    \ with\npesticides [8]. This method requires signiﬁcant amounts of pesticides,\
    \ which results in\nhigh ﬁnancial and human resources and signiﬁcantly changes\
    \ the environment. The use\nof a deep learning algorithm that detects the exact\
    \ time, location, and affected crops and\nsprays the pesticides only on the affected\
    \ plants can reduce resource consumption and\nenvironmental changes.\nKerkech\
    \ et al. [61] used the SegNet model to segment and detect grapevine diseases\n\
    using images with RGB and infrared ranges. The dataset was acquired using a UAV\n\
    device with two MAPIR Survey2 camera sensors, including a visible light (RGB)\
    \ sensor\nset for automatic illumination and an infrared sensor. The dataset was\
    \ labeled using a\nsemi-automatic method, i.e., a sliding window to identify potentially\
    \ diseased areas. Then,\neach block was classiﬁed by a LeNet5 network for pre-labeling.\
    \ In the end, the labeled\nimages were manually corrected. The SegNet recognizes\
    \ four classes including the shaded\nareas, soil, healthy and symptomatic vines.\
    \ Two models were trained, one for the RGB\nimages and the other for the infrared\
    \ images. The segmentation results of the two models\nwere also fused in two ways.\
    \ The ﬁrst case was called “Fusion AND”, which means that\nthe symptom is considered\
    \ detected if it is present in both the RGB and infrared images.\nThe second case\
    \ is called “fusion by the union” and has the symbol ”fusion OR”, which\nmeans\
    \ that the symptom is considered detected if it is present in either the RGB or\
    \ the\ninfrared image. The model trained with RGB images (AC = 85.13) outperformed\
    \ the model\ntrained with infrared images (78.72). The fusion AND had the best\
    \ performance, and the\nfusion OR had the worst accuracy. The runtime of SegNet\
    \ on a UAV image was reported to\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 638\n13 of 43\nbe 140\
    \ s for visible and infrared images. The fusion between the two segmented images\n\
    takes less than 2 s.\nKerkech et al. [62] used a CNN model to detect Esca disease\
    \ in grapevine using UAV\nRGB images. A CNN model was trained with different combinations\
    \ of patch sizes 16 × 16,\n32 × 32 and 64 × 64 with different color spaces including\
    \ RGB, HSV, LAB, and YUV, and\nvegetation indices such as ExG, ExR, ExGR, GRVI,\
    \ NDI, and RGI. All the different color\nspaces and vegetation indices used in\
    \ this study can be calculated from the RGB images.\nThe results show that the\
    \ CNN model trained with the RGB and YUV color spaces has a\nbetter performance\
    \ compared to the models trained with HSV and LAB. It was pointed\nout that the\
    \ lower accuracy of the models trained with HSV could be due to the Hue (H)\n\
    channel in HSV, which combines all color information into a single channel and\
    \ is less\nrelevant for the network to learn the best color features. The LAB\
    \ color space has one\nluminance channel (L) and two chrominance channels, which\
    \ do not reproduce the colors\nof the diseased vineyard well.\nIn the next experiment,\
    \ vegetation indices were added to the RGB and YUV data.\nCombining vegetation\
    \ indices with RGB and YUV improved classiﬁcation results in most\ncases. The\
    \ ﬁnal investigation concerned the models trained by combining the vegetation\n\
    indices alone. The combination of ExR, ExG, and ExGR vegetation indices with a\
    \ size of\n16 × 16 gave the best performance among the other inputs (including\
    \ color space) and sizes\nwith an accuracy of 95.80%. Furthermore, the combination\
    \ of YUV and ExGR vegetation\nindices with sizes of 32 × 32 and 64 × 64 achieved\
    \ similar performance but the run-time\nwas longer.\nFrom the results, the color\
    \ of the images and leaves is very important in the detection\nof grapevine diseases.\
    \ Furthermore, the number of channels in the input does not affect the\nrun-time\
    \ of the model, but the size of the input and the model structure do.\nBarbedo\
    \ [55] investigated how dataset size and diversity affect the performance of\n\
    DL techniques applied to plant diseases. An image dataset of leaves with a small\
    \ number\nof samples for the CNN model was used to investigate the behavior of\
    \ GoogLeNet under\ndifferent conditions. Data augmentation and transfer learning\
    \ methods were used to\ntrain the CNN. The results showed that even with transfer\
    \ learning and augmentation\ntechniques, CNN requires a large number of images\
    \ to extract useful features from the data.\nEven though a large number of images\
    \ can be easily acquired with the new technology,\nlabeling the dataset is time-consuming.\
    \ One option proposed in this paper was to share\nthe dataset, but as mentioned\
    \ earlier, the two environments are not the same in agriculture.\nThe effect of\
    \ removing the background of the images on the accuracy of the model was\nalso\
    \ investigated. The model has trained again with the images without background.\
    \ The\nmodel has trained again with the images without background. The results\
    \ show different\nbehaviors with respect to the accuracy of the model, including\
    \ no signiﬁcant effect, a\nsigniﬁcant improvement in accuracy in some cases, a\
    \ signiﬁcant decrease in accuracy, and\nmixed results (improved accuracy in some\
    \ diseases while the error rate increased in others).\nFrom the signiﬁcant decrease\
    \ in accuracy for some plants, it was inferred that the CNN\nmodel sometimes uses\
    \ the background of the model to classify the images. An attempt that\ncan be\
    \ made here is to train the model with both datasets (with and without background)\n\
    and investigate the accuracy of the model in this case.\nFerentinos (2018) [63]\
    \ used AlexNet, AlexNetOWTBn [64], GoogLeNet, Overfeat [10],\nand VGG models to\
    \ identify 25 plant disease in 58 different classes of (plant, disease) com-\n\
    binations, including some healthy plants. The dataset used was images of healthy\
    \ and in-\nfected leaves of the plants from the Plantvillag database (https://github.com/spMohanty/\n\
    PlantVillage-Dataset, accessed on 17 November 2021). More than 37.3% of the images\
    \ in\nthe dataset were taken under real cultivation conditions in the ﬁeld, and\
    \ the other images\nwere taken under laboratory conditions. In the ﬁrst experiment,\
    \ the number of images\nacquired under laboratory conditions and real conditions\
    \ was kept similar in the training\nand test set, and the models were trained\
    \ using this dataset. The VGG model performed\nbest on the test set with an accuracy\
    \ of 99.53%.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 638\n14 of 43\nThey also investigated the\
    \ signiﬁcance of the presence of ﬁeld-captured images in\nthe training set. From\
    \ the 58 available classes of the form (plant, disease), the 12 that\ncontained\
    \ images of both types were selected. Two experiments were conducted with\nthese\
    \ 12 classes, and two CNN models were developed: one was trained with images\n\
    under laboratory conditions and tested with images under ﬁeld conditions, and\
    \ another\nwas trained with images under ﬁeld conditions and tested with images\
    \ under laboratory\nconditions. Although the number of images acquired under ﬁeld\
    \ conditions was less than\nthe number of images acquired under laboratory conditions,\
    \ the CNN model trained only\nwith images under ﬁeld conditions performed better\
    \ with an accuracy of 68% than the\nCNN model trained only with images under laboratory\
    \ conditions with an accuracy of\n33%. This result shows the importance of the\
    \ presence of the images acquired under ﬁeld\nconditions. From the misclassiﬁcation\
    \ image, they point out some problematic situations,\nincluding images with extensive\
    \ partial shading on the leaves, images with multiple objects\nin addition to\
    \ the image, images where the leaf occupies a very small and non-centric part\n\
    of the frame, and images without leaves.\nJiang et al. [65] implemented the CNN\
    \ models to detect ﬁve common apple leaf\ndiseases using images from the ﬁeld.\
    \ By applying data augmentation, such as rotational\ntransformations, horizontal\
    \ and vertical ﬂips, intensity disturbances, and Gaussian noise,\n26,377 disease\
    \ images were generated. The problem with SDD is that it cannot detect\na small\
    \ object, and also, an object can be detected multiple times. To overcome these\n\
    drawbacks, they developed an SSD model with a VGG-INCEP as the backbone, where\n\
    two GoogLeNet inception layers replace two convolutional layers of the VGG model.\n\
    Moreover, the structure of feature extraction and fusion is designed by applying\
    \ the\nRainbow concatenation method instead of the pyramid (which is used in the\
    \ SSD model) to\nimprove the performance of feature fusion. The results showed\
    \ that the data augmentation\nimproved the accuracy of the model by 6.91% compared\
    \ to the original dataset. Moreover,\nthe proposed model achieved the best performance\
    \ compared to faster R -CNN and SSD\nwith VGG and Rainbow SSD (RSSD) model.\n\
    To investigate the effect of using a deep model as a backbone, ResNet-101 was\
    \ used\nas a feature extractor for SSD. The results show that ResNet-101 does\
    \ not lead to any\nimprovement. In terms of speed, Faster RNN was the slower model\
    \ with more accuracy.\nThe proposed model with 78.80% mAP and 23.13 Frames Per\
    \ Second (FPS) was more\naccurate than SDD and RSSD, but SSD outperformed the\
    \ other models in terms of time\ninference. By examining the misclassiﬁed images,\
    \ it was indicated that similarity between\ndiseases, misclassiﬁed background,\
    \ and light condition were the challenges in classiﬁcation.\nKarthik et al. [66]\
    \ proposed a Residual Attention Network for disease detection in\ntomato leaves.\
    \ The main idea of attention is to focus on the relevant parts of the input to\n\
    produce outputs. The dataset was collected from the open-source website Plantvillage\
    \ and\ncontained one healthy class and three diseases. They implemented three\
    \ models. One was\na traditional CNN model, the second used the three residual\
    \ layers introduced into the\nCNN model as part of the ResNet architecture, and\
    \ the last used an attention mechanism\non top of the residual CNN for effective\
    \ feature learning. The traditional CNN-based\nmethods focus on ordered feature\
    \ learning, starting from basic image-level features such\nas edges, color, etc.,\
    \ to complex texture-based differences [66]. In the deeper layer, some\nimportant\
    \ features extracted in the ﬁrst layer may be lost. The residual layers are designed\n\
    to avoid this problem [66]. They concatenate the extracted features from the earlier\
    \ layers\nwith the deeper layers. In addition, the attention mechanism is used\
    \ to extract the relevant\nparts of the feature maps. The Residual Attention Network\
    \ CNN performed better with an\noverall accuracy of 98% than the Vanilla Residual\
    \ Network with an accuracy of 95% and\nthe traditional CNN model with an accuracy\
    \ of 84%.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 638\n15 of 43\nLiu et al. [67] implemented the\
    \ model Cascade Inception to detect four common apple\nleaf diseases in images\
    \ captured in the ﬁeld. The Cascade Inception was a modiﬁed AlexNet\nmodel with\
    \ inception layers from GoogleNet. Various data enhancement methods such as\n\
    image rotation, mirror symmetry, brightness adjustment, and PCA jittering were\
    \ applied to\nthe training images. Moreover, the fully connected layers were replaced\
    \ by convolutional\nlayers, which results in fewer parameters and avoids overﬁtting.\
    \ The proposed model was\ntrained using the optimization method Nesterov Accelerated\
    \ Gradient (NAG) and achieved\nan accuracy of 97.62%. The performance of the proposed\
    \ model was compared with\nSVM and BP neural networks, standard AlexNet, GoogLeNet,\
    \ ResNet-20, and VGGNet-\n16. Transfer learning method was used to train VGGNet-16\
    \ and achieved 96% accuracy.\nStandard AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and ResNet-20 were\
    \ trained from scratch using SGD-\noptimization and achieved a maximum accuracy\
    \ of 95.69%. The SVM and BP, which\nachieved an accuracy of less than 60%, show\
    \ that the traditional approaches rely heavily\non the expert developed classiﬁcation\
    \ features to improve the recognition accuracy. They\nalso investigated the effect\
    \ of data augmentation methods and optimization algorithms\non accuracy. The model\
    \ with the SGD optimizer achieved 93.32% accuracy, while the\nmodel with NAG achieved\
    \ 97.62% accuracy. The data augmentation methods improved the\nperformance of\
    \ the model by 10.83%. The advantage of the model is that it outperformed\nother\
    \ CNN models in terms of training time and memory required. Furthermore, the\n\
    number of parameters of the model was less than AlexNet and GoogleNet. One point\n\
    that emerges from the paper is that GoogleNet and AlexNet were trained using the\
    \ SGD\noptimizer, and the proposed model was trained using the NAG method, but\
    \ as mentioned\nin the paper, SGD has the “local optimum” problem. In addition,\
    \ the models were not\ncompared based on the inference time.\nRamcharan et al.\
    \ [12] trained the SSD object detection model to identify three diseases,\ntwo\
    \ types of pest damage, and nutrient deﬁciency in cassava at the mild and pronounced\n\
    stages. A dataset was collected from the ﬁeld, which was divided into 80–20 as\
    \ training\nand testing sets. The model achieved 94 ± 5.7% mAP on the test dataset.\
    \ The trained model\nwas used on a mobile phone to investigate the performance\
    \ of the model in the real world.\nOne hundred twenty images of leaves were captured\
    \ using a mobile device of the study\nexperiment, and the model inference was\
    \ run on a desktop and mobile phone to calculate\nthe performance metrics of the\
    \ trained model. The results show that the average precision\nof the model on\
    \ the real dataset decreases by almost 5%, but the average recall decreases\n\
    by almost half, and the F1-score decreases by 32%. Furthermore, the results show\
    \ that the\nmodel performs better on the leaves with pronounced symptoms than\
    \ on the leaves where\nthe symptoms are only mildly pronounced.\nRemote Sens.\

    \ to detect seventeen diseases of ﬁve crops (wheat,\nbarley, corn, rice, and rapeseed)\
    \ in images captured in the ﬁeld. The dataset contained\nseveral challenges, such\
    \ as multiple diseases on the same plant, similar visual symptoms\namong diseases,\
    \ images of early and early-stage diseases, and diseases of leaves, and stems.\n\
    To improve the accuracy of the model, the crop ID was used in the network. The\
    \ crop ID\nwas deﬁned as a categorical vector with K components, where K is the\
    \ number of crops in\nthe model. Several models were trained. The ﬁrst approach\
    \ was to train an independent\nmodel for each crop and the second approach was\
    \ to train a single model for the entire\ndataset. The results show that the multi-crop\
    \ model had a similar performance to splitting\nthe training dataset into the\
    \ different crops (1% increased accuracy). However, the class of\ndiseases with\
    \ fewer images in the training set may beneﬁt from the multi-crop model. The\n\
    second approach was to add the crop ID to the multi-crop model. The results show\
    \ that by\nadding crop id, the model can still beneﬁt from more images for training,\
    \ while crop ID\ninformation helps the network to discriminate between similar\
    \ diseases.\nChen et al. [69] used pre-trained MobileNet V2 networks to identify\
    \ twelve rice\nplant diseases. The dataset was collected from online sources and\
    \ real agricultural ﬁelds.\nAn attention mechanism was added to the model, and\
    \ transfer learning was performed\ntwice during model training to achieve better\
    \ performance. The MobileNet-V2 achieved\n94.12% accuracy on the PlantVillage\

    \ two other networks named MobileNetv2-2stage and\nMobileAtten-alpha were trained.\
    \ In the MobileNetv2-2stage model, transfer learning was\nperformed twice to identify\
    \ the images of plant diseases.\nSimilarly, in MobileAtten-alpha, the attention\
    \ method was used instead of transfer\nlearning twice. The proposed model (using\
    \ attention and transfer learning twice) achieved\nthe the second best accuracy\
    \ of 98.84%. The DenseNet121 with an accuracy of 98.93%\noutperformed other models.\

    images and the inversion of the left cordon images to look similar to right cordon\
    \ images.\nThe third model, an autoencoder network, is trained to a high level\
    \ of accuracy and the\nCNN encoder weights are transferred as starting weights\
    \ into the CNN model for the yield\nestimation model. In the fourth model, an\
    \ autoencoder model was trained to output the\ndensity map of the grapes in the\
    \ image. Then, the weights of the encoder are transferred as\ninitial parameters\
    \ into the CNN model for yield estimation. The last model was trained\nwith the\
    \ output of the autoencoder for the density map as input to the CNN model for\
    \ yield\nestimation instead of the RGB images. The CNN models with ﬂipped images\
    \ outperformed\nthe simple CNN model with an MAE % of 15.43. The models of transfer\
    \ learning from\nDensity Map Network Representation with MAE % of 11.79 achieved\
    \ the best performance\namong the other models. The last model with MAE % of 15.99\
    \ did not perform as well as\nthe fourth model because the accuracy of the density\
    \ map estimates was quite low. The\nresults show that transfer learning, when\
    \ used properly, can improve recognition accuracy.\nAguiar et al. [72] trained\
    \ SSD MobilenetV1 and the Inception model to detect Grape\nBunch in Mid Stage\
    \ and early stages and then transferred the trained model to the TPU-\nEdge device\
    \ to investigate the temporal accuracy of the model. The same strategy in [18]\n\
    was used to collect the dataset and it is publicly available (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.\n\
    5114142, accessed on 3 November 2021) with 1929 vineyard images and their annotation.\n\
    Overall, SSD MobileNet-V1 performed better than the Inception model, as it had\
    \ a higher\nF_1 score, AP, and mAP. The early stage was more difﬁcult to detect\
    \ than the middle growth\nstage. The ﬁrst class represented smaller clusters that\
    \ were more similar in color and\ntexture to the surrounding foliage, making them\
    \ more difﬁcult to detect. SSD MobileNet-V1\nshowed an AP of 40.38% in detecting\
    \ clusters at an early growth stage and 49.48% at a\nmedium growth stage. In terms\
    \ of time, SSD MobileNet-V1 was more than four times faster\nthan the Inception\
    \ model on TPU-Edge Device.\nGhiani et al. [31] used Mask R-CNN with ResNet101\
    \ as a backbone which was pre-\ntrained with the dataset COCO (https://cocodataset.org/#home,\
    \ accessed on 18 November\n2021) for detecting grape branches on the tree. An\
    \ open-source dataset GrapeCS-ML [73]\ncontaining more than 2000 images without\
    \ annotation of ﬁfteen grape varieties at different\nstages of development in\
    \ three Australian vineyards was used to train the model. In\naddition to the\
    \ GrapeCS-ML dataset, 400 images were collected from the island of Sardinia\n\
    (Italy). The result obtained by applying the detector to the test samples was\
    \ an mAP value\nof 92.78%. To investigate the generalizability of the proposed\
    \ model, the model trained on\nthe GrapeCS-ML dataset was tested on its internal\
    \ dataset. The dataset contained different\ngrape varieties, vegetation, and colors\
    \ than the GrapeCS-ML dataset. An mAP of 89.90%\nwas obtained with the internal\
    \ dataset, indicating that the model can be used in other ﬁelds.\nTo investigate\
    \ the signiﬁcance of the size of the dataset used for training and the importance\n\
    of the augmentation techniques, the size of the original dataset was reduced to\
    \ 10% of the\ntraining images in one case with augmentation and the other case\
    \ without augmentation of\nthe dataset. The mAP was reduced by up to 5%, especially\
    \ in the experiments performed\nwithout augmentation. It was observed that the\
    \ recognition accuracy decreased for images\nwith overlap between clusters.\n\
    In Milella et al. [74], a system for the automatic estimation of harvest volume\
    \ and for\ndetecting grapes in vineyards using an RGB-D sensor on board an agricultural\
    \ vehicle has\nbeen proposed. An RGB-D sensor is a special type of depth detection\
    \ device that works in\nconjunction with an RGB camera and is able to add depth\
    \ information to the conventional\nimage pixel by pixel. The approach to determine\
    \ the crop volume involved three steps: the\n3D reconstruction of the vine rows,\
    \ the segmentation of the vines using a deep learning\nmethod, and the estimation\
    \ of the volume of each plant. In the ﬁrst step, the depth output\nRemote Sens.\
    \ 2022, 14, 638\n20 of 43\nfrom the camera was not used because the parameters\
    \ of the algorithm are ﬁxed and cannot\nbe conﬁgured. Instead, the semi Global\
    \ Matching (SGM) algorithm was used, which is a\ncomputer vision algorithm for\
    \ estimating a dense disparity map from a rectiﬁed stereo\nimage pair. A box-grid\
    \ ﬁlter is then used to merge the point clouds.\nIn segmentation, a segmentation\
    \ algorithm was ﬁrst used to separate the canopy from\nthe background using the\
    \ green–red vegetation index (GRVI), and then k-means were\nused to identify each\
    \ plant. Based on the results of the clustering algorithm, different\nplants were\
    \ calculated and an estimate of the volume per plant was performed. Finally, the\n\
    pre-trained AlexNet, VGG16 and VGG19, and GoogLeNet were trained to perform grape\n\
    cluster detection in 5 different classes (grapes, vineyard stakes, vine stems,\
    \ cordons, canes,\nleaves, and background). The VGG model performed the best with\
    \ an accuracy of 91.52.\nSantos et al. [26] used deep learning models and computer\
    \ vision models to estimate\ngrape wine yield from RGB images. Images were captured\
    \ with a Canon EOS REBEL T3i DSLR\ncamera and a Motorola Z2 Play smartphone from\
    \ five different grape varieties. The dataset\nnamed Embrapa Wine Grape Instance\
    \ Segmentation Dataset (WGISD) with 300 RGB images\nis publicly available (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo3361736,\
    \ accessed on 18 November\n2021). Models from DL such as Mask R-CNN, YOLOv2, and\
    \ YOLOv3 were trained to detect\nand segment grapes in the images. Then, an image\
    \ processing algorithm called Structure-\nfrom-Motion (SfM) was used to perform\
    \ spatial registration, integrating the data generated by\nthe CNN-based step.\
    \ In the final step, the results of the CV model were used to remove the\nclusters\
    \ detected in different images to avoid counting the same clusters in several\
    \ images. The\nMask R-CNN with ResNet101 as the backbone outperformed YOLOv2 and\
    \ YOLOv3 in terms\nof object detection, but the YOLO model outperformed the Mask\
    \ R-CNN in terms of detection\ntime. The worst performance was obtained with YOLOv3.\
    \ To verify the performance of Mask\nR-CNN+SfM, 500 key-frames of a video were\
    \ used, and the result is shown in a video at\nhttps://youtu.be/1Hji3GS4mm4, accessed\
    \ on 17 November 2021.\nPalacios et al. [75] applied the method of deep learning\
    \ to detect the flowering of\nthe vine and used it for the estimation of early\
    \ yield estimation. Images of six grapevine\nvarieties were acquired using a mobile\
    \ platform developed at the University of La Rioja.\nThe RGB camera was a Canon\
    \ EOS 5D Mark IV RGB with a full-frame CMOS sensor. The\nground truth was acquired\
    \ using the algorithm in [76]. This algorithm was developed to\nprocess only images\
    \ with a single inflorescence and a dark background. In the first step,\nSegNet\
    \ was used with VGG (VGG16 and VGG19) as a backbone to segment and extract\nthe\
    \ inflorescences contained in the images. Then, these regions were used to count\
    \ the\nflowers in each inflorescence using three algorithms, including SegNet,\
    \ Watershed Flower\nSegmentation, and a linear model. The SegNet with VGG19 as\
    \ backbone outperformed the\nmodel with VGG16 in terms of IOU and F1-score. For\
    \ flower recognition, the SegNet model\nwith VGG19 was trained to classify a group\
    \ of flowers per image into three classes including\ncontour, center, and background.\
    \ After segmentation, false-positive filtering of flower\nsegmentation was performed.\
    \ Here, the flowers whose center and contour was segmented,\nand whose contour\
    \ surrounded the center above a certain threshold were considered as\ntrue positives.\
    \ The F1-score reached its highest value when contour filtering was set to 50%,\n\
    resulting in an F1-score of 0.729. The best F1-score for the watershed approach\
    \ was 0.708\nand the worst performance in counting flowers was obtained with linear\
    \ regression in the\nform of the Root Mean Square metric. The number of flowers\
    \ counted using SegNet-VGG19\nfor inflorescence extraction and flower detection,\
    \ and flower counting using the algorithm\nof [76] showed a correlation with R2\
    \ close to or above 0.75 for all cultivars.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 638\n21 of\

    22 of 43\nKang and Chen [34] implemented DaSNet-v2, which is an ’Encoder–Decoder\
    \ with\natrous convolution developed in Deeplab-v3+ to detect and segment the\
    \ apple in an\norchard for harvesting by a robot. Atrous convolution is a type\
    \ of convolutional layer that\nallows control of the resolution of the features\
    \ computed by the CNN. The dataset was\ncollected from an apple orchard as RGB-D\
    \ and RGB. The RGB-D was used to visualize the\nenvironment. A lightweight model,\
    \ Resnet 18, was used as the backbone of the DaNet-v2\nto ensure its deployment\
    \ on the Jetson-TX2 with limited computing capacity. In addition,\nthe model was\
    \ trained with the Resnet50 and Resnet101 backbones. The performance of\nthe model\
    \ with the Resnet101 backbone was compared with DaSNet-v1, YOLO-v3, faster-\n\
    RCNN, and the Mask-RCNN. DaSNet-v2 and Mask-RCNN with F1-score of 0.873 and\n\
    0.868, respectively, outperformed the other models. However, DaSNet-v2 outperformed\n\
    mask-RCNN with a computational efﬁciency between 306 and 436 ms with a time of\n\
    1.3 s. The results also show that single-stage detection models such as Yolo have\
    \ better\ncomputational efﬁciency compared to two-stage detectors. The model was\
    \ implemented\non Jetson-TX2, a lightweight backbone of Resnet-18, and the experimental\
    \ results show\nthat DaSNet-v2 with Resnet-18 can achieve similar performance\
    \ in recall and precision of\ndetection compared to YOLO-v3. Environmental factors\
    \ such as strong sunlight reﬂection,\nshadows, and appearance variations of fruits\
    \ in color, shape, occlusion, or viewing angle\ncould lead to false-negative detection\
    \ results. RGB-D images were processed using DaSNet-\nv2 and the PPTK toolbox,\
    \ a Python package for image visualization, to deploy the robot in\nthe orchard.\n\
    Koirala et al. [77] developed a DL model, called Mango-YOLO, based on YOLO-v3\n\
    and YOLO-v2 (tiny) for counting mangoes on trees. YOLOv2 (tiny) has a small architecture\n\
    with only nine convolutional layers, six pooling layers, and one detection layer,\
    \ sacriﬁcing\naccuracy for speed. YOLOv3 [22] is based on Darknet-53 and improves\
    \ upon YOLOv2 [78].\nThe Mango YOLO had 33 layers compared to 106 layers in YOLO-v3\
    \ and 16 layers in YOLO-\nv2 (tiny). The reduction in the number of layers is\
    \ expected to reduce computation time\nand detect mangoes more accurately. The\
    \ model was trained on the dataset collected from\nﬁve orchards. The Mango-YOLO\
    \ achieved better performance with an accuracy of 0.967%\ncompared to YOLO-v2\
    \ (tiny) (0.9% ) and YOLO-v3 (0.951%). In terms of time inference,\nthe Mango\
    \ YOLO with 15 ms was faster than YOLO-v3 (25 ms) and slower than YOLO-v2\n(tiny)\
    \ (10 ms). Moreover, Mango-YOLO was trained once from scratch on the augmented\n\
    dataset, and the second time transfer learning was used using the COCO dataset.\
    \ The\nmodels had the same performance on the test set, and the reason was explained\
    \ by the fact\nthat the COCO dataset does not contain Mango images. The false\
    \ detection over images\ntaken with Canon camera shows resizing of the images\
    \ and results in image distortion\nwith leaves taking a curved shape resembling\
    \ the fruit and overexposed areas on branches,\ntrunks, and leaves.\nLiang et\
    \ al. [79] applied the SSD network to detect mango and almond on tree fruits.\n\
    The dataset in [80] was used to train the model. The SSD model used the original\
    \ and\nsampled a patch such that the minimum Jaccard overlap with the objects\
    \ is 0.1, 0.3, 0.5,\n0.7, or 0.9, and ﬁnally randomly sampled the input image.\
    \ The size of each sampled area\nand the minimum Jaccard overlap are critical\
    \ for object detection. These two parameters\nwere changed to adopt the SSD model\
    \ for small mango detection. Using VGG16 as the\nbasic framework for the SDD outperformed\
    \ the SSD with ZFNet. Furthermore, using the\ninput image size of 400 × 400 and\
    \ 500 × 500 as the input of the model, the model achieved\nbetter performance\
    \ than SSD with an input size of 300 × 300. The model outperformed the\nfaster\
    \ RCNN in terms of speed and accuracy. The challenges related to mango detection\n\
    on the tree were considered in the paper: the size of mango on the whole image,\
    \ blocking\nthe mango with leaves, branches, resizing the original image, making\
    \ mango smaller, and\nsimilarity between mango and background.\nTian et al. [81]\
    \ developed YOLO-V3 with DenseNet as the backbone to detect apples\non trees.\
    \ They used two datasets for training. The ﬁrst one contained images of apples\
    \ at\none growth stage, and the second one contained images taken at different\
    \ growth stages.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 638\n23 of 43\nThe model showed better\
    \ performance for mature apples than for young and growing\napples because the\
    \ color features were more prominent, the individual volume was larger,\nand there\
    \ was less overlap. The results also showed that the F1-score of the model trained\n\
    with the ﬁrst dataset was higher than that of the model trained with the second\
    \ dataset.\nThe performance of the trained model decreased for images with partial\
    \ occlusion of apples\nwith branches and leaves but is still an acceptable result\
    \ (IOU = 0.889 for mature apples ).\nThe model achieved the best performance compared\
    \ to Faster R-CNN, YOLOV2, and\nthe original YOLOv3. In terms of time inference,\
    \ the model was faster than Faster R-CNN\nand similar to YOLOv3. The F1-score\
    \ and IOU of the model without data augmentation\nmethods decreased by 0.033 and\
    \ 0.058, respectively.\nZhou et al. [82] implemented an SSD model with two lightweight\
    \ backbones Mo-\nbileNetV2 and InceptionV3, to develop an Android APP called KiwiDetector\
    \ that detects\nkiwis in the ﬁeld. Quantization is a technique for performing\
    \ computations and storing\ntensors with bit widths smaller than ﬂoating-point\
    \ numbers. When training a neural net-\nwork, 32-bit ﬂoating-point weights and\
    \ activation values are typically used. A quantized\nmodel performs some or all\
    \ operations with tensors using integers instead of ﬂoating-\npoint values. This\
    \ allows the computational complexity to be reduced and the trained\nmodel can\
    \ be used on devices with lower resource requirements. The quantization method\n\
    was used to compress the model size and improve the detection speed by quantizing\n\
    the weight tensor and activation function data of convolutional neural networks\
    \ from 32\nto bit ﬂoating-point numbers to an 8-bit integer. The results showed\
    \ that MobileNetV2,\nquantized MobileNetV2, InceptionV3, and quantized InceptionV3\
    \ achieve a true detec-\ntion rate of 90.8%, 89.7%, 87.6%, and 72.8%, respectively.\
    \ The quantized MobileNetV2 on\nthe Huawei P20 smartphone outperformed the other\
    \ models in terms of detection speed\n(103 ms/frame) and size. Although the SSD\
    \ with MobileNetV2 was more accurate than the\nSSD with quantized MobileNetV2,\
    \ the SSD with quantized MobileNetV2 was 37% faster.\nThe problem with kiwi detection\
    \ was that overlapping kiwis were reported, which the\nmodel counts as one kiwi.\n\
    3.8.3. Weed Detection\nBesides disease, weeds are considered to be a prevalent\
    \ threat to agricultural produc-\ntion. These are plants considered undesirable\
    \ in a particular situation, as they may compete\nwith crops for sunlight and\
    \ water, resulting in crop and economic loss. One signiﬁcant\nproblem in weed\
    \ control is that they are difﬁcult to detect and distinguish from crops\n[8].\
    \ DL algorithms can improve weed detection and discrimination at a lower cost\
    \ with\nreduced environmental problems and side effects. These technologies could\
    \ power robots\nthat detect and remove weeds.\nBah et al. [83] proposed a CNN\
    \ model with unsupervised training dataset annotation\ncollection for weed detection\
    \ in UAV images of bean and spinach ﬁelds. They assumed that\ncrops are grown\
    \ in regular rows and that plants growing between the rows are considered\nweeds.\
    \ The Hough transform was applied to the skeleton to detect the rate of plant\
    \ rows,\nand then a simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) algorithm was applied\
    \ to create a\nmarker and delineate the plant rows. This algorithm generated superpixels\
    \ based on\nk-mean clustering. After row detection, a blob coloring algorithm\
    \ was used to identify the\nweeds. The unsupervised training dataset was used\
    \ to train ResNet18 for weed detection\nin the images. The supervised learning\
    \ method performed 6% better than the unsupervised\nlearning method in the bean\
    \ ﬁeld and about 1.5% better in the spinach ﬁeld. The low\nnumber of weeds between\
    \ rows may explain the difference in performance in the bean\nﬁeld. The performance\
    \ of the model was compared with SVM and RF. In general, ResNet18\nshows better\
    \ performance in supervised and unsupervised learning methods than SVM\nand RF.\n\

    \ learning models JULE and Deep-\nCluster to detect weeds in the ﬁeld. The JULE\
    \ consists of stacked multiple combinations of\nconvolutional layer, batch normalization\
    \ layer, ReLU layer, and pooling layer. AlexNet and\nVGG16 were implemented as\
    \ the basis of the DeepCluster model to extract features, and\nthen K-means is\
    \ used as the clustering algorithm. Two datasets, Grass-Broadleaf [84] and\nDeepWeeds\
    \ [85] were used in this work. The DeepCluster model performed better than\nthe\
    \ JULE model on both datasets with a large number of clusters. The DeepCluster\
    \ with a\nbase of Alexnet and VGG achieved similar performance, with Alexnet performing\
    \ better\non DeepWeed and VGG on the other dataset. To investigate the effect\
    \ of transfer learning\non unsupervised learning, the pre-trained VGG and AlexNet\
    \ were used on ImageNet. The\npre-trained model did not improve the accuracy of\
    \ Grass-Broadleaf, but it did improve the\naccuracy of DeepWeed. The data augmentation\
    \ also improved the accuracy of the unsuper-\nvised learning methods. They also\
    \ used semi-supervised data labeling. Semi-supervised\nlearning is a machine learning\
    \ approach that deals with the use of labeled and unlabeled\ndata. In the semi-supervised\
    \ method, labeled images from the DeepCluster model were\nused to train Inception-V3,\
    \ VGG, and ResNet. Inception-V3 and VGG outperformed ResNet\non the Grass-Broadleaf\
    \ and DeepWeeds dataset, respectively.\nMilioto et al. [86] modiﬁed Encoder–Decoder\
    \ CNN architecture in [87] to distinguish\nweeds from crops and soil. The number\
    \ of convolutional layers was decreased to reduce\ntime inference, and additional\
    \ vegetation indices (14 channels) were included in the input\nfor more accurate\
    \ detection. The dataset of three ﬁelds was used. Three networks were\ntrained\
    \ with different inputs: one with RGB images, another with RGB and near-infrared\n\
    (NIR) images, and the last one was trained with 14 channels such as RGB, Excess\
    \ Green\n(ExG), Excess Red (ExR), color index of Vegetation Extraction (CIVE),\
    \ and Normalized\nDifference Index (NDI). To investigate the generalization ability\
    \ of the proposed model,\nthe model was trained on the images of one ﬁeld and\
    \ tested on images of all ﬁelds. The\nresults indicate that feeding these 14-channels\
    \ into the input can speed up the training\nand improve the performance of the\
    \ model on the unseen dataset compared to the model\ntrained on RGB images and\
    \ RGB+NRI but still, the recall and precision of the model on the\nunseen ﬁeld\
    \ drop sharply (11–50%).\nAnother experience was conducted to investigate the\
    \ generalization capacity of the\nproposed model. The trained model was retrained\
    \ on the unseen dataset with 10, 20, 50, or\n100 images in the training set. The\
    \ performance of the RGB network when retrained with\n100 images is almost the\
    \ same as the performance of the proposed model trained with ten\nimages. The\
    \ inference time of the proposed model on PC and Jetson TX2 platform was also\n\
    found to be 44 ms and 210 ms, respectively, which is slower than the model trained\
    \ with\nRGB images with 31 ms and 190 ms, respectively.\nLottes et al. [30] developed\
    \ an encoder–decoder Fully Convolutional Network (FCN)\nwith the sequential model\
    \ for weed detection in sugar beet ﬁelds. The encoder–decoder\nFCN was used to\
    \ extract features from the input images, and the sequential model processed\n\
    the ﬁve images in a sequence using 3D convolution and output a sequence code that\
    \ was\nused to learn sequential information about the weeds in ﬁve images in a\
    \ sequence. The\nresults showed that the encoder-decoder with a sequential model\
    \ improved the F1-score of\nthe module by almost 11–14% compared to the encoder-decoder\
    \ FCN. The results indicated\nthat the changes in the visual appearance of the\
    \ images in the training and test dataset\ncould lead to a decrease in model performance,\
    \ and adding additional information, such as\nvegetation indices, leads to better\
    \ generalization for other ﬁelds.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 638\n26 of 43\nTable\

    \ oilseed\nincluded in the paper were taken under completely different lighting\
    \ conditions. To mit-\nigate the effects of the different lighting conditions,\
    \ three image enhancement methods\nwere evaluated, including Histogram Equalization\
    \ (HE), Auto Contrast, and Deep Photo\nEnhancer. The models were also trained\
    \ with various inputs, including YCrCb and YCgCb\ncolor spaces and vegetation\
    \ indices such as Normalized Difference Index (NDI), Normal-\nized Difference\
    \ Vegetation Index (NDVI), Excess Green (ExG), Excess Red (ExR), Excess\nGreen\
    \ minus Excess Red (ExGR), Color Index of Vegetation (CIVE), Vegetative Index\
    \ (VEG),\nand Modiﬁed Excess Green Index (MExG), Combined Indices (COM1), and\
    \ COM2. For\nthe sugar beet dataset, the model trained with NIR images enhanced\
    \ by Auto Contrast\noutperformed the other models with a mean IOU of 87.13%. For\
    \ the Oilseeds dataset, the\nmodels were trained with RGB images only, and the\
    \ model trained with images enhanced\nby Deep Photo Enhancer outperformed the\
    \ other models (mIOU = 88.91%). Moreover, the\nauto-contrast method outperforms\
    \ other methods in terms of time inference.\n3.8.4. Species Recognition\nThe classiﬁcation\
    \ of species (e.g., insects, birds, and plants) is another critical aspect of\n\
    agricultural management. The traditional human approach to species classiﬁcation\
    \ requires\nspecialists in the ﬁeld and is time-consuming. Deep learning can provide\
    \ more accurate\nand faster results by analyzing real-world data.\nRußwurm and\
    \ Körner [90] trained LSTM and GRU models for multitemporal classiﬁ-\ncation,\
    \ which achieved high accuracy in crop classiﬁcation tasks for many crops. Images\n\
    were collected from SENTINEL 2A images between 31 December 2015 and 30 September\n\
    2016. For consistency with the LANDSAT series, the blue, green, red, near-infrared,\
    \ and\nshortwave infrared 1 and 2 bands were selected for this assessment. The\
    \ performance of the\nLSTM model was compared to the RNNs, the CNN model, and\
    \ a baseline SVM. The LSTM\nmodel outperformed the other models in terms of accuracy\
    \ in land cover classiﬁcation.\nLee et al. [91] used CNN to classify 44 plants\
    \ based on leaf images. Two datasets were\nprepared. One contained the entire\
    \ image of a leaf, and for the other, each leaf image was\nmanually cropped. The\
    \ accuracy of the CNN model trained with the second dataset was\nhigher than that\
    \ obtained with the ﬁrst dataset. The results showed that CNN can extract\nhigh-level\
    \ features such as structural subdivisions, leaf tip, leaf base, leaf margin,\
    \ etc., and\nis not limited to shape, color, and texture.\nAyhan et al. [92] implement\
    \ DeeplabeV3+, a CNN model developed from scratch\nand a machine learning method\
    \ that uses NDVI (NDVI+ML) to segment vegetation and\nnon-vegetation in the images.\
    \ The dataset of [93] belongs to two studied sites, Vasiliko in\nCyprus and Kimisala\
    \ in Rhodes Island, were used. The images were acquired using a UAV\nand a modiﬁed,\
    \ uncalibrated near-infrared camera. The image resolution of the Vasiliko\nimage\
    \ is 20 cm per pixel and these images were used to train the models. On the other\n\
    hand, the Kimisala dataset was used as a test set. The images in this dataset\
    \ contain two\ndifferent resolutions of 10 cm per pixel and 20 cm per pixel.\n\
    Two DeeplabeV3+ models were trained with RGB images as input and G, B bands\n\
    plus NDVI as the third channel. Although the loss of the DeeplabeV3+ model trained\
    \ from\nscratch with NDVI+GB was decreased, the test result was very poor. However,\
    \ the same\nmodel trained with transfer learning and NDVI+GB channels improved\
    \ the accuracy of the\nmodel compared to the model trained with RGB images (almost\
    \ one percent). The CNN\ndeveloped from scratch was also trained with two different\
    \ channels. The ﬁrst was trained\nwith RGB images and the second with four channels\
    \ of RGB and NIR. The model trained\nwith RGB and NIR outperformed the model trained\
    \ with RGB images with an accuracy of\n80.9% and an accuracy of 76%.\nIn the last\
    \ experience, the NDVI and the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) of the\nmachine learning\
    \ model were used to classify the images. This method includes several\nthresholds\
    \ that need to be adjusted by the user. The NDVI+ML method outperformed the\n\
    Remote Sens. 2022, 14, 638\n28 of 43\nmodels from DL with an accuracy of 87%.\
    \ Note that the deep learning method in this work\nwas trained with a dataset\
    \ from one location and tested at another location with a different\nland cover.\
    \ This could be a reason why NDVI+ML outperformed the DL models.\nBhusal et al.\
    \ [94] used the pre-trained MobileNet on the ImageNet to classify bird\npests\
    \ in the image. Video data from a commercial vineyard captured with a GoPro Hero\n\
    4 outdoor camera with 1080P resolution was used as the dataset. In their work,\
    \ a motion\ndetection algorithm was used that is capable of detecting moving objects.\
    \ For each of these\nmoving objects, the abounded rectangle was extracted. These\
    \ moving objects were cropped\nfrom the original RGB image and reduced to 32 ×\
    \ 32. Each of these cropped images was\nreferred to as motion instance images\
    \ (MIIs). More than 5000 MIIs were collected from\ndifferent videos and classiﬁed\
    \ as bird or non-bird. In the next step, a CNN model developed\nin [95] was used\
    \ to improve image resolution. The images were converted from 32 × 32\nto 64 ×\
    \ 64, 96 × 96, and 128 × 128 and denoted as MIIs (e-MIIs), 2e-MIIs, 3e-MIIs, and\n\
    4e-MIIs, respectively. Five MobilNet models were trained with the MIIs, 2e-MIIs,\
    \ 3e-MIIs,\n4e-MIIs, and the entire Dataset. The worth results in terms of accuracy\
    \ were obtained with\na model trained with MIIs, and the best result was obtained\
    \ with the model trained with\nall the datasets.\nMac Aodha et al. [96] used the\
    \ CNN models from scratch to detect bats from audio\nﬁles. Two CNN models called\
    \ CNNFULL with three convolutional layers and 32 ﬁlters and\nCNNFAST consisting\
    \ of two convolutional layers and 16 ﬁlters were trained. The audio\nﬁles were\
    \ converted to a spectrogram and used as input to the CNN model. CNNFULL and\n\
    CNNFAST took 53 and 9.5 s, respectively, to run the entire detection pipeline\
    \ on the 3.2-min\nfull-spectrum test dataset. CNNFAST showed a trade-off between\
    \ speed and accuracy with\nslightly lower performance compared to CNNFULL.\nThe\
    \ performance of the models was compared with three existing commercial closed-\n\
    source detection systems, including SonoBat (version 3.1.7p) (https://sonobat.com/,\
    \ ac-\ncessed on 26 November 2021); SCAN’R (version 1.7.7), and Kaleidoscope (version\
    \ 4.2.0\nalpha4) (https://www.wildlifeacoustics.com/products/kaleidoscope-pro,\
    \ accessed on 26\nNovember 2021), as well as a machine learning method RF. The\
    \ CNN model signiﬁcantly\noutperformed the other algorithms in terms of mAP.\n\
    Ramalingam et al. [97] used Internet of Things (IoT) based architecture for insect\n\
    detection. The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks\
    \ that use\nTransmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) to connect\
    \ billions of computers\nworldwide [98]. The IoT, on the other hand, is a global\
    \ network of physical objects equipped\nwith sensors and actuators that connect\
    \ to the Internet in real-time to be identiﬁed, sensed,\nand controlled remotely\
    \ [98]. The IoT architecture used in [97] consists of four layers:\nperception\
    \ layer, transport layer, processing layer, and application layer. In the perception\n\
    layer, a smart wireless camera captures an image of a sticky insect trap. The\
    \ transport\nlayer uses WiFi communication and TCP/IP to send images to the processing\
    \ layer and\ntransmit processed data to the application layer. In the processing\
    \ layer, an Fast RCNN\nwith ResNet50 is used to detect the insect in the images.\
    \ In the ﬁnal stage, smartphones and\nweb interfaces are used to perform the application\
    \ layer tasks. The experimental results\nshow that the trained model achieves\
    \ 96% accuracy in insect detection and outperforms\nYOLO and SSD in terms of accuracy.\n\
    3.8.5. Soil Management\nFor experts in agriculture, soil is a heterogeneous natural\
    \ resource with complex\nprocesses and unclear mechanisms [8]. Its temperature\
    \ alone can provide insight into\nthe impact of climate change on regional yields.\

    30 of 43\nLi et al. [99] used a bidirectional LSTM model to estimate soil temperature\
    \ at 30 sites\nunder ﬁve different climate types. Soil temperature (ST) measurements\
    \ were obtained\nfrom the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Water and\
    \ Climate Center, which\nhas established more than 200 sites across the country\
    \ to collect data on meteorology,\nsoil, and solar radiation. Two models were\
    \ trained with different inputs and outputs.\nThe ﬁrst model received the meteorological\
    \ weather conditions including daily hours,\nminimum and maximum air temperature,\
    \ minimum and maximum relative humidity,\nvapor pressure, average solar radiation,\
    \ and average wind speed, and outputted the soil\ntemperature amplitude obtained\
    \ by subtracting the daily average soil temperature from the\nhourly soil temperature.\
    \ The second model obtained the meteorological weather conditions\nincluding month,\
    \ day of the month, observed air temperature, dew point temperature,\nminimum\
    \ and maximum air temperature, minimum and maximum relative humidity,\nvapor pressure,\
    \ average solar radiation, average wind speed, and outputted the daily\naverage\
    \ ST. To calculate the hourly ST, the output of the ﬁrst model was added with\
    \ the\noutput of the second model and called the integrated BiLSTM model. The\
    \ result of the\nmodel was compared with the BiLSTM model, which directly estimates\
    \ the hourly ST, the\nLSTM model, the deep neural network, random forest, SVR,\
    \ and Linear Regression. The\nintegrated BiLSTM model outperformed the other models\
    \ in terms of MAE, RMSE, and R2.\nThe LSTM model achieved the second-best performance.\n\
    It was also found that the performance of each model is not as good in snowy areas\
    \ as\nin warm or dry areas and that, the accuracy of the other models increases\
    \ with soil depth\n(except for RF). This behavior could be due to a change in\
    \ the standard deviation of the soil\ntemperature at different depths and climate\
    \ types, but this is not investigated in the study.\nYu et al. [100] implement\
    \ CNN (Conv2D, Conv3D), ConvLSTM to estimate the soil\ntemperature. The difference\
    \ between Conv2D and Conv3D is the size of the input channels.\nIn the ConvLSTM\
    \ model [101], there are convolution structures in both the input-to-state\nand\
    \ state-to-state transitions. The model obtains the last ten days of historical\
    \ data from\nspatiotemporal ST and predicts the ST one, three, and ﬁve days in\
    \ advance. Each model\nwas trained with two different input channels. The ﬁrst\
    \ time the raw data from ST was\nfed into the model, the second time, the input\
    \ was processed using the Empirical Mode\nDecomposition (EMD) method, which is\
    \ a proposed method for processing signals. In\nthe EMD method, the number of\
    \ channels was increased from one to ten. To complement\nthe model DL, persistent\
    \ prediction (PF) is used, a simple prediction method that treats\nthe temperature\
    \ of the ﬁrst day as a prediction for the next day. When forecasting ST\nwith\
    \ one-day historical data, PF outperformed the models of DL with raw data input.\n\
    On the other hand, when the models of DL used the EEMD- processed data as input,\
    \ the\nprediction performance was signiﬁcantly improved. Among all the models,\
    \ EEMD-Conv3D\nperformed the best in predicting the spatiotemporal ST. It could\
    \ be noted that ST depends\nnot only on the historical data of ST but also on\
    \ the meteorological weather conditions,\nwhich can be used as input to the model\
    \ to improve the accuracy.\nAlibabaei et al. [102] used Bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM),\
    \ CNN-LSTM, and a simple\nLSTM model to model daily reference evapotranspiration\
    \ and soil–water content. Meteo-\nrological weather data for three sites in Portugal\
    \ were collected from the stations Póvoa\nde Atalaia, Estação Borralheira, and\
    \ Direção Regional de Agricultura e Pescas do Centro,\nPortugal. Evapotranspiration\
    \ was calculated from meteorological data using the FAO\nPenman–Monteith equation\
    \ and soil water content was retrieved from ERA5 land. The\nBLSTM model with an\
    \ MSE of 0.014 to 0.056 outperformed the LSTM, CNN, and CNN-\nLSTM models. The\
    \ performance of BLSTM was also compared with traditional machine\nlearning methods\
    \ such as Random Forest and SVR and outperformed these two models.\nAmong the\
    \ machine learning methods, RF outperformed the SVR model. The model was\nnot\
    \ tested with data measured in the ﬁeld. For use in the ﬁeld, it can be re-trained\
    \ with a\nsmall set of ﬁeld-measured data to be used with more conﬁdence in real-world\

    \ has implications for hydrological, climatological,\nand agronomic balance [8].\
    \ Five papers on the topic were reviewed, where machine learning\nmodels are employed\
    \ to estimate various values, such as evapotransition, allowing for\nmore effective\
    \ use of irrigation systems, and water table detection, which helps determine\n\
    crop water needs.\nSaggi and Jain [103] used multilayer perceptrons (MLP) to evaluate\
    \ daily evapotranspi-\nration for irrigation scheduling. They developed their\
    \ model from scratch. The developed\nDL model performed well in estimating evapotranspiration\
    \ and outperformed ML models\nsuch as RF, Generalized Linear Model (GLM), and\
    \ Gradient Boosting Models (GBM).\nZhang et al. [104] presented an LSTM-based\
    \ model for water management in agri-\ncultural areas. The LSTM model with a R2\
    \ value of 0.789–0.952 outperformed the fully\nconnected network. As mentioned\
    \ in the paper, the prediction of water table depth can\nhelp engineers and decision-makers\
    \ to develop an optimal irrigation scheduling system\nwhile controlling the effects\
    \ of salinity on intensive irrigation.\nLoggenberg et al. [105] applied hyperspectral\
    \ sensing and machine learning to model\nwater stress in vineyards. Stem water\
    \ potential (SWP) was measured in the ﬁeld by using a\npressure chamber to determine\
    \ vine water stress status. Vines with SWP values between\n−1.0 MPa and −1.8 MPa\
    \ were classiﬁed as water-stressed, while vines with SWP values\n−0.7 MPa were\
    \ classiﬁed as not stressed. Images were acquired using the SIMERA HX MkII\nhyperspectral\
    \ sensor, which detects 340 spectral wavebands in the VIS and NIR. A spectral\n\
    subset consisting of 176 wavebands with a spectral range of 473–708 nm was used\
    \ as\ninput to the models. Two ML models Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient\
    \ Boosting\n(XGBoost) were used for classiﬁcation. In the ﬁrst experience, RF\
    \ and XGBoost models\nused all wavebands (176 bands) as input. RF with an accuracy\
    \ of 83.3% outperformed\nXGBoost with an accuracy of 78%. When using a subset\
    \ of important wavebands (18 bands),\nthe accuracy of RF and XGBoost was improved\
    \ (RF = 93.3% and XGBoost = 90%). The\nresults show that the choice of input to\
    \ the model in ML is crucial and should be carefully\nselected. The effect of\
    \ smoothing the spectral data with the Savitzky–Golay ﬁlter in the data\npreprocessing\
    \ step was also investigated in the paper. The Savitzky–Golay ﬁlter reduces\n\
    the model accuracy ranging between 0.7% and 3.3%.\nChen et al. [40] used a deep\
    \ Q-learning (DQN) model for an irrigation decision\nstrategy based on short-term\
    \ weather forecasts for rice. Daily observed meteorological\ndata of the rice-growing\
    \ period at three stations, including daily minimum and maximum\ntemperature,\
    \ average temperature, average wind speed, sunshine duration, average relative\n\
    humidity, and precipitation were collected. The state-space consisted of Pt is\
    \ the predicted\nprecipitation sequence for the next 7 days on day t , mm; ht\
    \ is the water depth on day t, mm;\nhmin is the lower limit of water depth, mm;\
    \ hmax is the upper limit of water depth, mm;\nHp is the maximum allowable water\
    \ depth after precipitation. In the action space, three\npossible actions were\
    \ included, representing the fraction of the irrigation quota (irrigation\nto\
    \ hmax) to be supplied to the ﬁeld on day t. Action 0 returns 0%, action 1 returns\
    \ 50%, and\naction 2 returns 100%. The reward is based on the rainfall use reward\
    \ and the yield reward.\nThe results of the DQN irrigation strategy compared to\
    \ the results of the conventional\nirrigation strategy showed a signiﬁcant reduction\
    \ in irrigation water volume, irrigation\ntiming, and drainage water without yield\
    \ loss.\nAlibabaei et al. [38] uses the DQN model to schedule irrigation of a\
    \ tomato ﬁeld in\nPortugal using climate Big Data. Historical data are collected\
    \ from various sources and\nprocessed for use as input. Two LSTM models are trained\
    \ on the obtained historical data to\npredict the total soil water in the soil\
    \ proﬁle for the next day and the tomato yield at the\nend of a season, respectively.\n\
    The trained LSTM models were used in the DRL training environment, which takes\n\

    \ and then returns\nthe next state and reward. The reward was calculated as the\
    \ net return and the Q-value\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 638\n33 of 43\nwas estimated\

    waste at the beginning of the season and water stress at the end of the season.\
    \ Compared\nto the threshold and ﬁxed irrigation method, the DQN agent increases\
    \ productivity by 11%\nand avoids water waste by 20–30%.\n3.8.7. Automation in\
    \ Agriculture\nDeep learning is also being used to control sensors and robots\
    \ that enable automation\nand optimization of agricultural processes. These robots\
    \ can be used for a variety of\npurposes, including automated seeding, pesticide,\
    \ and crop nutrient application, damage\nrepair, irrigation, weed detection and\
    \ removal, harvesting, etc.\nLi et al. [52] used a deep-learning algorithm to\
    \ quickly and accurately detect and\nlocate longan fruit in imagery and pick the\
    \ fruit with a UAV device. An RGB-D camera\non the UAV was used to collect images\
    \ of the fruits. As mentioned in the paper, one of\nthe disadvantages of UAVs\
    \ is that they are easily affected by local circulation and airﬂow\nwhen capturing\
    \ images, resulting in blurred images of the fruits. In the preprocessing of\n\
    the data, a Fuzzy image processing algorithm was used to remove the blurred images\
    \ from\nthe data set.\nFPN, YOLOv3, YOLOv4, MobileNet-SSD, YOLOv4-tiny, and MobileNet-YOLOv4\n\
    models were trained on the images to detect and locate string fruits, simple fruits,\
    \ and fruit\nbranches. In the ﬁnal phase, the detection results are mapped onto\
    \ the optimized depth\nimage to extract the contours and spatial information of\
    \ the three targets. Based on this in-\nformation, the drone can detect and locate\
    \ the fruits and use them in harvesting. In general,\nthe YOLO models had faster\
    \ detection speed and achieved better accuracy than the FPN\nand SSD models. MobileNet-YOLOv4\
    \ achieved the best performance in terms of accuracy\n(mAP = 89.73) and inference\
    \ time (68 s), while FPN achieved the worst performance.\nTo test the model in\
    \ orchards, a picking platform was developed with a UAV, a Jetson\nTX2, an RGB-D\
    \ camera, a set of scissors with clamps, and a support frame. The accuracy\nrate\
    \ of successful harvesting in four cases was reported as 75, 75, 69.23, and 68.42.\n\
    Aghi et al. [106] presents a low-cost, energy-efﬁcient local motion planner for\
    \ au-\ntonomous navigation of robots in vineyards based on RGB-D images, low-range\
    \ hardware\n(a low-cost device with low power and limited computational capabilities),\
    \ and two control\nalgorithms. The ﬁrst algorithm uses the disparity map and its\
    \ depth representation to\ngenerate proportional control for the robot platform.\
    \ The second backup algorithm, based\non a deep learning algorithm, takes control\
    \ of the machine when the ﬁrst block brieﬂy fails\nand generates high-level motion\
    \ primitives.\nAn Intel RealSense Depth Camera D435i RGB-D camera was used to\
    \ capture images\nand compute the depth map on the platform. The video was captured\
    \ in different terrain,\nquality, and time of day. Then, a light depth map-based\
    \ algorithm processes the depth\nmaps to detect the end of the vineyard row and\
    \ then calculates control values for linear and\nangular velocities using a proportional\
    \ controller. Since, as in many outdoor applications,\nsunlight negatively affects\
    \ the quality of the results and interferes with the control provided\nby the\
    \ local navigation algorithm, MobileNet was trained to classify whether the camera\n\
    was pointed at the center of the end of the vineyard row or one of its sides,\
    \ and it was used\nwhen the ﬁrst algorithm failed due to outdoor conditions. The\
    \ CNN model was trained\nwith transfer learning and classiﬁed the images into\
    \ three classes: Middle, Left, and Right.\nFor the middle class, the video was\
    \ taken in rows with the camera pointed at the center,\nand for the other two\
    \ classes, the videos were rotated left and right with the camera at a\n45-degree\
    \ angle to the long axis of the row. The accuracy of the model on the test set\
    \ was\none. The model was trained on a small portion of the data set to investigate\
    \ the signiﬁcance\nof the size of the data set. The accuracy of the model decreased\
    \ by 6% with the small\ndata set.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 638\n34 of 43\nTable\

    \ optimized by discarding all redundant operations and\nreducing the ﬂoating-point\
    \ accuracy from 32 to 16 bits. The accuracy of the optimized\nmodel was the same\
    \ as the original and the time inference was improved. The proposed\nmodel was\
    \ implemented on a robot and the tests were performed in a new vineyard\nscenario.\
    \ The ﬁrst algorithm can detect the end of the vineyard regardless of the direction\n\
    of the long axis of the robot. When the ﬁrst algorithm fails, the CNN model jumps\
    \ in and\ndetects the end of the vineyard.\nBadeka et al. [107] trained YOLOv3\
    \ to detect grape crates in the ﬁeld for use on robots\nharvesting grapes. The\
    \ images of the crate were taken under natural ﬁeld conditions. Three\ndata enhancement\
    \ techniques were used, including rotation, noise, processing, and blur\nprocessing.\
    \ The model achieved an accuracy of 99.74% (mAP%) with an inference time\nof 0.26\
    \ s. To use the trained model on robots, it must be deployed on edge devices and\n\
    report the inference time and accuracy of the model on these devices. Another\
    \ interesting\nproblem is that the robot can detect whether the box is full or\
    \ not.\nMajeed et al. [108] combined the DL model with mathematical models to\
    \ detect\ncordons in grape canopies and determine their trajectories. Images were\
    \ taken so that a tree\ntrunk was approximately in the center of the ﬁeld of view\
    \ of a high-resolution camera (Sony\nCyber-shot RX100 IV). A total of 191 images\
    \ of random RGB images were captured from two\ndifferent vineyard blocks with\
    \ different cultivars. Each image in the dataset was classiﬁed\ninto three classes:\
    \ Background, Trunk, and Cordon (http://hdl.handle.net/2376/16939,\naccessed on\
    \ 1 September 2021). Since the background pixels in the labeled images covered\n\
    most of the images, a weight was assigned to each class in the preprocessing of\
    \ the data,\nwhich was calculated using a median frequency class balancing method\
    \ to avoid bias during\ntraining. Data augmentation and transfer learning techniques\
    \ were used in this work.\nA fully convolutional neural network (FCN) and SegNet\
    \ with VGG and AlexNet\nbackbones were trained to segment the cordons in the images.\
    \ The FCN-VGG16 network\nachieved the best performance in terms of mean accuracy\
    \ and F1-score compared to the\nother networks. In the next step, the mathematical\
    \ model including the Fourier model,\nGaussian model, polynomial model, and sine\
    \ sum model was applied to estimate the\ntrajectory of the cordons. The sixth-order\
    \ polynomial equation with an average R2 value of\n0.99 had the best ﬁt for the\
    \ trajectories of the cordons compared to the other mathematical\nmodels tested.\n\
    Pinto de Aguiar et al. [109] trained seven different DL models for detecting grapevine\n\
    stems in two vineyards in Portugal. The trained models included Single Shot Multi-\n\
    box (SSD) MobileNet-V1 (α = 0.75), SSD MobileNet-V1 with different hyperparameters\n\
    (α = 0.75), SSD MobileNet-V2, Pooling Pyramid Network (PPN) MobileNet-V1, SSDLite\n\
    MobileNet-V2, SSD Inception-V2, Tiny YOLO-V3. In this work, Transfer Learning\
    \ was ap-\nplied using the COCO dataset. A dataset was created using a robotic\
    \ platform. This dataset\ncontains images captured in two different vineyards,\
    \ using two cameras each, including\nthe Raspberry Pi cameras and a conventional\

    \ image (http://vcriis01.inesctec.pt/datasets/DataSet/VineSet.zip, accessed\n\
    on 2 September 2021). A robotic platform AgRob V16 with a frontal stereo RGB camera\n\
    and a frontal thermal camera was used to capture a video from which the images\

    \ to resize the dataset\nto a suitable size for the seepage learning method. Two\
    \ training datasets were used to\nevaluate the effect of the training dataset\
    \ size on the performance of the detectors. The\noriginal VineSet dataset and\
    \ a small subset of it containing 336 non-augmented images\nwere used. The SSD\

    \ Colabora-\ntory platform (https://colab.research.google.com, accessed on 1 September\
    \ 2021) to help\nresearchers automatically label the new dataset and then manually\
    \ correct the labeling.\nLabeling the data is one of the challenges of using the\
    \ DL model. In this way, labeling the\nimages of the trunk becomes less time-consuming.\n\
    4. Discussion\nDeep learning is already being used in various areas of agriculture,\
    \ but it is still far\nfrom being widely applied in agriculture. In this paper,\
    \ we reviewed 46 recent research\npapers to examine the challenges of using deep\
    \ learning in agriculture. Figure 13 shows\nthe pie chart of the researched papers\
    \ based on the application domain.\nDisease Detection\nYield Prediction\nWeed\
    \ Detection\nSpecies Detection\nSoil Management\nWater Management\nAutomation\
    \ \nFigure 13. Pie chart representing the papers by application area.\nThe following\
    \ challenges can be pointed out from the reviewed articles. The most\ncritical\
    \ point concerns the dataset. Training the model with a small dataset can lead\
    \ to\nsigniﬁcant failures [18,72,106] and even with transfer learning and data\
    \ augmentation,\ntraining the model may require a sufﬁcient amount of data [55].\
    \ The presence of the image\nunder ﬁeld conditions in the data set is very important\
    \ [63]. Therefore, collecting authentic\nﬁeld images and datasets under different\
    \ conditions is the ﬁrst and most important step.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 638\n\
    38 of 43\nUsing open-source datasets, sharing the dataset with other researchers,\
    \ data augmentation,\nand transfer learning properly can help to overcome these\
    \ challenges [71,77].\nIn addition, agricultural image datasets are more complex\
    \ due to outdoor conditions,\nthe object of interest usually occupying a very\
    \ small and uncentered part of the image,\nsimilarity between objects and background,\
    \ blocking the object with leaves and branches,\nmultiple objects in one image,\
    \ and many more [31,63,65,68,79,82]. To be applicable in the\nreal world, the\
    \ dataset should fully represent the state of the environment. In some cases,\n\
    such as variable illuminance, data augmentation may also be helpful.\nThe type\
    \ of input affects the performance of the model [55,62,88,92]. Removing\nbackground\
    \ from images [55], using different color spaces and vegetarian indices as in-\n\
    put [62], detecting crop at different growth stages [81], adding vegetarian indices\
    \ to the\ninput [30,86], cropping the input image [91], and data from different\
    \ climate types [99]\nchange the performance of the model. The size of the input\
    \ also affects the runtime and\naccuracy of the model [62,79]. Therefore, it is\
    \ challenging to determine the best input set\nfor the speciﬁc task.\nLabeling\
    \ large amounts of data is expensive and time-consuming [55]. In addition,\nthere\
    \ are some tasks, such as those related to plant diseases, that can only be performed\n\
    by specialists in the ﬁeld. Even when using open-source datasets with already\
    \ annotated\ndata, there is no way to ﬁnd out who actually did the annotation.\
    \ As it was seen in\nseveral papers, data augmentation and transfer learning are\
    \ ways to avoid labeling a\nlarge dataset, but labeling a small dataset is still\
    \ time-consuming [55]. Unsupervised and\nsemi-supervised learning methods can\
    \ be of great help but need further investigation in\nthis area [35,36,61,83].\n\
    When choosing a model for a task, there is a tradeoff between accuracy and inference\n\
    time [26,34,65,67,77,96]. Depending on the application, the model can be chosen.\n\
    Neither environment is similar in the ﬁeld of agriculture, and each environment\
    \ and\nproblem requires its own dataset, and therefore the DL model may not be\
    \ universally\napplicable, i.e., if a model has been trained with a dataset from\
    \ a particular site or a dataset\nfrom an open-source site such as ImageNet, it\
    \ may not be able to be used at another site, or\naccuracy may decrease when applied\
    \ to the dataset collected in the real world [12,69]. The\nchanges in the visual\
    \ appearance of the images in the training and test dataset could lead\nto a decrease\
    \ in model performance [30]. One way to overcome this is to retrain the already\n\
    trained model with a small dataset from the new environment [86].\nThe design\
    \ of deep models is complex and they are referred to as black boxes [7]. One\n\
    of the challenges in training DL models is that a system with very high computational\n\
    power (GPU) is needed [7]. Moreover, the performance of these models depends on\
    \ the\nchoice of hyperparameters, loss functions, and optimization algorithm [60,67].\
    \ Algorithms\nsuch as Bayesian optimization [110] can help to ﬁnd the right hyperparameters\
    \ [102].\nGoogle researchers used neural architecture search (NAS) algorithm [111]\
    \ to ﬁnd state of\nthe art MobilenetV3 [112]. NAS is a method that searches among\
    \ all possible combinations\nof submodules that can be repeatedly assembled to\
    \ obtain the entire model with the best\npossible accuracy.\nThe other challenge\
    \ relates to the real-time applicability of the models. Most deep\nlearning models\
    \ have many parameters that need to be trained, and after training the\nmodel,\
    \ inference of the model is not made in real-time. In some applications, such\
    \ as using\na robot for harvesting, time inference is essential. As we see in\
    \ this work, most of the\nmodels are implemented and tested on the PC, which requires\
    \ power and it is impractical\nin real applications. Moreover, implementation\
    \ on devices such as smartphones still, brings\nvarious challenges that need to\
    \ be considered, such as memory consumption, speed, etc.\nSingle-stage detection\
    \ models such as YOLO and SSD, lightweight classiﬁcation models\nsuch as MobileNet,\
    \ the development of edge devices such as Raspberry Pi and Jetson nano,\nand the\
    \ use of cloud computing have made it possible to deploy Deep Learning models\
    \ in\nreal-world applications and practical ways [34,52,72,86,109]. The quantization\
    \ method can\nbe also used to compress the model size and improve the detection\
    \ speed [82].\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 638\n39 of 43\nOn small farms, the use of\
    \ some methods is sometimes impractical because farmers\nmust have some knowledge\
    \ to interpret the results obtained. For example, the model\nthat predicts soil\
    \ moisture for irrigation scheduling requires a human expert to use this\ninformation\
    \ to determine the best time and amount of water for irrigation. As mentioned\n\
    earlier, Deep Reinforcement Learning is showing great success in several areas\
    \ as a promis-\ning model for building smart farms in several areas [39]. The\
    \ model can be trained to\nmake decisions about when and how much to irrigate\
    \ [38,40]. Information generated by\nIoT devices also helps farmers track agricultural\
    \ operations and make better decisions to\nimprove agricultural productivity [97].\n\
    5. Conclusions\nThis paper discussed some recent work on the application of DL\
    \ to agriculture and\nbiodiversity and highlighted some challenges in this area.\
    \ More sustainable agriculture\nand the promotion of biodiversity in agricultural\
    \ systems can be achieved by reducing the\nuse of agrochemicals, low pesticide\
    \ use and organic farming, appropriate crop rotations,\nsmall-scale ﬁelds, and\
    \ the preservation of natural spaces between agroecosystems [113]. As\nmentioned,\
    \ this can be achieved through the new IoT technology in combination with the\n\
    new biodiversity algorithms and Artiﬁcial Intelligence model. They can be used\
    \ to detect\nand control species and also to improve ecosystem state and thus\
    \ productivity having to\nresort to the use of environmentally damaging practices.\n\
    The novelty of the application of DL models and the challenges identiﬁed in agriculture\n\
    demonstrates the need for further research. CNN is the most widely used DL model\
    \ in\nagriculture. The use of new methods, such as attention mechanisms, new lightweight\n\
    models, single-stage detection models, can improve the performance of the model,\
    \ as a\nslight improvement in accuracy and run time can signiﬁcantly improve the\
    \ ﬁnal results.\nIn the future, we expect to develop or improve models that help\
    \ farmers make crop\nmanagement decisions. These models can be integrated into\
    \ decision support tools, and\nthese tools can guide users through precise steps\
    \ and suggest optimal decision paths. It is\nexpected that the development of\
    \ these models will also enable biodiversity monitoring.\nConsequently, the adoption\
    \ of new sustainable practices supported by DL models and\nbiodiversity monitoring\
    \ will help manage the farm with minimal human intervention and\ngreater effectiveness.\n\

    METHODOLOGY\nA spatio temporal spectral framework \nfor plant stress phenotyping\n\
    Raghav Khanna1* , Lukas Schmid1, Achim Walter2, Juan Nieto1, Roland Siegwart1\
    \ and Frank Liebisch2\nAbstract \nBackground: Recent advances in high throughput\
    \ phenotyping have made it possible to collect large datasets \nfollowing plant\
    \ growth and development over time, and those in machine learning have made inferring\
    \ phenotypic \nplant traits from such datasets possible. However, there remains\
    \ a dirth of datasets following plant growth under \nstress conditions along with\
    \ methods for inferring them using only remotely sensed data, especially under\
    \ a combi-\nnation of multiple stress factors such as drought, weeds and nutrient\
    \ deficiency. Such stress factors and their combi-\nnations are commonly encountered\
    \ during crop production and being able to accurately detect and treat such stress\
    \ \nconditions in an automated and timely manner can provide a major boost to\
    \ farm yields with minimal resource input.\nResults: We present a generic framework\
    \ for remote plant stress phenotyping that consists of a dataset with spatio-\n\
    temporal-spectral data following sugarbeet crop growth under optimal, drought,\
    \ low and surplus nitrogen fertiliza-\ntion, and weed stress conditions, along\
    \ with a machine learning based methodology for systematically inferring these\
    \ \nstress conditions from the remotely measured data. The dataset contains biweekly\
    \ color images, infra-red stereo \nimage pairs and hyperspectral camera images\
    \ along with applied treatment parameters and environmental factors \nlike temperature\
    \ and humidity, collected over two months. We present a plant agnostic methodology\
    \ for deriving \nplant trait indicators such as canopy cover, height, hyperspectral\
    \ reflectance and vegetation indices along with a \nspectral 3D reconstruction\
    \ of the plants from the raw data to serve as a benchmark. Additionally, we provide\
    \ fresh and \ndry weight measurements for both the above (canopy) and below (beet)\
    \ ground biomass at the end of the growing \nperiod to serve as indicators of\
    \ expected yield. We further describe a data driven, machine learning based method\
    \ \nto infer water, Nitrogen and weed stress using the derived plant trait indicators.\
    \ We use the plant trait indicators to \nevaluate 8 different classification approaches\
    \ from which the best classifier achieved a mean cross validation accuracy \n\
    of ≈ 93, 76 and 83% for drought, nitrogen and weed stress severity classification\
    \ respectively. We also show that our \nmulti-modal approach significantly improves\
    \ classifier performance over using any single modality.\nConclusion: The presented\
    \ framework and dataset can serve as a valuable reference for creating and comparing\
    \ pro-\ncessing pipelines which extract plant trait indicators and infer prevalent\
    \ stress factors from remote sensing data under \na variety of environments and\
    \ cropping conditions. These techniques can then be deployed on farm machinery\
    \ or \nrobots enabling automated, precise and timely corrective interventions\
    \ for maximising yield.\nKeywords: Phenotyping, Plant-stress, Nitrogen, Weed,\

    Khanna et al. Plant Methods           (2019) 15:13 \nIntroduction\nPlants grown\
    \ in most crop production fields and breed-\ning nurseries suffer from varying\
    \ types and severities of \nbiotic and abiotic stresses such as nutrient deficiency\
    \ \nand weed pressure which have adverse affects on yields \n[3]. For precise\
    \ and timely corrective intervention, a sig-\nnificant challenge is to determine\
    \ the types as well as the \nseverity levels of the multiple stress conditions\
    \ present at \ndifferent locations on the field. This information is impor-\n\
    tant for field experiments as well as crop management in \nfarmers’ fields. Once\
    \ the type and severity level of each of \nthe many possible stress factors can\
    \ be accurately deter-\nmined, corrective treatments such as irrigation, ferti-\n\
    lizer and herbicide application can then be applied in a \nprecise local manner,\
    \ targeting only areas where these \ntreatments would have a beneficial impact\
    \ while simulta-\nneously adjusting the applied amount to meet the actual \ndemand.\
    \ This concept is widely described as variable rate \napplication (VRA) and is\
    \ linked to increased resource \nuse efficiency and economic benefit [4, 5]. Furthermore,\
    \ \nthe recent surge in interest in agricultural robotics [6–8], \nspecifically\
    \ pertaining to precision agriculture applica-\ntions [9] make automated, remote\
    \ sensing based plant \nstress inference, as a key capability of such systems,\
    \ a \npertinent challenge.\nToday, determination of crop stress factors using\
    \ vis-\nible symptoms is still often a manual and complex task \npredominantly\
    \ carried out by trained and experienced \nindividuals, such as agronomists, crop\
    \ scientists and plant \npathologists, since a variety of stress factors can mani-\n\
    fest themselves through similar symptoms. Similar to \nplant breeding, however,\
    \ the manual process is laborious, \ntime-consuming and not always reproducible\
    \ due to the \ninherently subjective nature of manual ratings, experience \nand\
    \ interpretation [10]. Advancements in high through-\nput phenotyping, remote\
    \ sensing hardware and machine \nlearning software have now made remote sensing\
    \ based \nplant stress inference computationally tractable [11]. State \nof the\
    \ art machine learning methods [12, 13] can employ \nlarge amounts of multi-modal\
    \ data to produce accurate \nclassification and regression models that can be\
    \ used for \nsuch inference tasks. There exist a variety of readily avail-\nable,\
    \ rich, open-source software libraries [14–16] with \nwhich, given suitable data,\
    \ one can quickly iterate and \ndetermine the most suitable machine learning algorithm\
    \ \nand create an accurate model for a given inference task. \nWith the proliferation\
    \ of these automated high through-\nput plant phenotyping tools, a large number\
    \ of recent \nstudies have been focused on studying plant growth in \nrelation\
    \ to genotype variety [17, 18] and under stress using \na variety of sensors and\
    \ their combinations [11]. Studies \non plant stress include those on drought\
    \ stress [19, 20], \nheat stress [21], salt stress [22, 23], nutrient deficiency\
    \ [24, \n25] and biotic stress [10, 12, 13, 26–28]. Sensor modali-\nties used\
    \ in these studies include colour, hyperspectral, \nthermal and fluorescence imaging.\
    \ However, most stud-\nies typically include primarily one sensor modality [11,\
    \ \n29] and focuses on one out of the many aforementioned \nstress conditions\
    \ [11, 30], which often occur simultane-\nously on real fields. These stress studies\
    \ also typically \nonly look at individual time points during plant develop-\n\
    ment [11]. Studies covering the temporal range of plant \ngrowth may allow for\
    \ better characterization of dynamic \nplant response to stress. There also remains\
    \ a dirth of \nopen, high quality, multi-modal datasets which can be \nused along\
    \ with the powerful machine learning software \nlibraries to develop, compare\
    \ and benchmark methods for \nautomated plant stress inference.\nTo address these\
    \ issues, we studied plant growth under \ndifferent severities of 2 commonly occurring\
    \ abiotic stress \nconditions-drought and nitrogen availability and one biotic\
    \ \nstress-weeds. We imaged the plants subjected to multiple \ncombinations of\
    \ these stress conditions with color, stereo \ninfrared and narrow-band hyperspectral\
    \ cameras providing \nbi-weekly multi-modal information on the growth of sugar-\n\
    beet plants under these stress conditions. We show how such \na dataset can serve\
    \ as an test bench for rapidly developing and \nevaluating classification models\
    \ which determine the presence \nand severity of different stress factors using\
    \ remotely sensed \ndata. The primary contributions of this work are (Fig. 1):\n\
    • A open, publicly available dataset [1] from a two \nmonth long experiment consisting\
    \ of biweekly RGB, \nstereo and hyperspectral imagery for sugar beet \nplants\
    \ grown in a greenhouse subject to known \nseverity levels of water, nitrogen\
    \ and weed stress.\n• Reference measurements including environmental \ntemperature\
    \ and humidity logs, along with applied \ntreatment regimens creating the different\
    \ stress con-\nditions, SPAD measurements and harvested beet \nbiomass after the\
    \ experiment enabling the systematic \nstudy of the effects of different stress\
    \ factors on plant \ndevelopment and yield.\n• Generic, plant agnostic pre and\
    \ post processing soft-\nware [2] for the raw imagery, providing functionality\
    \ \nfor spectral point cloud generation and extraction of \na variety of remote\
    \ phenotypic plant trait indicators \nsuch as canopy cover, height and spectral\
    \ vegeta-\ntion indices along with an analysis of the impact of \nthe different\
    \ stress factors on the extracted plant trait \nindicators and biomass production.\n\
    • A machine learning based methodology, using the \nextracted plant trait indicators\
    \ for simultaneous \nstress severity level classification of drought, nitrogen\
    \ \nand weed stress, released as part of the open source \nsoftware suite [2].\n\
    Page 3 of 18\nKhanna et al. Plant Methods           (2019) 15:13 \nWith this methodology,\
    \ we show that with spatio-tem-\nporal spectral data it becomes possible to create\
    \ accurate \nclassification models for a variety of useful tasks, spe-\ncifically,\
    \ the simultaneous detection of the presence and \nseverity of drought, nitrogen\
    \ and weed stress. The same \nmethodology can also be used to collect similar\
    \ datasets \nfor other plant species, which can then be used with the \nprovided\
    \ software suite to conveniently build similar \nmodels for a variety of different\
    \ crops. These validated \nmodels can then be augmented with data from limited,\
    \ \nless expensive field trials and deployed on hand-held sen-\nsor setups [31],\
    \ Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), smart \ntractors and Unmanned Ground Vehicles\
    \ (UGVs) for use \nin plant breeding and sustainable crop production [6, 7].\n\
    Materials and methods\nPlant cultivation and stress treatments\nThe experiment\
    \ was conducted at the ETH research sta-\ntion for plant sciences in Lindau Eschikon,\
    \ Switzerland. The \nsugar beet plants (Beta vulgaris) of the variety “Samuela”\
    \ \n(KWS Suisse SA, Basel, Switzerland) were grown in a green-\nhouse chamber\
    \ under controlled climate conditions—24/12 \n(◦C) Day/Night temperature, a relative\
    \ humidity of 50–80 \npercent (average 60%), and additional light using Eye Clean\
    \ \nArc MT 400DL/BH lamps with a color temperature of \n6400  K when ambient radiation\
    \ was below 25 klux. The \nachieved radiation intensity ranged approximately between\
    \ \n300 and 680  µmol/cm2s . The radiation angle between \nthe cultivation light\
    \ source and the plants was nadir ±20◦ . \nAbove 45 klux the shading screen was\
    \ closed. For the exper-\niment, 6 sugar beet plants each were sown on 18.01.2018\
    \ \nin 30 cultivation boxes of size 40 × 20 × 15.5 cm using a \npeat substrate\
    \ (Klasmann substrate 1 and 2, Klasmann–\nDeilmann GmbH, Geeste, Germany). The\
    \ plant boxes were \nplaced on tables about 2 m from the artificial light sources.\
    \ \nRegular watering was volume controlled and applied manu-\nally according to\
    \ necessity two to three times a week. The \nexperiment was conducted until 29.03.2018\
    \ when the plants \nwere manually harvested.\nIn addition to the control group\
    \ of plant cultivation \nboxes which were provided with sufficient nutrients and\
    \ \nwere not subjected to any weed pressure, we established \na mix of three different\
    \ stresses relevant for field crops \nin general and for sugar beet production\
    \ in particular—\nNitrogen (N) availability, weed pressure and water sup-\nply\
    \ listed in Table  1. Different severity levels for each \nof these three stress\
    \ types and their combinations were \nestablished which span the range of expected\
    \ conditions \nwhich may be observed on the field.\nFig. 1 An overview of the\
    \ framework described in this paper. This work presents a methodology for building\
    \ and benchmarking machine learning \nmodels that can infer plant stress using\
    \ remotely sensed, multi-modal data. Our framework consists of a spatio-temporal\
    \ spectral dataset, image \npre-processing and classification algorithms along\
    \ with reference plant trait measurements and stress type and severity level labels\
    \ to serve as \nground truth. Our generic, plant agnostic pipeline starts with\
    \ raw input imagery from RGB, stereo infrared (IR) and multispectral cameras,\
    \ followed \nby pre-processing steps of vegetation segmentation, 3D reconstruction\
    \ and reflectance normalization to transform this raw data into plant trait \n\
    indicators such as canopy cover, average height and normalized narrow-band reflectances\
    \ over time. We then train machine learning models which \ncan use these indicators\
    \ to predict severity levels for Water, Nitrogen and Weed stress simultaneously.\
    \ We show the effectiveness of our framework \nby using the trained models to\
    \ accurately predict stress severity levels on novel test data. We release the\
    \ collected dataset [1] and accompanying \npre-processing and classification software\
    \ [2] under an open source license for the broader plant research community\n\

    For plant N availability, three levels: low, medium and high \nwere established,\
    \ targeting a deficient, sufficient and sur-\nplus N supply, simulating an N availability\
    \ equivalent of \n20, 40 and 80 kg/ha on the field respectively. These N sup-\n\
    ply values were chosen based on literature [6, 32, 33], own \nexperience and local\
    \ farmers’ best management practices. \nThe low N supply was achieved using the\
    \ Klasmann sub-\nstrate 1 which contains minor amounts of N, sufficient only \n\
    for initial plant growth. The medium N level was achieved \nusing the Klasman\
    \ substrate two containing amounts of N \nsufficient for 1–2 months of plant growth\
    \ and the high level \nreceived additional N by means of fertigation once a week\
    \ \nfrom 14.02.2018 onwards using 0.2 percent Wuxal Profi \n(Syngenta Agro AG,\
    \ Dielsdorf, Switzerland) [34].\nWeed stress\nTo establish weed pressure we used\
    \ monocotyle and \ndicotyl weeds, shown in Fig. 2. As monocotyle weeds we \nused\
    \ three grass species—Poa pratensis L., Lolium per-\nenne L. and Festuca rubra\
    \ agg. L., in variable combinations \nas derived from the mulch meadow grass seed\
    \ mixture \nprovided by Ufa Seeds (fenaco, Bern, Switzerland) [35]. As \ndicot\
    \ species we used locally collected Stellaria media (L.) \nVill. (common chickweed).\
    \ We established three levels of \nweed density: no weeds, medium weed pressure\
    \ contain-\ning 2–4 chickweeds (without grass) and a high weed pres-\nsure containing\
    \ 4–8 chickweed plants and 2–4 grasses \ntotalling in 7–12 weed plants per cultivation\
    \ box. The \nweed pressure classes medium and high were established \naccording\
    \ to experience from previous field and green-\nhouse experiments. Additionally,\
    \ we established boxes of \nsingle and mixed weed species without sugar beet which\
    \ \nmay be useful for classifier training purposes.\nWater (drought) stress\n\
    We established two severity levels of drought stress. To \nthe water limited (drying)\
    \ plant boxes, we provided an \nTable 1 Overview of the experimental treatments\n\

    \ Plant Methods           (2019) 15:13 \nData pre‑processing and plant trait extraction\n\
    This section describes the data pre-processing algorithms \nand methods for extracting\
    \ plant trait indicators from the \ncollected dataset. Documented MATLAB® code\
    \ with the \npre- and post-processing methodology described in this \nsection\
    \ is available online [2].\nRegion of interest(ROI)/box detection\nIn order to\
    \ facilitate extraction of relevant parts of the \nimages and include only the\
    \ foreground, i.e the boxes \ncontaining the plant and soil material, we provide\
    \ a semi \nautomated work flow for detecting box boundaries in the \nRGB images.\
    \ We rely on observing similarly colored gray \npoints on the edges of the box\
    \ and then use one of the \ntwo procedures described below:\n1. Fit the box boundaries\
    \ to the most prominent \ndetected edges, i.e locations of highest edge point\
    \ \ndensity. This method is relatively robust to outliers, \nhowever works well\
    \ only if lots of points on the box \nedges are observable in the image, which\
    \ is only the \ncase for early growth stages with low canopy cover.\n2. Span a\
    \ rectangle of maximum size, that does not con-\ntain any of the edge points.\
    \ This method only needs \nfew (e.g. 2 per boundary) points in order to detect\
    \ \na rectangle, and thus works well even in cases of \nextreme coverage by the\
    \ canopy. However, it is sensi-\ntive to outliers detected within the box (e.g\
    \ plant or \nsoil pixels detected as edges since they appear “gray” \nin the image).\n\
    The automated detection candidates are then provided to \nthe user for feedback\
    \ through a pop-up window (Fig. 8), \nwhere the user can drag the box outlines\
    \ to the correct \nbox edges (Fig. 8b). Once the box areas are detected in \n\
    each of the color images, they are saved for further pro-\ncessing steps. We release\
    \ our annotations based on this \nwork flow for the pixel positions of the box\
    \ corners for \neach image along with the dataset.\nReflectance computation\n\
    Radiometric calibration for the hyperspectral camera is \nperformed using the\
    \ method described in [40]. Further-\nmore, a plate of uniform reflectance across\
    \ the wave-\nlength range of interest is placed in the measurement \n30\n35\n\

    \ the plant N \navailability which correlates strongly with the SPAD values is\
    \ lower \nin the deficient (Low N input) case, however, similar for the medium\

    \ Methods           (2019) 15:13 \nsetup to provide a normalization factor under\
    \ varying \nillumination conditions. The reflectance normalization \nfactors,\
    \ freﬂectance , are estimated using the reflectance \nplate in every image with\
    \ known constant reflectance of \nR = 0.6. Since the plate is fixed with respect\
    \ to the cam-\neras, its location in the images is always the same. The \nreflectance\
    \ factors are defined as the ratio of point reflec-\ntance to its observed intensity\n\
    Since the camera exposure time and white balance is set \nto utilize the full\
    \ 10 bit range of digital number values \nprovided by the camera, the pixel intensity\
    \ values do not \ndirectly correspond to the point reflectance. Assuming \nuniform\
    \ illumination over the area of interest, a robust \nreflectance factor can be\
    \ estimated from a region of \nknown reflectance, i.e. the reflectance panel,\
    \ using\nindependently for each channel (wavelength band). \nOcclusions of the\
    \ reflectance panel, however, remain \na potential source of error. To overcome\
    \ errors due to \nocclusion, at first, occlusions of the reflectance panel are\
    \ \ndetected in the RGB image, since it is easier to find val-\nues deviating\
    \ from the expected brightness. If the reflec-\ntance panel region contains any\
    \ pixels, darker than a \ncertain threshold (0.4 in this case), the image is marked\
    \ \nas occluded. The reflectance factors are then computed \nfor all non-occluded\
    \ images in the dataset and all image \ntypes (RGB, IR and HS). The reflectance\
    \ factors for \noccluded images are approximated by averaging the first \nnon-occluded\
    \ images taken before and after the image of \ninterest. If there are no non-occluded\
    \ images before, only \nthe following image is considered. In the worst case,\
    \ this \nprocedure leads to assuming the reflectance factor from \nthe reference\
    \ box image (Fig.  5), where the reflectance \npanel is always fully visible.\n\
    Spectral 3D point cloud generation\nWe combine the information from the color,\
    \ stereo-infra-\nred and hyperspectral images to create spectral point \nclouds\
    \ for each image set. This data structure is funda-\nmental to all further processing\
    \ steps including plant trait \nindicator computation and classification. The\
    \ spectral 3D \npoint cloud stores information about each box on each \nmeasurement\
    \ date in the form of a point cloud, where \neach point is defined by its 3D cartesian\
    \ coordinates w.r.t \nthe left IR camera optical center, RGB colors and spec-\n\
    tral reflectance data. The point clouds are constructed as \nfollows:\n(1)\nfreﬂectance\
    \ = Rpixel\nIpixel\n(2)\nfreﬂectance ≈\nmean\npixel∈Region\n\x1FRpixel\nIpixel\n\
    \x1E\n1. The two infra-red images are used to extract the 3D \nstructure of the\
    \ scene in the form of a point cloud using \nthe stereo processing approach described\
    \ in [42].\n2. Each 3D point in the above point cloud is then asso-\nciated to\
    \ a pixel in the color image by projecting \nits 3D coordinates into the color\
    \ camera using the \nextrinsic camera calibration parameters [43]. The \nRGB values\
    \ of the corresponding pixel can then be \nassociated with the 3D point, producing\
    \ colored \npoint clouds, such as the ones shown in Fig. 9.\n3. A similar procedure\
    \ is followed to project the 3D \npoint into the hyperspectral image, thereby\
    \ associ-\nating the corresponding 25 narrow band reflectance \nvalues with this\
    \ 3D point. These reflectance values \ncan then be used to produce phenotyping\
    \ related \nindex maps (e.g NDVI, NDRE), such as those shown \nin Fig. 10, which\
    \ can be used to follow the develop-\nment of physiology and chemistry (e.g chlorophyll\
    \ \nlevels [44]) within the plants over time.\nVegetation segmentation\nVegetation\
    \ segmentation is an important pre-process-\ning step which effects all derived\
    \ plant trait indicators. \nIn contrast to previous popular approaches where seg-\n\
    mentation is performed using only one modality such as \nthresholding in some\
    \ colour space [45, 46] or based on \nsome index [47], we perform robust segmentation\
    \ using \na combination of color, hyperspectral and spatial cues. \nEmpirically\
    \ determined thresholding criteria for each \nof the three sensing modalities\
    \ were found to provide \nexcellent segmentation quality over the entire range\
    \ of \nillumination conditions, growth stages and plant species \npresent in the\
    \ dataset. All points matching one of the fol-\nlowing criteria were classified\
    \ as vegetation:\nThe Excess Green Index (Eq.  3) is incorporating infor-\nmation\
    \ from the color images, where R, G and B are the \nreflectance of the color channels.\
    \ Equation  4 includes \ninformation from the hyperspectral images by compar-\n\
    ing infrared to red reflectance. Equation  5 adds height \ninformation to include\
    \ points which may be incorrectly \nclassified by the above two criteria due to\
    \ shadows. The \nthree modalities are fused in order to include sufficient \n\
    information from all sources into the segmentation. This \nprocess is depicted\

    \ 15:13 \nRemote trait indicator based stress severity classification\nClassifier\
    \ training methodology\nThe provided dataset contains a total 16 measurement \n\
    dates over the growing period for each of the 30 boxes \nwith different treatments\
    \ listed in Table 1. Since the first \nmeasurement date (day of sowing), does\
    \ not contain any \ngerminated plants, it was removed for this analysis. The \n\
    remaining data was split into a training and test set:- all \nmeasurements pertaining\
    \ to 6 randomly selected boxes \n(20% of the total data) were not available to\
    \ any of the \nclassifiers during training, in order to serve as an inde-\npendent\
    \ and unbiased test set.\nIn order to evaluate the utility of the dataset with\
    \ \nrespect to automated stress inference, we trained clas-\nsification models\
    \ using a variety of commonly used \nmachine learning techniques using the spatio-temporal\
    \ \nspectral feature set listed in Table  2 created from the \nindicator-statistic\
    \ pairs described in section \"Tem-\nporal evolution of plant trait indicators\"\
    . Each feature \n(e.g. Height, Canopy cover, reflectance) was standard-\nized\
    \ by scaling it to zero mean and unit variance across \nthe training set. With\
    \ the time parameter appended, in \nunits of days after sowing (DAS), to the 54\
    \ indicator-\nstatistic pairs after scaling, the input to the models were \n55\
    \ dimensional vectors, with components enumer-\nated in Table 2. Given these input\
    \ vectors, the classifier \nmodels were tasked with predicting the level of sever-\n\
    ity for each of the three stress factors. The different lev-\nels for each of\
    \ the three stress factors, i.e the possible \noutput classes of the classification\
    \ model are listed in \nTable 3. Separate classification models were trained for\
    \ \neach of the 3 stress factors.\nWe employed five-fold cross-validation for\
    \ training the \nclassification models. In k-fold cross-validation, the train-\n\
    ing dataset is randomly separated into k equally sized \nfolds or groups. From\
    \ the k groups, a single group is used \nas the validation set for testing the\
    \ model predictions by \ncomparing them to their true values, and the remaining\
    \ \nk − 1 groups are used as the training data. The process \nis then repeated\
    \ k times, with each of the k groups used \nonce as the validation set. The k\
    \ results can then be aver-\naged to obtain a mean cross validation accuracy.\
    \ Cross \nvalidation allows one to assess the general applicability \nof a classification\
    \ model, by preventing over-fitting on \nthe training data. Furthermore, our classification\
    \ scheme \nwarrants non-uniform misclassification costs, since mis-\nclassifying\
    \ a high nitrogen or weed stress sample as a \nmedium one is more appropriate\
    \ than misclassifying it as \na low one. To take this factor into account we define\
    \ mis-\nclassification cost matrices, as shown in Table 4 for the \nNitrogen and\
    \ Weed stress classifiers.\nClassifier performance evaluation\nWe evaluated several\
    \ machine learning methods, listed in \nTable 5 in order to train the classifiers\
    \ which learn a func-\ntion (mapping) from the input feature vectors (Table 2)\
    \ to \nthe output class (Table 3), i.e predict the level of severity \nfor each\

    at the completion of the experiment. Additionally, the \ndataset also contains\
    \ dry and fresh weights of the above \nground biomass (leaf material). The three\
    \ investigated \nstresses, N deficiency, weed pressure and water limita-\ntion\
    \ had varying impact on the total biomass production \n(Fig. 13). The fresh biomass\
    \ weight at the conclusion of \nthe experiment i.e the sum of both above (shoot)\
    \ and \nbelow (root) ground biomass is used here as a proxy for \nthe yield potential\
    \ since the plants did not reach matu-\nrity. Figure 13a–c depict the variation\
    \ in yield as a func-\ntion of the three stress factors-water, nitrogen and weeds,\
    \ \nrespectively, while the levels of the other stress factors \nwas kept constant\
    \ for each case.\nOne can see the adverse impact of drought stress on \nyield\
    \ in Fig. 13a where the average fresh biomass weight \nper box drops from about\
    \ 2000g to 700g, with sufficient \nNitrogen availability and no weeds present.\
    \ This is in \naccordance with the expectation that water limitation \nreduces\
    \ biomass accumulation in sugar beet [56, 57]. \nFrom Fig.  13b we can observe\
    \ that the medium level \nN treatment was found to be sufficient for the sugar\
    \ \nbeet growth during the two months of the experiment \nreflected by the increase\
    \ in biomass production from \napproximately 900g to above 2000g, for the low\
    \ and \nmedium N fertilization treatment, respectively. On the \nother hand, additional\
    \ N input supplied in the High N \navailability treatment had little yield increasing\
    \ impact. \nThis represents an optimal N supply level, which in \nfield sugar\
    \ beet production is very much related to \nextractable sugar yield, and is compromised\
    \ by both too \nlow and to high N fertilization levels [6, 32, 58]. Low \nweed\
    \ pressure might be tolerated by a sugar beet crop \nbut high weed pressure as\
    \ created in this experiment \nreduces the sugar beet biomass production (Fig. \
    \ 13c). \nUnder field conditions such competition with weeds \nhas also been reported\
    \ to have lead to reduced sugar \nyield [59, 60]. One insight that can be derived\
    \ from \nthese stress reaction plots (Fig.  13a–c) is that under \nthe stress\
    \ conditions established during this experiment, \ndrought stress had the most\
    \ severe impact on fresh bio-\nmass yield, followed by Nitrogen availability and\
    \ then \nweed pressure.\nFigure 13d clearly shows that that under realistic field\
    \ \nconditions, stresses occurring simultaneously interact \nwith each other and\
    \ have a combined effect on bio-\nmass production and yield. These interactions\
    \ make \nthe determination of the individual stresses and their \nseverities using\
    \ remotely sensed data more complex. \nHowever, since different stresses affect\
    \ yield by differ-\nent amounts, having data about how each stress factor \naffects\
    \ yield independently along with the impact of \ncertain combinations should make\
    \ this task computa-\ntionally tractable.\nTemporal evolution of plant trait indicators\n\
    We refer to plant trait indicators as numeric values, rep-\nresenting a spatial\
    \ or spectral property of plants associ-\nated with an image patch, in this case\
    \ of the box. They \nare extracted from the calibrated spectral point clouds \n\
    by taking a statistical measure, such as the mean or var-\niance of the quantity\
    \ of interest over all points labeled \nas vegetation. Examples of useful plant\

    Data \npre-processing and plant trait extraction\", a set of plant \ntrait indicator\
    \ values, listed in Table 6 is extracted from \nthe spectral point clouds. These\
    \ plant trait indicators \ncan be used to monitor the development of the plants\
    \ \nand observe the effect of the different stresses on multi-\nple aspects of\
    \ plant growth (Fig. 14). A variety of effects \nmay be observed from the plots,\
    \ such as:\n• the canopy cover for weed infested boxes is signifi-\ncantly higher\
    \ than the boxes with no weeds and the \nvegetation canopy closes earlier\n• drought\

    \  (2019) 15:13 \nfound using a combination of spatial, spectral and tem-\nporal\
    \ cues. The identification of such plant trait indica-\ntors can be supported\
    \ by using a variety of statistics \nfrom the point clouds, such as those listed\
    \ in Table 7. An \nAnalysis of Variance (ANOVA) procedure may be used to \ndetect\
    \ statistically significant differences, corresponding \nto the stress treatments,\
    \ within these remote trait indi-\ncators. Such analyses are made simple and straightfor-\n\
    ward through the provided dataset and accompanying \nsoftware and may be used\
    \ to find promising indicators \nand their combinations which are indicative of\
    \ particu-\nlar stress factors, which are not only limited to this data-\nset\
    \ but generalize to the field as well. Plant growth is \ntypically faster under\
    \ greenhouse conditions and, higher \nplant density in the boxes than in the field\
    \ results in com-\nparatively faster canopy closure. However, in field trials,\
    \ \nit is typically difficult and expensive to accurately control \nsoil conditions\
    \ such as N availability and water content. \nThe greenhouse dataset, with defined\
    \ nutrient and water \ninputs, provides an ideal test bed to establish and validate\
    \ \nframeworks for determining probable causes of stress \nfrom remotely measured\
    \ data using statistical machine \nlearning tools. Such a framework can then be\
    \ deployed \non the field after data augmentation from conducting \nmuch smaller\
    \ and hence inexpensive field trials.\nImpact of input feature vector modality\
    \ on classifier \nperformance\nFigure  15 shows the impact of input feature modal-\n\
    ity on classification performance for a SVM classifier. \nThe RGB only classifier\
    \ was trained using features that \ncan be extracted using only the color imagery\
    \ (i.e Can-\nopy Cover), the RGB+3D classifier using features from \ncolor and\
    \ stereo infrared imagery (i.e Canopy Cover, \nHeight, Volume), the Hyperspectral\
    \ only classifier was \ntrained on data from the hyperspectral camera (i.e the\
    \ \n25 HS reflectances), the RGB+3D+Hyperspectral clas-\nsifier using features\
    \ from all of the above modalities and \nthe RGB+3D+Hyperspectral+Time classifier\
    \ also had \naccess to the time (in DAS) for each measurement. It can \nbe observed\
    \ that the spatio-temporal spectral combina-\ntion of color imagery, 3D data,\
    \ hyperspectral reflectances \nand time outperform the individual modalities,\
    \ for each \nof the stress factors.\nConclusions and outlook\nIn this work we\
    \ have provided a multi modal framework \nfor systematically studying the effect\
    \ of drought, nitrogen \ndeficiency and weed stress on plant growth. Our frame-\n\
    work includes a dataset containing remotely sensed data \nmeasured in a greenhouse,\
    \ which may also be measured \nwith an unmanned aerial or ground vehicle on the\
    \ field \nas well as associated standard reference measurements \nwhich are typically\
    \ manually measured for evaluation \nand benchmarking. Furthermore, we included\
    \ a pre- \nand post-processing software framework along with the \ndataset which\
    \ includes functionality for radiometric nor-\nmalization, 3D point cloud extraction,\
    \ plant trait extrac-\ntion and machine learning based stress severity level \n\

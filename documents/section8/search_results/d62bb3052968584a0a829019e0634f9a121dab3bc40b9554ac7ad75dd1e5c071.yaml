    Publisher: IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction In the near future, the
    agricultural sector is called to face a significant challenge due to increasingly
    scarce resources, extreme weather conditions, a growing population, and a reduction
    in arable land [1]. Indeed, according to the FAO, by 2050, the world’s population
    will reach about 10 billion and, to be able to feed everyone, we will have to
    produce 70% more food [2], [3]. A practical and feasible solution is to move from
    the old farming concept to smart agriculture, with the adoption of information
    and communications technologies (ICTs) that help farmers to monitor, manage, and
    optimize their operations more effectively [4]. In particular, the introduction
    of the Internet of Things (IoT) applications, every single step of agricultural
    production can be improved: from soil management to minimizing water consumption,
    from plant protection to animal health and farm automation [5], [6]. Smart devices
    located infields are able to collect information and control the evolution of
    the different processes at various production stages. Besides, the miniaturization
    of electronic components allows to implement IoT sensors with reduced form factor
    and energy consumption, monitoring many variables of interest, such as temperature,
    humidity, wind speed and direction, soil conditions, chemical concentrations,
    crop growth, and solar exposure, as well as possible damages caused by drought,
    hail, or flooding. IoT systems integrate all this and other data and turn it into
    useful statistics: for example, predictive analysis allows farmers to use the
    strictly necessary resources (water, pesticides, fertilizers, etc.) and only where
    there is a real need, e.g., for poorly irrigated areas of the field, weak or sick
    plants, etc. [7], [8]. Despite such potential benefits, the deployment of smart
    agriculture systems is still in its infancy. Indeed, an obstacle to the digitization
    of agriculture is the lack or limitations of Internet connectivity in many areas.
    In the literature, several communication protocols have been proposed, with different
    characteristics related to cost, coverage, power consumption, and reliability
    [9]. Among the available technologies (summarized in Fig. 1 in terms of power
    consumption and coverage range), low-power wide-area networks (LPWANs), enlightened
    in a dashed box in Fig. 1 represent the best solution for supporting smart agriculture
    requirements. One of the most adopted LPWAN technology is LoRaWAN, which offers
    wide network coverage, built-in security, low cost, and limited power consumption
    during operation [10]. Fig. 1. Classification of wireless technologies: power
    consumption versus communication range [11]. Show All Indeed, LoRaWAN is an open
    system based on a very robust modulation (called LoRa), which provides several
    interesting features for covering rural areas with simple devices [9]. For such
    reasons, LoRa has been widely employed and tested in the agricultural field, connecting
    environmental sensors measuring temperature, air/soil moisture, etc., or to control
    different kinds of actuators (e.g., irrigation valves), and in applications, such
    as tractor communications, livestock monitoring, and location tracing [12], [13],
    [14]. Differently from existing surveys, which either treat LoRa together with
    all other IoT solutions or consider very specific technological aspects, we consider
    the adoption of these systems from an holistic perspective. For example, LoRa
    is cited in [5] in the general framework of IoT; [7] cites LoRa among the most
    promising technologies for agricultural IoT, and the same plan is followed by
    [8] which dedicated a Section to LoRa in Enabling Communication Technologies;
    similarly [15] includes LoRa in IoT communication protocols suitable for smart
    agriculture. On the other hand, [16] is specific to LoRa but is focused only on
    the protocol performance, [13] takes into consideration only the energy consumption
    of LoRa, [17] discusses the application of the technologies of industry 4.0 in
    the context of smart agriculture. Papers [18] and [19] deal with specific issues
    meaning the decision support system (DSS) and robotics in agriculture, respectively.
    Instead, in this article, we strive to provide a thorough and focused analysis
    on LoRa/LoRaWAN application in smart agriculture, offering a comprehensive view
    of the advancements and in-field applications of this IoT technology. LoRaWAN
    relies on LoRa modulation, a robust chirp-based modulation scheme, patented by
    Semtech [20]. It supports wireless connectivity with limited data rates over large
    areas and without the need of an operator. LoRaWAN is widely used in smart industry,
    smart home, smart city and, increasingly, in the smart agriculture environment.
    In the view of the authors of this article, LoRaWAN possesses five main strengths
    (low-cost, long-range, low-power, no-operator, and unlicensed spectrum) that can
    bridge the gap between smart agriculture and smart cities or industries. Moreover,
    several recent improvements on the resource allocation, channel access protocol,
    and network planning can enhance the efficiency of LoRaWAN networks, reducing
    capital and operational costs [21]. In rural areas, several experiments have demonstrated
    good coverage of LoRa [22], [23], [12]. Coverage ranges of up to 5 and 47 km have
    been obtained in the non-line-of-sight (NLOS) and line-of-sight (LOS) propagation
    conditions, respectively. In addition, in the case of NLOS propagation, the coverage
    range can be increased by using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) [24], [25]. In
    terms of power consumption, LoRa offers up to 15 years of battery life to its
    devices. The low power consumption is a key feature of LoRa that makes it an ideal
    choice for smart agriculture applications. It was demonstrated experimentally
    that the estimated battery lifetime of a LoRa device may be six times that of
    a Wi-Fi device and two times that of a ZigBee device [26]. In this article, we
    provide a broad survey of LoRa-based smart agriculture systems, analyzing the
    state-of-the-art and highlighting for each solution the possible adoption of Machine
    Learning, control automation techniques, and energy autonomy features. We classify
    these works in four main categories: 1) irrigation systems; 2) plantation and
    crop monitoring; 3) tree monitoring; and 4) livestock monitoring. These LoRa systems
    are analyzed in terms of scalability, interoperability, network architecture,
    energy efficiency, and point out some open issues which traverse most of the current
    smart agriculture systems. References have been selected based on recent papers
    dealing with smart agriculture; however, some contributions in different fields
    useful as a benchmark are cited as well. Finally, we present the lessons learned
    and draw future research directions which we think crucial for the success and
    widespread of such technologies. The remainder of this article is structured as
    follows. Section II provides an overview of LoRa technology and its perspectives
    in agriculture, while Section III offers a brief summary on smart agriculture
    applications and their main challenges. Section IV reports on general purpose
    LoRa-based IoT platforms applied to smart agriculture. Section V, instead, discusses
    specific vertical solutions for smart agriculture, according to the four above-mentioned
    categories. Lessons learned and future research directions are proposed in Section
    VI. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section VII. SECTION II. LoRa and Its Perspectives
    in Agriculture LoRa technology is a proprietary physical layer technology patented
    by Semtech, which is revealing as a promising solution for large-scale low-power
    IoT deployments, including smart agriculture applications. Indeed, by operating
    in the unlicensed industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) radio bands and with
    a robust chirp-based modulation scheme, LoRa provides a cheap solution for supporting
    wireless connectivity with limited data rates (from 0.3 to 27 kb/s) in large areas
    and without the need of an operator. Moreover, LoRa transmissions are regulated
    by having a maximum transmission power of 25 mW (14 dBm) in the uplink, a configurable
    bandwidth of 125, 250, or 500 kHz, and a duty cycle of 0.1%, 1.0%, and 10%, which
    permit low energy consumption. In some scenarios, the battery of LoRa devices
    can last up to 15 years. Although LoRa technology is limited to the physical layer,
    different network solutions can be built on top of it, by exploiting its transmission
    interfaces. Among these, the most consolidated one is the open-source solution
    promoted by the LoRa Alliance, which is called LoRaWAN [27]. LoRaWAN networks
    are based on a simple star of star topology (Fig. 2): end-devices (EDs), such
    as sensors or actuators deployed infield, transmit packets on the wireless medium
    to fixed nodes called gateways (GWs), which, in turn, forward the collected packets
    to a central network server (NS) interacting with several application servers
    (ASs) [28]. The network infrastructure between GWs, NS, and ASs is typically based
    on a wired Internet technology, while EDs are not associated to a specific GW,
    which greatly simplifies implementation (e.g., in case of mobility [29]): in case
    a duplicate packet is simultaneously received by multiple GWs, the NS is responsible
    of filtering these packets and performs other simple decisions on network configuration.
    Fig. 2. LoRaWAN typical architecture. Show All To minimize the protocol complexity
    and the energy consumption, LoRaWAN employs a simple Aloha MAC protocol and defines
    three classes of devices (Fig. 3). Device classes represent different ways of
    managing the reception operations performed by the EDs. Class A devices, corresponding
    to the lowest energy profile, can receive downlink packets only in two time windows
    following the transmission of their own packet to the GW. In other words, devices
    can sleep all the time and downlink transmissions are triggered only after an
    uplink one. Class B devices add to this possibility a periodic scheduling of reception
    windows, by keeping a time synchronization with the GW. Finally, class C devices
    are constantly listening to the channel for downlink packets. Any time that a
    new packet is ready for transmission, devices attempt to transmit by randomly
    selecting one of the available channels in the ISM bands (e.g., in the 868 MHz
    there are 16 channels in Europe), together with a modulation parameter called
    spreading factor (SF). More into details, six different SFs are used in LoRa (from
    SF7 to SF12), which result in different symbol times and in almost orthogonal
    transmissions: when two signals modulated at different SFs overlap, the GW is
    able to decode both transmissions in a wide range of power ratios among the signals
    [30]. Unlike many other IoT technologies, the LoRaWAN specification offers dedicated
    end-to-end encryption to application providers, together with network-level security
    primitives, which allow sharing the same network among multitenant applications
    [31]. Fig. 3. LoRaWAN technology stack. Show All Summarizing, the ease of deployment
    with excellent coverage, the availability of devices with very low energy demand,
    and intrinsic security mechanisms make these systems very suitable for innovative
    agriculture applications. Indeed, several state-of-the-art IoT applications in
    smart agriculture are based on LoRa/LoRaWAN networks. For example, LoRa is used
    to connect sensor nodes measuring environmental parameters or to control different
    kinds of actuators (e.g., solenoid valve for irrigation purposes), and in applications
    such as livestock monitoring and location tracing [13], [10], [14]. These applications
    are not critical for data rates and latency, but often require to work in large
    rural areas, with limited access to energy grids and the Internet, and with decision
    mechanisms which benefit from data-driven learning. SECTION III. Smart Agriculture
    Applications and Challenges While industrial production processes have already
    become smarter and autonomous thanks to the implementation of the so called Industry
    4.0 concept, the integration of technologies such as IoT, artificial intelligence
    (AI), robotics, and big data is more recent in agriculture. The availability of
    IoT technologies for supporting wireless connectivity in rural areas and controlling
    infields smart objects shows a great potential for improving the agricultural
    sector, toward the so called smart agriculture [17], [18], [19]. Indeed, farm
    monitoring and automation can make production more efficient and sustainable [7],
    by promptly detecting and reacting to water or moisture stress, wastes of raw
    materials, crops’ diseases, pests, and nutrient deficiencies, as well as problems
    related to the wellbeing of farm animals. The interest on the development of smart
    agriculture applications has been demonstrated by the recent commercialization
    of agricultural sensors and robots (called Agribots), specifically designed for
    reducing the intense physical labor traditionally required in agriculture [15].
    Apart from the availability of smart devices for interacting with the farm in
    the physical world, smart agriculture applications require to build a digital
    representation of the farm status and a decision logic based on the collected
    data. Different protocols can be envisioned both for providing the wireless connectivity
    to heterogeneous devices (from simple low-cost temperature sensors, to complex
    remote-controlled robots) and exporting data for analysis and decisions [32],
    [33]. Since a large amount of data can be produced by agricultural sensors, big
    data analysis can provide efficient monitoring and processing methods [34]. Data
    processing may involve various features such as data loading, validation, aggregation,
    prediction, classification, image or video processing, and data mining. Thus,
    based on the acquired data, DSSs can optimize the productivity and reduce the
    ecological footprint of the farm. Researchers recognize that digitization of farming
    processes and activities is an important challenge for the adoption of smart agriculture
    technologies [32], [35]. In particular, the major challenges to digitization in
    agriculture can be categorized as follows. Communication Issues: As we will detail
    later, large-scale implementations of IoT solutions require robust and secure
    network architectures. The reliability of communicating information still represents
    a challenge to be addressed in the agricultural context and justifies the adoption
    of LoRa/LoRaWAN technologies. Energy Management: The power supply in devices for
    smart agriculture is a significant challenge and energy harvesting systems are
    a relevant area of research. The main issue concerns the sensor’s power supply
    and how to optimize efficiently the power consumption. Moreover, distributed nodes
    can execute some computations (Edge computing) which consumes more energy, while
    sensor batteries have a limited capacity. Consequently, smart devices require
    efficient energy storage and supply. Data/Device Heterogeneity: In general, the
    agricultural data is produced by heterogeneous sensors (soil sensors, weather
    sensors, trunk sensors, leaf sensors, etc.). In addition, IoT devices generally
    use different network protocols and platforms. Thus, in addition to sensors heterogeneity,
    network and protocol heterogeneity should be considered as well. Getting these
    technologies to work together is often an issue, especially for unskilled farmers.
    Physical Deployments: Spatial deployment of devices on farms proves to be a significant
    challenge, especially when the entire farm needs to be monitored across a large
    area and with different application scenarios (soil, plants, trees, animals, etc.).
    Data Management: The difficulty of interpreting the data can be a huge barrier:
    indeed, numerous sensors are necessary and big data analysis could be required
    to better understand and forecast the unpredictability of agricultural ecosystems.
    Generic Platform: To promote the adoption of smart agriculture technologies is
    often required to develop user friendly software platforms. The challenge here
    is to build a universal platform that can be easily modified to support different
    types of monitoring ranging from specific crop to livestock. These challenges,
    together with the cost of infrastructure investment, the complexity of technologies,
    lack of farmers’ education and training, data ownership, and privacy and security
    concerns, has motivated the research and development of innovative platforms,
    specific network technologies, and new architectures for smart agriculture [32],
    [35]. SECTION IV. Generic LoRa-Based Platforms Since agricultural applications
    are widely different, varying from soil and air monitoring, to irrigation automation
    and livestock breeding, several general purpose IoT platforms have been adapted
    for farmers to accommodate all these applications together under a unified, easy
    to understand and simple to use interface. Therefore, in this section, we will
    discuss some of these LoRa-based platforms horizontally designed for smart agriculture,
    while in the next one, we will dig into more vertical and application-specific
    systems, focusing on the four reference scenarios depicted in Fig. 4. Fig. 4.
    Four reference applications in smart agriculture. Show All Generic and open IoT
    platforms can indeed help to digitize farms by integrating numerous agriculture
    applications, harmonizing specific sensing devices, actuators, and decision logics,
    which exhibit heterogeneous requirements in terms of network bandwidth, latency,
    sensors’ complexity, and energy requirements. A clear example is constituted by
    FIWARE [36], a powerful open-source platform, sponsored by the European Commission,
    that provides standardized interfaces for many different IoT sectors including
    agriculture. The FIWARE platform includes several parts called generic enablers
    (GEs), which provide components and reference implementations that support specific
    APIs, and can integrate data collected from heterogeneous sensors using different
    communication technologies, to create custom applications [37], [38]. Several
    GEs are available making it easier to interface with IoT systems, and the IoT
    Agent for LoRaWAN offers a bridge between LoRaWAN and the FIWARE Context Broker
    (the core component of the “Powered by FIWARE” platforms). Moreover, FIWARE can
    be combined with other third-party platforms to provide accessible tools to worldwide
    farmers and consumers too [39]. Another example is the work in [40] where low-cost,
    LoRa-based devices are used for soil temperature and humidity monitoring, and
    the data is processed and sent to the Cayenne IoT Platform for storage and visualization
    [41]. This platform is a drag and drop project builder for developers and engineers
    that can be used in different IoT applications. It encompasses cloud-based web
    applications as well as mobile apps for Android and IOS devices. Cayenne can integrate
    any tool into the library with a wide variety of IoT ready-to-use devices and
    connectivity options. Other LoRaWAN-based IoT platforms are more specific to the
    agricultural world, aiming at improving the management of generic farms in a highly
    customizable way. For example, the LoRaFarM platform [42] has a generally applicable
    “core” infrastructure, which can be completed with specialized ad-hoc modules
    depending on the farm’s characteristics and requirements. The LoRaFarM platform
    derives its topological structure from the LoRaWAN architecture, since low-level
    communication patterns are built around the LoRaWAN technology (see Fig. 5). Hence,
    expansion modules can be added at farm level (or low level), if they include physical
    hardware to be installed in the deployment (sensors or actuators), as well as
    a high level, in case data processing is needed. The middleware, in the LoRaFarM
    domain, refers to the set of entities and technologies by which data coming from
    farm-level modules are collected, stored, and exposed to high-level modules. This
    middleware can be defined as a sort of “connecting layer” between the farm and
    the back-end domain. Fig. 5. LoRaFarM platform: levels and parallelism with LoRaWAN
    [42]. Show All One of the main advantages of the LoRaFarM platform is that heterogeneous
    subnetworks, in terms of capabilities (transmission range, data throughput, and
    energy consumption), can be incorporated without altering the platform structure
    and, thus, making it highly scalable, flexible, and suitable for a wide range
    of scenarios. Indeed, this gives the freedom to choose the most suitable communication
    protocols and traffic policy to monitor and control the farm different areas,
    such as greenhouses and fields. Messages between nodes employing different protocols
    are translated by a multiprotocol GateWay (mpGW), enabling communications between
    non-LoRaWAN-enabled nodes and the LoRaFarM middleware, in a seamless way. Its
    protocol translation functionality, the mpGW can be enriched with edge computing
    features, to process and aggregate sensor data. Moreover, LoRaFarM can be extended
    with new functionalities like data analysis and prediction of the evolution of
    environmental parameters to prevent plant diseases, relying on AI and Machine
    Learning techniques. Finally, the mySense environment proposed by Silva et al.
    [58] is a sensor data integration framework aimed to systematize data acquisition
    procedures to address common smart agriculture issues. It facilitates the use
    of low cost platforms such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi, making available a set
    of free tools based on the do it yourself (DIY) concept. The mySense platform
    builds over a 4-layer technological structure (sensor nodes, crop field and sensor
    networks, cloud services and front-end applications) and is accordingly divided
    into four levels of operation: Level 1, for data collection using common data
    transfer technologies (ZigBee, GSM/GPRS, LoRa, etc.); Level 2, for GWs (possibly)
    running local tasks according to the fog or edge computing paradigms; Level 3
    for storing data in the cloud; and Level 4 for high-level applications. Data can
    arrive from any device provided that complies with the data formats allowed by
    the platform. Summary and Insights: This Section discussed LoRa-based platforms
    which can be exploited to unify different applications into one simple and easy-to-use
    platform. Platforms such as Fiware, Cayenne, LoRaFarM, and mySense provide standardized
    interfaces to integrate different agricultural applications with each other. These
    platforms provide ready-to-use solutions and connectivity between heterogeneous
    networks. With these platforms, LoRa can integrate and complement existing systems
    based on other network technologies (ZigBee, Bluetooth, etc.), making them highly
    scalable. SECTION V. Application-Specific LoRa Platforms In this section, we provide
    an in-depth review focusing four reference scenarios: 1) irrigation systems; 2)
    plantation and crop monitoring; 3) tree monitoring; and 4) livestock monitoring,
    which broadly cover most of smart agriculture applications. A. Irrigation Systems
    Accurate monitoring of the soil water status allows to achieve seasonal water
    savings of up to 90% compared to traditional management, increasing productivity
    and introducing significant savings in energy costs for the water pumps management
    [59]. To improve water management in agriculture, it is necessary to analyze and
    monitor the complex water interactions that occur in field, following the concept
    of soil-plant-atmosphere (SPA) continuum systems [60]. Indeed, the knowledge of
    the water status of the SPA system plays a significant role for understanding
    the crop water stress and implement water saving mechanisms with a minimal effect
    on the production [59]. Measuring the evapotranspiration (ET), which refers to
    the amount of water that passes from the soil into the air due to the combined
    effect of plant transpiration and evaporation, is another complex task. Examples
    of these sensors are the lysimeters or sophisticated micro-meteorological sensors
    (e.g., Eddy covariance), whose cost and complexity limit their application to
    research studies [61]. Cheaper systems are the time domain reflectometry (TDR)
    technique or gravimetric methods [62], whose main limit is the difficulty in calibration
    and automation. Some LoRa-based irrigation systems are implemented using development
    boards such as Arduino, ESP32, Pycom, or STM32, e.g., [43], [44], [47], [48],
    [46], and [51]. Few of them also include energy harvesting modules, such as an
    hydroelectric generator, allowing them to operate for decades. For example, the
    LoRaWAN-based irrigation system in [51] comprises an energy-neutral irrigation
    node (Fig. 6) with the following modules: controller module, power module, irrigation
    module, and transmitter module. Fig. 6. Energy-neutral irrigation node described
    in [51]. Show All Exploiting AI and data coming from different sensor, such as
    air temperature and humidity, soil temperature and humidity, light intensity,
    etc. makes possible to develop and train specific irrigation models to calculate
    the exact amount of water to be distributed. For example, the works [54], [55],
    [56] provide machine-learning-based smart irrigation systems, all employing LoRa
    technology. In particular, in [55], a random forest classifier predicts the soil
    moisture and, thus, irrigation is planned accordingly. In [54], instead, multiple
    linear regression algorithm is employed to train the model using two highest correlation
    coefficient features: 1) light intensity and 2) soil humidity. Data is collected
    with a LoRa P2P network, which uses a master–slave and TDMA-based MAC protocol.
    Each slave node has a unique address and can transmit a packet in each of the
    reserved TDMA time slots. Alternatively, a Penman-Monteith-based irrigation model
    allows for an optimal irrigation strategy for different crop growth periods and
    uses the ET parameter to estimate the amount of water [63]. This solution requires
    an integration of actuators, sensors and a meteorological station in a LoRa network
    [49], [50]. In addition, third-party services such as weather information or fog
    computing may be needed to decide on irrigation schedules [57]. Since in LoRaWAN,
    the latency of downlink communication from GW to Class-A nodes (sensors or actuators)
    is relatively long (must first wait for an uplink transmission), few systems employ
    alternative Master/Slave protocols [52], [53], [54]. These protocols increase
    the stability of the LoRa irrigation system, avoiding packet collisions and, thus,
    can save water during the close command of the solenoid valve. Finally, AREThOU5A
    [43] is an example of a water management system that combines data collected from
    wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in the field and satellite data provided by international
    weather forecast services, to achieve efficient water usage strategies for farmers.
    It employs a WSN with two different sensors for measuring the temperature and
    the soil moisture in field. A routing subsystem controls and routes the data and
    information through LoRaWAN and TCP/IP with SSL network interfaces. The LoRa network
    is used to collect data from the EDs and perform administration processes, while
    the TCP/IP SSL works as a bridge to the rest of the network architecture. Summary
    and Insights: Comparing the characteristics of different irrigation systems, summarized
    in Table I, it is relevant to note that most of these LoRa-based irrigation systems
    adopt temperature, humidity, and soil moisture sensors. However, albeit all cited
    papers are recently published, ML is used only in 1/3 of the applications. TABLE
    I LoRa-Based Irrigation System Comparison Furthermore, only 13% of these irrigation
    systems used an evapotranspiration-based methodology. This strategy, which is
    often expensive, may be accomplished by combining inexpensive sensors and AI (with
    a more comprehensive approach integrating meteorological variables measured by
    a weather station with variables measured by soil sensors into the system), significantly
    lowering the cost of direct evapotraspiration measurements. Such improvements
    could lead to more effective water management, with the simultaneous impact of
    decreasing water usage and increase crop output. Finally, LoRaWAN communications
    can be tuned to adapt the duty cycle and manage the system optimally: for example,
    when the irrigation system is not in use, sensor data could be collected every
    hour or even less, while when irrigation is taking place the measurements could
    be increased to every 5–10 min. This way, the use of water and energy could be
    further reduced [71]. B. Plantation and Crop Monitoring Plantation and crop monitoring
    requires a large number of sensors to obtain an effective control and, thus, increase
    productivity, especially when agricultural fields are very heterogeneous. For
    example, in order to optimize the production while minimizing the ecological footprint,
    it is necessary to control the injection of pesticides and fertilizers [72], [73],
    increasing yields up to 10% and saving fertilizers up to 37% [74]. Such control
    can be performed by varying the pesticides and fertilizer application rate over
    time and space. Crops do not always need a uniform application, as some areas
    have different requirements due to their location (sunlight, soil features, etc).
    Over-fertilization can deteriorate water quality, favor weed growth, and reduce
    profit. Vice-versa under-fertilization restricts yield or reduces crop quality
    [75]. The application rate can be modified based on weather impacts, nutrient
    availability, and seasonal cycles [73], [75]. Some optical or ultrasonic sensors
    indirectly assess the nutrient request (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, etc.)
    of the crop at the time of application [72]. In addition, to reduce the loss of
    productivity in crops, surveillance systems can be adopted [76]. Providing visual
    monitoring to growers can prevent crops from getting damaged by intruders, ensure
    the field conditions or enable the detection of pests attacks remotely. Although
    there are plenty of devices which can be exploited for building a real-time visual
    monitoring system, deploying them in a wide area and over wireless channels can
    be challenging [77], [78], [79]. Table II summarizes the main characteristics
    of several plantation and crop monitoring systems, based on LoRa technology. The
    nodes used in these systems should be of small dimensions, self-sufficient in
    terms of energy, relatively cheap, and often able to acquire a large variety of
    parameters. For example, three different sensor nodes have been developed by Valente
    et al. [64] and tested in a vineyard field: node 1, with an ultrasonic anemometer
    (that measures the direction and speed of the wind) and a sensor that monitors
    bulk electrical conductivity, in addition to volumetric water content (by measuring
    soil permittivity) and soil and air temperature; node 2, an irrometer watermark
    soil water tension sensor; and node 3, an all-in-one weather station with 12 sensors
    to measure air temperature, relative humidity, vapor pressure, barometric pressure,
    wind speed, gust and direction, solar radiation, precipitation, lightning strike
    counter, and distance. It should be remarked that each node contains sensors which
    differ for the sampling rate, accuracy, and supplied energy. The nodes send data
    using LoRaWAN to a GW that is connected to a the things network (TTN) server.
    In the TTN server, data is decoded and sent to the ThingSpeak [80] platform for
    visualization and possible analysis and aggregation. Fig. 7 summarizes the different
    blocks composing the nodes: 1) a maximum power point tracker (MPPT) applied to
    a photovoltaic source and connected with a storage system; 2) a dc/dc switching
    converter to interface the source with the storage system and loads; 3) the LoRaWAN
    module for communication; and 4) the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) module
    to convert the signals available from sensors. TABLE II LoRa-Based Plantation
    and Crop Monitoring System Comparison Fig. 7. Block diagram of the sensor nodes
    taken from [64]. Show All In [66] a LoRa-based IoT monitoring system for starfruit
    plantation is presented. The LoRa network implemented includes three nodes and
    one master, and it can cover a range of 700 m. For optimal growth, starfruit plants
    need soil pH conditions between 5.5–7.5. Thus, thanks to the proposed LoRa system,
    the farmers can make important and precise decisions about how to grow the crop.
    Similarly, works [65], [67], [68], [69], [58] present solutions to increase production
    and fruit quality, with optimal use of resources through LoRa-based networks.
    The Smart Mushroom Cultivation is a system used to automatize the production of
    expensive mushrooms [67]. The smart system includes devices to monitor and control
    humidity and C O 2 levels through sensors and actuators all connected using LoRaWAN.
    The sensor nodes measure the ambient condition inside Mushroom House (humidity,
    temperature, and C O 2 ), and data is sent to the remote server for monitoring
    and analysis. An automatic control maintains the ambient conditions between the
    required levels. Finally, there are cases where anomaly detection near the sensor
    is required to allow decisions and actions as soon as possible. In this direction,
    Brunelli et al. [70] proposed a new paradigm of monitoring and pest detection
    to improve the performance of an apple orchard. They add intelligence to the LoRa
    nodes, shifting the detection of anomalies near the sensor. The application is
    developed on a low-energy platform powered by a solar panel, realizing an energy-autonomous
    system capable of operating unattended continuously over LoRa networks. Summary
    and Insights: Plantation and crop monitoring requires the control of numerous
    parameters, captured by different heterogeneous sensors deployed in the agricultural
    fields. Some of the sensors used in the cited papers are specific to the type
    of crop, while others (e.g., temperature, humidity, etc.) are deployed in almost
    all of the literature works. In addition, the use of AI is not yet widely adopted,
    and only three out of nine papers adopt automatic control for the implementation
    of DSSs. An innovative approach in this context would be to add intelligence to
    the LoRa nodes, while moving the DSS closer to the sensor. Finally, note that
    the maximum size of the LoRa payload is 250 bytes; this allows a wide variety
    of parameters to be monitored and transferred in a single packet. For example,
    Sacaleanu and Kiss [69] send eight agri-meteorological measurements in a single
    LoRa packet of only 16 bytes. C. Tree Monitoring Trees are essential in modern
    society and are widely applied in a great number of scenarios including soil erosion
    prevention, air purification, wood or fruit production. For supporting the managers
    of urban/rural green infrastructures and forests, it is important to constantly
    monitor the tree conditions, in terms of growth rate and failure risk, as well
    as micro-climate parameters in the tree surrounding areas. The analysis of this
    data allows the characterization of the trees functional responses to their environment
    and a prompt action in case of problems. Tree monitoring also requires reliable
    long-range communications in the presence of foliage, large sensor densification
    (i.e., one sensor per tree), and measurements of various physiological/biological
    parameters from specific locations (at the root, the trunk, or the branch) as
    a function of vegetation type to obtain accurate readings [83]. In these systems,
    it is also important to measure changes in position over time or instantaneous
    trunk accelerations. Table III summarizes the main characteristics of relevant
    Monitoring systems. TABLE III LoRa-Based Sensors Applications in Tree Farms One
    of the main properties to be measured is the water transport in the xylem of the
    trunk (called the sap flow). A possible measurement method is the Heat Balance
    Method, developed by Granier [91], [92], which is based on analyzing the temperature
    difference among two probes inserted into the stem wood at a 10 cm distance along
    the vertical trunk axis. The probe in the higher position is heated, while the
    lower one provides the stem wood reference temperature. The temperature difference
    generated between the probes represents an index of the transpiration activity
    of the plant, expressed as a variation of the flux density. This method can be
    used for accurate measurements of sap flow in plants, providing a reliable calibration
    procedure to relate the temperature difference to the actual sap flow [93]. For
    example, the TreeTalker (TT) [81] is a device that measures sapflow (water transport
    in the trunk), wood temperature and humidity, multispectral signature of light
    transmitted through the canopy, tree trunk radial growth, accelerations along
    a 3-D coordinate system used to detect tree movements, air temperature, and relative
    humidity, which can be additionally complemented by soil temperature and volumetric
    water content. A TT node is connected via LoRa wireless connection to a GW, that
    manages up to 48 devices in one cluster. The GW is, in turn, connected to the
    Internet via GPRS and sends data to a computer server. This technology can be
    applied to monitor the root plate tilt, as well as the flexion and the accelerations
    that tree trunks receive under the force of the wind for the evaluation of tree
    failure risk. Another solution to analyze the health condition of a tree consists
    on the electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), it is a well-known technique with
    a wide range of applications. EIS has been applied to characterize solids, liquids,
    both in the laboratory and industrial environments. Moreover, assessment of physiological
    states of some trees (pinus, chestnut, etc.) has also been studied. The method
    based on bioimpedance indexes allows determining three distinct physiological
    states: healthy and watered plants, plants with a high level of hydric stress,
    and plants with disease [94], [95], [96]. For example, Amaro et al. [82] integrated
    an EIS system in a sensor node to analyze the health condition of the tree and
    transfer the results through the LoRaWAN protocol. Finally, tree monitoring systems
    are often influenced by the presence of foliage which can severely impact wireless
    communication systems performance. This generally leads to node densification
    to increase coverage levels, especially in large areas, resulting in additional
    costs and constraining the design of LoRa systems in nonhomogeneous vegetation
    environments [84], [85], [97]. For such reasons, a small drone with a GW is sometimes
    required for collecting data from nodes and solving the Fresnel zone radio propagation
    issues encountered in tree farms [98], [86]. Summary and Insights: In this section,
    some methodologies for monitoring tree health have been discussed. It is important
    to highlight how LoRa can be easily integrated into these systems, e.g., to measure
    the lymph flow or bio-impedance of trees. In case the parameter to be monitored
    involves roots, it has been shown that LoRa can be used for under-ground or near-ground
    communications too [12], [99]. Finally, the use of drones for data collection
    has been exploited to solve the problem of foliage scattering. D. Livestock Monitoring
    System Smart livestock practices aim at improving the productive and reproductive
    parameters, feeding and handling of feces, producing a direct effect on the increment
    of the farmers’ income, and also better milk and meat production [100]. The implementation
    of these practices requires to monitor the general health conditions of the animals,
    by tracking some biological signals to be associated to symptoms of disease, estrus
    and calving [101]. Wearable sensor technologies provide the possibility of remotely
    managing individual animals facilitating urgent interventions, responding to time
    and labor-intensive concerns in a more efficient way [87]. In extensive livestock
    production systems, the absence of access to networking and animal contact presents
    a barrier to the effective use of these technologies. Wearable sensors, to be
    more practical for extensive management settings, must: 1) network over longer
    distances; 2) have reliable power supplies (preferably renewable); 3) be low-cost
    so that damaged and lost sensors are less economically impactful; and 4) transmit
    data in real time. For these reasons, LoRaWAN technology is indicated for above
    described applications, some of which are summarized in Table IV. Primarily, these
    systems are used to monitor the animal health, but by integrating LoRa technology
    with a GPS, remote grazing systems can be implemented [87], [88]. TABLE IV LoRa-Based
    Sensor Applications in Livestock Monitoring Animal monitoring can involve completely
    different scenarios; as a consequence, the LoRa network architecture could require
    a more specific design effort to work either in indoor or outdoor settings. For
    example, the work in [89] proposes two different versions of GWs: an indoor GW,
    designed for installation in sheltered areas such as barns and cowsheds and oriented
    toward dairy cattle livestock scenarios, and an outdoor version, more specific
    for open areas such as paddocks and pasture lands, and designed for beef cattle
    livestock scenarios. The indoor GW is conceived for monitoring several important
    physical parameters typical of the shed environment, such as temperature, relative
    humidity, illuminance, carbon dioxide (C O 2 ) , and ammonia (N H 3 ) concentration,
    while the main purpose of the outdoor GW is to manage nodes in remote areas, far
    from the shed, directly on the pasture land. In the open field scenario, weather
    parameters (temperature and humidity) are collected, for purposes of correlation
    with the animal health status. Moreover, in the presence of large herds, the high
    node density could cause an increase in collisions between sent packets. In such
    scenarios, a MAC layer that includes a listen-before-talk (LBT) mechanism could
    prevent as much as possible packet collisions among nodes. Indeed, LBT-based carrier-sense
    multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) can be incorporated with the
    physical layer of LoRa [89]. The CA mechanism is based on a random retransmission
    time that randomizes the access of the nodes to the wireless medium. The size
    of the pasture area is another factor to consider in deploying the LoRaWAN network.
    In particular, it has been shown that in large areas of pasture, the use of a
    mobile GW that moves along the track is a better solution than the use of one
    or more static GWs [90]. Contrarily, when the livestock area is not too large,
    using only one static GW is preferable because the data extraction rate value
    is high enough and the energy consumption is lower compared to multiple static
    GWs or one mobile GW. The instance of cattle monitoring in New Mexico, as described
    by Actility [102], is one of the successful illustrations of a large-scale LoRaWAN-enabled
    deployment. Due to the large size of these desert ranches (10000–20000 hectares)
    and the large number of cows to track (up to 7000), monitoring and obtaining information
    regarding cattle wellbeing can be time consuming and expensive. Indeed, while
    the cattle were previously followed using traditional GPS devices, the absence
    of reliable cellular connection throughout the whole grazing region made this
    method ineffective. These issues were solved with an off-the-shelf LoRaWAN solution
    because of its extensive range and good coverage. Finally, LoRa technology can
    be used for sharing the short text messages and voice messages in the absence
    of cellular coverage. For example, COWShED [103] is used for supporting livestock
    transhumance in Senegal. Summary and Insights: In this section, we showed how
    LoRa is used to collect information about the movements and health of livestock,
    as well as on the conditions of grassland. LoRa can also aid herders in achieving
    remote grazing by combining data with electronic fences, to identify whether animals
    have crossed it. In addition, LoRa has been used to monitor environmental parameters
    of barns, demonstrating how this technology can be adopted in both outdoor and
    indoor scenarios. Additionally, innovative MAC schemes, such as LBT method could
    be implemented to minimize packet collisions when big herds present, and to mitigate
    the limits on the effective duty cycle of channel occupation. Finally, in the
    absence of cellular coverage, LoRa/LoRaWAN solutions have been used for large-scale
    cattle monitoring or even supporting livestock transhumance for text/voice messages.
    SECTION VI. Lessons Learned and Open Issues This Section discusses the lessons
    learned and the open research challenges for using LoRa technology in smart agriculture.
    According to the aim of this article, it was learned that, given the wide variety
    of sensors used in smart farming systems, different communication protocols need
    to be integrated, particularly when different platforms/vendors coexist and data
    must be collected from the various subsystems. In addition, since power supplies
    are frequently unavailable in a large agricultural area, nodes should be as energy
    self-sufficient as possible. Using local or edge data processing could mitigate
    this problem, optimizing the energy consumption. Moreover, keeping the logic on
    the Edge of the network could alleviate the hurdle on LoRa’s centralized communications
    (especially on the downlink). The development of interoperability in smart agriculture
    systems can also be accelerated by platforms such as FIWARE and Cayenne, while
    machine learning can be used to model and analyze technical problems, improving
    scalability of LoRa networks and predicting network congestion. The experience
    gained in Industry 4.0 can be transferred to agriculture, considering some peculiarities,
    including the need to cover large spaces that cannot be manned. In addition, there
    is the need to provide device power supply and data security (partially solved
    by leveraging on LoRaWAN built-in security schemes). Another significant factor
    is the initial cost of the system, which must be as low as possible since the
    pay-back time also depends on elements that cannot be predicted during the year,
    such as weather. Finally, it has been recognized that although ICT has long-term
    sustainability issues to be solved, they show great potential for improving the
    usage of natural resources, especially when cyber–physical systems (CPSs) are
    combined with IoT, AI, machine learning, and neuromorphic computing techniques
    [104]. Through the study carried out in this article, it is also possible to understand
    in which area LoRa has been applied and is emerging in recent years. In particular,
    among the application areas discussed in Section V, Fig. 8 shows in a pie chart
    that more than 40% of the analyzed studies focus on water management, while almost
    25% are dedicated on crop monitoring, followed by tree monitoring. This result
    is in line with recent market surveys on LPWANs (e.g., [105]), and other general
    studies on communications protocols for smart agriculture [9]. Fig. 8. Distribution
    of the LoRa papers according to smart agriculture application areas. Show All
    All this confirms the great potential of implementing smart agriculture solutions
    using IoT, and LoRa technology in particular. However, there are still some open
    issues that need to be faced: for example, LoRaWAN works quite well in uplink
    when it needs to collect data from sensors, while downlink connections might suffer
    high latency. In what follows, we briefly discuss future research directions related
    to downlink latency, energy management, device heterogeneity and interoperability,
    data management, and scalability. These open issues must be solved for LoRa systems
    to be widely adopted in smart agriculture. We conclude the Section with an eye
    on other wireless technologies, different from LoRa/LoRaWAN. A. LoRa Downlink
    Performance The downlink performance of LPWAN systems still represents a challenge
    since it is related to the energy consumption. In particular, LoRaWAN allows different
    tradeoffs between communication latency on the downlink channel and energy consumption.
    Nodes are classified by classes: they can receive only after an uplink transmission
    (Class A), or at regular time intervals (Class B), or at any time (Class C). The
    modern trend is to optimize energy efficiency, hence, data are transmitted only
    when necessary or periodically. According to the authors’ opinion, a further optimization
    could be retrieved by local data processing. As a matter of fact, even if nodes
    remain asleep most of the time, as in [57], or with scheduling intervals of reception
    windows of 10–20 min as in [48] and [50] or a few hours [58], local processing
    always lowers the data to be transmitted decreasing the transmission time; it
    has been successfully tested in [42] where edge processing on the GW allows a
    more effective control of the actuator nodes. This last approach improves also
    reliability since it allows farms to work even if the Internet connection of the
    LoRa GW is absent for a few hours. Reliability can also be improved by a Master/Slave
    access control method for the LoRa network [52], [53], [54]. Alternatively, for
    short-range communication, a Wake-up Radio (WuR) can be adopted. WuR technology
    is an ultralow-power receiver that is continuously listening to the channel while
    spending a few nanowatts or microwatts depending on the circuit’s design. WuRs
    work in parallel to the main LoRa transceiver and allow asynchronous wake-up of
    the nodes with low latency. With the LoRa-WuR scheme, the downlink latency can
    be reduced by almost 90% compared to the traditional LoRa protocol for a ten nodes
    cluster [106], [107]. B. Energy Efficiency Considerations In addition to downlink
    communication performance just explained, the energy consumption in an agricultural
    ED can include turning on booster pumps or solenoid valves, activating sensors
    over a long period, use of GPS and data transmission, etc. Nodes should be autonomous
    as much as possible since usually power supplies are not available in a wide agricultural
    area. Besides, the use of batteries needs to minimize disposal costs and pollution.
    Providing solutions to avoid the use of batteries by harvesting energy from the
    environment would encourage the deployment of wireless devices in smart agriculture.
    The use of different energy sources, such as solar energy, piezoelectricity, thermal,
    wind, water, and radiofrequency is consolidated [108]. However, making a device
    completely energy-neutral requires a thorough analysis of power consumption in
    different working states [109]. One facilitation is the availability of a renewable
    energy source as in [51]; on the other hand, a high energy consumption due to
    the heating of one probe as in [91] requires a different design or the remote
    monitoring of the energy available or harvested as in [110]. It is evident that
    there are many factors that influence the analysis of offering-demanding energy,
    it varies on a case-by-case basis and does not lend itself to systematic analysis;
    on the other hand, in this context, machine learning algorithms can give a significant
    contribution. Infact, the ML approach has been already successfully applied in
    different contexts allowing to implement an efficient renewable energy selection
    based on the geographic location [111], or to retrieve a good energy prediction
    [112]. An application example is given by the energy-neutral system for pest detection
    [70] which takes advantage of ML algorithms. C. Heterogeneity and Interoperability
    Smart agriculture systems are quite heterogeneous in terms of sensors and, in
    some cases, it is also required to integrate different communication technologies,
    e.g., when multiple platforms coexist and data arrives from different subsystems.
    LoRa platforms are used with ZigBee to implement hybrid communications managing
    different sensors clusters or with the IEEE 802.11s-based system to build a mesh
    networking architecture. The path for the integration of different technologies,
    such as cloud, IoT, and software-defined networking, with AI is proposed in [113]
    with the related challenges and opportunities. Assuring communications in heterogeneous
    smart agriculture systems is a critical issue that has been studied for example
    in [114], where LoRa and ZigBee hybrid communications are implemented. Precisely,
    two LoRa sensor clusters and two ZigBee sensor clusters are used and combined
    with two ZigBee-to-LoRa converters to communicate in a network managed by a LoRa
    GW. The token ring protocol in the ZigBee network and polling mechanism in the
    LoRa network is used. The system can work with a packet loss rate of less than
    0.5% when the communication distance is 630 m for the ZigBee network and 3.7 km
    for the LoRa network. An hybrid LoRa/IEEE 802.11s-based mesh networking architecture
    is proposed in [115], where an effective network protocol selection mechanism
    is developed to choose the right interface. Protocol selection is based on multiple
    parameters, including network communication interface type, GNSS position of the
    APs, RSSI of nearby nodes, type and amount of data to be transmitted. Large data
    to be transferred in a short time can rely on the IEEE 802.11s-based network while
    small data can be transmitted through a LoRa-based mesh network. Platforms such
    as FIWARE [116], Cayenne [41] and mySense [58], discussed in Section IV, can also
    give a push to achieve interoperability in the smart agriculture systems. The
    above described solutions can benefit of an “industry 4.0”-based approach where
    the integration of different protocols cooperate to address the needs of automating
    computing and technology processes [113], [18]. D. Machine Learning and Big Data
    Management The integration of big data analysis with machine learning can provide
    predictions about future outcomes, such as fruit quality or detect crops’ diseases
    using historical data, analytical techniques, and statistical modeling [117].
    The benefits of ML in the agriculture are relevant [118]. However, the deployment
    of models is the most challenging step to bring the ML algorithms in the production
    fields, and thanks to its advantages, LoRa technology could make a big contribution
    to taking this step. Collected data can be used to implement an intelligent system
    capable of supporting the identification of varieties and predicting the quality
    of the final product [64]. In fact, exploiting ML, the data can be used by the
    biologists to develop crop models and perform disease prediction [68]. The agricultural
    industry produces a large amount of data collected by heterogeneous sensors, so
    best practices should include the mechanisms to reduce the memory and time for
    data analysis. Thus, to pursue such objectives, edge computing models are also
    applied [119]. Distributed data process, such as MapReduce [120], may avoid bottlenecks
    when transferring all data to a single server, as in [121] where the proposed
    method adopts smart sensors to measure the soil quality indicators, while the
    preelaborated data is transmitted using the LoRaWAN protocol. The Apache Spark
    environment is then used to implement a parallel algorithm for statistical models
    based on the soil indicator data obtained from the experimental field. E. LoRa
    Scalability and Network Improvement As concerns scalability, some open points,
    shared with general applications, are recognized. For this reason, most of the
    reference literature does not directly address issues related to agriculture.
    Indeed, scalability is a key feature in LoRa networks due to its long-range and
    large number of devices can concurrently reach a given GW. The network scales
    quite well if dynamic transmission parameters are used, in combination with multiple
    sinks. However, the correct behavior of the NS is not easy to be evaluated [122].
    In fact, the NS presents some challenges from the point of view of its optimization,
    such as processing duplicate packets or packets from other networks, or bringing
    down the entire network in case of Internet connection loss. LoRa networks are
    bound by strict legal requirements, particularly where no LBT schemes are utilized.
    The transmission duty cycle (TDC) regulates the ISM bands to determine the maximum
    time that the band can be occupied, typically bounded to 1%. This implies that
    devices may not occupy the ISM band for more than 36 s per hour, forbidding the
    transmission of new packets when this limit is attained [123]. Machine learning
    can be applied to model and analyze technical problems, improving the scalability
    of LoRa networks and predicting network congestion [124]. Further developments
    could include enhanced ADR mechanisms, optimization of GW locations, and interference
    cancelation techniques [125]. Finally, some challenges remain such as the widespread
    adoption of multihop communications in LoRaWAN. Literature has shown that multihop
    or mesh topologies can extend the coverage of LoRaWAN networks and improve energy
    efficiency in certain scenarios [126]. These solutions propose intermediate nodes
    to forward messages to other EDs to extend the coverage. Other open points include
    the use of GWs as intermediate nodes, GW-to-GW communications, and practical large-scale
    deployment of LoRaWAN mesh networks. F. Other Communication Technologies The choice
    of a specific communication technology is central to the performance of IoT-based
    agricultural applications. Other than LoRa, many standards for wireless communications
    can be employed, including Bluetooth, ZigBee, Z-Wave, RFID, Sigfox, and NB-IoT.
    Some of them work well in the short-range (within 100 m), while others are more
    useful to cover long distances (up to tens of kilometers). Examples of the former
    are Bluetooth, ZigBee, Z-Wave, and passive and active RFID systems, while in the
    latter, standards are Sigfox and NB-IoT (and LoRa of course). As discussed previously,
    the deployment of a massive number of IoT devices might cause interference problems
    especially for technologies using the unlicensed spectrum, such as ZigBee, Wi-Fi,
    Sigfox, and LoRa. On the other hand, IoT devices operating with a licensed spectrum
    eliminate interference problems but might increase costs significantly. Several
    papers have analyzed different aspects of wireless communication protocols for
    smart agriculture, studying possible applications and comparing their performance.
    For example, ZigBee-based smart agriculture systems are described in [127], [128],
    [129], [130], and [131]. The biggest challenges for ZigBee networks are the limited
    range and increased power consumption (compared to LPWANs) and relatively low
    data rate (e.g., compared to BLE or WiFi). Therefore, ZigBee is better suited
    for small-scale scenarios [130], while the use of this protocol is not suitable
    when the agricultural area is vast and the distance between sensor nodes is large.
    On the other hand, the works [132], [133], [134], [135] represent successful examples
    of NB-IoT applications in smart agriculture. Indeed, extensive coverage, adaptable
    power consumption (depending on the mode of operation), and low interference among
    nodes, are features that make NB-IoT an interesting protocol for various agricultural
    systems [136]. However, NB-IoT employs licensed frequency channels, which results
    in higher subscription prices for the associated system even if it offers a higher
    data throughput than LoRa. Moreover, when there is an existing LTE infrastructure
    already in place, the need for hardware update may be another source of expense
    for such a system. This might be a drawback in the context of smart agriculture
    if the projected return on investment is not high enough to cover these costs
    [137]. Overall, the choice of the communication technology in smart agriculture
    needs to consider many factors and requirements, such as support for roaming,
    suitability of technology to small-scale, medium-scale, and large-scale deployments,
    geographical location, costs, etc. For example, it has been shown that Sigfox
    and LoRaWAN excel on network capacity, battery lifetime, and cost, whereas NB-IoT
    achieves higher quality of service and lower latency [27]. Finally, while LoRaWAN
    has been considered the most suitable communication network for IoT in smart agriculture
    [16], it is still difficult to tell which technology will dominate the market,
    or if several technologies will coexist, perhaps specializing on different application
    domains. SECTION VII. Conclusion Although the expected transition to smart agriculture
    has already begun, researchers around the world are still looking for new solutions
    to improve agricultural productivity through IoT architectures. Indeed, albeit
    applications in agriculture can benefit from the experience gained in Industry
    4.0, they require specific knowledge regarding sensor management, energy optimization,
    and data processing. LoRa technology is widely adopted, as it allows building
    an autonomous network that meets some of the requirements of the smart agriculture,
    such as low-power and long-range communication. The adoption of LoRa-based systems
    in agriculture results in an effective way to improve the connectivity of farms,
    encourage the deployment of DSSs and consequently improve their management, leading
    the agricultural sector toward smart agriculture. In order to provide a more focused
    and comprehensive view of the applications in the field, in this article, we restricted
    our focus to LoRa/LoRaWAN technology and its uses in the context of smart agriculture.
    We presented many LoRa applications in the field, and we discussed some open issues
    and research areas for future improvements. The main challenges analyzed using
    LoRa Technology in smart agriculture, are: latency on the downlink channel, energy
    management, heterogeneity and interoperability of the devices, data management,
    and scalability. All of these can benefit from the use of machine learning algorithms.
    Indeed, AI and edge computing are still scarcely used but related algorithms and
    technologies are now mature and may be successfully applied in this field. Finally,
    the optimization of multiple GW locations and multihop topologies to extend the
    coverage of LoRa networks have been recently tested to further improve the performance
    and coverage. NOTE Open Access funding provided by ‘Università degli Studi di

    The global food system is currently under pressure due to rising population, economic
    growth, land degradation, and increased demand for animal-based products (Keating
    et al., 2014; Lal, 2013). For example, global food production needs to be increased
    by about 70% to ensure food security for an estimated world population of more
    than 9.7 billion people in 2050 (Cole et al., 2018; FAO, 2017). Further, climate
    change is projected to affect global food production and efforts to increase food
    productivity. Notably, crop production across the globe has already experienced
    negative effects from warming temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns,
    and increased extreme weather events (IPCC, 2022; Paudel et al., 2014). This will
    likely be exacerbated by climate change in the future (Hasegawa et al., 2021;
    Lobell et al., 2008; Rosenzweig & Parry, 1994). As such, researchers, scientists,
    policymakers, and organizations like the Food and Agriculture Organization of
    the United Nations (FAO) call for a radical transformation in global agricultural
    and food systems. Therefore, improved technologies that aim at enhancing production
    and supply-chain efficiencies under a resource-constrained environment are crucial
    to ensuring food security in the face of climate change (FAO, 2017). One such
    technology is the Internet of Things (IoT), which has recently shown the potential
    to provide solutions to several challenges associated with increased agricultural
    productivity under climatic changes and variability (Figure 1). FIGURE 1 Open
    in figure viewer Uses of the Internet of Things (IoT) in agriculture (Source:
    Salam, 2022, used with permission). Although there is no single definition of
    IoT, it could be broadly described as a system of devices, software programs,
    sensors, and other technologies that are either connected or are able to become
    connected via the Internet to exchange information and data (Borgia, 2014). The
    first application of IoT is believed to be an information-sharing network used
    by US defense sectors in 1969, then called the Advanced Research Projects Agency
    Network. The chronological timeline detailing the evolution process of various
    technologies within IoT since 1969 is summarized in Table 1 (Balas et al., 2019).
    In recent years, there has been an exponential increase in the number of common
    devices that might be considered to be a part of the IoT framework, including
    cell phones, televisions, thermostats, vehicles, refrigerators, home lighting
    systems, and smart watches among many others. Such IoT infrastructure is projected
    to substantially impact the global economy, with more than 100 billion connections
    (Huawei Technologies Co., 2015) and a financial impact of more than $11 trillion
    by 2025 (Manyika et al., 2015). Their impact is largely apparent in the agricultural
    sector, which currently contributes up to 60% of the national gross domestic product
    in many countries (The World Bank, 2019). TABLE 1. Chronological evolution of
    the technologies in Internet of Things (IoT) domain. Year Evolution Reference

    locating people and objects Sharma and Lohan (2019) 2020 IoT was used for monitoring
    and controlling distant objects such as water levels in tanks in crop fields Rajalakshmi
    and Mahalakshmi (2016) The use of IoT in agriculture emerged due to advancements
    in data science, remote sensing, and computer technologies, and the need for optimizing
    decisions regarding agricultural management practices (King, 2017). Specifically,
    IoT use in precision and smart agriculture is notable with applications in data-informed,
    site-specific, and real-time management and decision-making. International Society
    of Precision Agriculture defines precision agriculture as “a management strategy
    that gathers, processes and analyzes temporal, spatial and individual data and
    combines it with other information to support management decisions according to
    estimated variability for improved resource use efficiency, productivity, quality,
    profitability and sustainability of agricultural production.” Smart agriculture
    refers to farming using softwares, sensors, automation, and data technologies.
    Digital agriculture seeks to utilize data from precision farming and the power
    of Artificial Intelligence. Digital agricultural technologies and the use of IoT
    are illustrated in Figure 1. Development of pilot research farms is already underway
    in several countries to determine the feasibility of IoT-informed decision-making
    for improving the efficiency and sustainability of agricultural production. Some
    examples include the Accelerating Precision Agriculture to Decision Agriculture
    (P2D) project in Australia (Zhang et al., 2017) and SmartAgriHubs (Chatzikostas
    et al., 2019) and SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos et al., 2012) in Europe. Yet, the adaptation
    of IoT technology in the agricultural sector is still in its infancy (Villa-Henriksen
    et al., 2020). IoT enables us to gather information from enclosed proximity to
    the physical location using fog computing, edge computing, communication protocols,
    and sensor technologies. They show potential in improving decision-making and
    productivity in various stages of agricultural production. Examples include the
    use of wireless in-field sensors in improving the measurement of soil moisture
    and permittivity (Salam, 2020; Bogena et al., 2010), autonomous precision irrigation
    systems (Dong et al., 2013), and identification and tracking of livestock animals
    (Trotter et al., 2010). Satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and new remote
    sensing approaches (e.g., PlanetLab) are increasingly used in IoT. For example,
    UAVs have been used for plant height estimation (Anthony et al., 2014; Herwitz
    et al., 2004), biomass estimation (Sinha et al., 2015), crop yield prediction
    (Ashapure et al., 2020; Panday et al., 2020), detection of weeds (De Castro et
    al., 2017), soil nitrogen management (Ballester et al., 2017), crop disease detection
    (Sugiura et al., 2016), and estimation of the leaf area index (LAI) (Hunt et al.,
    2008). Despite the growing interest of the agricultural research community in
    integrating IoT-enabled devices into production, to date, such technologies are
    not widely adopted by producers due to concerns associated with cost and return
    on investment (Narwane et al., 2022; Pillai & Sivathanu, 2020). More specifically,
    there is a need to understand the benefits and utilities of IoT from different
    perspectives (users, developers, and researchers) to fully utilize its potential
    to improve crop production under limited resources and climate change. Therefore,
    in this paper, we review existing literature and discuss the concepts, applications,
    potential challenges, and opportunities associated with IoT with a specific focus
    on its application in digital agriculture. First, we provide the concepts and
    technical details of different components of IoT, followed by its applications
    in digital agriculture, and associated challenges and opportunities. Overall,
    this review is expected to provide useful insights into how IoT could be integrated
    into the smart agriculture framework for improving crop productivity and food
    security in the face of climatic change and variability. Core Ideas Different
    platforms, sensors, and structures of IoT in digital agriculture were reviewed.
    The application of IoT in data management, interoperability, and precision farming
    was reviewed. Potential of IoT to improve agricultural quality and productivity
    was highlighted. Challenges and opportunities of IoT in digital agriculture were
    discussed. 2 COMPONENTS OF THE IOT The key components of the IoT include IoT platforms,
    wireless sensor networks (WSNs), and the IoT structure. An IoT platform can be
    defined as an on-premises software suite or a cloud service (IoT platform as a
    service [PaaS]) that monitors and may manage and control different kinds of endpoints,
    generally through apps installed on the platform. Similarly, WSN refers to an
    infrastructure-less wireless network that is installed ad hoc in a large number
    of wireless sensors to monitor system, physical, or environmental factors. The
    structure of IoT largely consists of devices, network structure, and cloud technology
    that allow IoT devices to communicate with each other. These components are discussed
    separately below. 2.1 IoT platforms IoT platforms provide proprietary or open-source
    suite for controlling devices and data in IoT system. Various IoT platforms, both
    proprietary and open source, are currently available to handle data from diverse
    sources using different devices. They serve functions like ingestion, filtering,
    aggregation, storing, and computation of data (Jayaraman et al., 2016). These
    platforms support specific microcontrollers, transceivers, data and extension
    memory, and programming. Some select platforms in agriculture are available from
    Tzounis et al. (2017) and are discussed in detail as follows. 2.1.1 FarmBot FarmBot
    is an open-source precision agricultural project platform that consists of a farming
    machine, software, and a repository for farming data. The three main components
    of FarmBot include mechanisms for seed planting, a nutrient delivery system, and
    a universal tool mounting system. FarmBot is generally used in urban farming for
    monitoring plant growth parameters and predicting a suitable harvest date at a
    future point in time (Nugraha et al., 2020). FarmBot can plant seeds with a regular
    watering schedule and can be remotely accessed with ease from Internet-connected
    devices (Murdyantoro et al., 2019). It takes the location of each plant into account
    to facilitate essential nutrients and water application for optimal plant growth
    based on feedback from the online database of records from various agricultural
    fields. The main purpose of FarmBot technology is to optimize the quality and
    quantity of agricultural produce and to enhance resource efficiency. Arduino,
    an open-source hardware and software company, which manufactures microcontrollers,
    is used to control the FarmBot and is connected to the Internet using a Raspberry
    Pi 3 board. A decision support system (DSS) has been implemented to help in data-driven
    design, access to the open repository, and real-time control of the parameters.
    An Android application can be designed to monitor the stepper motor location to
    carry out different farm operations, plant seeds using the vacuum pump in the
    field, and capture images. 2.1.2 Raspberry Pi Raspberry Pi is a small, low-cost
    computer chip capable of being used with a computer monitor, mouse, and keyboard.
    The basic structure of a Raspberry Pi includes random access memory (RAM), a processor,
    USB ports, general purpose input/output pins, an Ethernet port, a full HDMI port,
    a camera interface, a display interface, and a micro SD card slot (Balamurugan
    et al., 2017). The Raspberry Pi has been used in a wide variety of applications
    in agricultural systems. The growing availability of Raspberry Pi with high processing
    capacity has enabled many remote sensing tasks in agriculture, including crop
    imaging, determination of soil fertility, crop yield estimation, and spraying
    of fertilizers (Mathe et al., 2022). Flores et al. (2016) utilized a Raspberry
    Pi as a local server to display the relative humidity, air temperature, soil moisture,
    soil electrical conductivity, and soil pH through the use of a graphical user
    interface. Kamath et al. (2019) used a Raspberry Pi to monitor weeds in paddy
    crops and Bluetooth 4.0 to send data to remote base station using visual sensor
    nodes. These sensor readings were then processed using machine learning models
    (e.g., support vector machines and random forests) to distinguish weeds from paddy
    crops using shape features. 2.1.3 IRIS Mote An IRIS Mote (Crossbow) is a computing
    system consisting of a microcomputer plus one or more sensors that are connected
    wirelessly via a radio link. The IRIS Mote has one of the highest communication
    ranges (close to 500 m) using a 2.4 GHz IEEE 802.15.4 wireless module. It also
    includes an Intel XScale processor, 8 KB of RAM, 512 KB of flash memory, and a
    transmission rate of 250 kbps. The expansion connector has eight channel analog
    inputs. The IRIS Mote handles task scheduling and input/output processing (Liu
    et al., 2015) using an open-source TinyOS operating system based on an ATMega1281
    low-power microcontroller (Sivagami et al., 2010). The transmission current of
    IRIS Mote is 10–17 mA, whereas the receiver current is 16 mA. The indoor communication
    range of the device is greater than 300 m, and the outdoor communication range
    is greater than 50 m (Narayanan et al., 2016). The underground communication range
    is reduced to less than 30 m due to interference in radio frequency communication.
    The IRIS Mote is used in small agricultural fields to monitor climatic and hydrologic
    parameters like rain, sunlight, humidity, and temperature of a system. 2.1.4 Zolertia
    The Zolertia Z1 Mote (Zolertia S.L., Barcelona, Spain) is a platform designed
    for WSNs. It is compatible with TinyOS, OpenWSN, and RIOT OS. It supports analog
    and digital sensors and includes an MSP432 microcontroller, 8 KB of RAM, and 92
    KB of flash memory. It can operate in the temperature range of −25 to −85°C. It
    is designed to work in the range of 0.3–3.6 V, powered by two 1.5 V AA standard
    batteries (Zolertia, 2010). Agricultural use of Zolertia has previously been reported
    in greenhouse-based tomato farming, where the attenuation of radio waves in the
    2.4 GHz freeband was measured using a received signal strength indicator (Cama-Pinto
    et al., 2021). Zolertia Z1 Mote has also been used in determining agro-climatic
    variables like temperature and soil moisture in cassava (Manihot spp.) production
    (Caicedo-Ortiz et al., 2018). 2.1.5 Node MicroController Unit Node MicroController
    Unit (NodeMCU) is an open-source IoT platform with an ESP8266 microcontroller
    and Wi-Fi system on chip (SoC) from Expressif Systems, and hardware, which runs
    on an ESP-12 module. This firmware runs on Lua scripting language (Vanaja et al.,
    2018). It functions the same way as a Raspberry Pi in the case of agricultural
    applications and may be connected to various sensors for real-time monitoring
    of soil moisture, relative humidity, and air temperature. In one study, NodeMCU
    was used to monitor the environmental conditions of indoor greenhouses (Wan et
    al., 2019). A cloud-based platform has been used to store the environmental sensor
    readings and has been used for automatic irrigation systems for controlling agriculture
    pumps and remote monitoring systems resulting in increased economic benefits (Bentabet,
    2020). 2.1.6 Intel Galileo/Edison The Intel Galileo (Intel) board is based on
    Intel architecture (Intel Quark SoC X1000, 400 MHz processor) and is designed
    to have powerful functionalities with minimum power consumption. This allows users
    to apply shields compatible with Intel Galileo and extend the functionality of
    the board. It comprises two levels—legacy controlled blocks and microbuses. The
    legacy-controlled blocks are used for specific functions using dedicated channels.
    It has a dedicated point-to-point connection to connect to standard modules like
    Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and SIM card modules for cell phones. The issues of these boards
    within agriculture are similar to that of the Raspberry Pi (Silpa et al., 2018).
    These boards are used in a house environment monitoring system, which helps in
    producing high-quality crops with minimal labor costs (Ajith et al., 2020). Some
    other applications are observed in the monitoring of soil pH and nutrients of
    cultivated crops (Sakthisudhan et al., 2019). 2.2 Wireless sensor network WSN
    is an important component of IoT, and its use in the agricultural sector has been
    widely discussed (Mahbub, 2020; Sanjeevi et al., 2020). A WSN is a wireless network
    consisting of spatially distributed sensors and sensor nodes to monitor physical
    or environmental conditions and transfer data to a base station. These systems
    are often inexpensive, scalable, and consist of mobile nodes (Kiani & Seyyedabbasi,
    2018). Briefly, the WSN system consists of two major components, sensor nodes
    and sink nodes (base station) (Kocakulak & Butun, 2017). The sensor node consists
    of a power unit, a sensing unit, and a computing unit. These nodes may be placed
    inside or outside an agricultural field to continuously feed data to the base
    station. Depending on the ad hoc system configuration or network type, the sensor
    node could behave as a data originator or router. Sensor nodes can collect real-time
    physical or environmental conditions such as temperature, vibration, or motion
    time and produce sensory data (Pottie, 1998; Senouci & Mellouk, 2016). At the
    same time, the sink node collects sensor data and communicates with the end user
    via a direct connection. This connection between the sensor and sink nodes is
    established via the Internet, satellite, or any wireless link, and the data is
    accessed through an app or end-user interface. 2.3 IoT structure IoT structure
    is a system that helps in connecting objects to the Internet through information-sensing
    equipment to establish data exchange and communication and to monitor and manage
    digital systems (Ye et al., 2014). To achieve such functions, IoT uses the perception,
    network, and application layers, as well as the security strategy for each layer,
    as a part of its framework (Gou et al., 2013). The IoT structural hierarchy is
    shown in Figure 2 (Zhong et al., 2015), but more generalized structural components
    are discussed in sub-sections below. Different layers within the hierarchy are
    crucial to address issues like computational loss, poor access control, data leaks,
    malware risks, and cyberattacks (apriorit.com/dev-blog). FIGURE 2 Open in figure
    viewer Hierarchy of the Internet of Things (IoT) structure. 2.3.1 The perception
    layer The perception layer is the foundation of IoT and is the interface between
    the physical world and the digital world. This layer functions as “nerve endings”
    collecting measured signals and transporting those signals to the rest of the
    system (Yang et al., 2012). It uses radio frequency identification technology,
    barcode technology, sensor, and positioning technology to complete information
    collection and helps in controlling the perception by the actuators. The main
    security issues in a perception layer are related to information collection and
    transmission as most sensors have a simple structure and processor and do not
    have complex security protection capabilities (Zhao & Ge, 2013). 2.3.2 The network
    layer The network layer is generally composed of two layers—the network access
    layer and the network transmission layer. The access layer consists of a base
    station node and a gateway. Current methods of network access are Wi-Fi, Ad Hoc,
    Mesh, and Zigbee. The network transmission layer is responsible for the transmission
    and exchange of information, including satellite, mobile, and optical fiber communication
    networks. It is analogous to a person''s nervous system and brain, which are used
    to transmit and cope with the information from the perception layer. The most
    common security issues in a network layer occur when a number of malicious nodes
    send data at the same time, which may lead to a denial of service attack (Bello
    et al., 2017). 2.3.3 The application layer The application layer is generally
    composed of two layers—the application support layer and the application presentation
    layer. The support layer is responsible for data storage, information processing,
    and the exchange of information. The presentation layer is used for processing
    data from the application support layer. It uses technology with multimedia, virtual
    reality, and human–computer interfaces to connect the IoT and the user. The main
    security issues concerning the application layer may include data access permission,
    identity authentication, data protection and recovery, big data handling, and
    software vulnerabilities, among others (Karagiannis et al., 2015). 3 APPLICATIONS
    OF IOT IN DIGITAL AGRICULTURE Digital agriculture is directly linked with IoT.
    Indeed, IoT offers multiple applications in the production, circulation, and modernization
    of farming businesses (Chen & Jin, 2012; Ozdogan et al., 2017). The term “digital
    agriculture” refers to the on-farm and off-farm uses and applications of data
    based on location, weather, energy use, or other factor using sensors, machines,
    or satellites to monitor animals, plants, or soil (Klerkx et al., 2019). It integrates
    concepts from precision and smart farming. The basic framework (Tang et al., 2002)
    of digital agriculture includes: Agricultural databases that include information
    about farmlands, climatic conditions, and socioeconomic background that relates
    agricultural activities to the human society. Real-time monitoring and updating
    of information in the database about meteorology, vegetation, and soil information
    on and under the ground using in situ and satellite-based sensors. A network transmission
    and processing system to analyze collected information, make decisions, and transfer
    signals in controlling the functions of agricultural machinery. The actuation
    framework that includes digitized sowing and harvesting devices enabled with Geographic
    Information System and Global Position Satellite systems. Different crop, soil,
    and weather sensors are increasingly used in monitoring plant growth, diseases,
    pests, yield, weather variables (temperature, humidity, rain, air, etc.), and
    soil physical–chemical and hydraulic properties (Acharya et al., 2017; Sehgal
    et al., 2005). Sensors are used in real-time monitoring and reporting of agricultural
    parameters in the value chain, cloud computing, and integration of these processes
    with advanced technologies like UAVs and satellites to enable highly efficient,
    qualitative, profitable, and environmentally sound agricultural decision-making.
    Sensor-based data is also utilized in formulating predictive models to forecast
    crop yield (Supit et al., 2012). Some applications of IoT systems in digital agriculture
    are discussed as follows. 3.1 UAVs in digital agriculture Traditionally, satellites
    have been used to detect spectral responses from plants and soil (Dematte et al.,
    2018). However, satellite data is often of coarse resolution that is not applicable
    for canopy and plot scale applications and is not available regularly due to cloud
    cover and sensor property. UAVs provide a noninvasive and cost-effective approach
    to collect data at a much finer scale at the desired time scale. UAVs are defined
    as “a set of configurable elements consisting of a remotely piloted aircraft,
    its associated remote pilot station(s), the required command and control links,
    and any other system elements as may be required, at any point during flight operation”
    (International Civil Aviation Organization, ICAO). UAV-derived images can be processed
    to monitor and predict plant growth parameters, disease and pest incidence, yield,
    and different soil physical and hydraulic properties. Nowadays, smart technologies
    have been built into UAVs by integrating open-source technology, autonomous programs,
    smart sensors, and payloads (Puri et al., 2017). Different hyperspectral, multispectral,
    and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors can be mounted to the UAVs for
    near real-time monitoring of vegetation conditions, extraction of soil and vegetation
    indices (Ni et al., 2018), and predicting LAI. For example, multispectral sensors
    are increasingly used to calculate the normalized difference vegetation index,
    normalized difference red-edge index, leaf water content index, soil-adjusted
    vegetation index, enhanced vegetation index, tile drainage, and plant water status
    by capturing the reflectance including those in visible, near-infrared, and shortwave
    regions of the electromagnetic radiation (Tables 2 and 3). TABLE 2. Different
    sensors used in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and their advantages and disadvantages
    (Modified from Acharya et al., 2021). Sensors Advantages Disadvantages Red/green/blue
    (RGB) Portable, common, relatively inexpensive, provide high-quality RGB images
    for ortho-imagery and digital surface model, easy to integrate with different
    platforms Wider bandwidth and lower spectral resolution lack geometric and radiometric
    calibration Multispectral Multiple wavelengths allow geometric reconstruction
    and radiometric calibration Relatively costly, image processing relatively complex
    compared to RGB, radiometric, and atmospheric corrections may be required, limited
    compatibility to UAVs Hyperspectral High spectral resolution data across various
    wavelengths of the visible and near infrared spectrum Higher cost than multispectral,
    low signal-to-noise ratio, limited compatibility with standard UAVs and flight
    control software packages, radiometric and atmospheric corrections may be required
    Microwave High spatial resolution, useful under low visibility weather conditions
    (e.g., cloud cover) Sensitive to surface roughness Thermal Sense a wide range
    of temperatures, relatively cheaper Thermally sensitive, vignetting effects, low
    spatial resolution, radiometric corrections required, sensitive to change in surface
    roughness LiDAR Generates dense cloud points, high-quality data, direct geometric
    measurements Higher cost, limited compatibility with UAVs, requires ground filtering
    corrections TABLE 3. Selected vegetative indices and their application in agriculture

    near-infrared; R, red. There are several types of UAV systems used for agricultural
    applications (Table 4; Acharya et al., 2021). Two widely used UAVs include fixed-wing
    and rotary-wing UAVs (Dileep et al., 2020). Fixed-wing UAVs use airplane-like
    wings to generate lift and to move forward. Some of their properties include lower
    cost, higher endurance, and greater flight speed as compared to rotary-wing UAVs.
    Contrastingly, rotary-wing UAVs use rotor blades and are characterized by vertical
    takeoff and landing capacity, lower flight altitude, and lower flight speed. UAVs
    may be used for mid-season crop health monitoring of vegetative indices using
    near-infrared and other regions of the electromagnetic spectrum that cannot be
    sensed by the human eye (Table 3; Cancela et al., 2019; Ren et al., 2020; Veroustraete,
    2015). Pathak et al. (2020) reported the use of UAVs in spraying herbicides on
    up to 20–40 ha per day and to further eradicate farmers’ direct contact with poisonous
    chemicals and hazardous operational conditions. UAVs can be used to generate variable-rate
    application maps from the images to determine the strength of nutrient uptake
    in a single field. This has the potential to further minimize fertilizer costs
    and optimize crop yield (Kulbacki et al., 2018). UAV-based LiDAR systems and software
    have shown potential in stitching together thousands of high-quality aerial photographs
    to develop 3D maps for monitoring soil erosion and developing conservation strategies
    (Acharya et al., 2021). More recently, new types of aerial imagery and satellite
    (e.g., PlanetLab) have shown tremendous potential in monitoring crops, making
    informed decisions, and increasing yield (Cai et al., 2019). TABLE 4. Applications

    aerial imaging and field and crop monitoring 3.2 Cloud-based information communication
    technology (ICT) systems The main purpose of cloud-based information communication
    technology (ICT) systems is to provide tools to software developers to develop
    a variety of cloud-based services to monitor plant growth parameters and predict
    crop yield (Kaloxylos et al., 2012). This infrastructure consists of data collection,
    statistical analysis, and the creation of commands to control farming equipment.
    In a practical setup, data is generally transferred from a local farm management
    system to the cloud repository associated with the monitoring service in order
    to keep track of the farm activities. The data is subsequently analyzed by an
    expert online system such as an e-agriculturist, and outputs are made directly
    available to the farmers. An ICT system has three major components (Patil et al.,
    2012). The first is an information collection layer, which consists of a sensor-based
    climatic and agricultural dataset. Data may include but is not limited to air
    temperature, relative humidity, air pressure, atmospheric gas concentrations;
    names, models, and prices of agricultural products; operating status of agricultural
    equipment, and locations of agricultural products. The second layer is the transport
    or network layer, which is responsible for transmitting and processing data received
    from the sensor layer above. Finally, the application layer analyzes and processes
    information to cultivate digital awareness. One of the leading examples of a cloud-based
    ICT system is GeoFarmer (Eitzinger et al., 2019). GeoFarmer consists of a modular
    design, which is interoperable through an application programming interface. It
    follows open access standards regarding existing tools and technologies and the
    system is designed and developed in accordance with user needs. Further, the entire
    process and lessons learned in the development process are documented. Similar
    software architecture has been defined in FIWARE, an open-source platform for
    a smart digital future, which focuses on agricultural sensors with reprogrammable
    firmware and a set of interfaces already embedded in the General Packet Radio
    Service board. Cloud-based systems have been applied to monitor pesticide use
    and safety in vegetable crops (Qian et al., 2018). Interfaces of such systems
    consist of guidelines for pesticide purchasing and application, optimal harvest
    time estimation, and a feedback system formulation to monitor the health of vegetables.
    A mobile-based cloud architecture was implemented through AgroMobile (Prasad et
    al., 2013), which enhances smart agricultural practices with the help of image
    processing techniques, image visualization, and cloud-based data processing. A
    similar precision agriculture technique using cloud computing has been proposed
    in enhancing the capacity for special education leadership for aggregate farming
    in the cloud (Castillejo et al., 2020) to increase efficiency and productivity
    and reduce labor costs. Other applications include quality control in greenhouse
    production, and monitoring soil moisture levels, humidity, and temperature in
    agricultural plots. 3.3 Big data in agriculture Big data refers to datasets that
    are too large to be analyzed by traditional data processing software and applications.
    The integration of big data technologies and best farming practices has the potential
    to facilitate improved crop production, plant protection, postharvest analysis,
    and environmental conservation. The major applications of big data in different
    topologies of digital agriculture are available from Sarker et al. (2019) and
    are briefly discussed here. The first application of big data is in precision
    agriculture. Thus, data collected using sensor-enabled hardware and software tools
    is used for assessing, controlling, and improving crop management, crop performance,
    and environmental quality. The second application is prescription agriculture,
    where big data is used to prescribe agronomic practices for optimizing yield.
    The third application is in enterprise agriculture, which includes the agribusiness
    platform and links field data to inventory, logistics, machinery, and profit.
    Finally, the fourth application is in automated agriculture, where farm data and
    environmental data are used to automate agriculture through robotic technologies.
    The data lifecycle in agriculture consists of data generation, warehousing, cleaning,
    annotation, and processing to optimize or improve agricultural production while
    maintaining the quality of the environment (Chaterji et al., 2020). In the following
    section, we briefly describe each of these steps. Data generation may involve
    the use of site-specific or public data. Site-specific datasets, such as soil
    nutrient composition and fertilizer usage, are generally privately held. Examples
    of public data may include topographic or soil textural information of a location.
    Data warehousing allows the data to be integrated from multiple sources and then
    restructured for improved performance. Data annotation is a data labeling technique
    that translates an encoded value to raw data. Because classical WSNs have limitations
    in interpreting and understanding the context of raw sensor data, annotation is
    highly recommended for end-user applications (Khan et al., 2015). On the other
    hand, getting rid of the corrupt or inaccurate values from the tables is a very
    important step in processing and helps to eradicate outliers from the dataset.
    Finally, processing imagery data results in more useful formats, which is largely
    accomplished by using a variety of analysis techniques such as Artificial Intelligence.
    Despite the considerable importance of big data in modernizing agriculture, a
    dearth of publicly available, high-quality datasets remains a formidable challenge
    to farming using alternate techniques. A combination of machine learning and IoT
    may be crucial in filling those gaps and in designing interactive wireless sensor–actuator
    networks for the commercial application of alternative farming systems (e.g.,
    Aquaponics) (Dhal et al., 2022a, 2022b; Dhal, Jungbluth, et al., 2022). 3.4 Digital
    twins in agriculture Digital twins generally refer to a digital replica of real-world
    entities mirroring their behavior and states over the entire lifetime in a virtual
    world. It is generally a standardization of real-world variables and can be used
    irrespective of place, time, and human observation (Botín-Sanabria et al., 2022).
    A digital twin in agriculture has been described as a multi-physical, multi-scale,
    and probabilistic simulation model of complex production. It uses a combination
    of in situ sensors and physical models to mirror physical life. Information from
    sensors and satellite data is taken as input to design digital twins (Verdouw
    et al., 2021) and is utilized in reproducing historical statistics and predicting
    future values. The process involves data integration, Artificial Intelligence,
    and machine learning. Digital twins show potential for aiding in planning and
    managing soil operations, irrigation, robotics, and farm machineries (Nasirahmadi
    & Hensel, 2022). WSNs in farmlands and cloud servers that run machine learning
    algorithms can detect plant diseases, weed clusters, and nutrient deficiencies
    (Angin et al., 2020). Indeed, significant progress has been made in using digital
    twins in the field of arable farming, dairy farming, greenhouse horticulture,
    and livestock rearing (Howard et al., 2020; Verdouw et al., 2017). For example,
    digital twins have been designed to monitor the health of cows (Bos taurus) and
    pigs (Sus domesticus), model firmness and loss of vitamin content in mango (Mangifera
    indica), identify diseases and pests in olives (Olea europaea) and other crops,
    assist in fleet management and tracking machinery, and identify pesticide exposure
    in bees (Apis mellifera) (Pylianidis et al., 2021). These applications of the
    digital twins within the agricultural sector have been observed in seven major
    fields: real-time monitoring of data, energy consumption analysis, system failure
    analysis and prediction, optimization of resources, behavioral analysis, technological
    integration, and virtual maintenance (Angin et al., 2020). More recently, the
    concept of digital twins has been applied in postharvest management by categorizing
    simulations into three stages: input, throughput, and output (Dyck et al., 2022).
    This enables monitoring of moisture and temperature of grain to ensure safe storage
    and movement within the elevator. Further, a sensor network could be used in storage
    to ensure the optimal quality of grains. 4 ADVANTAGES OF USING IOT IN AGRICULTURE
    The demand for agricultural products will increase as the global population grows
    and as climate change occurs (Bradshaw & Brook, 2014). IoT shows the potential
    to lower the impact of these challenges while meeting this demand for agricultural
    products. Indeed, IoT offers a potential solution to increase agricultural efficiency
    and productivity while saving time, labor, and money. Because of the cost and
    time effectiveness of IoT systems, the use and installation of IoT devices in
    the agricultural industry are increasing by nearly 20% annually and are expected
    to reach 225 million devices by 2024 (Elijah et al., 2018). In addition, the expansion
    of cellular service and 5G connectivity introduced by satellite and cellular network
    companies in rural areas have boosted the use of IoT in recent years (Di et al.,
    2019; Chen et al., 2022). The advancement of IoT connectivity to personal and
    portable electronic items, such as cell phones, iPads, and tablets, along with
    the introduction of advanced WSNs and machine learning facilitates real-time data
    retrieval, processing, and decision-making. The advantages of IoT in agriculture
    include interoperability, wide advantages of WSN, and data management using cloud
    and fog computing. In the following section, we discuss these advantages in detail.
    4.1 Interoperability The data collected through WSNs and sensor nodes is made
    available using apps, equipment, and products to communicate and process them
    in a way that does not require any involvement from end users, which is called
    interoperability (Tzounis et al., 2017). In other words, interoperability is the
    data communication approach that allows using different information systems to
    transfer and comprehend information. The interoperability process consists of
    two methods. The first method makes the data available through a local area network
    or a wide area network. The second method shares the data via software or hardware
    between different systems and machines. In the utilization of IoT, interoperability
    plays a vital role in facilitating and exchanging effectively organized data between
    information systems. Interoperability provides multiple benefits, such as system
    adaptability, better productivity, data unity, improved data protection, fewer
    errors, and lower data acquisition costs. The interoperability functionality includes
    three approaches, which include syntactical, structural, and semantical approaches
    (Aydin & Aydin, 2020). Syntactic interoperability allows the use of two or more
    systems simultaneously to communicate and share data even if the interface or
    language is not the same. Structural interoperability defines the standard data
    exchange format from one system to another to understand the information clearly.
    Moreover, semantic interoperability allows connecting two or more systems and
    sharing data between them in a meaningful way. 4.2 Smart irrigation and decision
    support The use of sensors and communication technologies, microcontrollers, and
    actuators has the potential to improve water use efficiency, reduce the cost of
    irrigation, and increase crop productivity (Abbasi et al., 2019). For example,
    UAVs are increasingly used in monitoring plant water use efficiency, which provides
    a base to select plant varieties for breeding and crop improvement, particularly
    in water-limited systems. Soil moisture sensors using capacitance or frequency
    domain technology are able to continuously monitor soil moisture in determining
    irrigation rate and time. Farmers may use mobile phones or wireless personal digital
    assistants to remotely control data loggers and monitor and analyze moisture for
    irrigation scheduling and automation. The applications of different machine learning
    algorithms in developing irrigation support systems are shown in Table 5. The
    irrigation DSS allows a weekly schedule to meet the irrigation water needs of
    a plantation based on inputs to a data-driven model. Some automated and smart
    irrigation systems using WSN, the Internet, cloud computing, and optimization
    tools are discussed in Krishnan et al. (2020) and Ramachandran et al. (2018),
    among others. TABLE 5. Application of machine learning techniques as decision
    support systems in Internet of Things (IoT)-based agricultural applications. Application
    of IoT in irrigation decision support, input, and salient features Reference Input
    variables: Temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, rainfall, dew point, vapor

    and water supply Major Features: On-board decision system considering existing
    resources, irrigational cost-savings Balafoutis et al. (2017) Input variables:

    soil texture, and irrigation method Output variables: Soil water balance, irrigation

    Major features: Water management, irrigation estimations, irrigation layouts designing,
    scheduling water deliveries, and recording water consumption Mateos et al. (2002)

    future irrigation schedules formulated Li et al. (2018) Input variables: Forecasted
    rainfall and water stress index Major features: Two irrigation scheduling methods
    (decision support system [DSS]-based and soil-moisture based) have been proposed
    to improve cotton yield and water productivity Chen et al. (2020) Irrigation scheduling
    has been formulated using Fuzzy logic methods Giusti and Marsili-Libelli (2015)
    Output variable: Irrigation schedules Machine learning model: Linear regression,
    random forest regression and support vector regression Torres-Sanchez et al. (2020)
    4.3 Smart greenhouse One application of WSNs includes the conversion of a traditional
    greenhouse into a “smart greenhouse” (Kodali et al., 2016). The sensors automatically
    adjust the greenhouse climatic conditions, such as air pressure, relative humidity,
    air temperature, and light conditions, according to a particular set of instructions.
    The real-time greenhouse environment may be monitored via email and SMS alerts
    on mobile phones. For example, the installation of soil moisture sensors in the
    greenhouse activates an irrigation system only when the soil is dry. Recently,
    the use of solar-powered IoT sensors (Hou & Gao, 2010) has made building smart
    greenhouses an inexpensive and popular choice. 4.4 Data management With an increase
    in the application of IoT in multiple sectors and high-performance computing trends,
    the conventional database system has failed to meet the need and demand for massive
    sensor-derived data storage. In this regard, cloud base and fogging data storage
    in IoT platforms play a vital role in managing, transferring, and analyzing data
    into meaningful information using analytical tools. Cloud and fog computing have
    their characteristics to process data burdens and preferences, but they supplement
    each other. Using predictive analytics, a farmer could better predict weather
    conditions, maintain crop quality, and enhance soil fertility to formulate better
    plans and decisions related to crop harvesting and enhance crop quality and productivity.
    4.4.1 Cloud computing Cloud-based data management provides an option for computing
    resources on a pay-per-use basis. It is an extension of cluster and grid computing
    that collects resources at one central place and utilizes them for high-performance
    computing employing wireless connections (Qian et al., 2009; Armburst et al.,
    2020; Dillon et al., 2010). Such a computing system could be divided into two
    parts: front end and backend. The front end consists of client devices, such as
    computers, cell phones, tablets, and iPads, whereas the backend consists of data
    storage and processing located far away from the client. Cloud computing architecture
    provides three types of services, such as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS),
    PaaS, and Software as a Service (SaaS) (Dempsey & Kelliher, 2018; Jagli et al.,
    2018; Laghari et al., 2016). IaaS platform is a remote data center that provides
    the right to change or configure storage capacity, processing power, and networking
    to their needs. PaaS provides a development platform for an application developer
    to create, test, and launch an application. SaaS deals with ready-made software
    tailored to various business needs and customer services. Cloud technology is
    also used to deliver mobile applications and is called mobile cloud computing
    (MCC). This method handles the information and relocates the storage from mobile
    devices to intense and centralized computing platforms situated in the cloud (Huang,
    2011). MCC takes the pressure off mobile devices by harnessing the power of cloud
    infrastructure. Many cloud service providers are compatible with Windows or Linux
    operating systems, such as Amazon Web Service, Server Space (ITGLOBAL), Microsoft
    Azure (Microsoft Corporation), Google Cloud Platform (Google LLC), IBM Cloud Services
    (International Business Machines Corporation), Adobe Creative Cloud (Adobe Inc),
    and Dropbox (Dropbox Inc). 4.4.2 Fog computing The motivation behind fog computing
    is the need for real-time computing. It is an extension of cloud computing that
    consists of multiple edge nodes directly connected to the physical device. As
    the nodes are physically much closer to the device, it seems more advanced and
    provides better performance than cloud computing for handling user requests and
    emerging standards (Atlam et al., 2018; Khan et al., 2017). Fog computing can
    include cloudlets, a small-scale and robust data center located at the edge of
    the network system to perform computation without sending it to a distant server.
    Thus, fog computing acts as an intermediary between computing hardware and a remote
    server, controls the information being sent to the server, and processes it locally.
    It supports heterogeneous devices to provide greater interoperability than cloud
    computing. However, the security and privacy concerns in Fog computing are big
    issues due to the prevalence of wireless networks from a business point of view
    compared to cloud computing and deserve further research (Khan et al., 2017).
    Because of attacks, such as jamming attacks, and sniffer attacks, numerous organizations
    are focusing on considerable research on the security issue of Fog computing,
    including Cisco, Microsoft Corporation, ARM Holding Plc, and Dell Inc. Farmers
    benefit from cloud and fog data management by registering into the system application.
    The application is often designed to store farmers’ details, agronomic marketing
    details, agronomic vendors, and agricultural service providers, such as fertilizer,
    pesticides, seed, and equipment, and information on the government''s scheme.
    Indeed, cloud and fog data management systems have both advantages and disadvantages
    (Table 6), which largely determine the choice of using one over another. TABLE
    6. Pros and cons of cloud and fog computing in Internet of Things (IoT). Cloud
    for IoT Fog for IoT Pros Cons Pros Cons Improved performance between IoT sensors
    and data processing system High latency because of the distance between client
    devices and data processing centers Low latency because users are geographically
    closer to Fog to get an instant response A more complicated system in data processing
    and storage/decentralized computing Storage capacity can be scalable to store
    and share enormous amounts of data Downtime due to interruption in network and
    multiple connected channels No issues with bandwidth and connection because multiple
    interconnected channels are involved in sending the data Additional expense requires
    routers, hubs, and gateways Virtual processing capabilities on demand via remote
    data center Security and privacy could be limited because thousands of gigabytes
    of data are being transferred simultaneously High security because numerous nodes
    are involved in the complex distribution system Potential for cyberattacks, such
    as jamming and sniffer due to the extension of network''s edge Reduced cost because
    of lower licensing fees than the cost of equipment and maintenance Rescheduling
    of failure management is slow Power efficiency and improved user experiences because
    each node runs efficiently and provides instant response to the users Limited
    scalability—because it cannot be scalable as the cloud 5 CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES
    OF USING IOT IN AGRICULTURE Data-driven agricultural practices are largely focused
    on precision, predictive, smarter, and efficient farming practices with minimal
    use of resources and enhanced agricultural automation (Ayaz et al., 2019; Patil
    et al., 2012). Therefore, the usage of IoT in agriculture is inevitable with the
    increasing demand for food, land, and changes in climatic conditions. However,
    IoT in agriculture presents several challenges. These challenges and opportunities
    are observed at different levels of data handling and analysis: Collection, data
    transmission, processing and storage, and the application of the data inferred
    (i.e., inference drawn from available data without much expense of resources;
    Tzounis et al., 2017) and are discussed in detail as follows. 5.1 Data collection
    Different IoT sensors are typically designed for a particular agriculture practice
    (Dholu & Ghodinde, 2018). The use of such sensors in different locations and climates
    is often challenging and may require either modification in design or further
    calibration. An ideal sensor should be user-friendly, efficient, robust, and able
    to withstand variable weather conditions. Although experts in the field can set
    up, install, and connect equipment, the application of data by farmers on day-to-day
    basis demands skills and training. The collection of real-time data is increasingly
    important in precision farming and requires an active Internet connection, which
    further presents a major challenge in IoT applications in underdeveloped countries
    and rural areas in the United States (Federal Communications Commission, 2020).
    Although IoT has been widely used in the field of precision agriculture, only
    proprietary solutions are currently being implemented, which creates difficulties
    with device compatibility and connectivity. There is a pressing need to discover
    other approaches that employ interoperable hardware built on open standards and
    platforms. Lower priced alternatives to expensive proprietary solutions can be
    found in the form of many already available products that are built on open hardware,
    at least in part (Stočes et al., 2016). Scaling up the use of integrated IoT technologies
    beyond early adopters is important, especially by making existing solutions easier
    to use and more affordable, thereby improving their selection and use by farmers
    and food companies. Therefore, business models that work for small companies and
    systematic analysis of associated costs and benefits may be necessary. More effort
    is necessary in improving the utilization of IoT technologies in a wide range
    of climates, crops, and soils. Efforts could be centered on the development of
    IoT devices for harsh environments (open air, dirt, dust, moisture, animal manure,
    cold storage, hot cleaning treatments, etc.) and for natural objects (plants,
    animals, square meters of soil, perishable food products), which have limited
    ways to embed IoT devices in the objects themselves. This is especially true for
    devices that use new technologies because there has already been a lot of progress
    in adapting more mature technologies (Verdouw et al., 2017). Indeed, IoT includes
    a large variety of heterogeneous devices; therefore, it is challenging to achieve
    high levels of compatibility among devices if they employ dissimilar standards
    and protocols. In order to overcome such obstacles, standard IoT protocols ought
    to be designed (Abbasi et al., 2019). There are several challenges associated
    with UAV deployments in the agricultural sector, including limited flight durations
    (<1 h), small coverage area, high costs, large amounts of imagery data resulting
    from flights, and geometric and radiometric correction issues. Further, UAVs could
    interfere with civilian aircraft and generate safety issues. There are often stringent
    national laws issued by aviation authorities in each country regarding flying
    UAVs. Typically, the only permission granted is for educational or experimental
    purposes. In the United States, the maximum flight altitude is 120 m above ground
    level, and UAVs are not permitted to fly at night. Finally, processing large volumes
    of imagery data requires special skills, time, and software, often demanding the
    use of machine learning, communication technologies, and data repositories. 5.2
    Data transmission, storage, and processing IoT systems must communicate, store,
    and process the data they have acquired. Data transmission is made feasible with
    adequate connectivity. Many parts of the world, including the United States, have
    poor or no broadband and Internet connection. A significant obstacle to IoT applications
    is the access to internet. Presence of agricultural fields in distinct locations
    limits Internet use and other connectivity (Antony et al., 2020). The data collected
    from one agricultural landscape is often not applicable in other areas. Although
    proper storage and security of the collected data are important, the cost of storage
    and further analysis and processing of stored data to develop an inference for
    its application in the fields remains challenging. New technologies, such as Starlink
    (https://www.starlink.com), free TV band/channels, and other communication channels,
    could be exploited to substitute Internet at remote locations. Further, it is
    important to consider human factors when sharing and communicating information
    between farms, regions, and enterprises. 5.3 Data security Security of routing
    protocols is a major challenge in WSNs. Privacy issues in WSNs are either data-oriented
    or context-oriented. The former is largely associated with handling, preserving,
    and integrity of datasets. The latter deals with contextual information like location
    and time (Abbasi et al., 2019). Indeed, data security, anonymity, and privacy
    present both formidable challenges and opportunities to coordinate data transfer,
    availability, and usability securely for both small and large stakeholders. Agricultural
    data can be difficult to mine because of its volume, noise, gaps, and heterogeneity.
    This, however, provides opportunities for data imputation, standardization of
    IoT, integration of multiple domains, and collaborative research in sensor and
    communication technologies (Abbasi et al., 2019; Verdouw et al., 2017). There
    are opportunities for developing high-throughput phenotypic platforms through
    new sensors or improvements in existing sensors, robotics, remotely sensing vehicles,
    communication technologies, and deep learning methods. 5.4 Application of the
    inferred data IoT provides a foundation for smart logistics, intelligent transportation,
    and affordable agricultural application to address climatic challenges, improve
    resource utilization and efficiency, and increased productivity (Chen & Jin, 2012).
    However, challenges remain in efficient data transmission systems and adaptation
    of outputs by farmers. Indeed, farmers must be technology savvy to understand
    and utilize information. Certain changes may be necessary at farmers’ fields,
    which may incur additional expenses for data collection or processing. Rural farmers
    are often hesitant to adopt new technology. The use of IoT in agriculture is challenging
    due to the complexity of agricultural fields and farming operations. Research
    in IoT is often constrained by short-term funding; thus, limiting data collection
    processes. Antony et al. (2020) reported that 2 to 3 years of funding in the agriculture
    sector is relatively ineffective as plants’ cropping cycle may vary with weather
    conditions. However, the need to feed the growing population has bestowed opportunities
    in utilizing recent advances in IoT (Mahanta et al., 2022) in greenhouse farming,
    vertical farming, hydroponic, and plant phenotyping. Nevertheless, we see a plethora
    of opportunities to utilize WSNs, digital twins, machine learning, and cloud computing
    in soil and crop monitoring, irrigation scheduling, water quality analysis, plant
    breeding, weed control, disease, and pest identification, pesticide spray, reuse
    and recycling of wastes, and livestock management. 6 CONCLUSION This paper reviewed
    the application of different IoT platforms, WSNs, and technologies like UAVs,
    cloud computing, and big data analytics in agricultural production systems and
    value chains, such as crop monitoring, irrigation support, weed and pest control,
    fertilizer application, and soil health assessment. The literature, in general,
    indicates the use of sensors, actuators, microcontrollers, and machine learning
    in automated and smart irrigation systems and agricultural decision support. Different
    red, green, and blue, hyperspectral, multispectral, and LiDAR sensors could be
    mounted on UAVs for improved agricultural monitoring and forecasting to enable
    highly efficient, qualitative, and profitable farm products. Big data, data mining,
    and real-time analysis show promise to support and improve precision, prescription,
    enterprise, and automated agriculture. Cloud and fog data storage in IoT platforms,
    however, appear to be crucial in managing, transferring, and analyzing big agricultural
    data. This review also reveals opportunities in improving data security, anonymity,
    and usability, and developing high-throughput phenotypic platforms through new
    sensors or improvements in existing sensors, robotics, remote vehicles, communication
    technologies, and deep learning methods. Overall, IoT can improve production levels,
    cost-effectiveness, product quality, safety, and traceability through innovation,
    automation, and control while advancing the much-needed digital transformation
    of the agricultural sector in the face of climate change. AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS

    Precision agriculture (PA) utilizes modern technologies to provide valuable insights,
    treatment, operation management and decisions for quality crop production. The
    combination of Internet of Things (IoT) with wireless sensor networks (WSN) are
    the enabler technologies that contributes in making precision agriculture a reality.
    Features such as cost-effective monitoring, collection and wireless transmission
    of real-time data to facilitate decision-making directives, makes IoT and WSN
    perfect candidates for precision agriculture. PA is characterized by the spatial
    variations and the incessant dynamic changes of the environmental aspects as it
    varies from one field to another. Aspects such as soil, temperature, drainage,
    humidity, water and vegetation strongly affect crop growth and production. Although
    farmers and agriculturists are always aware of these factors, they were not able
    to quantitatively measure these environmental variations, predict outcomes and
    proactively take the appropriate actions. Various measurements readings provide
    useful guidelines to avoid water stress by projecting irrigation schedules improve
    production efficiency, product quality, and reduce the environmental impact. It
    is noteworthy that in such environments, the need for context-sensitive assistance
    and support that can autonomously plan timely directive actions and pre-emptive
    guidelines becomes a real vital necessity. Within the PA domain the approach will
    make the most of the WSN technology to provide services, expertise guidelines
    and farming relevant-information and hence will radically transform the way agriculture-related
    services are conceived and delivered. This paper presents a novel architecture
    that provides efficient means and decision-making mechanisms geared towards maximizing
    production and profits while taking into consideration the optimal utilization
    of various natural and artificial farming resources in precision agriculture.
    The architecture models PA entities as autonomous agents that collaborate to monitor
    soil, crops and climate in a farm field, and hence, provide timely decisions to
    facilitate real-time agricultural activities such as irrigation, fertilizer and
    pesticide application, for specific parts of a field proactively and in real time.
    Given the open, non-deterministic, and the dynamic nature of the entities participating
    in PA activities require the ability to change configuration according to their
    roles such as agronomists, inspectors, aquatic ecologists, foresters and Arborists.
    Moreover, farmers and agricultural personnel need spontaneous answers to various
    questions that are usually susceptible to a conjecture and speculation and prone
    to very intuitive analysis. It is clear that the design and implementation of
    solutions within distributed, open and heterogenous milieus such as the PA environments
    require a new modeling paradigm, integration architectures, and reliable uninterrupted
    self-configurable services. Such paradigm must describe the organization of the
    entities within the PA environment and the interconnection among them. Moreover,
    it must implement real-time smart monitoring to facilitate the various agriculture
    operations through managing the activities to enable the coordination amongst
    various PA entities and support the ad hoc and automated configurations. Given
    the aforementioned characteristics of the PA environment, agent-orientation is
    a suitable design paradigm as it provides the ability to monitor and coordinate
    PA tasks among services by providing adequate interaction mechanisms. Such paradigm
    enables modeling the nature of the PA environment being open, distributed, and
    heterogeneous environments in which an agent operates as part of a community of
    systems, as well as, human users. In this work, the notion of agent-hood is defined
    as a metaphorical conceptualization tool that captures, supports and implements
    features at a high level of abstraction (knowledge level), which is useful for
    the PA environment. These features are classified as primary features such as
    rationality and coordination; and secondary features such as intelligence and
    learning. The paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2, presents the evolution of
    the agriculture domain with the evolvement of technology, Sect. 3, presents agriculture
    4.0 conceptual model, Sect. 4, provides a review of enabler technologies and existing
    related approaches, Sect. 5, presents details of the a multi-agent architecture
    for PA, Sect. 6, presents the architecture and the necessary means and decision-making
    mechanisms that are geared towards the optimal utilization of natural and artificial
    farming resources in precision agriculture, Sect. 7, presents a prototype implementation
    using JADE (Java Agent Development platform) to support monitoring and control
    capabilities in precision agriculture environments, Sect. 8, provides a conclusion
    and discussion. 1.1 Agriculture Evolution The practice of agriculture existed
    since ancient days where human nurtured lands and raised animals to survive. With
    the evolvement of technology, the agriculture domain has been adopting the existence
    of the current technology and evolved from manual processes to automated ones.
    Figure 1 presents the evolution of the Agriculture 1.0 to the current existence
    of Agriculture 4.0 based on the industrial evolution. Traditional agriculture1.0
    relied on simple tools, manpower, and animal forces with low productivity. In
    the 19th century, with industrial evolution of steam engines, the use of machinery
    that is operated by farmers in agriculture 2.0, as well as the use of chemicals.
    Fig. 1. Evolution of agriculture with the industrial evolution Full size image
    This allowed for an increase in productivity of farm operations, however, it brought
    to the agriculture domain other issues related to the field contaminations, destruction
    to the eco-environment, and waste of natural resources. In the 20th century, the
    evolution of computing with computer programs and robotics enabled the agricultural
    machines to perform farming operations efficiently and intelligently, and hence,
    the 3rd agricultural evolution (Agriculture 3.0). This allowed in the reduction
    of chemical usage by optimizing the use of machinery, as well as, the improvement
    in the precision of irrigation. Current technologies and techniques within the
    fourth industrial revolution such as Cloud Computing, Internet of Things (IoT),
    Big Data, Artificial Intelligence, and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) allowed
    for more improvements to the agriculture domain and the existence of Agriculture
    4.0. Such technologies and techniques provide significant improvements within
    the agriculture domain in relation to the operation and the production. The work
    in [1] utilized IoT and WSN to optimize the production efficiency through efficient
    use of energy and water, as well as on maximizing on the agriculture quality,
    minimizing the impact on the environment. Moreover, the use of machine learning
    techniques in [19] to provide rich recommendations and insights for farmers to
    make adequate decisions within the agriculture domain. Other works looked into
    the efficient use of water for irrigation by utilizing IoT, WSN, and Cloud Computing
    [2, 20]. This paper explores the Agriculture 4.0 and the development of the smart
    system and devices using the multi-agent system paradigm with the support of the
    current existing technologies such the IoT, WSN, and Cloud Computing. 1.2 Agriculture
    4.0 Conceptual Model The conceptual model presents the required layer to deliver
    on agriculture 4.0 which enables precision agriculture. Figure 2 shows the architecture
    with the essential layer. The following subsections elaborate on the main functionalities
    of each layer and its contributions to enable the current agriculture 4.0. Fig.
    2. Agriculture 4.0 conceptual model Full size image Physical Layer. The current
    Industry 4.0 requires the definition of any object into the physical space and
    the digital space. The physical layer consists of domain related sensors (such
    as moisture sensor), transducers, and micro controllers/servers. The sensors provide
    the electrical signal readings within the agriculture environment. The electrical
    signals with the transducers are then shifted, scaled, and/or amplified with the
    micro controller/server digital, analog, and serial communication ports. Some
    decisions could be made with the aid of the micro controller/server device at
    the edge. such decision could be related to the operation of some of the resources
    related to the agriculture environment such as the irrigation system. The collected
    data from the physical layer is transmitted through the agriculture communication
    network layer through the supported protocols for the purpose of data storage
    and processing. Communication Layer. This layer is to make use of the adequate
    communication protocols and technologies in the transmission of the collected
    data from the sensor devices within the agriculture domain. This is an essential
    layer that provides the ability to connect the physical resources (in the physical
    layer) into the digital space. The digital space usually does not exist within
    the same network as the physical location of the farm, and hence, this requires
    access to the Wide Area Network (WAN). This can be either wired or wireless. Wireless
    communication network has been around for decades and has evolved from the first-generation
    to the current fifth generation of mobile communication network. Data Collection
    and Storage Layer. This layer provides the ability to collect, aggregate, and
    model the data captured from the physical layer. This data provides the ability
    for the control layer to provide the adequate decisions based on the collected
    agriculture data from the farmlands. The aggregated data may involve current collected
    data, as well as, historical data, depending on the model generated. Data from
    the agriculture domain can be either structured or semi-structured. Control Layer.
    This layer provides the ability to manage and decide upon specific criteria within
    the agriculture domain such as increasing productivity, allocating resources effectively,
    adapting to climate changes, and avoid food wastage. the layer contains Decision
    Support Systems (DSS) that provides the ability to provide the right decision
    as the right time depending on the implemented criteria. The DSS may utilize specific
    design paradigm and techniques for the agriculture domain such as Agent Oriented
    (AO) design paradigm and machine learning approaches that utilized current and
    historical data from the data collection and storage layer. Application Layer.
    This Layer Provides the Ability for the End User Within the Precision Agriculture
    to Interact with the System. The Layer Provides the Web Portal with the Exposed
    Services and Functionalities. Security Layer. This is an Essential Layer Since
    Each of the Aforementioned Layer Can Be Vulnerable to Various Malicious Attacks.
    Agriculture 4.0 Solutions Must Implement Security Practices to Protect the Full
    Environment from Information Disclosure, as Well as from Unauthorized Access,
    Improper Usage, Modification, or Destruction of Resources and Services. The Goal
    of the Security Layer is to Safeguard the PA Assets from Any Vulnerability Risks,
    Provide Confidentiality and Ensure the Integrity and the Overall Intrinsic Service
    Availability. These Goals Are Supported Through the Use of Authentication, Authorization,
    and Auditing Processes. 2 Enabling Technologies for Precision Agriculture With
    the rapid advancement in information technology, tremendous effort was devoted
    to developing new technological venues and design paradigms such as cloud computing,
    ubiquitous computing, and the context-aware computing in many application domains.
    Traditional agricultural management and processing methods need to be complemented
    by innovative sensing and driving technologies and state of the art technologies.
    Current trends of Agriculture 4.0 adopted innovative design and modelling paradigms
    as well as AI-based technologies. Precision agriculture is one of the promising
    application domains in which several technologies such as adaptive planning and
    scheduling, pattern recognition, neuron networks and machine learning models and
    methods, big data and predictive analytics were proposed [3, 9, 14, 25, 35]. Although
    more complex definitions exist, it was claimed that term of PA was first coined
    in 1997 by the US House of Representatives, in which the PA was defined as “an
    integrated information- and production-based farming system that is designed to
    increase long term, site-specific and whole farm production efficiency, productivity
    and profitability while minimizing unintended impacts on wildlife and the environment”.
    Within this context, Precision Agriculture is viewed as a farming management concept
    based upon monitoring, computing and responding to variability either in crops
    and produces or in aspects of animal rearing and cultivation [6]. While the focus
    of some definitions was impacted by the modern technical approaches on climate
    change, such as climate smart agriculture, for which the definition of the PA
    was aimed to develop the structural policies and the proper techniques that will
    achieve sustainable agricultural development to achieve food security under climate
    change. Other definitions envisioned that PA was not only restricted to the cropping
    systems per-se, but to include the entire agricultural production system such
    as animal industries, fisheries and forestry. Other approaches were proposed in
    the context-aware computing and grid computing based architecture [7, 17]. However,
    the main focus of these paradigms was geared towards the automation of collaboration
    activities and computation on a global scale. Several solutions were proposed
    to support agricultural activities and domain services that use real-time sensing
    networks for site sprinkle irrigation and control of watering via Bluetooth wireless
    technology [5, 11, 12, 18, 23]. Other approaches proposed several ways of controlling
    infertility through sensing capabilities and hence, the increase of soil fertility
    [13, 16]. Some of the existing approaches provide decision-based monitoring architecture
    for pesticide control and disease monitoring prediction that address climate change
    and hence, predict rampant pest outbreaks and diseases [6, 29, 30]. Observing
    climate and soil relative parameters such as humidity, temperature and plants
    moisture are used as vital indicators to the development of the disease in potato
    fields was exhibited with the utilization of wireless sensors. Phenomena such
    as the Internet of Things [31] and Big Data as well as the utilization of Cloud
    Computing resources and Artificial Intelligence techniques are gaining a prominent
    acceptance and expected to leverage the development of various precision agriculture
    application [32]. Massive volumes of various data can be captured, analyzed and
    thus used for better automated control and decision-making. Wolfert provides a
    comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art of big data applications in smart
    farming and identifies the related socio-economic challenges [34]. In spite of
    the prominent rapid development of computer technology, field measurements of
    agricultural environment parameters and spatial data collection still depend highly
    on human intervention, stationary sensors and very traditional data repositories
    such as data loggers, paper-based records and static storage sources which are
    labor-intensive and prone to very vital errors. In this work, Precision Agriculture
    is viewed as: an abstraction level at which the agricultural environment is viewed
    as a coherent universe that provides coordination solutions to a variety of agricultural
    entities in open distributed and heterogeneous settings. 3 Multi-agent Architecture
    for Precision Agriculture Farmers and agricultural personnel entities such as
    agronomists, inspectors, aquatic ecologists, foresters and arborists within a
    PA environment need spontaneous answers to various questions that are usually
    susceptible to a lot of conjecture and speculation and prone to very intuitive
    analysis. The main challenge in PA is how to adopt an adequate technology that
    provides means and mechanisms to improve field-level management with regards to,
    crop monitoring, farming practices and crop needs. Multi-agent design paradigm
    provides and improved integration architectures, and services for monitoring and
    control of the PA environment. Moreover, the multiagent design paradigm provides
    the ability to implement real-time smart monitoring to facilitate various agriculture
    operations and thus enables the interaction amongst various PA entities and supports
    the ad hoc and automated configurations. In the traditional point-to-point interaction
    patterns, entities engage directly with each other to satisfy controlled and directed
    coordination. It is clearly obvious that in such configuration is both inflexible
    and computationally expensive. For instance, there is no separation of concerns
    and responsibilities between the computation elements and the incurred required
    interactions and coordination. The lack of a distinct medium that deals solely
    with the coordination activities, imposes a considerable overhead on the entities
    in which they have to carry out the “interaction work” themselves to satisfy common
    or local task, in addition to their fundamental computational responsibilities.
    As an alternative, a capability-based coordination approach for interaction is
    a favorable and effective choice in which entities does not need to be concerned
    with how the interaction is performed or done. In this work, we consider the agent
    technology as the applicable medium that supports the coordination approach that
    is based on the capabilities of the agents within the PA environment. The notion
    of agent-hood is defined as a metaphorical conceptualization tool that implements
    features within the PA environment at a high-level of abstraction at the knowledge
    level. These features are classified as primary features such as rationality and
    coordination; and secondary features such as intelligence and learning. The multi-agent
    architecture for PA takes into consideration the creation of a smart environment
    with the ability to combine distributed information sources that may have different
    schemas. Furthermore, it provides a level of assistance to agriculturists through
    the ability to integrate distributed multi-modal sensors and actuators, and further
    analyze the integrated information. Such heterogeneity of the PA environment adds
    burden on fulfilling the interoperability among the different PA participants.
    Many semantic solutions were proposed in the literature in order to solve the
    problem of data heterogeneity and providing interoperability between the devices,
    sensors and relevant entities in PA, such as semantic annotations, linked sensor
    data, and ontologies. In addition, different information models might use different
    ontologies languages in terms of representations, which make the process of the
    semantic interoperability a complicated activity. Thus, our presented agent-based
    architecture defines an ontological view and representation that act as an explicit
    semantic ontology, which consequently provide meaningful integration processes
    such as matching, mapping, and aligning as well as enabling the interoperability
    among the PA entities. 3.1 Modeling the Precision Agriculture Smart Environment
    The architecture for a smart PA environment can be viewed as a multi-layered system.
    The nodes of a WSN are composed of sensors that collect data from the agriculture
    field. Sensors may also get data from other nodes by exchanging messages. The
    data obtained from the WSN describes how properties vary within agriculture fields.
    This information is then used to analyze and predict values that provide efficient
    control of important farming operations. The results of the interventions are
    monitored, recorded and used as a starting point to initiate the next crop cycle.
    From the collection and intelligent analysis of these parameters can then plan
    interventions such as fertilizers, irrigation and plant protection treatments
    tailored to the actual needs of the crop, which is implemented only when necessary.
    The positive effects of a site-specific management of agricultural practices affect
    not only the quantity and quality of products, but also a significant reduction
    in production costs and more effective action to protect the environment by reducing
    the use of pesticides. This approach also allows identifying and evaluating the
    risk indices plant pathology in order to implement appropriate strategies of “integrated
    pest management”. Figure 3 shows the proposed PA environment as a collection of
    software agents that interact autonomously and cooperatively analyze information,
    generate valuable decisions, and accordingly provide agricultural directives and
    guidelines. Fig. 3. Smart environment monitoring and control architecture for
    PA Full size image Agent-orientation provides the ability to develop entities
    that are able to detect and react to the nature of PA dynamic stimuli. Agent-hood
    features such as autonomy, reactivity and mobility drive certain desirable similarities
    with WSN. These similarities can be summarized as follow: Reactivity: Agents are
    able to detect and react to events, and external stimuli. Ability to work asynchronously:
    The agents come into operation, upon receipt of a stimulus. In PA, this feature
    favors the implementation of techniques to ensure that messages are asynchronously
    delivered and managed over the network. Autonomy: Agents have control over their
    actions and the various internal states without an intervention of humans. In
    a PA environment, this condition is very useful, since if any node in the network
    fails, the network must be able to meet its target objectives without impacting
    the overall common goals such as sustainability, availability and robustness.
    Communication capability: Agents need to interact and communicate to achieve their
    goals. The communication component defines the language and the set of protocols
    of exchanging messages. This ability is reflected in the distribution of information
    obtained from sensors or from other network nodes. Coordination and Cooperation.
    The agent must be able to perform tasks and coordinate their interaction through
    collaboration with other agents. The coordination defines both the system structure
    and the Interaction mechanism and the cooperation defines the policies that govern
    the interaction. Mobility: It is the ability of an agent to move around a specific
    network. The deployed node is in mobility to either track or get the data from
    a corresponding PA field. Agent Architecture. The agents of the PA environment
    are built on the foundation of Collaborative Intelligence Rational (CIR) agent
    architecture with the focus on utilizing the model to capture the participating
    agent’s behavior towards achieving the desirable goal. Each agent has two main
    components: 1) Knowledge Component, 2) Capability Component. Each component is
    designed according to the agent’s specific role [21]. The knowledge component
    consists of the following: The agent’s self-knowledge based on its role within
    the PA environment. The knowledge of the other agents within the PA environment.
    The specific goals to be satisfied within the PA environment. Possible solutions
    to satisfy each goal within the PA environment. The local history of the PA environment
    that consists of all possible local solutions for an agent at any given time.
    Agent’s desires commitments and intentions toward achieving each goal within the
    PA environment. The capability component consists of the following: The domain
    actions which contains the possible set of actions that impacts the state of the
    PA environment when executed. The communication where each agent within the PA
    environment sends and receives messages. The problem solver which consists of
    reasoning algorithms that are executed based on the role of the agent to satisfy
    its goal. The generated solution from the problem solver within the agent depends
    on the aforementioned knowledge component. From Fig. 3, we can observe the interdependency
    challenge among the Ontology Agent, Personal Assistant Agent, and the Gateway
    Agent. Interdependency is defined as a goal-relevant interrelationship between
    actions performed by various participating agents [22]. The coordination mechanisms
    reduce and resolve the issues associated with interdependencies. Furthermore,
    the agent’s interaction module identifies the type of interdependencies that exists
    within the PA environment and accordingly utilizes the suitable interaction device.
    The interaction devices are categorized as: Contract-based, includes the assignment
    device; Negotiation-based, includes resource scheduling, conflict resolution,
    synchronization, and redundancy avoidance devices [10]. The interdependency within
    the PA domain is classified as capability interdependency and the interaction
    device is the “assignment” device. The main function of the assignment device
    is to resolve problems associated with capability interdependencies. The basic
    characteristics of the assignment device are problem specifications and evaluation
    parameters. With reducing complexity in achieving a goal as the agent’s main objective,
    a solution can be selected based on the goal quality. The basic characteristics
    of the assignment device are problem specifications, evaluation parameters, and
    the sub-processes. The problem specifications might include, for example, the
    request, the desired-satisfying time, and the expiration time. A collection of
    basic components comprises the structure of the agent model and represents its
    capabilities. The proposed architecture defines three types of rational intelligent
    agents, namely: The Personal Assistant Agent (PAA), the Ontology Agent (OA) and
    the Gateway Agent (GA). Personal Assistant Agent (PAA): possesses the capability
    of three major components: 1) the communication component, 2) the analysis data
    component, and 3) the decision-making component. The role of the PAA is to formulate
    the agriculturists’ request and collects the various climates relevant readings
    obtained from the PA environment. Upon receiving these readings, the PAA analyses
    the information and determines the ideal settings and the possible recommended
    set of needed actions (for example, if the humidity or temperature exceeds/less
    than a predefined value, an action alert will be generated). In order for the
    PAA to capture the other agents’ model, it has to be able to communicate only
    about facts that can be represented and expressed in the defined ontology view
    and representation. In other words, agents need to adhere to the ontological semantic
    and structure. Moreover, in order for the PAA to fulfill this capability, it asks
    the Ontology Agent (OA) for the definitions and possibly requests translation
    of agricultural terms and concepts inherent is a specific request. Ontologies
    provide support for semantic data and semantic integration. However, there are
    many cases where organizational, cultural, or infrastructural constraints hide
    or even disallow the adoption of such semantic artifacts, in other words, there
    is a lack of explicit ontologies. Ontology Agent (OA): captures and defines the
    set of agriculture concepts, set of activities and domain events. It provides
    various abstract levels of domain knowledge within the PA related applications
    and hence derives the decision–making process. The corresponding ontology specifies
    a formal representation for the different agricultural concepts (semantic ans
    syntax) and the different relationships amongst these concepts. This ontology
    must be agreed and understood by the agent community that constitute the PA environment
    (or at least among its part) in order to enable each agent to understand messages
    from other participants. The formal precision agriculture ontology presented in
    this work adopts a similar structure defined by Goumopoulos [11] that can be formally
    represented as follows $$ PA_{Onto} = \\left( {Ont_{Des} , PA_{Concept} ,PA_{Relation}
    , Axioms} \\right) $$ The \\(Ont_{Des}\\) is a tuple that consists of the following
    elements: \\({ }Ont_{Des} \\equiv \\langle OntID,{ }DevId,{ }ver,{ }md{ }\\rangle\\),
    where \\({ }OntID\\) is the ontology name, \\(DevId\\) defines the device name,
    \\(ver\\) specifies the time of relevant to ontology creation and \\(md{ }\\)
    represents the source and the purpose of the ontology metadata information. The
    \\(PA_{Concept} { }\\) represents the PA set of concepts and terminologies; \\(PA_{Relation}\\)
    defines both the set of hierarchical and non-hierarchical relationships between
    the PA concepts and \\(Axioms\\) are these assertions (including rules) in a logical
    form. The representation of the PA Ontology captures the knowledge of various
    agricultural resources in terms of their classifications and descriptions. In
    this work, the knowledge representation of ontology adheres to the five-elements
    ontology approach, which can be formally, represents as follows: $$ Ont \\equiv
    \\left\\{ {C, Attr^{c} , Rel^{c} , Attr^{Rel} , H^{c} } \\right\\} $$ The \\(C\\)
    defines the set of agricultural concepts and terminologies; \\(Attr^{c}\\) is
    the set of all the possible states defined by the attributes of each concept;
    \\(Rel^{c}\\) is the set of relationships among the ontological agricultural concepts;
    \\(Attr^{Rel}\\) defines the various attributes of specific relationship along
    with the applicable multiplicities. All dependencies can be further viewed in
    terms of a generalization (is-a) or aggregation (part-whole) relationships; \\(H^{c}\\)
    specifies the concept hierarchy and its sub-elements. For example, the potato’s
    insecticide control ontology shall adhere to the aforementioned representation
    in which the elements will be defined as follows: \\(C\\) = {Plant, Insects, Pests,
    Insecticide, potato, Blister beetle, Aphid, Grubs, Russell Potato, White Potato,
    moisture, hydrometer} \\(Attr^{c}\\) = {(Name, Plant), (Reading, Moisture), (Poisoning
    percentage, Insecticide), (Color, Grubs)} \\(Rel^{c}\\) = {Kill (Insecticide,
    Aphid)} \\(Attr^{Rel}\\) = {((Name, (is-a), Plant)), ((Nutrients, (is-composed-of),
    ingredients))} \\(H^{c} \\) = {(Potato, Solanaceae), (Blister beetle, Insect),
    (Aphid, pests), (Herbicides, Insecticide)}. The Gateway Agent (GA): has the role
    of information gathering that receives sensors’ readings based on pre-set sampling
    intervals. For each sensor set, the GA is assigned the task of retrieving readings
    from the underlying scattered sensors based on the defined ontology. The GA monitors
    the status of the sensors and performs checking operations and set the data collection
    frequency. It is noteworthy that the PA environment encompasses different kinds
    of sensors with various specifications. The GA supports on-demand reading delivery
    as well as the full pre-defined measurement lifecycle. The knowledge component
    of the GA includes the sensors model available in the PA environment starting
    from the registration of physical sensor nodes as well as the addition or removal
    of a physical sensor. The knowledge component also contains a description of the
    sensors measuring capability, the agricultural terms understood and the description
    of the relationship between the concepts. The domain knowledge provides mappings
    models for transforming a domain queries into a set of queries to the appropriate
    target sensors. All these models need to be stated in an expressive common language
    that can allow capturing all the relevant distinctions amongst various terms and
    concepts as per the aforementioned ontology view. The gateway agent’s capability
    component identifies, dynamically selects the appropriate sensor and accordingly
    retrieves the relevant readings. Query processing requires developing a plan for
    obtaining the requested data. It is noteworthy, that the gateway agent also acts
    as a firewall and a proxy server to prevent unauthorized access to the private
    agricultural field network. 4 Agent-Based PA Implementation Directives The proposed
    architecture is validated by implementing the system of the PA in a real environment.
    The implementation of the system is viewed as a collection of tiers and layers
    with various autonomous agents that can act independently and cooperate in providing
    services and synergize agricultural environmental and spatial data according to
    mutual interests. The model provides querying ability and coordination activities
    that enhance the overall connectivity of distributed, autonomous, and heterogeneous
    WSN information sources in PA. In this work the Mote-View WSN package [4] was
    used as the “client tier” application interface for control and monitoring supervision
    for a specific topology of wireless sensors deployment [33]. 4.1 Hardware Specifications
    Two types of sensors were used; namely: the (MEP410) for microclimate and ambient
    light monitoring, and (MEP510) sensor, in addition to a gateway (MIP520) [33].
    The sensors and the gateway are installed with the distance between the nodes
    is 3.5 m. Each WSN package contains of the following: Radio Platform (PR2400CA):
    the platform is based on a low-power microcontroller (AtmelATmega128L) and runs
    MoteWorks [24] that is an end-to-end platform for the creation of wireless sensor
    networks applications and the processing of simultaneous radio communications.
    Data Acquisition Board (MDA300CA): a compliant data acquisition board that can
    adopt various types of sensors. The board contains standard environmental measurements
    sensors such as ambient temperature, humidity, soil moisture, leaf wetness and
    atmospheric pressure. Sensor Node: Each sensor node consists of 2.4 GHz MICAz
    mote, MDA300CA data acquisition board, Irrometer Soil moisture sensor, atmospheric
    pressure sensor MPX4115A, and leaf wetness sensor. The board is managed and controlled
    by an operating system (TinyOS). TinyOS is an open-source operating system designed
    for low-power wireless devices [28] and event-driven programming language [8].
    Sink Node: The Sensor –System interface is supported by MIB510, which provides
    data transfer and allows aggregation of sensor network data on different computer
    platforms via an RS-232 serial programming interface. Additionally, the sensor
    node (MICAz) acts as a base station when assembled with the MIB510 interface board
    [8]. 4.2 Software Specifications The Mote-View software framework is used for
    managing, monitoring, and visualizing sensor network deployments. The modules
    within the Mote-View client are conceptually viewed as a multi-tier-based architecture
    in which four layers provide dedicated services (see Fig. 4). Fig. 4. MOTE-VIEW
    client-tier abstraction of sensor network data Full size image A Data Access Abstraction
    Layer (data layer), comprises the PostgreSQL relational database [26] and captures
    various system data such sensors readings, and environment corresponding surroundings
    information as well as a real-time measurements’ readings. The Node Status and
    Configuration Layer (Node Layer) manages all the relevant sensor configuration
    and gets updates upon successful events that are sent from the data layer; Calibration
    and Conversion Layer which provides calibration and data conversion service to
    the measured parameters and uses calibration coefficients raw data readings. The
    Presentation layer provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for to provide users
    of wireless sensor networks an end-to-end management and supervision of a specific
    sensor’s deployment. Each layer includes a plug-in capability for providing modular
    extensions. The Mote-View package consists of the following modules. MoteViews:
    it is software used for collecting data from the nodes in different fields. XSniffer:
    Monitors the 802.15.4 wireless network packets. MoteConfig: it is a Windows-based
    GUI utility for programming Motes. This utility provides an interface for configuring
    and downloading pre-compiled XMesh/TinyOS firmware applications onto Motes. Cygwin:
    is a command-line interface. 4.3 Experiment Environment Setting The proposed architecture
    was tested under experimental conditions and was meant as a proof-of-concept.
    Two rows of shallow trenches, one meter apart was dug and seed potatoes half (½)
    meter apart were planted accordingly, each seed location is characterized by a
    soil moisture sensor. The temperature sensor was installed halfway between the
    two rows and mounds it against the plants, burying the stems halfway. A total
    of seven sensors (Mica2 motes) were organized in a parcel for monitoring the crop
    and recording the temperature and relative humidity. In order to maintain an effective
    network connectivity and reliable communication, the sensors were installed at
    a height of 50 cm. It is noteworthy that during the potatoes flowering, the radio
    range was dramatically affected and thus manual adjustments for the sensor’s heights
    were required. All the system settings, readings and corresponding sensors data
    were captured in multiple databases by using the PostgreSQL DBMS. The implementation
    utilizes the JADE platform [15]. JADE is a software framework geared towards developing
    agent applications in compliance with the FIPA specifications for multi-agent
    systems. JADE supports a distributed environment of agent containers and allow
    several agents to execute concurrently. The role of the PAA agent is to formulate
    the service requests, sends it out to all gateway agents and collects the required
    information, evaluates the received data, determines the applicable decision accordingly
    and notifies the corresponding agent about the outcomes. The knowledge component
    includes the agent’s self-model, model of gateway and ontology agents, and the
    local history. The main capabilities of the PAA agent include communication, reasoning
    and domain actions components. The PAA problem-solver component incorporates the
    Jade behavior classes (simpleBehaviors and cyclicBehaviors) that fulfill tasks
    such as registration with the directory facilitator (DF) service and to handle
    the various incoming messages and requests. The cyclic behavior class equips the
    PAA agent with ability to check for service results that have been sent by the
    gateway agents. The communication component inherits the jade.Core.Agent and jade.lang.acl.ACLMessage
    existing classes of the jade platform. These classes enable constructing ACL messages
    by utilizing the various FIPA performatives such as REQUEST, INFORM, INFORM-DONE,
    and QUERY-IF. The messages exchanged in the interaction contain a set of one or
    more message elements. The elements vary according to the coordination scenario;
    however, the only mandatory element in all the ACL messages is the performative.
    A message might additionally include the sender name or signature, the receiver
    and the possibly a content. Agents are able to get contents and set the content
    of a particular message by overriding the methods setContent and getContent. The
    coordination component uses the FipaContractNetBehaviour for the interaction and
    negotiation patterns based on the soliciting approach as in the case of the contract-net
    approach which depends on (1) the modeling approach for other agent’s capabilities,
    and (2) the solicitation approach for the local schedule and workload of other
    agents. To capture the PA ontology and to represent the domain knowledge, the
    Protégé [27] extendible framework is used in this work. The use of Protégé permits
    exporting the ontology in various formats such as OWL (Web Ontology Language)
    and RDF (Resource Description Framework). The JADE Abstract Ontology is implanted
    using the SimpleJADEAbstractOntology. For Frames ontologies, the SimpleJADEAbstractOntology
    is inherited and for the OWL ontologies, the OWLSimpleJADEAbstractOntoloigy package
    is imported. 5 Conclusions Precision agriculture is a new paradigm that is geared
    to accommodate the increasing demand for food and nutrient using state-of-the-art
    technologies. These technologies have emerged as a proper choice not only to make
    the agricultural activities simpler, but cheaper to collect and apply data, and
    to adapt to changing environmental conditions while using the resources most efficiently.
    The proposed agent-based monitoring and control architecture promotes innovative
    model that can protect field crops, manage and control real-time agricultural
    activities in a novel modern approach. The timely decisions exhibited by the modcel
    are very desirable fundamental directives for optimizing production activities
    of precision agriculture users. The architecture depicts a a promising trend in
    moving from an intensive-labor and time-consuming work to an automated, real-time,
    and cost-effective monitoring, control and decision-making architecture that can
    enhance the PA prospective and objectives. By utilizing the Agent-Oriented paradigm,
    the Precision Agriculture domain environment is modelled at a high level of abstraction
    and viewed collectively as a coherent universe of interacting and collaborative
    agents that provide high degree of decentralization of capabilities, which is
    the key to system scalability and extensibility. The ontology model specifies
    formal schemata and intelligent view for developing and representing efficient
    of agricultural knowledge across various agriculture information sources. It is
    noteworthy that the number of physical parameters that need to be observed and
    monitored can be captured by introducing relevant sensor types as long as these
    attached sensors are registered and initiated with the Gateway Agent (GA). Furthermore,
    the model can accommodate control-based sensors for actuators and motors which
    can be remotely switched on and off to perform automatic activities such as irrigation
    and pesticide spraying activities. The utilization of the WSN technology and the
    proposed model was realized and tested under lab conditions where physical parameters
    (such as soil temperature and soil moisture) can be easily captured and transmitted
    for further decision making. References Blackmore, S., Stout, B., Wang, M., Runov,

    the farming sector should benefit with new tools and techniques coming from Information

    deployment of sensing devices has increased considerably in the field of agriculture.
    This fact has led to a new concept called smart agriculture, and it contemplates

    Organization (FAO) predicts that the global population will reach 8 billion people
    by 2025 and 9.6 billion people by 2050 [1]. To keep pace, food production must
    increase 70% by 2050. There are some obstacles to increase food production and
    produce such amount of food. Some of them are climate change; restricted availability
    of arable land; reduced productivity growth; water necessity; the impact of urbanization
    over agricultural labour; high price and low availability of energy, mainly from
    fossil fuels; among many others. Moreover, the average age of farmers is increasing
    because young people prefer going into the industry [2]. A report from the Intergovernmental
    Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) [3] enumerates all effects of climate change on
    agriculture. They are: 1) changes in extreme weather with severe flooding and
    acute water shortages areas will increase around the globe; 2) Since agriculture
    consumes 70% of the world''s fresh water supply, water management should be an
    adequate and controlled process. To mitigate these challenges, the FAO [4] recommends
    that all farming sectors should be equipped with new tools and techniques coming
    from the Information and Communications Technology (ICT). During the last decade,
    a new movement to implant digital technology on agriculture was born, which is
    known as precision agriculture [5]. It aims to optimize the yield per unit of
    farming land by using ICT tools and technologies [6]. The objective of precision
    agriculture is to achieve the best products concerning quality, quantity and economic
    conditions. Traditionally, precision agriculture makes use of sensors to monitor
    environmental conditions. To attain this objective, networks of these sensors
    are created to cover larger areas. Precision agriculture is not only attached
    to deploying on-site sensors but involving many areas related to robotics, computer
    science, and remote sensing. An example of this is the use of smartphones, which
    have been used to visualize on the field the data provided by sensors and offer
    the possibility to apply different strategies to improve productivity [7]. The
    works presented in [8], [9] exploit the use of advances in neural networks for
    weed detection and plant species identification with the purpose of optimizing
    the herbicide application. Finally, the review introduced in [10] showed the improvements
    of the spatial resolution in aerial and satellite imagery for precision agriculture
    since the late 80s, which now allows fine-grained analysis at the expense of high
    data storage and computational resources. In the last decade, a new approach to
    connect everything (sensors or actuators), as well as to monitor and act [11]
    using the Internet, was implanted in every aspect of our daily lives; this process
    has come to be called the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT describes how in the real
    world, physical things are integrated into the digital world of bits and bytes
    [12]. In general, it involves the integration of each object, such as a sensor
    or device that is connected via wired or wireless networks using the Internet.
    To connect things, the Internet Protocol (IP) is used, in which each device has
    an IP address. The IoT devices need a mechanism to communicate with the cloud
    side, which is called Machine to Machine (M2M) communications. M2M will work with
    new developments and contributes to the future of Internet [13]. Nowadays, the
    future of the Internet will not only consist of connecting people but also to
    the approach of a digital world where, ideally, everything will be connected.
    Every day farmers are producing large amounts of data that are published on the
    cloud, with the aim of delivering benefits concerning data access, synchronization
    storage and to apply some analysis, the so-called Cloud Computing (CC), to make
    decisions. New trends that appeared after CC move the computation towards the
    smart devices; the benefit is to distribute the computing between different things.
    This paradigm is called Edge Computing (EC) [14]. The connection between the IoT
    and M2M with precision agriculture have produced a new concept called “smart agriculture”
    following other M2M based implementations such as smart cities. One of the realms
    in which more great adaptation of such technologies has been incorporated is the
    viticulture. Viticulture has historically been characterized by obtaining a high-quality
    product. This has been made possible by many factors: the selection of suitable
    soil and climatic zones, the varietal vineyards and the work of the winegrowers
    in managing their vineyards. Many threats can affect quantity and quality of the
    wine. Concretely, there are some well-known plagues attacking vineyards, and they
    produce substantial losses. The vine is exposed to different types of diseases
    or harmful agents; these are classified into four types [15]. The first category,
    physiological damage or disorders in the vine that are not caused by pest and
    diseases, are generated by lack or excess of irrigation, extreme conditions due
    to meteorological factors, natural ageing, deficiencies or excesses of nutrients
    in the vine, lousy soil, irrigation with saline water, among many others. The
    second category, fungus, they can even grow in both wet and dry regions. Some
    examples of this disease are powdery mildew, downy mildew, and bunch rot and they
    can even grow well in both wet and dry regions. The third category, vine pests,
    and insects, the most damaging are those that feed on grapes, examples of them
    are: Tetranychus urticae, Meloidogyne, Heterodera, Ditylenchus, Lobesia botrana,
    Colomerus viti, Eriophyes vitis or Phylloxera vastatrix, among others. Finally,
    the last category is vine diseases generated by viruses and bacteria, like grapevine
    degeneration, grapevine decline, leafroll complex or rugose wood complex. All
    these diseases impoverish the quality of the grape, and as a result, they might
    cause severe economic losses to farmers and people related to the wine industry.
    Downy mildew is probably the most studied disease, as it produces critical economic
    losses in vineyards and, consequently, in wineries1 . Within this context, this
    paper introduces the SEnviro platform for vineyards, which integrates the downy
    mildew model [16] for detecting the most suitable moment to treat the downy mildew
    disease. In summary, the main contributions of this work are: 1. to apply a model
    to alert when would be the suitable moment to treat the downy mildew disease in
    the vineyard context; 2. to monitor vineyard fields through a new version of the
    SEnviro platform following the IoT paradigm and; 3. to follow the edge computing
    paradigm and to mitigate the communication between ends. The remainder of the
    paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the background of the IoT in
    edge computing, open hardware and smart agriculture. Section 3 presents the SEnviro
    Platform. Section 4 details the Goidanich model used to detect the suitable moment
    to apply treatment for the downy mildew disease. Section 5 shows the experimentation
    done to test the platform. Section 6 reviews the related work. The paper concludes
    in Section 7 with conclusions and future work. 2. Background This section is devoted
    to showing the background of the IoT, Edge Computing, and Open Hardware paradigms.
    Also, their relation with precision agriculture through GIS is detailed. 2.1.
    IoT in the edge Cisco''s report anticipates that 50 million smart objects will
    be connected to the Internet by 2020 [17]. This situation will cause “data tsunami”
    which refers to the use of the IP to achieve connectivity between these smart
    objects. This trend produces streams of potential information, which challenge
    today''s data analysis systems in a centralized server in the Cloud [18], [19],
    [20]. IoT movement has been successfully applied in healthcare [21], [22], [23],
    [24] (ambient-assisted living and telemedicine), smart home and smart metering
    [25], [26] (devices that enable the automation of common in-house activities),
    video surveillance [?] (intelligent video systems), automotive and smart mobility
    [27], [28] (intelligent transportation systems) and smart energy and smart grid
    (intelligent management of energy distribution and consumption) [29]. All these
    applications have boosted up the popularity of “smart things” connected to the
    Internet, and the networks created with them. In this way, the traditional WSNs
    have been updated to follow an IP protocol to apply all the benefits that it entails.
    The new paradigm, namely cloud computing, has been added to improve and provide
    more advantages over the IoT [30]. The low bandwidth lacks between the producer
    (smart objects) and consumer parts (cloud server) and the improved performance
    at both computing and consumer of smart objects, has led to a new paradigm called
    edge computing. The main feature of edge computing is that data can be processed
    locally in smart devices, rather than being sent to the cloud for being processed.
    The edge computing essentially means that instead of staying and working from
    a centralized cloud, edge nodes work at the ends of the networks. Edge computing
    puts some of the transactions and resources on the edge of the cloud; instead
    of establishing channels for storage and use in the cloud, it reduces the need
    for bandwidth by not sending every bit of information through channels to the
    cloud and instead adds it in specific access points. By using this type of distributed
    strategy, we can reduce costs and increase efficiency and reduce bandwidth consumption.
    Edge computing arose from the need to address three issues: 1) being able to act
    in real-time with the incoming data; 2) working within the limits of available
    bandwidth; and 3) distributing the computing between the nodes, to relive the
    centralized server. Edge computing address applications and services that do not
    fit the paradigm of the cloud, such as applications that require very low latency
    and being predictable; geospatial distributed applications; fast mobile applications;
    distributed control systems on a large scale. Fig. 1 details the work-flow for
    connecting sensor nodes to users using a cloud and edge computing infrastructure.
    On the one hand, this figure divides the physical and cyber worlds and the IoT
    part with traditional IT. The Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) is used to pass
    the barrier between the IoT device cloud and the IT cloud [31]. It is responsible
    for the interworking between the GPRS network and Internet. On the other hand,
    the figure shows where the edge computing is located. The results offered by the
    edge computing can be sent to the cloud or directly to the clients without using
    any cloud infrastructure. Download : Download high-res image (165KB) Download

    and IT, that it is divided between the physical and cyber world. 2.2. Open-hardware
    to make smart objects Nowadays, the open movement has gained attention [32]. Traditionally,
    this idea was applied with more acceptance over source code and provoked the open-source
    movement. More recently, the same idea has been applied to the hardware (open-hardware).
    This situation has permitted to offer complete open systems, where both source
    and hardware are open. The users can contribute to improve the system and propose
    improvements. One of these improvements is the ability to offer more interoperability
    between components because they can be adapted for each usage. In this way, it
    reduces compatibility issues. This advantage can establish a standard IoT approach.
    In this work, we apply different Geographic Information Systems (GIS) standards
    to communicate with each IoT device; these standards will be explained in following
    paragraphs. Another advantage is the low cost of these devices compared with commercial
    solutions. As concluded by [33], open initiatives are cheaper, but they have also
    shown that open hardware is more powerful and has better performance than commercial
    solutions. Also, the same work demonstrates that the open hardware project can
    be considered reliable. Currently, there are several different alternatives regarding
    the micro-controller based platform, and the most remarkable platforms are Arduino2,
    Raspberry Pi3, BeagleBone4 or MSP430 Launchpad5 . All these platforms can be expanded
    easily, and used for other applications. Using these platforms different applications
    have been developed thanks to the acceptance of the IoT movement above described.
    2.3. GIS role in smart agriculture As commented in the Section 1, one way to address
    these issues and increase the quality and quantity of agricultural production
    is by using ICT to make farms more “intelligent” and more connected through the
    so-called “precision agriculture” also known as “smart agriculture”. Nowadays,
    there is a high quantity of proprietary IT solutions to help farmers manage their
    farms more effectively [34]. More advanced systems track geospatial zones, weather
    patterns and perform expert predictions [35]. These kinds of systems are called
    Farm Management Information Systems [36], and focus on specific tasks and use
    their specifications to implement the functionality provided. Currently, this
    field is slowly moving to use the Internet and is starting to use some of the
    networking solutions to improve what they offer to the end users. However, it
    is widely accepted that the Internet faces some shortcomings, especially in handling
    vast numbers of networked devices (IoT) or stakeholders. Moreover, there is still
    no standardized solution to enable cohesive and straightforward interoperability
    among services and stakeholders. To solve this issue, we look at GIScience. It
    can offer an excellent opportunity to standardize the ways of connecting different
    “things”, offering an interoperable connection; and it should help to deploy the
    new smart cities. GIScience can be defined as “the discipline that uses GIS as
    tools to understand the world” [37]. It can contribute by offering a crucial essential
    component for the IoT movement, which is interoperability using the use of standards.
    The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)6 is a non-profit international organization
    which develops open standards for the global geospatial community. OGC defines
    standards in a wide variety of domains including environment, defense, health,
    agriculture, meteorology, sustainable development, and smart cities. The OGC has
    standardized Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) as a set of specifications related to
    sensors, sensor data models, and sensor web services that will enable sensors
    to be accessible and controllable via the web [38]. It is composed of a set of
    standards; the most popular are: Observations and Measurements (O&M), SensorML,
    Sensor Observation Service (SOS), Transducer Model Language (TransducerML), Sensor
    Planning Service (SPS), Sensor Alert Service (SAS) or Web Notification Service
    (WNS). Another proposal is OGC SensorThings API7 . It is a new candidate standard
    that provides open access built on web protocols, based on the current SWE standard
    and following the architectural REST style. The aim is to provide a standardized
    a way to expose the IoT world to the real world, where things have limited resources.
    3. SEnviro platform This section presents the sensorized platform used in a smart
    agricultural context. As commented in the above sections, the platform Sense Our
    Environment (SEnviro) [39] follows the IoT and Web of Things (WoT) [40] paradigms
    by means of a low-cost, open-hardware and open-software, energetically efficient
    and autonomous and interoperable solution. The SEnviro platform uses the IP protocol
    to establish the connection. With these features, it can be considered that each
    SEnviro Thing is a smart object. A network is formed by joining several SEnviro
    Things. This platform makes use of standards when publishing data. It guarantees
    the interoperability of the services provided by the platform. Another important
    feature of this platform is that it is energetically efficient and autonomous
    through a battery cell, which is charged with the energy provided by a solar panel
    attached to it. To save as much energy as possible, we are using a sleep mode,
    in which during this period the micro-controller and connectivity module consume
    as little as possible. 3.1. How is SEnviro made of? At the hardware level, the
    sensorized platform has been designed to be a node acting as a smart object, which
    provides measures of environmental variables. Each SEnviro Thing is composed of
    different components, which are organized into four groups depending on their
    function: Core, Sensors, Power Supply and Communication. At the same time, the
    Core is formed by four parts: Micro-controller, Connectors, Clock, and Memory.
    For this work, we developed an enhanced SEnviro using the LinkIt One development
    board. The LinkIt ONE board is an open source, high performance, Arduino footprint
    board for prototyping IoT devices. The board is based around a powerful ARM7 EJ-S
    processor but has onboard GSM, GPRS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth BR/EDR/BLE, GPS, Audio codec,
    and SD card connector. Pin-out similar to Arduino boards, including Digital I/O,
    Analog I/O, PWM, I2C, SPI, UART and power supply, compatible with Grove 4-pin
    interface. In Section 5, we detail all components used to develop the SEnviro
    node for monitoring vineyards. 3.2. How does SEnviro work? At an operational level,
    SEnviro Thing can change its behaviour, updating the information about what sensor
    is active and the frequency at which measures are taken. The SEnviro Thing''s
    behaviour has two stages, initial and repetitive periodic. In the initial stage,
    a set of procedures are executed when it is initiated, for instance, one procedure
    could initialize the clock using the current time. The repetitive periodic stage
    defines the procedures that are repeated during the SEnviro Thing''s life cycle
    before going to sleep. Fig. 4 shows the design of the complete infrastructure
    with all of the system''s components, and describes each of them in different
    layers. If we analyze SEnviro from a GIS context and specify what is happening
    in each of its layers, we obtain Fig. 2, which we are going to detail below. In
    the content layer, there are different SEnviro Things to cover an area to measure
    the phenomena by the included sensors in each sensorized platform. In this figure,
    we can see the two functionalities mentioned above. Download : Download high-res

    different observations are periodically taken from the installed sensors to monitor
    the environment. When the SEnviro Thing takes a new observation, it invokes the
    Sensor Data Management (SDM) module. This component is implemented as a RESTful
    web service. The SDM module is responsible for publishing observations in different
    services that we want to offer, such as SensorThings API, SOS or others. Thus,
    it offers the same content using different interfaces; depending on the context
    it may be more or less appropriate. Different adapters for each of these services
    are offered. If we want to support new services/standards, we only need to add
    a new adapter for the service. We use the adapter software pattern to implement
    this feature. The service layer offers the services described above. One of the
    objectives of the SEnviro platform is to offer a standard service, to provide
    connectivity in an interoperable way. To meet this challenge, a candidate OGC
    standard, SensorThings API, has been used to offer an interoperable service to
    access the SEnviro platform. The most remarkable thing about this standard is
    that it breaks away from all “standard topics” [41] and offers access to restrictive
    devices, such as smartphones. Also, it offers the SOS interface to increase the
    interoperability, because this standard is widely used [42]. Finally, a lightweight
    RestFul service is created to connect this service in a more agile way [43]. The
    last layer, the application layer has been designed for different clients, mobile,
    web-based or desktop. The SEnviro Thing can adapt its behavior, updating the information
    about which sensor is active and the frequency at which measurements are taken.
    At regular intervals, the platform requests a new behavior to a server using a
    RestFul service. Then, the SEnviro Thing will get a new behavior following the
    new configuration received. The sensorized platform sends the taken observations
    to a server. A sensor collector service has been created to achieve this integration.
    Different operations are available to collect the observations measured. When
    one SEnviro Thing takes a new observation it invokes these operations to send
    data to the server using SDM module. When the SDM receives a new observation,
    it connects with the different adapters to send the data for each available service.
    To accomplish this objective, we have followed previous work [43], [39] to connect
    with different OGC instances, such as SOS and candidate standard SensorThings
    API. Also, we provide a lighter solution for data sensors access using RestFul
    interface used in [43]. To offer all these interfaces, we provide different adapters
    to publish the sensor data in different services or databases. To offer a SensorThings
    interface, we use an external server to test this API, which is offered by the
    SensorThings API candidate proposal. For SOS, the 52° North implementation (SOS
    version 2.0) is used. In this case, the server is deployed using an Apache Tomcat
    server and sensor data are stored in a PostgreSQL/PostGIS database8 following
    the documented standard installation guides. Finally, for the last interface,
    a Lightweight RestFul service is implemented using JAX-RS9, Jersey 10 and one
    MongoDB database11 is used to store the observations. 4. Goidanich model to detect
    downy mildew disease Downy mildew is a fungal disease caused by the plasmopara
    viticola oomycete. It is one of the worst diseases of vine cultivation under specific
    weather conditions. Downy mildew is the most studied disease, as it produces critical
    economic losses in vineyards and, consequently, in wineries [44]. Downy mildew
    is the result of the presence of a fungus in the green elements of the vines,
    and its life cycle is well established [44]. Its biological cycle is developed
    in four phases: contamination, incubation, and sporulation and propagation phase.
    • Contamination phase: in spring, the oospores reach maturity and germinate as
    zoospores. These may be transported by rain and wind, reaching the vine green
    parts and colonizing them. The needed conditions for contamination are: an air
    temperature around 10 °C, a young plant of at least 10 cm, and a rain rate of
    at least 10 mm/day. • Incubation phase: it takes from 4 to 21 days, depending
    on the temperatures and relative humidity. • Sporulation phase: during this step,
    the fungus is propagated along the vine. • Propagation phase: dissemination to
    nearby plants with the help of rebounding raindrops and wind. The optimal condition
    for ambient temperature is between 20 and 25 °C, with the help of rain during
    the night. There are some models with more complexity and better precision than
    Goldanich [45] such as MILVIT [46], [47]. Some other works simulate only a particular
    phase of the epidemic cycle [48], [49]. Moreover, some other works simulate only
    the first date of primary infection followed by the second cycle with quantitative
    outputs [50], [51]. More recently, new models are presented which use exploratory
    simulations based on newly available computing power [52]. Our work, unlike the
    ones found in the bibliography, is the pioneer in using devices of IoT for monitoring
    this kind of models. Although Goldanich''s model has been improved over time,
    it is an ideal candidate for testing our platform. As a future work, we intend
    to use other more complete models to improve the predictions of this type of disease.
    The Goidanich model is used to follow the evolution of the downy mildew fungus
    [16]. It takes into account three different phenomena: relative humidity, temperature,
    and rainfall. The model starts when a traditional method is reached, the “rule
    of the three ten”, which predicts that primary infections will occur once the
    average temperature has exceeded 10 degrees, the sprouting exceed 10 cm and on
    a day when there is at least 10 mm of rainfall. This rule, though simple, gives
    a rough idea of when to start looking for these primary infections. To follow
    the evolution of the fungus, it is necessary to know the average temperature (Tm),
    the average relative humidity (Hm) and daily rainfall. Goidanich presents a daily
    table (Table 1) in which, for each temperature, the daily growth of the fungus
    is set according to whether the Hm is high or low. The author defines each Tm
    in two columns, one when the Hm is lower than 75% and the other when it is higher
    than 75%, providing, therefore, two numerical values of daily development for
    each case. Table 1. Daily cumulative percentage of downy mildew incubation. Tm(C)

    records 10 or more mm of rain, starting from the next day, the estimation of the
    daily growth is recorded, and the model is calculated by adding every day until
    reaching the value of 100. At this moment, the theoretical incubation period ends,
    and the fungus contamination is evident due to the appearance of stains of oil
    and the asexual fruiting. The model works in that if the sum of the daily development
    accumulated is over 70%, the risk is high, so treatment is needed as soon as possible.
    If a fungicide product is applied, the development of the fungus restarts and
    remains in suspension for a certain number of days, or until the product has been
    washed away by rain. 5. Case study: SEnviro for agriculture This section details
    how we have developed the sensorized platform in a smart agricultural context.
    5.1. Building a SEnviro Thing for Smart Agriculture For this work, we have developed
    a new version of the sensorized platform presented in [39]. For the current case
    study, we only need three different phenomenon sensors, such as temperature, humidity
    sensor and rain gauge (Fig. 3). Also, for this case, the new sensorized platform
    uses a GPRS connection to offer easy installation and wireless connection in the
    field. The LinkIt One board offers an integrated GPRS module. Table 2 shows a
    general description. Fig. 3 shows a SEnviro Thing assembled with all components
    used to follow the Goidanich model. Download : Download high-res image (166KB)

    Ion Battery 2200mAh 3.7V Empty Cell Solar panel 3W Solar Panel 138X160 To offer
    an energetically efficient and autonomous platform, we use a lithium battery of
    2200 mAh12 that supplies an output voltage of 3.7 V and is charged with the power
    generated with a 3W solar panel13 that supplies an output voltage of 5.2 V. Those
    two elements and the microcontroller are attached to a board (Lipo Rider V1.114)
    that handles the power ow between the various components. Finally, to protect
    all parts of the SEnviro Thing, two boxes have been used. A waterproof box15 to
    protect the Core, Communication and Power supply and a pagoda box to protect the
    sensors. 5.2. Applying Goidanich model This section describes the behavior that
    follows the developed SEnviro node for monitoring the downy mildew. The SEnviro
    has two different objectives: 1) to take and send observations at a defined rate,
    which by default is every ten minutes. 2) to calculate the Goidanich model, and
    if an alert state happens, the SEnviro node will send an alert via SMS. The Fig.
    4 shows these two functionalities as general overview following different layers.

    Fig. 4. On top) the figure gives information about the realization of the different
    components of the infrastructure and the sequence diagram of an exemplary usage
    to send SEnviro''s observations; on bottom) it gives a sequence diagram of an
    alarm. The first functionality was explained in [39], but in this work, some changes
    have been introduced. The first functionality has been the connectivity used.
    We have selected GPRS connectivity due to lack of other connectivity in the context
    in which it is experienced. The sensorized platform sends the observations to
    a server (Section 3). A sensor collector service has been created to achieve this
    integration. Different operations are available to collect the observations measured.
    When one SEnviro Thing catches a new observation, it invokes these operations
    and sends the data to the server using the SDM module. When the SDM receives a
    new observation, it connects with the different adapters to send the data for
    each service available. To accomplish this objective, we have followed our previous
    work [43], [39] to connect with different OGC instances, such as SOS and candidate
    standard SensorThings API. Also, we provide a lighter solution for data sensors
    access using RestFul interface used in [43]. To complete the SEnviro Thing integration,
    we proposed a SEnviro application to access sensor data provided by each SEnviro
    Thing. The SEnviro APP is a web-application in charge of integrating the sensor
    data provided by the installed SEnviro Things. Furthermore, the application is
    built using the mobile-first approach. In this way, it can be easily tested on
    a mobile device. The second functionality, which is of high importance for this
    work, is the possibility to apply the Goidanich model in each SEnviro node. We
    follow the fog computing paradigm to distribute the computation between the devices,
    in this case, SEnviro nodes. To calculate the Goidanich model, we need to know
    the temperature and humidity averages per day and the amount of rainfall accumulated.
    Each platform will have the capability to execute a method as depicted in Fig.
    5. The Pseudocode 1 shows how each SEnviro Thing can calculate the Goidanich model.

    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Goidnich model workflow. Download
    : Download high-res image (190KB) Download : Download full-size image The first
    step is to accumulate the rain gauge. When it starts to rain, the algorithm will
    calculate the rain quantitative uninterruptedly while it is raining. The accumulative
    value will be reset when in one-day rainfall has been recorded. When the accumulative
    rainfall exceeds 10 mm, the SEnviro starts to calculate the temperature and humidity
    means. To offer these means, we will add up all of the observations taken in one
    day and divide them by the number of observations. These means will be used to
    determine the percentage of downy mildew incubation, and the selected value will
    be accumulated. When this value reaches 100, an alarm will be sent to the farmer
    to inform him/her about the downy mildew incubation level, and the specialized
    treatment can begin. We have selected SMS-based services as the way to connect
    with the farmers. It is due to the high penetration of mobile phones used by the
    stakeholders. Also, using SMS notifications, we can guarantee that the notification
    will arrive at the farmer. Other mobile technologies that use Internet connection
    do not guarantee the notification delivery, because the receiver needs permanent
    Inter-net connection. It involves farmers having a smartphone with an Internet
    connection data plan that will also receive the alarm. It is important to remark
    the potential of the developed SEnviro node. Although this subsection has described
    the behavior that it followed for a particular disease, its development could
    be modified to follow other models using the meteorological data collected by
    the node. Therefore, we consider that the SEnviro node could also be useful for
    detecting different diseases in vineyards or other crops. 5.3. Results In a first
    phase, the platform has been tested in a lab environment. It was working correctly
    without huge losses. The sensors obtained measurements between predictable values.
    The rain gauge has also been tested with rain recreation, and it was working correctly.
    These tests were carried out both indoors and outdoors. In a second phase, we
    have been deployed within a vineyard parcel located in the municipality of Vilafamés
    (Castelló, Spain). The parcel has a 23633.4 m2. Fig. 6 shows the location of each
    SEnviro Thing. A SEnviro node was deployed in this vineyard parcel during May
    2016 (Fig. 7), the month when downy mildew can begin to arise at the chosen location.
    As mentioned, this platform is capable of measuring three different phenomena
    which are temperature, humidity and the amount of rainfall that are all involved
    in the Goidanich''s model. During this month, observations were taken every 10
    minutes and were sent to the central server. Each platform can calculate the temperature
    and minimum humidity, in addition to calculating cumulative rainfall every day.

    the platform registered correct observations. During this period, the rain gauge
    did not reach 10mm to activate the alert, so our system does not detect downy
    mildew. During the 30 days that is was running almost all observations (96,9%
    successful deliveries) have been measured and sent in real-time although there
    were some that were undetected due to the loss of the signal in the area. These
    lost observations were sent in following deliveries. 6. A comparative between
    some similar works In the literature, some approaches are similar to our proposal.
    The following items describe the works that have been analyzed. All of them talk
    about IoT in the smart agriculture context, more concretely on monitoring vineyards.
    • In [53], the authors propose a WSN where each node takes images from the field
    and internally uses image processing techniques to detect any unusual status in
    the leaves. • The paper [54] presents a smart embedded system that will aid vineyards
    and which is cost-effective and flexible. They monitor ambient temperature and
    humidity and send an SMS with the values. • Authors in [55] do not describe a
    single platform, they show a variety of sensor network configurations and applications
    that can address different priorities in the vineyard. • Authors in [56] present
    the results from an operational sensor network. The network is based on the Berkeley
    mote (Mica II mote). The basic sensor board is equipped with a temperature sensor.
    The network consisted of sixty-five motes distributed in a grid-like pattern ten
    to twenty meters apart covering about two acres. • Authors in [57] present a general
    sensor network designed to connect agriculture to the IoT. A customized sensor
    node and developed the application for agriculture on top of TinyOS 2.x are detailed.
    A common access interface of the sensor networks for agricultural applications
    was created to enable further integration of the sensor networks on the IoT. •
    A sensor network built using TelosB platforms is presented in [58]. They show
    the experience of maturated during the design and deployment of a prototypal WSN-based
    system for monitoring the productive cycle of high-quality wine in a Sicilian
    winery. They propose two networks, one for the vineyard, and another for the wine
    cellar. The objective is to provide some of the basic functionalities that may
    be extended to obtain complete product traceability, from the grapes to the bottle.
    To compare the formerly reviewed works, Table 3 shows a comparison between the
    detailed works. The following features to characterize each one have been proposed:
    • Platform: it refers to the microcontroller model that the system uses. • Real-Time:
    it indicates if the system works in real-time. Possible values: Yes/No. • Connection:
    it refers to the wireless connections available for the system. Possible values:
    Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPRS, others. • Phenomena: it refers to the phenomena that the
    system can measure. Possible values: Temp., Hum., Dust, Bar., Noise, others. •
    IoT-WoT: it indicates if the system follows the IoT and WoT paradigms. Possible
    values: Yes/No. • Analyze: it shows if the system offers a RESTFul interface.
    Possible values: Yes/No. • Client: it indicates if the system provides a client
    for visualizing the sensors and observations. Possible values: Yes (what kind)
    /No. • OGC standards: it shows if the system offers OGC standards. Possible values:
    Yes (what kind) /No. Table 3. Comparison between different sensorized platforms.

    works and our work using the characteristics listed at the beginning of this section,
    and the results are shown in Table 3. As indicated, most of the analyzed works
    use different platforms to build the different nodes. In our case, we use LinkIt
    ONE, because it has different ways to connect, GPRS, Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. It also
    includes useful operations to use the different features. Like some other works
    analyzed, our work offers sensor data in real-time. It is possible because our
    SEnviro node, to monitor vineyards, is provided with GPRS connection to the Internet.
    SEnviro, as we show in [39], it can include a huge variety of phenomena. For this
    proof of concept, to detect downy mildew disease, we adopt the nodes to offer
    only three phenomena: temperature, humidity and rain gauge. Only three analyzed
    projects [56], [57], [58] follow the IoT and WoT paradigms. SEnviro follows these
    paradigms and offers a RESTFul interface. Finally, our project aims to be interoperable,
    and for this purpose, an OGC standard has been chosen, such as the OGC SensorThings
    API. If you look at the works that apply some analysis over the observations from
    the sensors, only two works, apart from SEnviro, apply some analysis to increase
    the value of the observations and offer decision-making models. Our work, as we
    detailed in the previous work [39], provides a client to these paradigms and offers
    a RESTful interface using the OGC SensorThings API. 7. Conclusions The primary
    concern of this work is to apply the new improvements in the ICT area, within
    the smart agriculture context. In this way, the applied model to detect the suitable
    moment to treat downy mildew disease can help the farmer in different ways. The
    first improvement is the reduction of costs of chemical products. The proposed
    support system detects the best moment to apply the downy mildew control treatments,
    which are only applied when they are strictly necessary. At the same time, it
    reduces the chemicals in the soil. It redounds in less external elements in the
    environment, improving the ecological footprint of the crop. Also, it reduces
    costs concerning person-hours; each treatment that is not needed represents some
    working hours that could be used for other tasks. Consequently, the farmer does
    not need to visit the vineyards to know the status. Our work applied a sensorized
    platform called SEnviro detailed in [39], whose objective was to monitor vineyards.
    For this purpose, we have designed a new version of the sensorized platform to
    measure different phenomena to provide follow up models to detect the best moment
    to treat downy mildew. To achieve this, we propose an improved version of the
    SEnviro platform that follows different computer science paradigms, such as IoT
    or edge computing. In this way, our platform can process and apply short algorithms
    to compute the information at the same moment when the data are collected. The
    objective of the work is not to evaluate or validate the Goldanich model since
    there are different works in the bibliography related to that. Our work only shows
    a single experimentation to test the presented IoT platform. It has offered good
    results during the month that the SEnviro platform has been installed and has
    correctly reported the observations to the central server, the platform had some
    isolated losses caused by coverage problems to send the observation in real-time.
    Temperatures and humidities average for the monitoring of the Goidanich model
    have also been calculated. As future work, new fungal disease models in the field
    of viticulture could be included, such as Powdery mildew, Black rot or Botrytis.
    All of these diseases are based on meteorological phenomena, and they are included
    in the SEnviro node. New kinds of crop could be supported if the disease models
    are based on these meteorological phenomena. Support other crops with other phenomena
    require to add these sensors, in this case, more efforts are needed. Acknowledgments

  description: Wireless sensor networks are used in various fields, such as military,
    healthcare, agriculture, environment monitoring, Monitoring and preparation of
    critical infrastructure. However, due to some of the restrictions of WSNs on storage,
    power consumption, communication, computation, scalable, security and privacy;
    people are looking forward cloud environment with large storage framework for
    the processing and storing of real time data. The cloud environment is providing
    large storage space and better services to the people in scalable manner. Sensor-cloud
    infrastructure is popular, providing an open, flexible and reconfigurable platform
    for many monitoring and control applications. In this work presenting a sensor-cloud
    infrastructure for storing data related to agriculture, Infrastructure that shows
    how to transfer data from WSNs to the cloud. In addition we addressed malicious
    attacks, issues and challenges in sensor cloud infrastructure. The idea of our
    proposed work is to collect all the samples for the soil. We choose the most favored
    plants around the India, then, select three plants, namely rice, sugarcane and
    wheat. After selecting the plants we collect data related to agriculture irrigation
    from different types of sensors such as soil moisture, temperature, humidity,
    and soil PH, CO2 and light sensors. Based on the data collected, our proposed
    system advice to farmers that usage of pesticides, fertilizers which are most
    suitable to their lands at the same time, we integrate to improve agriculture
    productivity in India.

  description: Traditional Agriculture method consumes a huge amount of fresh water
    for irrigation that needs to be optimized. This paper presents Web of Things (WoT)
    based an automatic WSN irrigation system that reduces fresh water consumption.
    The proposed irrigation system 'AgriSense' contains three end nodes disseminated
    on the field, one router node, and one coordinator. Arduino Uno with Xbee and
    sensors (specifically temperature, humidity, and soil-moisture) opted for end
    nodes that send sensor data wirelessly to the coordinator using ZigBee protocol.
    Arduino Uno with relays works as router that operates water pump and valves. The
    Raspberry Pi board with Xbee acts as a coordinator node. Coordinator analyzes
    sensor data and commands the router to on/off the water pump and valves based
    on threshold values. Coordinator is also responsible for sensor data modeling
    with XML and XML/RDF data formats and sends these annotated sensor data to the
    web server. XML script is machine readable and widely used data format on the
    web and other platforms, thus it provides syntactical interoperability. The web
    server stores and parses this annotated sensor data and display it using graphical
    representation. This automatic irrigation system helps farmer to maximize yield
    with minimum human effort.

    India SECTION I. Introduction Agriculture is the backbone of India as it participates
    about 16% of total GDP of India [1]. Almost 58% workforce of Indian workers is
    cultivators (31.7%) and agricultural laborers (26.5%) (India census) [2]. About
    43% of total population of India directly or indirectly dependent on agriculture
    treads [3]. Increasing demand for agriculture-based products and global trend
    leads to pressure, for the framers to increase the productivity of agricultural
    goods. In addition to this, government policies for non-expansion of agriculture
    land in order to protect the forest, farmers always have the compulsion to increase
    the productivity with limited area. The reduction of farmers per square area due
    to elopement also increases the problems to get higher production. The other issues
    like labour shortage, limited resources, and freshwater availability multiplies
    the difficulty level for farmers. A paper published in Global Forum for Food and
    Agriculture (GFFA) indicates Indian irrigation needs total 80% of available fresh
    water due to its poor management [4]. The methods of irrigation generally include
    Monsoon (the rainy season, a span of four months basically June to September),
    aqueducts, and groundwater resources. The only water recharge system is natural
    rainy season. Life on Earth dependent on water and human race required agriculture
    and fresh water for survival, therefore, land used for agriculture and fresh water
    usage needs to be optimized. The traditional method of irrigation required a huge
    amount of water and also needs human effort whether it is sprinkler system or
    drip system irrigation. In this method, there is a fair amount of doubt either
    water amount that passed on the field are less or huge which directly affect the
    crops production. In traditional irrigation methods, due to the lack of crop surveillance,
    some fields cope with less water supply and some have a deluge of water. Another
    fact is; different crops need different amounts of water, furthermore farmers
    are not capable to survey all the fields many times in a day. In addition to that
    weather pattern matters a lot on the Indian subcontinent. It is dependent on the
    weather and type of crops, the amount of water is supplied to the fields. So considering
    these facts, freshwater consumption for the agriculture can be reduced along with
    the efficient production of corps by means of advanced technologies. The advancement
    of different technologies (hardware and software) together and automation can
    fill the gap that inadequate with the traditional methods of agriculture. Latest
    hardware and data science technologies like sensor and/or actuators for observation
    and action, Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), and the internet which includes web
    make the automation process possible. This paper presents the automation process
    of the irrigation system by following the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT)
    and Web of Things (WoT), and we named it “AgriSense”. The Internet of Things term
    first coined By Kevin Ashton at MIT where he was working on the Auto-ID project
    with the Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags [5]. The International Telecommunication
    Union (ITU) internal report describes the IoT as a ubiquitous system where things
    are connected with each other and can communicate. Formally IoT depicts by ITU
    in terms of “anyone can interact with anything (smart objects) at anytime and
    anywhere” [6]. In the context of agriculture, the IoT system can be described
    by the automation process where hardware (sensor and/or actuator) and software
    work jointly to make a pervasive agriculture system that minimizes the human intervention.
    The advancement of hardware, compatibility with other products and scalability
    is one more step towards construction of the pervasive system. Hardware like sensors
    (digital and analog), Arduino (microcontroller), Xbee (radio communication device),
    Raspberry Pi (microprocessor) can be attached to the other hardware with the help
    of different shields. This facility makes this hardware highly scalable and compatible
    with each other. This hardware consumes low energy as well as uses low-bandwidth
    protocol based on IEEE 802.15.4 standards [7] to send the data over the network.
    This easily available and low-cost hardware makes pervasive system possible and
    affordable for common peoples. So these characteristics make these devices a perfect
    candidate for IoT devices. We are presenting an irrigation system with the help
    of these devices which displays sensor information on the web (WWW) also it contains
    sensor data in form of XML and XML/RDF format to ensure interoperability with
    other platforms. There are sufficient work have been done in the area of agriculture
    and data science in the context of IoT. Tim Wark et al. describe in the paper
    that how sensor technologies can make an automotive system for farmers. They explained
    WSN technology and its challenges for soil-moisture, pasture assessment, and cattle
    management [8]. Yunseop (James) Kim et al. describe the method of irrigation following
    the WSN technology, where they have used a temperature sensor, and a soil-moisture
    sensor for on-field sensor node. Wind speed and direction sensor, humidity sensor,
    and another temperature sensor for the weather station. A programmable logic controller
    (PLC) is used to upload an algorithm which takes care of irrigation as per the
    sensor feeds [9]. The paper by Joaquín Gutiérrez et al. describes an algorithm
    to control irrigation with the help of WSN and other latest hardware. The algorithm
    is based on a threshold value of temperature and soil-moisture sensor. The web
    application displays the result in graphical form [10]. Pandurang H. Tarange et
    al. presents WSN based irrigation scheme with the help of Raspberry Pi and ZigBee
    protocol-based radio frequency communication hardware Xbee. Raspberry Pi acts
    as a coordinator that stores sensor data acquired by different routers/end-nodes.
    An algorithm switches on/off the irrigation system based on sensor data. This
    irrigation system can be observed and control on the web too [11]. Open Geospatial
    Consortium (OGC) programme known as Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) presented a framework
    which is an open standard and makes use of web-connected sensors and sensor systems.
    The SWE architecture uses the web platform to facilitate a different kind of services
    such as discovery, processing, and data exchange of sensor observations [12].
    Amit Sheth et al. present the concept of semantic sensor web, where authors describe
    the importance of background information like time, space and thematic data annotation
    along with sensor data in form of XML data format [13]. Wang Wei et al. describe
    the sensor network, semantic technologies, and sensor data modeling that represent
    the sensor data in XML data format which is open source [14]. In our experiment,
    we have used WSN to obtain the agriculture data specifically soil temperature,
    atmospheric humidity, and soil moisture. Sensor works as the communicator amid
    real world and digital world; it senses the real world parameter and afterward
    converts it with some measurable quantity. The end sensor node is assembled using
    Arduino Uno, sensors and Xbee S2C. End sensor nodes with WSN feature is disseminated
    on the agriculture field. Arduino with Xbee S2C acts as router. Raspberry Pi 3
    model B with Xbee is used for coordinator which receives data generated by dint
    of end sensor nodes. Xbee sends/receives the data wirelessly through radio frequency
    transmission that makes the sensor network, Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). The
    network anatomy used for wireless communication is star topology. To support interoperability
    and open-source, we used sensor data modeling concept that annotates agriculture
    sensor data in XML format, so the sensor data can be operated on the web and other
    platforms. Building interoperable data is a challenging task, moreover, in some
    cases, it is nearly impossible due to lack of common IoT standardization formed
    for data formats [15] [16]. The World Wide Web (WWW) is turning out to be the
    common platform on the internet for communication. To support and enhance additional
    features web services played an important role. The web is handled by open-source
    public forum [17]. So it is better to deploy sensor data on the web rather scattered
    internet to achieve interoperability. The received sensor data on coordinator
    is raw data that cannot be exposed to the web as it has no background information.
    The coordinator (Raspberry Pi) annotates the agriculture sensor data and sends
    annotated data to the web in form of XML and XML/RDF. The web server parses this
    annotated sensor data (XML) for further processing i.e. display the sensor data
    in graphical form. The web platform (website) contains the XML and XML/RDF sensor
    data download option. SECTION II. Irrigation System: Architecture, Method, and
    Tools A. Proposed Irrigation System The proposed irrigation system (Fig. 1. shows
    the system architecture) has three end nodes based on three different types of
    crops, one router node, and one coordinator node that is configured using star
    topology fashion. The end nodes send the temperature, atmospheric-humidity, and
    soil-moisture data wirelessly to the coordinator. The end nodes are built using
    Arduino Uno, sensors (temperature, humidity, and soil-moisture), and Xbee S2C
    with a shield. Data is sent in form of radio waves through Xbees that use the
    packet based Application Programming Interface (API) mode. The coordinator receives
    all the sensor data which is sent by the end nodes. Raspberry Pi 3 model B act
    as a coordinator node. Xbee is associated with the Raspberry Pi through USB serial
    port and receives the data from all the end sensor nodes. Router''s responsibility
    is to switch on/off water motor and valves when the command is received from coordinator
    based on the threshold value of sensors. Coordinator is also responsible to annotate
    and send sensor data to the web in an arranged manner with semantics (sensor data
    modeling) in form of XML and XML/RDF format. The benefit of XML and XML/RDF data
    format is that it provides machine-readable data [14]. Moreover, these data formats
    are prevalent on the internet mostly on web thus these are obvious candidate for
    syntactical interoperability [15]. Fig. 1. Irrigation system architecture Show
    All The presented irrigation system AgriSense stores the data in data repository
    on the cloud. One copy of the sensor data is stored on the local database of coordinator
    for safety and local analysis purposes. The water supply for every field is switch
    on/off based on soil-moisture and field temperature threshold value. Agriculture
    fields division is based on the type of crops. The water supply also depends the
    range of soil type [18], however, we are considering all our fields have the same
    type of soil. B. Components and Tools 1) Sensors There are three type of sensors
    have been used for the experiment; temperature sensor, atmospheric humidity sensor,
    and soil-moisture sensor. a) DTH11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor The DTH11 sensor
    measures relative humidity and temperature. It is calibrated for the accurate
    digital output and contains one-time programmable (OTP) memory with an 8-bit microcontroller.
    The power supply needed for this device is 3V to 5.5V DC that makes it more compatible
    device for IoT. The accuracy of relative humidity (RH) is ±5% and accuracy of
    temperature is ±2% degree Celsius. It is low-cost, accurate, and compact; consume
    low-power, and compatible with Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and Intel Edison etc. b)
    Soil-Moisture Sensor The two leg soil-moisture sensor comes with separate Printed
    Circuit Board (PCB) controller. It has three modes of output: digital, analog,
    and serial. The threshold voltage can be set for the digital output that indicates
    the binary status of soil-moisture according to the threshold. The analog output
    gives the numerical number from 0 to 1048 (it can depend upon different product)
    according to the voltage variation, the lower the value less moisture in the soil.
    The value of soil-moisture is based on the conductivity between the probes when
    electricity passed to it, lower the conductivity (and higher the resistance) due
    to moisture between the probes results less the numerical number. The input power
    supply is 5V DC for the sensor. The sensor readings depend on the soil type and
    soil temperature so it must be calibrated before the final deployment. 2) Arduino
    Uno The Arduino Uno is a programmable microcontroller board that is based on ATmega238P
    microchip. It contains 14 digital I/O ports, 6 analog input ports, one USB port,
    32Kbytes flash memory with 16MHz clock speed CPU. The power supply for the device
    is 5V DC. This device can be easily configured along with sensors and Xbee. Different
    type of shield can be mounted on the top of the Arduino Uno with Xbee and sensors.
    Shield provides the piggyback facility that includes additional functions on microcontroller
    or microprocessor. 3) Raspberry Pi 3 Model B The Raspberry Pi is a low-power credit
    card sized microprocessor. It includes 1.2GHz ARM based Quad-core processor, 1GB
    ram, Wi-Fi based on IEEE 802.11b/g/n protocol, IEEE 802.15 low energy Bluetooth,
    dual-core GPU that can handle 1080p video, Ethernet and HDMI connectors, 3.5mm
    audio output jack. The Raspberry Pi 3 Model B has 40 General Purpose Input-Output
    (GPIO) pins that connect with the real world through sensors. It supports operating
    system that boot from the micro SD card and generally Linux Debian based Raspbian
    OS is used. The input power supply for Raspberry Pi is 5V DC through the micro
    USB port. 4) Xbee S2C Xbee S2C manufactured by Digi International is a radio communication
    device that runs on IEEE 802.15.4 based protocols (DigiMash, Zigbee, and point-to-point).
    Xbee devices help to create wireless sensor network (WSN) using the radio data
    transmission with different network topologies. It uses Low energy and low data
    rate as defined by IEEE standards, Xbee devices work on 2.4GHz ISM band at 250
    kb/s data transmission rate. These devices use two types of addressing scheme
    the 64-bit address and another 16-bit address. The 64-bit address id the MAC address
    of the Xbee and 16-bit address is used as the network address for the data transmission,
    64-bit MAC address is often used in data transmission as 16-bit address are not
    static. The Xbee supports Transparent mode (also known as AT mode) and Application
    Programming Interface (API) mode of data transmission. The Transparent mode uses
    the serial port for data transmission. It is very simple to use, but more than
    two Xbee cannot communicate following AT communication mode is the flaw of this.
    The API mode uses the packet based data communication method to transmit the data
    over the network. It can transmit data to multiple hosts. Different topologies
    can be used for data transmission such as mash, star, point-to-point [19]. SECTION
    III. Detailed Irrigation System Design In our experiment, we have used three end
    sensor nodes (field sensor devices), one router (water pump), and one coordinator
    (base station). As we discussed earlier there is only one end-node sensor required
    for irrigation on same type of soil. We are considering crop-type (as different
    crops needed different amount of water) parameter for irrigation that is different
    crop-type fields needed different end-nodes. So end-nodes distributed on the agriculture
    field depend on the crop type. There are three end sensor nodes distributed on
    the field as per the crop-type. The Arduino Uno is used as an end sensor node
    device. Sensors and Xbee attached to the Arduino for observation subsequently
    wireless data transmission. The Arduino Uno uses C programming language for communication
    with sensors and digital world. Each end-node is equipped with a temperature sensor,
    humidity sensor, and soil-moisture sensor. We have used Zigbee protocol for wireless
    data communication which is one of the protocols supported by Xbee to establish
    WSN (the data flow graph of WSN irrigation depicted in Fig. 2.). Data communication
    is implemented through star topology because base station is in the center. The
    distributed wireless sensors nodes (end sensor nodes) sends data to the base station
    every hour and then go on sleep mode to minimize power consumption. In general
    wireless sensor node takes more power for searching the nearby devices and sending
    the data over other devices. The new generation protocol IEEE 802.15.4 has been
    introduced with low energy and low bandwidth for radio communication devices that
    defines Physical Layer (PHY) and Medium Access Control Layer (MAC). The Zigbee
    protocol works on the top of IEEE 802.15.4. It defines Network Layer (NWK) and
    structure for Application Layer (APL) which adds functionality like encryption,
    mash and routing capabilities over the IEEE 802.15.4 protocol. The Xbee can use
    simple IEEE 802.15.4 or Zigbee or DigiMesh protocol[19]. Fig. 2. Dataflow graph
    for WSN irrigation system. Show All The base station (coordinator) is implemented
    with the help of Raspberry Pi and Xbee that receives sensor data and sends commands
    to router and end-nodes. The Xbee connected to the Raspberry Pi using USB serial
    port. Python scripting has been developed on Raspberry Pi to coordinate the end
    sensor nodes and coordinator. An algorithm has been implemented using the python
    script that sends the command to water motor and valve to on/off water supply
    to the particular crop-field based on soil moisture and temperature threshold
    values (algorithm described in Fig. 3.). The coordinator is responsible to annotate
    sensor data to XML and XML/RDF data format (Fig. 4.). Coordinator also sends the
    annotated sensor data to the cloud to support the interoperability concept. For
    this python script is implemented with the help of library packages. Raspberry
    Pi stores the sensor data on the local database for threshold value analysis,
    safety, and to avoid failure. At the server end annotated sensor data is received
    in form of XML (Fig. 5.) and XML/RDF. The intention of changing the raw sensor
    data into XML and XML/RDF is to provide the interoperability at syntactical and
    semantic level [15] [13]. The raw sensor data does not contain any syntactical
    or semantic information thus it is not machine-readable. Consider an illustrative
    example: say an end sensor node sends values 26, 62, 30 to the coordinator. The
    coordinator is programmed in such a way that it can easily understand this values
    like 26 is temperature in degree Celsius, 62 is the humidity percentage, and 30
    is a soil-moisture percentage of the agriculture field. Even the cloud server
    can also be programmed to understand the values which are transmitted to it. But
    if the order of values is changed or unit of reading is changed, we must configure
    the coordinator and cloud server separately. Moreover, the readings do not give
    information about the background. For example, the temperature and humidity readings
    are indoor or outdoor, the soil-moisture sensor is plugged-in the soil on agriculture
    field or not. Even if we solve these issues on both the ends (coordinator and
    cloud server), the third party website or app does not understand these raw data,
    hence raw sensor data is very limited in scope. Fig. 3. Algorithm for threshold
    value of different crop fields. Show All Therefore the syntactical and semantic
    representation of raw sensor data is very essential. XML and XML/RDF are the obvious
    candidates to present the sensor data syntactically and semantically as it can
    provide the common data exchange format over the web and other platforms [20].
    XML data format does not provide semantic representation for machines until some
    extra semantic model is not attached to it. The Resource Description Format (RDF)
    is annotation format that constructs semantic sensor data. Fig. 4. Flow graph
    for the web server. Show All Fig. 5. The annotated sensor data. Show All SECTION
    IV. Agrisense: State-of-the-Art Automatic Agriculture Utility System Water absorption
    capacity for different soil is different [18]. In our experiment, we are assuming
    that agriculture field has uniform soil distribution since the soil type generally
    changes over the large geographical area. Whereas our experimental design work
    within the agriculture field which is some acres. Therefore we are not using end-nodes
    sensor based on soil type but the crop-type as different crop needs a different
    amount of water. The coordinator sends signal to the router that on/off the water
    motor and valves. There are three crop fields; each crop field has one valve that
    controls the sprinkler of that field. Valves operated through relays. Coordinator
    sends the command to router on the basis of threshold value which is calculated
    through end sensor nodes readings. Coordinator is also responsible to annotate
    and send the sensor data in form of XML and XML/RDF to the cloud server. We have
    used PHP as server-side scripting for programming the cloud server. Like other
    server side scripting, PHP also supports XML/RDF metadata format for parsing.
    The web displays the near real-time sensor data in graphical form with the option
    to download XML and XML/RDF data. For quick graphic response and user friendly
    interface, we used jQuery and AJAX for client side scripting. SECTION V. Experimental
    Test Results As we mentioned earlier there are three end sensor nodes three types
    of crop. The Arduino Uno microcontroller along with all three sensors and Xbee
    treated as an end sensor node. End nodes send sensor data in form of radio signals
    to coordinator with the help of Xbee. Fig. 6 shows the snapshot of end-sensor
    node. The coordinator is developed using Raspberry Pi and Xbee (shown in Fig.
    8.). Xbee is plugged-in to the Raspberry Pi with the help of serial USB port.
    The hardware light signals that denote transmission (TX) and receiver (RX) of
    sensor data for both end-sensor node and coordinator depicted respectively in
    the Fig. 6. and Fig. 8. Coordinator programmed with python to receive end-nodes
    sensor data, analysis of sensor data to find threshold value, and send the sensor
    data over the cloud server. Coordinator also commands the router to switch on/off
    water motor and valves for irrigation. The cloud server displays the near real-time
    sensor data in terms of graphics with the help of PHP, jQuery, and AJAX. The data
    format and data structure of the annotated sensor data is depicted in the Fig.
    5. There are hyperlinks for download the XML data of each sensor node (Fig. 7.).

    SECTION VI. Conclusion The automated irrigation utility system presented in the
    paper uses the state-of-the-art technologies to minimize the human effort on the
    agriculture field and optimizes the consumption of fresh water. WSN technology
    with latest IoT based protocols uses low bandwidth for data transmission and consumes
    low energy, which makes it a perfect candidate for outdoor experiments. Hardware
    like Arduino Uno, Xbee, sensors, Raspberry Pi comes with a very low cost; moreover,
    this hardware can assemble and communicate with each other even if they belong
    to different vendors. Latest IoT based protocols provide the technical interoperability.
    In our experiment, we have used sensor data modeling in order to make the sensor
    data machine-readable and interoperable with different platforms. Coordinator
    annotates the sensor data with XML and transmits to the web server. XML data format
    is one of the widely used data formats that provide syntactical interoperability
    across the platforms. The web server then parses the annotated sensor data and
    presents it in the graphical form. The benefit of the XML being used is any web
    server can parse annotated XML sensor data as XML includes metadata information
    within it. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More Like This

  description: Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) have been highly developed which can
    be used in agriculture to enable optimal irrigation scheduling. Since there is
    an absence of widely used available methods to support effective agriculture practice
    in different weather conditions, WSN technology can be used to optimise irrigation
    in the crop fields. This paper presents architecture of an irrigation system by

    Las Vegas, NV, USA SECTION I. Introduction Shortage of fresh water is a common
    problem in the world. The demand for water supplies is expected to increase due
    to population growth; food demand needs, and changes in water availability. Irrigation
    is a primary user of freshwater, with the Food and Agricultural Organization of
    the United Nations (FAO, 2014) reporting that 70% of freshwater in the world is
    used for irrigation purposes. Irrigation is expected to be much more crucial for
    the food production in the near future, as most probable climate change scenarios
    predict large water deficits in certain areas in the world. Irrigation holds the
    most promise for increasing food productivity and security, provided it is managed
    efficiently. Also irrigation consumes large quantities of energy, which is a crucial
    constraint for development. To better manage the competing demands for water,
    agricultural policies will have to make water efficiency a priority. Hence the
    scientific and technology based irrigation scheduling of water is one of the ways
    to improve the irrigation processes to optimize the use of water and energy consumption.
    The incorporation of sensors in the context of agricultural production for water
    management and conservation has concerned an increasing interest for establishing
    irrigation management strategies. The use of water for agricultural production
    in water scarcity regions requires innovative and sustainable research and an
    appropriate transfer of technologies. Moreover, food security is an important
    issue since systems aiming at ensuring optimal production of crops form a vital
    part of any country''s overall security system. Ubiquitous and pervasive computing
    are key technologies significantly contributing to the advent of IoT. They bring
    computation capability to physical objects, which can communicate, in the Internet
    by producing, consuming, and computing information. WSNs are a prevalent instance
    of ubiquitous computing that enables small things to connect to the Internet.
    Sensor networks today are sensing and computing environmental phenomena and thus
    such a WSN can be used in real time application like irrigation scheduling. In
    reality these types of networks are heterogeneous by nature, arises from the fact
    that there are different types of WSN devices that do not use the same standards.
    The migration of WSN communication towards an all-IP mode, eliminate most of the
    heterogeneity. The Internet is smoothly migrating from an Internet of people towards
    an Internet of Things (IoT). Such a migration induces a strong level of complexity
    when handling interoperability between the heterogeneous IoT and also these types
    of networks are low power and lossy network. To support the connectivity, interoperability
    ad compatibility of heterogeneous WSN, IPv6 over Low Power Wireless Personal Area
    Network (6LoWPAN) was proposed by the IETF working group. Therefore the system
    proposed in this paper uses the wireless sensor networks and the architecture
    of Internet of things, allowing the users to analyze the moisture level of the
    field obtained by the array of sensors from any smart device in efficient way
    to take the decision of irrigation scheduling. This paper presents a multi hop
    WSN for smart irrigation scheduling that relies on 6LoWPAN, RPL and IEEE 802.15.4g
    protocols along with the performance evaluation of the WSN in terms of round trip
    time, packet loss and radio duty cycles of the sensors. The remainder of this
    paper is organized in the following way: Section 2 covers related work, whereas
    Section 3 presents our proposed system architecture. Section 4 includes details
    on our prototype design, while Section 5 conveys information about the simulations
    performed. Section 6 presents our results and the analysis performed, while Section
    7 finally concludes the paper and indicates future work. SECTION II. Related Work
    In GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication) based automated irrigation control
    using rain gun [1] irrigation will take place only when there will be intense
    requirement of water that save a large quantity of water. This system is not affordable
    economically due to coverage range of agriculture land. Siuli Roy et al. [2] proposed
    a Zigbee based wireless sensor network with the help of IEEE 802.15.4 link layer
    protocol. This work focuses to monitor agricultural parameter remotely and to
    control irrigation and fertilization. Evapotranspiration (ET) is affected by solar
    radiation, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and crop factors, such as stage
    of growth, variety and plant density, management elements, soil properties, pest,
    and disease control [3]. Systems based on ET have been developed that agree to
    water savings of up to 42% on time-based irrigation program [4]. To monitor the
    agricultural system a microcontroller based system developed by Zeldi [5], where
    the real time values of atmospheric condition displayed by the microcontroller
    by sensing of different parameters of agriculture like soil moisture, humidity
    and temperature. An electromagnetic moisture sensor was the basis for developing
    an irrigation system at a savings of 53% of water compared with irrigation by
    sprinklers in an area of 1000 m2 of territory [6]. By using soil sensor and an
    evaporimeter [7], to adjust the irrigation in different weather conditions, a
    scheduling system was developed to reduce the water consumption. However no performance
    analysis was made to look after the power consumption and fundamental issues of
    6LoWPAN protocol stack in these studies. These issues made us to decide to study
    the performances of irrigation system through Cooja Simulator. Since 6LoWPAN is
    an immerging technology and is suitable for constraint environment, smart irrigation
    based on this stack can be a new application area. The purpose of this research
    is to develop a smart irrigation system using 6LoWPAN wireless sensor network
    [8]–[13] and analyze the performances of the WSN. The system will be integrated
    with wireless sensor network technology where solar energy can be used to overcome
    the power crisis along with optimizing the irrigation management based on the
    6LWAN standard. Our own previous work includes performance analysis of an IP based
    protocol stack for WSNs [14] [15]. SECTION III. System Architecture Fig. 1 depicts
    the systems architecture to implement real time irrigation scheduling in a crop
    field. Fig. 1. Proposed system architecture Show All The architecture consists
    of a LoWPAN wireless sensor network, an IoT gateway for Internet connectivity,
    a web server to store sensor data, application software implementing our decision
    support system to provide irrigation scheduling, and a control system for interfacing
    and controlling the irrigation pumps. A LoWPAN is the collection of 6LoWPAN Nodes,
    which share a common IPv6 address, prefix. LoWPAN are connected to other IP networks
    through edge routers or border router. The edge router plays an important role
    as it routes traffic in and out of the LoWPAN, while handling 6LoWPAN compression
    and neighbor discovery for the LoWPAN. Multiple edge routers can be supported
    in the same LoWPAN if they share a common backbone link. Each LoWPAN node is identified
    by a unique IPv6 address, and is capable of sending and receiving IPv6 packets.
    Typically LoWPAN Nodes support ICMPv6 traffic such as ping and use the user datagram
    protocol (UDP) as a transport protocol. In the WSN, the upper leftmost sensor
    node acts as edge router as well as sink node and also the root of directed acyclic
    graph formed by the network topology. The rest of the nodes act as source nodes
    and send their sensing data to the sink node, which then forwards to the destination
    server through the gateway. To connect the WSN with the Internet backbone, a gateway
    is deployed between edge router and the LoWPAN. The gateway enables the connectivity
    of the LoWPAN to the Internet. Hence sensor data from the radio network can be
    transmitted to the server located anywhere in the Internet. The server in the
    architecture is used to collect and store the sensors data. The sensors sense
    moisture level of the crop field and forward the data to the server through the
    gateway. We can implement the server as a cloud from where the farmer, user or
    client retrieves sensor data to analysis for making decision such as moisture
    level, to make irrigation scheduling. The web based decision support system (DSS)
    analyzes the real time moisture level of the crop field and provides users with
    an irrigation schedule for crops during different phases of phonological development
    based on moisture level. If the DSS recommends for irrigation, then the user send
    a positive flag to the control system which then switches on the relay driver
    to turn on the irrigation pump. A relay is an electromagnetic switch operated
    by a relatively small electric current that can switch a much larger electric
    device. The LED in the microcontroller indicates the ON and OFF states of the
    relay circuit. Here we propose the source of energy for the pump is solar renewable
    energy due to power crisis of Bangladesh and remote location of the crop field.
    SECTION IV. Prototype Desgin We have implemented a prototype of smart irrigation
    system. A moisture sensor is used to detect the moisture. An Arduino Uno board
    is used to control whole system. The Arduino module compares the moisture level
    of the field with the threshold moisture level. Arduino will instruct the pump
    to be activated if the moisture of the field is smaller than the set threshold.
    When the moisture level is more than the threshold, the irrigation will be stopped
    by the Arduino. A solar system is used to provide the power need for this system.
    Fig. 2 presents the prototype implementation of our proposed system. Fig. 2. Prototype
    implementation of smart irrigation system Show All SECTION V. Simulation Scenario
    To closely reflect real deployments, nodes run Contiki OS with the whole protocol
    stack. We have compiled Contiki for the Tmote Sky platform based on MSP430 microcontroller
    with 10 KB of RAM and an IEEE 802.15.4 compliant radio. By using the MSP430 hardware
    emulator, Cooja thus takes into account all the hardware constraints of the devices.
    The simulation scenario is presented in Fig. 3. Fig. 3. WSN topology and radio
    environment in cooja. The green disk represents the transmission range and the
    gray disk represents the interference range of the sensor. The yellow nodes are
    source nodes while the blue node is the sink node. Show All The propagation model
    used in the simulations is COOJA''s Unit Disk Graph Medium (UDGM) with constant
    loss. This model uses two concentric disks of different radius. Any node within
    the transmission range receives transmitted packets with a probability of 100%
    (default value). Any node within the interference range but outside of the transmission
    range is not able to receive any packets but see its own transmissions affected.
    Finally nodes outside of the interference range are not able to receive packets
    and are not affected by transmitted packets. The border router or edge router
    is typically a device sitting at the edge of our network, which allows us to talk
    to outside networks using its built-in network interfaces, such as Wi-Fi, Ethernet,
    Serial, etc. In Contiki the current and most used border router application implements
    a serial based interface called SLIP, it allows to connect a given mote to a host
    using scripts like tunslip6 over the serial port, creating a tunneled network
    interface, which can be given an IPv6 prefix to set the network global IPv6 addresses.
    Node 1 corresponds to the border router, which has only one neighbor in its wireless
    coverage area the sensors are deployed to establish multi hops network from the
    border router. The simulation parameters including the protocol stack used are
    shown below in Table 1. For capturing data collected from sensors we use Collect
    view visualization tool provided by the Contiki OS. Table 1. Simulation parameters
    SECTION VI. Results and Analysis To illustrate the performance of the proposed
    WSN scenario we evaluate three important parameters named round trip time as delay,
    packet loss and energy consumption (radio duty cycle and average power consumption.
    This evaluation also tests the RPL routing protocol used in 6LoWPAN, as the scenario
    features nodes with 1 to 4 hops to the router. A. Round Trip Time (RTT) The RTT
    is an important parameter of concern as it is an indicator of the network congestion
    as well as the processing delays. It is computed as function of time by the ping
    request as the time difference between the time of successful response for a request
    and the time instant at which the request is sent. In our simulation, payload
    size is varied from 8 bytes to 56 bytes. Twenty ICMP messages are sent to each
    source node in the WSN through the border router from Contiki client and the statistics
    of round trip time are recorded and plotted in Matlab simulation software. The
    plots below illustrate minimum RTT, maximum RTT, median RTT and deviations of
    RTT for different packet size and multi hop scenarios. It can be seen from Fig.
    4 and Fig. 5 that packets moving further away from the sink experience higher
    RTT, as expected and with the higher payload, the RTT is also higher especially
    in multi hop cases. Fig. 7 presents cumulative distribution function (CDF) as
    a function of deviation of RTT for different hop counts, while Fig. 8 shows packet
    loss for different hop. Fig. 4. Minimum RTT Show All Fig. 5. Maximum RTT Show
    All Fig. 6. Median of RTT Show All Fig. 7. CDF of deviation of RTT for different
    hops Show All Fig. 8. Packet loss for different hop Show All Fig. 9. Average power
    consumption of the source nodes Show All Fig. 10. Average power consumption of
    the source nodes Show All B. Packet Loss The ping ICMP request sent by the client
    computer in the simulation scenario, which are not acknowledges within the specific
    waiting time determines the packet loss. Packet loss occurs in wsn networks due
    to noise, interference and collisions. The scenario is simulated in Cooja by considering
    TX with 100% and RX with 90%. The statistics of packet loss is obtained from the
    reply of ping ICMP packets. Fig. 2 illustrates the packet loss for the scenario.
    It is seen that the packet loss increase as the packet size and hop increases.
    C. Energy Consumption In this section, we look at the energy consumption of nodes
    under the ContikiMAC protocols. We use the duty cycle as an estimator of the energy
    consumption. The lower the duty cycle, the longer the nodes batteries should last.
    ContikiMAC is a suitable and energy efficient radio duty cycle mechanism (RDC)
    for sensor networks running Contiki. Contiki has a power efficient wake-up mechanism
    and uses a fast sleep optimization to allow receivers to quickly detect false
    positive wake-ups. It also uses a transmission optimization to allow run time
    optimization of the energy efficiency of transmission. The ContikiMAC implementation
    in Contiki 2.5 uses the Contiki real-time timers (rtimer) to schedule its periodic
    wake ups. The ContikiMAC wake-up mechanism runs a protothread, which performs
    the periodic wake, ups and implements the fast sleep optimization. The phase-lock
    mechanism is implemented as a separate module from ContikiMAC, which maintains
    a list of neighbors and their wake-up phases. The neighbor is evicted from the
    list after a fixed number of failed transmissions or having no link layer ack
    within a fixed time. In our experiments, the default parameters of ContikiMAC
    have been used. Due to the fast sleep optimization the duty-cycle of ContikiMAC
    is dynamic. The most important contribution to the ContikiMAC reduction in duty-cycle
    is the fast sleep optimization at the heart of the wake-up procedure. The Duty
    Cycle provides information regarding the energy consumption of a node by evaluating
    the time spent by a node in the following states: listen, RX, TX. The Duty Cycle
    is expressed as the ratio between the time spent by a node in those three states
    and the wake-up interval. The Duty Cycle value is computed via the Cooja Power
    tracker tool. The visualizations of radio duty cycle and average power consumption
    have been collected using the Cooja collect view tool and are presented in Fig.
    9 and Fig. 10. From Fig. 8 we observe that the node 5 and 9 experience less duty
    cycle than other nodes in the network as these are not intermediate node and generate
    less traffic. Consequently the average power consumption is also less in these
    two nodes for the same. SECTION VII. Conclusion and Future Work The purpose of
    this paper is to apply the functionality of Internet of things in the field of
    agriculture such as smart irrigation to provide optimum use of fresh water and
    better crops production. The main components of the paper are the system architecture
    for irrigation control system, the analysis of the performance of the 6LoWPAN
    protocol stack, Contiki OS and RPL routing protocol in terms of round trip time,
    packet loss and energy consumption, also investigation of the interoperability
    between heterogeneous network. Based on simulation we observe that the RTT and
    percentage of packet loss will increase as the hop and the payload size become
    larger due to environmental noise such as interference, collision and link quality.
    Radio Duty Cycle is a lifetime indicator of the sensors. It is observed from the
    result that less power consumption means less RDC and hence more lifetime of the
    sensors. ContikiMAC use a RDC protocol that is responsible for power saving mechanism.
    The stack simulated in this work is interoperable as it can be connected to different
    motes platform and does not require gateway to connect to the Internet. Cooja
    enables emulator with real hardware motes, which make the network simple and reusable.
    In addition to it, we browse the contents of the sensors from Mozilla browser
    using Copper plug-in, which implement the CoAP protocol. In a nutshell, one can
    decide the scalability of WSN in terms of multi hops, positioning of border router,
    desired latency and data uncertainty in terms of packet loss for real time application
    of IoT like smart irrigation systems. In the future we intend to implement this
    system in a real field scenario so that performance can be analyzed along with
    the development of web based DSS. There is also an opportunity to analyze the
    real time data streaming where a lot of data will be transmitted by sensors. We
    also plan to study how to handle anomalies of data from sensors. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
    We would like to extend our gratitude to the Swedish Research Council (under grant
    2014-4251) for the funding and the provision of resources to conduct this research.

  description: To solve the problems, such as electricity and water waste, poor automaticity
    and low efficiency of information management encountered in rural farmland irrigation,
    a set of remote monitoring system for constant pressure field irrigation are designed
    based on the communication, sensors, and control as well as internet technology.
    This system is composed of perception layer, network layer and application layer.
    In the perception layer, a star-type network is built through Zigbee wireless
    communication modules. The control of instruments in pump stations and the data
    collection of the environmental parameters of fields are realized by using PLC
    and MCU core nodes. In the application layer, a remote network monitoring software
    of field irrigation is developed by using Java language combined with JavaBean
    components in B/S mode and Ethernet communication technology with the aid of OPC
    server, which is called PC Access. This system has been applied in the irrigation
    of a standardization field in Taicang County. It is shown that the system can
    collect data accurately, and maintain a stable pressure level and exhibits a better
    ability to suppress disturbances. Furthermore, the system can ope-rate smartly
    and reliably under in situ control and remote network control conditions to monitor
    the real irrigation states.

  description: In sprinkling irrigation, evaluation of spraying quality mainly depends
    on water distribution test systems. Commonly, there are at least dozens of test
    points needed in the water distribution test, and sometimes hundreds of them are
    used in some particular cases. The space between rain gauges ranges from 0.5 m
    to 2 m by the coverage diameter of sprinkler which commonly requires high mobility
    and convenient reading functions. Traditionally, the test requires measurements
    of hundreds of points by use of standard measuring cup. Following that, a great
    deal of data from the test cups are collected for the calculation of sprinkler
    irrigation uniformity, and then water distribution map were manually drawn. All
    of those bring problems like heavy workload or low precision of the measured results.
    The water distribution testing software implemented can be used to draw the map
    of water distribution or the calculation, but it may not realize the function
    of real-time plot with the separation of water collecting apparatus. Moreover,
    the data downloaded into computer from the measuring apparatus cannot be exported
    to Excel, which may cause errors. Moreover, the drawings of water distribution
    map can only be printed in a specified angle and the outline of the water distribution
    cannot be viewed in a time. In order to improve the sprinkler performance and
    optimize the water distribution, a new approach of using wireless to test water
    distribution of sprinkler was proposed based on ZigBee technology, a new short-distance
    wireless network standard for sensor network with the distinct advantages of low
    energy consumption, low latency, and long battery lives, and Matlab in the double
    tipping bucket rain gauge, in which a wireless module ZigBee, and a hall sensor
    were installed to receive and store signal generated by the tipping bucket rain
    acquisition parts by CC2530 module. The rain gauges were arranged in the test
    field in a rectangular and radial direction and each one was numbered uniquely
    in the entire network. The frequency of communication between receiver and upper
    computer was 2.4GHz. In order to avoid signal congestion, the number of routing
    nodes was enlarged and tree type networks were used in the rain gauges. Terminal
    nodes were responsible for collecting signal and delivering it to the routing
    nodes during working conditions and the routing nodes transmitted the signal to
    the coordinators. The ZigBee coordinator node received signal and delivered it
    to the upper computer in which a real-time analytic software was developed by
    graphical user interfaces (GUI) of Matlab. The software allowed us to analyze
    data precisely with intuitive three-dimension image. The new developed test system
    had distinct advantage like improved generality, easy expansibility, high reliability
    and interoperability compared to the traditional one. A water distribution test
    was conducted as to the S800 rotating sprinkler produced by the Toro Company.
    The error of this system and manual measurement was less than 0.1 mm/h. It can
    bear at least 2940 reversal per hour without leak. The software system calculated
    11 combination sprinkler irrigation Christiansen uniformity coefficients with
    the combination spacing coefficient ranged from 1.0 to 2.0. The test results showed
    that the Christiansen uniformity coefficients of sprinkler reached 70.6%. The
    Christiansen uniformity coefficients corresponding to the combination spacing
    coefficient of rectangle ranged from 1.0 to 1.6 and that of triangle range from
    1.0 to 1.2 or 1.5 to 1.7 were up to 75%, which met the expected requirements.
    The entire system provided reliable data collection method and functional data
    analysis software for researcher to develop new sprinklers.

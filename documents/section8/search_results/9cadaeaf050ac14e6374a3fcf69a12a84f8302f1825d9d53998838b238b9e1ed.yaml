    high air temperature, and changes in soil biota are some factors caused by environmental
    changes. Verified and precise phenotypic traits are required for assessing the
    impact of various stress factors on crop performance while keeping phenotyping

    transpiration efficiency are often expensive and require complex infrastructures.
    This study presents the development and testing process of an automated, reliable,

    near-real time. Because of its waterproofness, our device—LysipheN—assesses each
    plant individually and can be deployed for experiments in different environmental
    conditions (farm, field, greenhouse, etc.). LysipheN integrates multiple sensors,
    automatic irrigation according to desired drought scenarios, and a remote, wireless
    connection to monitor each plant and device performance via a data platform. During
    testing, LysipheN proved to be sensitive enough to detect and measure plant transpiration,
    from early to ultimate plant developmental stages. Even though the results were
    generated on common beans, the LysipheN can be scaled up/adapted to other crops.
    This tool serves to screen transpiration, transpiration efficiency, and transpiration-related
    physiological traits. Because of its price, endurance, and waterproof design,
    LysipheN will be useful in screening populations in a realistic ecological and
    breeding context. It operates by phenotyping the most suitable parental lines,
    characterizing genebank accessions, and allowing breeders to make a target-specific
    selection using functional traits (related to the place where LysipheN units are
    located) in line with a realistic agronomic background.

    261 Accesses 1 Altmetric Metrics Abstract Climate instability directly affects
    agro-environments. Water scarcity, high air temperature, and changes in soil biota
    are some factors caused by environmental changes. Verified and precise phenotypic
    traits are required for assessing the impact of various stress factors on crop
    performance while keeping phenotyping costs at a reasonable level. Experiments
    which use a lysimeter method to measure transpiration efficiency are often expensive
    and require complex infrastructures. This study presents the development and testing
    process of an automated, reliable, small, and low-cost prototype system using
    IoT with high-frequency potential in near-real time. Because of its waterproofness,
    our device—LysipheN—assesses each plant individually and can be deployed for experiments
    in different environmental conditions (farm, field, greenhouse, etc.). LysipheN
    integrates multiple sensors, automatic irrigation according to desired drought
    scenarios, and a remote, wireless connection to monitor each plant and device
    performance via a data platform. During testing, LysipheN proved to be sensitive
    enough to detect and measure plant transpiration, from early to ultimate plant
    developmental stages. Even though the results were generated on common beans,
    the LysipheN can be scaled up/adapted to other crops. This tool serves to screen
    transpiration, transpiration efficiency, and transpiration-related physiological
    traits. Because of its price, endurance, and waterproof design, LysipheN will
    be useful in screening populations in a realistic ecological and breeding context.
    It operates by phenotyping the most suitable parental lines, characterizing genebank
    accessions, and allowing breeders to make a target-specific selection using functional
    traits (related to the place where LysipheN units are located) in line with a
    realistic agronomic background. Background Excessive costs of water and/or limited
    access to it in some agricultural areas do not allow all producers to access available
    solutions [1, 2]. Breeders are constantly searching to identify new phenotypic
    traits in early-generation materials that can indicate drought resistance, and/or
    water-use efficiency, and allow higher crop yields and better seed quality while
    keeping production costs low [3, 4]. This is a challenging task, especially when
    dealing with a wide range of possible adaptations or extremely different final
    product quality (seeds). On the other hand, the room for crop adaptation is limited
    by climate and climate-change volatility. Furthermore, there is not enough precise
    information about how crops will respond to these changes [5]. In the case of
    common beans, drought stress (and its consequences) has a higher level of severity
    than other types of abiotic stresses to which the bean may be exposed [6]. However,
    these problems are present in many other crops. Experiments in diverse but well-described
    and well-managed conditions help researchers to determine crop behavior related
    to a given environment [7]. Experiments focused on important crops need to be
    accompanied by internal and external information on crop physiological reactions.
    The whole set of important responses is related to restricted water availability,
    which should be understood by compiling both physical and climatic components;
    different soil types and soil profile depths; plant density, and crop-atmosphere
    relationships [8]. The physiologically adequate and agronomically relevant stress
    timing and duration connected with high-frequency data will play a crucial role
    in understanding crop responses. Thus, crops’ water use has become a main focus
    and carries different concepts to be considered. Therefore, to define water productivity
    at the plant level, transpiration efficiency (TE) likely plays a crucial role
    as it is an important component of the concept called effective use of water (EUW).
    TE is defined by accumulated economic biomass (i.e., seeds) per water unit transpired
    via the plant body [9]. To measure TE, a long period of plant observation/weighing
    is an indispensable need during the entire crop cycle. Without automation, this
    work has a drudgery component. Additionally, [10] emphasize that EUW studies should
    not be the only factor in optimizing yield under limited water conditions; Understanding
    the role of both limited and non-restricted transpiration during the diurnal phase
    and also across the whole phenology is one of the most important questions connected
    to target-specific breeding. Crop growth models recognize that water scarcity
    is associated with a high vapor pressure deficit (VPD), which in turn implies
    a condition of atmospheric water stress [11]. The dehydration resistance of leaves
    to very high VPDs has become a trait that researchers suggest being included when
    considering breeding crop varieties adapted to water-limited environments [12].
    On the other hand, under drought conditions, a limited transpiration rate under
    high VPD could be used to conserve soil water for later use when seeds are filled
    [13]. Logically the soil water availability and dynamic changes in water consumption
    during different phenological steps are crucial factors in determining the impact
    of VPD on crop development and should be included in analyses [14]. The challenge
    of useful phenotyping is aimed at techniques, tools, and databases together with
    the entire phenotypic platforms which rely on “hypothesis-driven” rather than
    “available tool-driven” research outputs [15]. The lysimeters measure changes
    in water movements by weighing the entire system. However, because of their robustness
    and complexity, most designs are considered impractical and expensive thus they
    are not widely used in research centers [16]. Additionally, the weighing lysimeter
    is a very accurate method for studying crop water-related requirements and gives
    valuable data for improving crop water management. Understanding this, some agronomists
    or crop scientists use pots or trays in evapotranspiration calculations [17, 18].
    Undoubtedly, there is a constantly increasing need for plant-phenotyping systems,
    which can (semi-)automatically measure water movement and calculate water use
    to identify genotypes with improved EUW [19]. In support of the above-mentioned
    considerations, the integration of technology to study plant features has reached
    the point at which novelty robotics solutions and mechatronic systems have often
    been offered [20]. Mechatronic systems that analyze plant-pot systems with (semi-)controlled
    irrigation are the next logical step to go further to find conservative crops
    with a limited transpiration rate at high VPDs [13]. Since VPD appears to have
    the greatest influence on transpiration response compared to other environmental
    variables [12], different studies have presented their prototypes reflecting VPD
    values. One of these is the lysimeter developed with a water-use-optimized irrigation
    system developed by Vera-Repullo. The study includes irrigation determined from
    the lysimeter’s dataset processing and an embedded system controller which is
    used as a remote data logger and allows data information access through the internet
    [21]. However, it is crucial that researchers focus efforts on developing tools
    that may be used directly in field conditions, not only in regulated and protected
    greenhouses. Some authors [16] have presented a weighing lysimeter prototype at
    the field level which was used on the farm and placed in the soil. Solutions implemented
    so far also include remote-sensing systems (i.e., wireless sensors with dataloggers),
    which have become an important tool for crop scientists. These technologies allow
    for capturing standardized data, reducing time-demanding operations, and eliminating
    differences in individual data perception [15]. Therefore, it is common that remote
    systems to be integrated with the internet-of-things (IoT). One example of this
    is the solution shown by [17], which implemented a low-cost weighing lysimeter
    that was able to measure the weight of potted crops and use an open-source platform
    to determine water balance in irrigation periods. Data were sent remotely to the
    cloud and accessible via the internet. In that way, [22] the system used 100 balances
    (scales) inside a glasshouse where each one automatically logged weight data every
    minute. In this study [22], two common bean cultivars demonstrate greater drought
    sensitivity compared to soybean cultivars. Thus, it is demonstrated that gravimetric
    platforms allow recognizing of the effects of biomass accumulation and transpiration
    per individual plant, as well as calculations related to the TE at the cycle end
    when seed yield is available. Through the measurements of plant weight changes,
    the extracted transpiration rate profiles can identify water-saving and water-spending
    mechanisms based on daily plant water losses (standardized to actual leaf area
    or other traits) representing transpiration response to VPD [23]. Our study shows
    the development and testing process for a solution-oriented tool that combines
    sensors with IoT technology. We called the device “LysipheN” (also Gravimetric
    Unit—GU). LysipheN is an automated, low-cost, and novel prototype for measuring
    the soil–plant-atmosphere continuum responses. By measuring the weight changes
    of the system (plant sown in a pot with soil) and reducing evaporation by surface
    coverage, LysipheN can automatically obtain the transpiration amount every minute
    diurnally or across the entire crop lifecycle. The system recognizes exactly the
    amount of water that has been irrigated within the system since the beginning
    of the experiment. The internal tissue (stem and pod temperature), soil moisture,
    air humidity, and air temperature sensors have been included in the device to
    capture the climatic data. Electronically, the LysipheN is an autonomous self-standing
    IoT-embedded system that sends data through the internet and stores a backup of
    millions of data locally within each unit. Besides that, the Arduino-based integrated
    system allows the integration of more sensors together. Using a Linux-based operating
    system (OS) allows updating and identifying the responses of different genotypes
    to different environments in an almost real-time manner. Each GU is an independent
    system and can be placed in different sites—growth chambers, greenhouses, and
    even within (remote) field trials. The goal of this study is to present a LysipheN
    system that can identify outstanding parental accessions for a particular region,
    using lines within a realistic breeding context, connected to product profile
    information, to dissect water-use-related traits of different genotypes/species
    and help to characterize genebank accessions. The LysipheN concept is oriented
    to be universal and versatile across a range of special-interest in crops such
    as beans, rice, bananas, tropical forage crops, and others in different stress
    scenarios related to TPEs of interest. Results The research implemented several
    experiments to achieve secure, highly precise measurements via the developed LysipheN
    prototype. Several different prototypes were tested (Gravimetric Units). The prototype
    device is described in “Materials and methods” section. For detailed technological
    adjustment data, please see Additional file 1. Once the defined version was ready,
    10 prototype replicas of LysipheN units were built to be tested. The experiments
    were conducted using the Bioversity International and CIAT Alliance facilities,
    inside a greenhouse in controlled conditions and under a monitored environment.
    The prototypes were set to record data every 5 min. The system weight (Fig. 1),
    air RH, air temperature, internal stem temperature, and soil temperature (Fig.
    2) were monitored. Together with the data from the sensors, every prototype calculates
    and recognizes data such as bean variety, number of irrigation events, total irrigated
    volume, etc. These data are stored automatically and sent to the phenotyping platform
    database. The raw results show that GU’s are stable (1, 2, 3, 5, 6–10), only GU4
    shows some noise data (Fig. 1). The irrigation events are clearly visible close
    to 10 am of each day. Mark higher raw weight changes in younger plants suggesting
    very high transpiration and water consumption connected to active prolongation
    growth on the plants. Fig. 1 Raw weight data from ten prototypes (evaluation of
    3 consecutive days). GU1 to GU5 younger (PCS) plants (1 month after sowing), GU6
    to GU10 (PCH) plants (> 80 days after sowing). A remaining noise can be noted
    on GU2 and GU10 data Full size image Fig. 2 Air temperature, electronic board
    temperature, the inside stem temperature (inserted thermocouple), and soil temperature
    together with air RH and calculated VPD. GU1 to GU5 studied younger (PCS) plants
    (1 month after sowing), and GU6 to GU10 studied plants close to the final harvest
    (PCH) Full size image The results show the environmental and stem temperature
    data from GUs (Fig. 2). The environmental data are logically pretty similar as
    the experiment was conducted in the same greenhouse. The only variable here can
    be visualized in the stem temperature as this is affected by the stem water conductivity
    and other genotype-related factors. Total leaf area (TLA) values were calculated
    for both experimental and control plants. The bar chart (Fig. 3) shows the calculated
    TLA per plant and nicely visualizes the growth differences between groups of smaller
    and big plants. The leaf area of smaller plants were around 200 cm2, meanwhile,
    the big plants’ leaf area was around 3000 cm2. Note, to standardize the row transpiration
    values among plants it is crucial to know the leaf area of each plant. Fig. 3
    Total leaf surface area calculated based on measurements of every single leaf
    surface area per plant (evaluation of 3 consecutive days). GU1 to GU5 contain
    younger (PCS) plants (1 month after sowing), and GU6 to GU10 contain old plants
    close to physiological maturity (> 80 days after sowing; PCH) Full size image
    Data analysis The cumulative transpiration per plant was calculated from GU data
    as the difference between the amount of water irrigated (ml) and the weight loss
    for 24 h (in our case for 3 consecutive days; Fig. 4). Fig. 4 Cumulative transpiration
    was calculated for every single GU. GU1 to GU5 contain younger (PCS) plants (1
    month after sowing), and GU6 to GU10 contain (PCH) old plants (> 80 days after
    sowing). The influence of the remaining noise from the load cell can be noted
    in GU2 and GU10 data Full size image Additionally, from manually measured TLA
    values and cumulative transpiration previously obtained, the net transpiration
    standardized for LA was obtained for PCS (small; GU 1–5) and PCH (big; GU 6–10)
    plants (Fig. 5). Thus, the net cumulative transpiration per leaf unit (ml cm−2)
    by the plants in different phenological stages can be observed. Note the markable
    differences between day (high) and night (low) net transpiration (Fig. 4). Fig.
    5 Net cumulative transpiration was calculated per leaf area unit for every single
    prototype. GU1 to GU5 contains data from young (PCS) plants (1 month after sowing),
    and GU6 to GU10 (PCH) contains data from physiologically mature plants (> 80 days
    after sowing). The influence of remaining noise can be noted in GU2 and GU10 data.
    Mark the difference in the scale between GU1-5 and GU6-10 due to TLA being lower
    on these plants Full size image The results show the significant difference between
    cumulative values of plant transpiration standardized to leaf area (ml cm−2) regarding
    their developmental stage. Figure 5 shows the raw, however stable data of cumulative
    transpiration standardized per leaf area. Discussion The LysipheN prototypes demonstrate
    their ability to measure 24/7 plant water consumption via transpiration (soil–plant–atmosphere
    continuum) changes according to the concept proposed by Poorter et al. [7]. The
    other variables such as stem and pods’ internal temperature, air temperature,
    air relative humidity, and soil water content were measured individually for a
    single plant. At the same time, the LysipheN units successfully supported plant
    growth without any supervision. This was achieved by controlling the daily irrigation
    of the individual plants based on plants’ previous water consumption data. The
    irrigation events were implemented by water injection reaching the defined target
    weight point every day (Fig. 1). The 10 LysipheN units were assembled based on
    the final prototype constructed from different previous versions of the GU. In
    this study, the previous versions are not shown. However, the development prototype
    process can be found in Additional file 1: “Prototype development process” section.
    This process was oriented to solving issues related to irrigation systems, hardware
    selection, sensor stability, and reducing the noise affecting the load cells.
    Some of these issues were related to the electric noise or were caused by vibrations
    [17]. Monitoring water-use efficiency (WUE) in diurnal schemes or for the entire
    growth cycle under different environmental stresses (such as VPD or irradiance
    [24]) is extremely helpful for the detection of preferred phenotypes. The specific
    target population of environments (TPE) needs to be properly considered before
    data mining starts, as only TPE-related outputs are useful for breeders who depend
    on realistic contexts. Evaluation of the final prototype on plants focused on
    showing that the prototype can effectively measure transpiration water losses
    in real-time, precisely capturing the diurnal dynamics (Fig. 1). However, some
    prototypes (GU2, GU3, and GU10) showed noise susceptibilities in the weighing
    measurements (abrupt and non-logical changes in the chart) which affected data
    quality and the analysis. We kept these data for easier detection of transpiration
    variability by former users. This particular erroneous behavior can easily be
    repaired by acquiring a high-load cell-quality sensor. The prototypes revealed
    that PCH transpired 100–200 more grams of water than PCS plants per day (during
    the 3 consecutive days), under the same environment and soil conditions. This
    is an expected result since the TLA of PCH plants was over 2000 cm2 and PCS under
    500 cm2 (Fig. 3). At this point, it is important to mention that plants’ transpiration
    under the same environment depends partly on genetics and partly on the presence
    of other abiotic or biotic stresses, and leaf temperature, thickness, and surface
    area [25, 26]. Knowing the weight losses per day, cumulative transpiration per
    leaf area/plant can be easily calculated using a particular formula (Fig. 4).
    As mentioned above, the transpiration of each plant should definitely be standardized
    per LA (Fig. 5) to unify responses between different plants and eliminate the
    genotype or treatment effect within each group. The calculations standardized
    to LA, allow us to determine that the amount of water transpired per leaf area
    was higher in smaller (PCS) than in bigger (PCH) plants due to the leaf phenology
    and in accordance with other physiological studies. These results demonstrated
    that the LysipheN prototypes are sensitive enough to detect and measure even tiny
    weight changes and then produce good transpiration data from very early to oldest
    plants across developmental stages. With additional measurements (air RH, air,
    soil, and internal stem temperatures) the co-factor effects in varying VPD (Fig.
    2) can be determined and support deeper analysis focused on factors that restrict
    transpiration. Genotypes with restricted transpiration could be more resistant
    to terminal drought but more susceptible to heat waves. However, the particular
    environment/soil scenario needs to be considered before any final decisions are
    made. The developed GU prototype is an innovative low-cost tool for modern phenotyping.
    Our system showed that combining different technologies focused on plant measurements
    creates a synergy that meets specific needs of crop physiologists, pre-breeders,
    genebank curators, and breeders. Due to the previous calibration procedures, the
    LysipheN unit is completely portable, allowing it to work in different environmental
    conditions and be connected to different electrical sources (solar panels, any
    110/220 AC source, batteries, 12 V power plants, etc.). Additionally, as an IoT
    phenotyping tool, each unit allows access to data remotely in real time through
    the web-user application. This application will send an email alert message if
    values are out of the programmed limits. Besides this, every prototype integrates
    an SQL database for data secure storing and algorithms able to calculate the water
    losses. The automatic adjustment (based on the predetermined stress scenario)
    of the next irrigation event based on the programmed watering scenario is another
    advantage of the system. High data precision will facilitate different crops’
    growth such as rice, forages, bananas, and other species according to the researchers’
    interest. Importantly, it will reduce the “preliminary experiments” to a minimum,
    especially when new stress, and more importantly new species are introduced. At
    the time of the study publication, the cost of materials per LysipheN unit (without
    manufacturing costs) was around 500 USD. Conclusions The developed LysipheN prototypes
    could become an important low-cost tool for crop pre-breeding and phenotyping
    teams, especially in places where scientists have limited resources for a big
    phenotyping platform or where the number of studied materials varies or is low.
    Development efforts were focused on the assurance of data stability and quality
    and also on a user-friendly approach for researchers even in remote areas of the
    world. The full availability for remote use of these units is an intended and
    crucial advantage when region-specific responses are needed. In this case, soil,
    water, and other inputs are used from this particular place to ensure outcomes
    suitable for modelers, pre-breeders, and breeders. This process is called “target-specific
    breeding” and is in accordance with the recommendations presented by physiological
    breeding. So far, we built 10 LysipheN prototypes capable of indirectly recognizing
    the growth specifications of individual plants by direct evaluation of their transpiration
    with a high level of precision. Weight measurements can vary between prototypes;
    therefore, easy calibration and mainboard thermal corrections are sufficient to
    solve this problem. However, the load cell noise, water condensation, and vibrations
    can affect high-precision measurements when plants are very small (one or two
    true leaves) because daily weight changes are close to the load cell threshold
    (± 5 g). With bigger plants, prototypes demonstrated successful noise reduction
    and are very reliable. The next development efforts will be focused on implementing
    cleaning algorithms and using robust industrial sensors. Using low-cost devices
    that allow remote connection to collect data in near real-time as also automatic
    irrigation based on feedback with previously transpired water is an important
    facilitation step for even small research groups to verify valuable hypotheses.
    The tool multiplies its benefits when selected functional traits are used in acceptable
    breeding contexts on materials with acceptable agronomic background (outstanding
    parental identification or early-materials evaluation). LysipheN is a tool to
    implement precise crop phenotyping, useful for breeders and physiologists but
    also in pre-breeding teams (characterization of genebank accessions by curators).
    Materials and methods In order to detect errors and challenges and measure plant
    transpiration, from early to ultimate plant developmental stages the following
    methodology is outlined. All additional technical details are included in Additional
    file 1. Experimental design An experiment with one common bean variety was carried
    out with the 10 previously-calibrated GUs inside the greenhouse with one plant
    in each GU. The experiment proved system stability, and automatic irrigation scheme
    viability, and verified the minimum threshold in weight recognition (real cell-load
    accuracy). To assess the contrast in transpiration, plants evaluated using GUs
    were divided into two groups with 5 replicates each according to their phenological
    stage (Fig. 6). The first group was formed with plants 30 days after sowing (PCS)
    and the second group with plants closer to the final harvest (PCH) (> 80 days
    after sowing). Fig. 6 Prototypes with plants—two groups. 1. Right—5 prototypes
    with younger plants (PCS) (1 month after sowing). 2. Left—5 prototypes with older
    (PCH) plants (> 80 days after sowing). 3. Center—water source container for prototypes’
    automatic daily irrigation supply Full size image In addition, 15 extra pots with
    one plant per pot, were placed next to the prototypes for manual evapotranspiration
    monitoring (control plants, Fig. 7). The soil surface of both the control and
    experimental GU was covered with black polyethylene to eliminate evaporation by
    irradiation and so measure only transpiration changes of individual plants. Fig.
    7 Prototypes with experimental (right) and control (left) plants. 1. Five prototypes
    with younger (PCS) plants (1 month after sowing). 2. Five prototypes with older
    (PCH) plants (> 80 days after sowing). 3. Control plants. Note that all pots are
    surface covered with black polyethylene. In the middle (between 1 and 2) there
    is an irrigation basin to feed peristaltic pumps for automatic irrigation Full
    size image Automatic data collection Every GU prototype was scheduled to automatically
    supply water to the plant. The amount of irrigated water depends on the amount
    of weight lost via plant transpiration during the last 24 h, after the previous
    irrigation event. In this case, 100% of the transpired water was added to each
    GU for each irrigation event, and plants were irrigated with the same amount of
    consumed water. For the purposes of this study, 3 consecutive days were selected.
    Manual data collection Some samples were taken manually during the experiment.
    Initially, 1 day before the experiment started, leaf length (LL) (from tip to
    petiole) and leaf width (LW) in millimeters at the leaves’ widest point were measured
    manually. However, these two values, LL and LW multiplied, give a rectangle area.
    Therefore, every single Leaf surface Area (LA) in cm2, was calculated by Eq. 1.
    (1) Note that GF is a genotype factor, which is a constant value of the area inside
    the rectangle that is not part of the leaf. This GF factor was obtained previously,
    and can be specific per used genotype. Thus, the Total Leaf surface Area in cm2
    (TLA) was calculated per plant (Eq. 2) as the addition of every single Leaf surface
    Area (LA). (2) TLA values were calculated for both experimental and control plants.
    Note that in Eq. 2 “n” is the number of trifoliate leaves in the plant, and LA
    is the single leaf area. Additionally, the number of leaves was also obtained.
    TLA measurements are depicted in Fig. 3 (Results section). The LysipheN prototype
    The LysipheN prototype is a mechatronic device, including hardware and software
    implemented in a mechanical structure. The mechanical structure is constructed
    as a robust, compact, and light assembly allowing the LysipheN to be easily portable.
    For the hardware implementation, the electromechanical devices, a microcontroller,
    IoT devices, and other sensors were equipped and plugged into an embedded electronics
    system. The software was developed using different programming languages and communication
    protocols. The LysipheN prototypes can measure different types of variables in
    the soil–plant–atmosphere continuum. The directly measured variable is transpiration,
    calculated via system weight changes over time. Other sensors (the tissue temperature,
    soil moisture, relative air humidity, and air temperature) serve as a source of
    additional data and support the high reliability/repeatability of the experiments.
    Using a peristaltic pump, the prototype can perform automatic and precise irrigation
    during the whole plant life cycle. Each GU is able to accurately quantify the
    transpiration losses and automatically adjust the later irrigation amount together
    with feedback from individual pre-settled unit treatment (irrigation amount in
    ml can vary from 0 to > 100% of the water loss during the evaluated period of
    time, based on the realistic or hypothetical stress scenario). The LysipheN-cultivated
    plants grow without any supervision and their performance is much better than
    in hand-irrigated plants (no damage by errors in over-watering by technicians).
    The initial parameter setting thus serves to supply plants with adequate water
    availability during the entire cycle or support constant under or overwatering.
    Accessing data in real-time is possible since every prototype has integrated a
    remote-access web application. LysipheN prototype portability allows users to
    easily move the tool to the evaluation site. The right combination of genotypes
    (deep understanding of parental lines for further crossing) together with the
    selection upon different stressors (climate, soil, watering regime, response to
    fertilizers, rhizobia etc.) will help to obtain proofs of concept for physiological
    trait/allele combinations that could boost yield, but still within a realistic
    breeding context. Mechanical structure The structure was built (Fig. 8) using
    elements purchased in a home store (our case in Homecenter in Colombia). Construction
    elements of the prototypes consist of commonly used materials such as polyvinyl
    chloride tube (PVC) 6-inch length and tube ½-inch diameter, polytetrafluoroethylene
    (PTFE; Teflon) 6-inch diameter, and electrical square box 12 × 12 cm. The mechanical
    structure contains an integrated weighing sensor (Fig. 10), but also, an irrigation
    system (actuator), cable and water hose protection, and an electronic box. The
    GU prototype structure itself (depending on the load cell capacity) is strong
    enough to support the weight of the complete system (pot, soil, and plant) up
    to 60 kg. Fig. 8 Gravimetric unit. 1. Teflon base for placing the pot. 2. Electrical
    Ip65 box. 3. Circular soft yellow 6-inch diameter PVC base. 4. Output holes for
    connecting sensors and dripping irrigation tubes. 5. Peristaltic pump for irrigation
    Full size image Hardware Since the GU prototype was developed as a complete embedded
    IoT development system, the hardware required a design adaptation process to build
    a compact electronic board with ports for the sensors, and other devices that
    facilitate the electronic working of the prototypes. This adaptation and electronic
    design process were carried out in different stages oriented to the GU hardware
    to be fully competent for the various parts: sensors’ data acquisition; irrigation
    control; electrical source connection and backup; data collection; control microcontroller,
    and IoT internal communication and application’s device (Fig. 9.). Fig. 9 Hardware

    structure was ready, the physical scope was defined to retain the ergonomics and
    protection of the electronic system without neglecting its basic operation. Sensor’s
    data acquisition Weight system measurements The weighing system (sensor, amplifier,
    and converter) returns the primary and most important variable in the measurements.
    A load cell [27] was used as the sensor to measure raw data in terms of voltage
    changes depending on the compression applied to the sensor (Fig. 10). Thus, after
    signal treatment, the system’s weight changes are measured for every required
    sample time (from milliseconds to hours), and—logically—individually for each
    GU. Therefore, considering a known initial dry weight of the substrate (soil),
    the weight system calculates the actual soil water content in % and according
    to how much water was supplied/lost evaluates the pot humidity in each period
    [28]. The sensor junction with the body of LysipheN was easily assembled in the
    structure using screws (Fig. 10). Fig. 10 Weight sensor installation. 1. Weight
    sensor (load cell). 2. Metal box as a support. 3. Circular soft yellow 6-inch
    diameter PVC base of the whole unit Full size image As the load cell works at
    a very low voltage level with 3–5 V input (1 mV in this case as an output signal)
    it is necessary to use the signal amplifier system (instrumentation amplifier)
    [28]. The ADS1232 analog-to-digital converter (ADC) was used for this purpose
    (Texas Instruments, USA). Internal pod and stem temperature measurements The prototype
    includes two thermocouple sensors to measure the temperature inside the stem and
    the fruit/pod. developed a methodology to measure the sap flow (however, this
    concept needs to be verified in our system as the most important part is the sensor
    insulation). In our case, the two sensors measure the internal pod and internal
    stem temperature by using the K-type thermocouple (K-type Teflon thermocouple
    with Nickel chromium and Nickel aluminum alloy) (Uxcell K-Type Thermocouple Wire).
    Each thermocouple (sensor) has an adapted welded end and the temperature changes
    applied to this union generate a small voltage as an output (mV) (Seebeck effect)
    transformed into the temperature. This data provides essential insights for plant
    modelers. Future crop models must accurately use varied tissue temperatures to
    estimate air temperature’s impact on growth in a changing climate. During this
    phase, internal stem and pod temperatures were measured to find links to other
    variables, plant behavior, and the influence of direct sun radiation. Electronical
    board’s temperature measurement There is a recognized temperature-based influence
    on electronic devices during their operation that could directly affect the reliability
    of working [29]. Therefore, methods to reduce the effect of the temperature should
    be applied in the design of electronic embedded boards [17] For this purpose,
    the temperature sensor TMP36 [30] was used to measure the air temperature related
    to the microclimate to which the electronical board is exposed. The data from
    this sensor is used to run an auto-compensation temperature calibration algorithm
    for more precise weight measurements. Environmental variables The monitoring of
    the immediate/cumulative plant responses according to treatment concerning actual
    climatic conditions is a necessary step for climate change-oriented plant research
    [18]. Besides, these variables are extremely important in any comparison of plants’
    responses [31]. However, sometimes climate data from far-set weather stations
    are used. Even if the climate is measured in plant proximity, some basic errors
    can easily occur because of convection, conduction, or radiation. In the developed
    LysipheN prototype, air temperature (Ta) and relative air humidity (air RH) close
    to the GU location are measured to know the dynamics of these variables during
    the experiment. These variables (Ta and RH) play a crucial role in terms of the
    VPD calculation in relation to these and transpiration demand [32]. Thus, based
    on that data, the evapotranspiration models can be calculated [33]. To measure
    Ta and air RH, an SI7021 IoT sensor together with a Sonoff module was used. The
    sensor measurement range is 0–100% RH, and − 10 to 85 °C. The precision of the
    sensors is approximately ± 3% in humidity and ± 0.4 °C for the temperature measurements.
    This sensor does not require a calibration process. Only the Tasmota code [34]
    must be uploaded to the Sonoff module with the Wi-Fi credentials. This module
    is very small. Therefore, plant development is not affected. Water irrigation
    control Poorter et al. [7] proposed different options to evaluate water consumption
    in the sense of irrigating plants in each pot individually. The consumed water
    can be replaced by plant irrigation while maintaining a nearly constant soil water
    status during the day [21]. Irrigation was supplied with high precision actuators
    (water volume error 5–10 ml) which were also used to support two different irrigation
    systems (dripping point from above the soil surface and classic bottom irrigation
    reaching first the roots). Having both systems available will allow a wider range
    of plant types to grow, including lowland rice under simulated flooding [21].
    The developed LysipheN prototype includes a programming algorithm for, among others,
    consulting local network time every 10 s in cases (experiments) where irrigation
    control by a specific time is required (below). The data of actual transpiration
    or tissue (leaf, bud, flower, pod) temperature are immediately available after
    any water supply. For the precise control of the irrigation system, a 12 V peristaltic
    pump [35] was used and connected to a digital relay which is an electronic device
    used to implement switching on/off logic [36]. During each experiment, irrigation
    process parameters may easily be changed depending on the user or plant requirements
    according to the type of water availability scenario in the developed user interface
    (UI) for the prototype (below). In a factory setting, irrigation was scheduled
    every day at a specific programmed time (usually early morning). Electrical source
    connection and backup Any experiment with LysipheN units needs an autonomous electrical
    and commonly used universal 12 V source. This allows its use at any location or
    country. Therefore, all experiments involved a battery backup system, which in
    parallel, secured 100% of the time working for the ten replicas built. Data collection
    and control microcontroller For an electronic system that requires sensor use,
    it is essential to have a microcontroller capable of reading and converting analog
    signals or digital messages into useful data. To solve this problem, the Atmega328p
    was selected [37]. This microcontroller programming is open source (using C++
    language) and can be done using the Arduino IDE. However, to get remote access
    and an internet connection for the prototype, this microcontroller needs to be
    accompanied by another device capable of saving data and sending it via Wi-Fi
    (as the Atmega328p does not have these functions). IoT internal communication
    and application device As mentioned above, Atmega328p (microcontroller) is used
    only for sensors data readings. For the prototype, it was necessary to use another
    device serving as a complement to this microcontroller able to both save and send
    data via Wi-Fi and also show them in an application Node-Red interface (see Raspberry
    application’s user interface programming). To solve this, we selected Raspberry
    Pi Zero W [38]. It is a small development board, a one-core processor with 512
    MB RAM, and integrated with a 32 GB microSD card for storing data and OS working.
    The Raspberry Pi Zero W function is highly important in the prototype’s working.
    It allows, among others: Host the main LysipheN unit web application (Fig. 15)
    where all collected data are shown and plotted in real-time. Store data in an
    internal integrated MySQL database. Control the peristaltic pump. Communicate
    and request data from Atmega 328p Microcontroller. Make easy wireless microcontrollers
    and main web application reprogramming. The use of this development board is like
    having a minicomputer within each LysipheN. Because it will allow easy connection
    and configuration of the main web application as well as allow integration of
    possible behavioral algorithm estimation and correlations that are within the
    limits of what is permitted by Raspberry’s characteristics. Main electronic board
    design The developed prototype has an integrated electronic board that contains
    ports for all devices necessary for the system’s working. For the correct integration,
    the development of the board carried out separate tests per device into an embedded
    system (Figs. 11 and 12). Thus, each sensor was tested individually using Arduino
    Uno to verify the communication working and data consistency. Fig. 11 Schematic
    design in EASYEDA Full size image Fig. 12 PCB design (top view), JLCPCB preview
    Full size image The electronic board is equipped with all devices and connections
    required. It is divided into three different parts. The first part is composed
    by: Supply connections that are connected to the 12 V main source. Internal 5
    V and 3 V converter that will supply to the Microcontroller, Raspberry, and other
    devices. The second part is accomplished by: Microcontroller (Atmega328p). Raspberry
    Pi Zero W with working respective connection. The third part in the main electronic
    board was meant for sensors connection. Weighing system (load cell, electric filter,
    and ADS1232 ADC) using a wired connection to the Atmega328p microprocessor. Two
    K-type thermocouples (tiny Teflon end welded). TMP36 sensor. Relay for ON/OFF
    peristaltic pump control. 12 V peristaltic pump for precise controlling of water
    supply. Finally, each unit has a main button, to start the entire system when
    it is switched off or to do a reboot, if necessary. A mini 5 V fan was connected
    to the IP65 box to cool it and make some airflow over electronic devices inside
    the box. Server web hosting device The GU project now comprises 10 prototypes.
    Even though each GU is equipped with a Raspberry Pi Zero W that works, among others,
    as application web hosting, this application is focused on single prototype information.
    Therefore, a Udoo Neo [39] model has been used as a server where the Node-Red
    general application works. This application contains data information of each
    GU connected to the same network and it is part of a bean phenotyping platform
    (in preparation) developed with MySQL and other saving and processing tools (below).
    Software The prototypes’ Programming routine was built in two different languages
    and programming environments. The microcontroller was programmed in C++ through
    Arduino IDE uses, and Raspberry Pi’s application was developed on Node-Red, which
    is a programming tool based on visual connections of nodes and allows different
    uses of internal Raspberry input and output pins, besides Wi-Fi connection and
    MQTT communication. Communication Perfect communication synchrony between devices
    is critical for any automated IoT development. Establishing the protocols and
    making sure that the data will not be lost, must be considered during system routine
    construction (Fig. 13). In our case, the Raspberry Pi and Microcontroller are
    compatible with serial communication, which makes it easier to share data processes
    between them. These two devices are perfectly synchronized. The Raspberry Pi Zero
    W sends a JSON package to the Phenotyping Platform with the data of each prototype
    using the MQTT protocol at each interval time previously defined. Fig. 13 Prototype
    communication flow Full size image Another important aspect of how to increase
    the communication quality for each LysipheN unit was the direct SPI connection
    between Raspberry Pi Zero W and the microcontroller. This allows the user to change
    the programming routine in both devices at any time and gives the possibility
    to add or change sensors and actuators in the future. Microcontroller programming
    routine A working program was written in C++ language to establish the main routine
    of the device that will collect data from all sensors (Fig. 14). This program
    code considers the working requirements of each sensor. Fig. 14 Microcontroller
    programming routine Full size image First, the program will load whole libraries
    and initial parameters to read the traits of the sensors’ signal data. Then, the
    user can choose in the Raspberry Pi Zero W application (see “Raspberry application’s
    user interface programming”) whether the weight temperature calibration will begin
    or not. If yes, this process will take 1 or 2 days depending on the required quality
    of the calibration. If not, the program will assign the parameters obtained during
    the last calibration to the weighing process which can then start immediately.
    If a data request arrives from Raspberry Pi Zero W, all sensors’ data are read
    and packaged in a JSON message, and it is sent to Pi Zero. Then, Atmega328p and
    the sensors are electrically disconnected for a previously defined time. Raspberry
    application’s user interface programming Every single unit was equipped with its
    user web application (Fig. 15). The role of the Raspberry Pi Zero W is to run
    the main application that uses a Node-Red programming environment, which is based
    on visual Programming through node connection and allows writing functions, Raspberry’s
    GPIO uses, and communication protocols such as MQTT. The flowchart is the name
    of the routine programmed, and it begins a short time before Raspberry starts.
    Fig. 15 Application interface with real-time data during the calibration process.
    Left to right; the last 36 h the weight and temperatures plot; the last 30 min
    weight and temperature plot; total water; and the current amount irrigated in
    the experiment and downloading data panel Full size image The application manages:
    Correcting the microcontroller’s electrical connection/disconnection. Requesting,
    receiving, and storing data from the microcontroller. Watering for daily irrigation
    control. Plotting the real-time weight and temperature changes in a web interface
    (Fig. 15). Sending data to the Phenotyping platform (Fig. 16). Fig. 16 Individual
    prototype programming of the user application Full size image Another important
    feature related to routine programming works in “parallel.” This enables the applications
    to be pending the defined irrigation time and simultaneously request, save, and
    send the data. Thus, when the time of irrigation is reached, the application executes
    the function that supplies the water based on the parameters defined previously.
    All received data are stored automatically in the MySQL database. Then, the database
    updates a CSV file with the new information and this file is ready to be downloaded
    at any time as users require. At the same time, a new JSON package is created
    and sent using the MQTT protocol to the Mosquitto broker (phenotyping platform
    server), where data from the 10 devices were saved into the MySQL database and
    interfaced in the phenotyping application in real-time. Once the data are received
    and saved, the microcontroller state is changed to OFF again and the cycle is
    restarted depending on the sample time defined by the user previously. This not
    only saves energy and protects the system, but also helps to keep the load cell
    in the correct calibration stage. Once the sampling time is reached, the Atmega328p
    state is switched to ON and then, the application requests data using the serial
    path. Phenotyping platform The aim of the platform was to construct an IoT-based
    automation platform to monitor and control environmental conditions inside greenhouses
    [40]. This platform includes vast information from many experiments on beans (Phaseolus
    vulgaris L.) at CIAT. It was developed as an open service able to receive, store,
    and show data in real-time. In addition, the IoT platform includes the application
    developed for requesting, receiving, and storing data from the Gravimetric Units
    (ten replicas), which is a necessary complement for the phenotyping development
    described in this study (Fig. 17). Fig. 17 Phenotyping platform. Note, that it
    is possible to access to complete experiment’s location-measured data and controlled
    variables information together with prototypes’ received data in a global database
    Full size image The phenotyping platform allows a general view of the data from
    the LysipheN unit prototypes in a real-time. In addition, this tool is able to
    integrate physiological and statistical analysis useful for breeders or other
    research purposes. It is important to mention that communication between the Phenotyping
    Platform and the LysipheN is made through the internet connection since both (the
    prototype and phenotyping platform) manage the wireless connection. However, developed
    LysipheN prototypes can be used without the internet, even though Wi-Fi is only
    for real-time monitoring and initial configurations, all the previously specified
    prototypes’ functionalities were programmed to work with only an electrical source.

    Article 20 October 2023 Introduction In the nineteenth century, coffee cultivation
    in Brazil began to expand into the Cerrado region. The Cerrado is a vast region
    of savanna with poor soils. However, Brazilian coffee farmers developed new techniques
    for improving the soil, such as using lime and fertilizer. As a result, the Cerrado
    is now the world''s largest coffee-producing region. The components nitrogen,
    phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, Sulphur, and iron can all be found
    in soil that is considered fertile1. The optimal soil for growing coffee is loamy
    soil, found in the state of north Karnataka, India which has a good combination
    of texture, drainage, and water retention. Coffee plantation soil requires well-drained
    soil to prevent waterlogging and root rot. Coffee plants have extensive root systems
    that extend deep into the soil to absorb nutrients and water2. The presence of
    nutrient-rich soil serves as the fundamental basis for the optimal growth and
    development of coffee plants, hence facilitating the production of superior-grade
    coffee beans. Fertility refers to the soil''s ability to provide essential nutrients
    for plant growth, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Healthy soil leads
    to healthier coffee plants, which produce higher yields of high-quality beans.
    Coffee plants thrive in slightly acidic soil with a pH of 5.0–6.5. Crop covering,
    composting, organic fertilizer, reduced tillage, water conservation, and shade
    management are ancient soil fertility strategies. Restoration of dry land to rich
    soil using IoT sensors to monitor and enhance coffee plantation soil health is
    creative and successful3. Soil sensors measure nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
    Soil temperature sensors show how temperature affects plant growth and nutrient
    uptake. Farmers can protect coffee plants from extreme temperatures by tracking
    soil temperature patterns. Soil temperature sensors show how temperature affects
    plant growth and nutrient uptake. Analyzing soil temperature patterns protects
    coffee plants from extreme temperatures4. IoT sensors help farmers optimize irrigation,
    fertilization, and other soil management activities for healthier soil and higher
    crop yields by giving real-time soil data. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are
    a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that are well-suited for processing
    sequential data like IoT sensor time-series data. RNNs are useful for time series
    prediction, anomaly detection, and natural language processing because they can
    learn and understand temporal patterns and interdependencies in datasets. Recurrent
    neural networks (RNNs) provide the capability to analyze records of soil moisture
    data, enabling the prediction of forthcoming moisture levels. Conduct a comprehensive
    examination of soil nutrient data to predict potential nutrient deficits, hence
    facilitating the efficient and effective application of fertilizers by farmers.
    This research gap identifies characteristic patterns in soil sensor data, with
    a special emphasis on sudden changes in moisture and nutrient levels. Regular
    soil monitoring will monitor the alterations in soil condition and prompt safeguards
    will be implemented5. Develop predictive models that provide suggestions for optimal
    irrigation, fertilization, and other soil management practices. The limited scope
    of traditional soil testing often focuses on soil organic matter, microbial activity,
    and soil structure. However, the use of organic improvement in soil may result
    in delayed progress. Generalized suggestions derived from past data may not consider
    the particular soil characteristics, regional climate, or contemporary methods
    of management. The information provided Erroneous interpretation of soil test
    findings and suggestions might result in misguided conclusions and unproductive
    actions. Insufficient historical analysis, which fails to account for previous
    management techniques and local environmental conditions, can have an influence
    on evaluations of soil health status and long-term patterns. This paper is organized
    as follows: “Literature review” section presents a review of related work in Recurrent
    Neural Networks with the Internet of Things using deep learning. “The proposed
    model” section describes the proposed RNN-IoT approach in detail. “Results and
    discussion” section presents the experimental setup and results. “Conclusion”
    section discusses the results and compares RNN-IoT with existing methods. “Challenges
    and future possibilities” section concludes the paper and discusses future research
    directions. Literature review Aarthi, R., Sivakumar, D., et al., proposed the
    optimal watering schedule and fertilizer application rate. IoT software platforms
    that can be used to develop smart soil property analysis systems such as Thing
    Speak, Blynk, Cayenne, Node-RED, and Azure IoT Hub. Smart soil property analysis
    systems can provide real-time soil conditions data, allowing farmers to respond
    quickly to any changes. Future work is to develop more sophisticated machine learning
    models to improve the accuracy of the predictions6. Na, A., Isaac, W., Varshney,
    S, et al., proposed an Internet of Things (IoT)-based system for remote monitoring
    of soil characteristics a system that employs sensors to collect data on soil
    properties, such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC), moisture, temperature, and
    then communicates this data to a cloud platform or another remote location. These
    soil qualities include electrical conductivity (EC), pH, and temperature7. Jain,
    N., Awasthi, Y et al., proposed an IoT-based soil analysis system using optical
    sensors and multivariate regression is a system that uses optical sensors to measure
    the color and reflectance of soil and then uses multivariate regression to predict
    soil properties, such as pH, organic matter, and nutrient content. IoT-based soil
    analysis systems can be made small and portable, making them ideal for field use.
    Future work on IoT-based soil analysis systems could focus on making IoT-based
    soil analysis systems more affordable and accessible to small-scale farmers8.
    Patil, P et al., proposed the implementation of IoT to determine the level of
    bicarbonate in the soil a system that uses sensors to measure the pH and electrical
    conductivity (EC) of soil and then uses this data to calculate the bicarbonate
    level. IoT-based bicarbonate detection systems can provide users with the data
    they need to make informed decisions about irrigation, fertilization, and other
    agricultural practices9. Adrian Z et al. proposed integrating soil pH measurement
    into an Internet of Things (IoT) application a concept that involves using sensors
    to measure soil pH and then transmitting this data to a cloud platform or other
    remote location using a wireless communication protocol. The dataset collected
    by IoT-based soil pH measurement systems typically includes soil pH, Temperature,
    Humidity, Electrical conductivity (EC), and Timestamp10 as illustrated in Table
    1. Table 1 Literature review for soil health based on different proposed models.
    Full size table IoT (Internet of Things) is a key enabling technology for smart
    agriculture, as it allows for the collection and analysis of data from sensors
    in real-time. IoT-based soil parameter measurement systems can provide real-time
    data on soil parameters, which allows farmers to respond quickly to changes. Future
    work on IoT-based soil parameter measurement systems could focus on making the
    systems easier to set up and maintain18. The materials and methods section describes
    how the soil is fertilized using IoT sensors and Cloud storage. The proposed model
    The primary objective of this research study was to monitor the overall condition
    of the soil and to design an advanced algorithm called RNN-IoT. The present techniques
    for measuring soil health based on existing and past guidelines have yielded inaccurate
    results. The suggested approach has successfully addressed all of the aforementioned
    limitations and obtained a predictable outcome in transforming barren land into
    sustainable and rich soil suitable for coffee cultivation. Build an IoT sensor

    As demonstrated in Fig. 1, the N95S31B NB-IoT outdoor temperature and humidity
    sensor accurately measures air temperature and relative humidity. Figure 1 Working
    prototype for testing soil fertility. Full size image It subsequently sends data
    to an IoT server over NB-IoT. CO2 sensors measure CO. The waterproof, sturdy CO2
    concentration transmitter outputs 0–10 V. Nordic nRF9160 SiP is a low-power, single-chip
    cellular IoT solution. Its Arm Cortex-M33 CPU, low-power RF transceiver, and multiple
    ports make it adaptable. The Nordic nRF9160 SiP''s ADC peripheral measures soil
    moisture. SiP receives soil moisture sensor data20. The Soil EC NPK PH Sensor
    monitors NPK, EC, and pH. Soil electrical conductivity (EC) may indicate salt
    concentration. Higher EC values imply plant-harming soil salt. Growing plants
    need nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. It means 20% nitrogen, phosphorus, and
    potassium in the soil. Soil pH indicates acidity or alkalinity. Acidic soils have
    pH < 7, while alkaline soils have pH > 7. Electrical conductivity sensors detect
    soil solution. NPK sensors evaluate soil solution light absorption at different
    wavelengths. This data can track soil health trends and identify areas that need
    specialist soil management. LDR soil color sensors like the MNS2-9-W2-CM-020 improve
    coffee plantation soil health monitoring21. The Maxim Integrated DS3231 time stamp
    may improve coffee plantation soil health monitoring in numerous ways. Plantation
    operators can use time stamps to find patterns and trends in soil health data
    as indicated in Fig. 2. Figure 2 Virtual abstract for proposed system. Full size
    image Protocol for interfacing serial technology (IST) Soil moisture sensors measure
    volumetric water content. Two electrodes detect soil electrical resistance, which
    fluctuates with water content. Sensor output is usually a soil moisture-proportional
    voltage or frequency as indicated in Eq. (1). Where VWC is the volumetric water
    content which finds the percentage of soil volume occupied by water, can be calculated
    based on the weight of the wet soil minus the weight of the dry soil which divides
    the weight of the dry soil. εa is the apparent dielectric permittivity of the
    soil, εb is the dielectric permittivity of dry soil, εc is the dielectric permittivity
    of water. Where ρn is the neutron count rate in the soil, ρd is the neutron count
    rate in dry soil, and ρw is the neutron count rate in water as indicated in Eq.
    (2). $${\\text{VWC}} = \\left( {\\upvarepsilon {\\text{a}} -\\upvarepsilon {\\text{b}}}
    \\right)/\\left( {\\upvarepsilon {\\text{w}} -\\upvarepsilon {\\text{c}}} \\right)$$
    (1) $${\\text{VWC}} = \\left( {\\uprho {\\text{n}} -\\uprho {\\text{d}}} \\right)/\\left(
    {\\uprho {\\text{w}} -\\uprho {\\text{d}}} \\right)$$ (2) $${\\text{VWC}} = {\\text{M}}
    + {\\text{N}}*{\\text{R}}$$ (3) where R is soil electrical resistance and M and
    N are calibration constants from Eq. (3). A soil temperature sensor is needed
    to understand soil activity and plant growth22. It employs thermistors or thermocouples,
    whose resistance changes with temperature. Equation (4) shows that the sensor''s
    voltage or current output is proportional to soil temperature. Where T is soil
    temperature, R is thermistor electrical resistance, and A and B are calibration
    coefficients. $${\\text{T}} = {\\text{A}} + {\\text{B}}*\\ln \\left( {\\text{R}}
    \\right)$$ (4) Water level indicators assess soil water table depth. It employs
    a pressure transducer or ultrasonic sensor to detect water-induced pressure or
    sound reflection. Sensor output is generally a water level-proportional voltage
    or frequency. An NPK color value indicator evaluates soil nitrogen, phosphorus,
    and potassium levels. It measures soil extract color with a colorimetric sensor.
    Sensor output is generally an RGB color value or a numerical NPK level value.
    A GPS sensor locates the soil monitoring spot. GPS satellites inform it of its
    latitude, longitude, and altitude. The sensor sends NMEA messages with location
    coordinates as indicated in Eqs. (5), (6), and (7). $${\\text{Latitude}}={\\text{ArcTan}}2\\left({\\text{sin}}\\left({\\upvarphi
    }\\right),{\\text{cos}}\\left({\\upvarphi }\\right)*{\\text{cos}}\\left(\\uplambda
    \\right)\\right)$$ (5) $${\\text{Longitude}} = {\\text{ArcTan}}2\\left( {\\sin
    \\left(\\uplambda \\right),\\cos \\left(\\uplambda \\right)*\\cos \\left( {\\upvarphi
    } \\right) - \\sin \\left( {\\upvarphi } \\right)*\\sin \\left(\\updelta \\right)}
    \\right)$$ (6) $${\\text{Altitude}} = {\\text{R}}*\\left( {\\sin \\left( {{\\upvarphi
    } - {\\upvarphi }_{0} } \\right) - \\left( {{\\text{R}}_{0} + {\\text{h}}} \\right)/{\\text{R}}*\\sin
    \\left( {{\\upvarphi }_{0} } \\right)} \\right)$$ (7) where \\({\\upvarphi }\\)
    is the geodetic latitude, \\(\\uplambda\\) is the longitude, \\(\\updelta\\) is
    the sun’s declination, R is the Earth''s mean radius (6371 km), R0 is its equatorial
    radius (6378 km), h is the GPS antenna’s height above the Earth’s surface, and
    \\({\\upvarphi }_{0}\\) is the reference ellipsoid’s latitude (43.66° LDRs (light-dependent
    resistors) measure soil color to determine nutrient content. It usually uses an
    LDR, which changes resistance when exposed to different wavelengths of light.
    Sensor output is generally a resistance value that fluctuates proportionately
    with soil color as indicated in Eq. (8). $${\\text{R}}=({\\text{Cr}}+{\\text{Cg}}+{\\text{Cb}})/({\\text{Cw}}+{\\text{Cg}}+{\\text{Cb}})$$
    (8) where R is the reflected light, Cr is the red light component of the incident
    light, Cg is the green light component of the incident light, Cb is the blue light
    component of the incident light, and Cw is the white light component of the incident
    light. Soils with higher organic matter content tend to reflect more red light
    and less blue light, while soils with lower organic matter content tend to reflect
    more blue light and less red light. A pH sensor monitors the acidity or alkalinity
    of the soil. Typically, it employs a glass electrode that generates a voltage
    that varies by the pH of the solution that it is surrounded by. The output of
    the sensor is often in the form of a voltage, and its magnitude is typically proportional
    to the pH of the soil as shown in Eq. (9). $${\\text{pH}}=-{\\text{log}}10\\left({\\text{aH}}+\\right)$$
    (9) pH is soil acidity or alkalinity and pH+ is hydrogen ion activity in the soil
    solution. Each soil health measurement is timestamped. Even when the gadget is
    off, its real-time clock (RTC) preserves precise time. Synchronizing soil health
    data with other sources and tracking changes requires the timestamp. Table 2 estimates
    dry land-rich soil in coffee plantations2. IoT sensors may be connected to Arduino
    using IST. The simple and efficient IST protocol is ideal for connecting many
    sensors to an Arduino microcontroller. It includes Master Out Slave, in Master
    in Slave Out, Slave Select, and Serial Clock. SCLK synchronizes master–slave data
    transfer. MOSI and MISO signals send data from master to slave and slave to master.
    The owner chooses the slave via SS. A start condition from the master device starts
    IST communication with the slave. Most starts are high-to-low SS signal changes.
    After supplying the start condition, the master device can send a MOSI bit per
    SCLK clock pulse to the slave device. The slave device receives MISO data and
    delivers a bit to the master device for each SCLK clock pulse. Stop signals from
    master devices to slave devices halt IST communication. SS signals typically rise
    during a standstill. Arduino microcontroller board with enough computing power
    for data handling and communication interfaces. Use appropriate cables to connect
    each sensor to the microcontroller board for proper pinout and voltage. In Algorithm
    1, each sensor''s communication protocols are configured for data acquisition.

    insights into the monitored environment or process. Analyzed sensor data can be
    used to trigger actions, such as sending alert messages based on soil health conditions.
    Recurrent neural network The raw data was delivered to the input layer, where
    it was often preprocessed and normalized to ensure network interoperability. Load
    the CSV file into Panda’s data frame. Preprocess the data by performing necessary
    steps such as cleaning, handling missing values, and feature selection. Sequence
    formation has sequence length is a variable that determines the length of each
    sequence to be created. An empty list called sequences is initialized to store
    the generated sequences. Formula for GRU-based Soil Health Monitoring where, h_t

    (12) Consider Ct as the cell state at time step t, \\({C}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}\\)
    at time step t − 1, and \\({h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}\\) as the forget gate

    the error via the unrolled RNN to calculate weight error gradients. Update weights
    to reduce inaccuracy. Prediction and Analysis in the RNN model increase warnings
    and suggestions by predicting soil health metrics from real-time sensor inputs.

    It compares with the actual generated out with historical data to generate recommendations.
    They are comparing the recommendation using three ways Present data—Historical
    data, Historical data—Historical data, and Present data—Present data as illustrated
    in Fig. 5. Figure 5 Counter-factual recommendations. Full size image For example,
    let us contemplate a hypothetical situation in which a soil health monitoring
    system, based on feedforward neural network (FFNN) architecture, provides a recommendation
    for the optimal application rate of fertilizer for a particular agricultural area.
    Counterfactual suggestion has the potential to be employed to generate alternative
    fertilizer recommendations. Manhattan distance, often known as taxi cab distance,
    is calculated by adding the absolute coordinate differences of two places. Imagine
    traveling solely horizontally or vertically in Manhattan’s grid. Distance is calculated
    using present and historical data. Consider N points in K-dimensional space, where
    2 <  = N <  = 10^ {5} and 1 <  = K <  = 5. Find the location with the lowest Manhattan
    distance from the N places. Manhattan distance is two points measured along right-angle
    axes. It is |x1 − x2| +|y1 − y2| on a plane with p1 at (x1, y1) and p2 at (x2,
    y2). Sorting the points in all K dimensions and outputting the middle components
    of each dimension reduces the Manhattan distance. $$Manhattan\\;Distance = \\left|
    {s1 - s2} \\right| + \\left| {r1 - r2} \\right|$$ (13) The Manhattan Distance,
    which indicates the dissimilarity between the current suggestion and several alternative
    fertilizer options, may be calculated as shown in Eq. (13), where |s1 − s2| denotes
    the absolute difference between the two points’ s-coordinates. |r1 − r2| is the
    absolute difference in r-coordinates. The calculation considers nutritional content,
    application rates, and environmental effects. The system may create counterfactual
    suggestions with Manhattan Distances below a threshold. This keeps alternate options
    comparable to the original advice while allowing for varied perspectives. The
    implementation phase collects and analyzes data. Results and discussion The field
    implementation of the AI-powered system involved deploying IoT sensors in selected
    infertile agricultural fields to collect real-time soil data. These sensors continuously
    monitor soil properties such as moisture, temperature, pH, nutrient levels, and
    electrical conductivity. XG-booster is used for the pre-training model for predicting
    specific soil properties (e.g., nutrient content, and moisture levels) based on
    sensor data. The collected data was then fed into the AI system, which employed
    RNNs and GRUs to identify patterns and trends in soil health indicators as indicated
    in Fig. 6. Figure 6 Agriculture land setup for testing soil fertility. (a) Agricultural

    False Negative, True Positive, True Negative, and False Positive metrics using
    the Recurrent Neural Network and Counter-Factual Recommendation Generation. Field
    setup for improving soil fertility Enhancing the fertility of the soil is essential
    for achieving sustainable agriculture and achieving maximum crop yields. To evaluate
    and enhance the fertility of the soil throughout a range of monitoring periods,
    this experiment describes a field design that makes use of several land portions.
    Datasets are collected in real-time from Madikeri, Coorg, Karnataka total of 640,
    monthly monitoring based on historical data from the past three years recorded
    around 300582. Performance evaluation compared with RNN A proposed model is compared
    to existing models to determine its accuracy. Table 3 shows random forest, SVM,
    K-means clustering, GAN, and feed-forward neural network. This performance is
    measured using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1
    score. Accuracy is the most straightforward metric, measuring the proportion of
    correct predictions made by the model. Precision measures the proportion of correct
    positive predictions. Recall, also known as sensitivity, measures the proportion
    of actual positive instances that are correctly identified as positive. Table
    3 Performance analysis for the proposed model. Full size table $$Accuracy = (True\\;
    Positives + True \\;Negatives) / (Total\\; Samples)$$ (14) $$Precision = True\\;

    * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)$$ (17) $$Specificity = True \\;Negatives
    / (True \\;Negatives + False\\; Positives)$$ (18) The proposed method achieves
    94.25% accuracy, while random forest, SVM, K-means clustering, GAN, and FFNN obtain
    81.22%, 81.66%, 82.12%, 88.12%, and 89.73%. Existing approaches take longer to
    calculate all datasets. Figure 7 shows that the suggested technique detects events
    better than current methods. High EC and TDS readings indicate excessive salinity,
    which can stress and reduce coffee plant output. Most of the 30-day monitoring
    period had optimum EC and TDS values. NPK levels reflect coffee plant nutrient
    availability. Low nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) levels can decrease
    coffee plant output. The reduction in NPK levels from day 11–30 suggests dietary
    replenishment. During days 1–10, the soil moisture was a little dry, but otherwise,
    it was excellent. The rain prevented soil desiccation and reduced coffee plant
    stress. Figure 8 shows that soil temperature also affects coffee plant development.
    Coffee plants like soil temperatures between 20 and 25 °C. During the monitoring
    period, soil temperature stayed within the optimal range, promoting root growth
    and nutrient absorption. Figure 7 Result analysis for the proposed approach. Full
    size image Figure 8 Mobile application. Full size image Optimization of the model
    To keep the coffee plants healthy and the farm skiing, it is important to monitor
    the soil health of the plantations. Beans with more robust scents and tastes are
    a product of soil that is both healthy and well-tended. Farmers may maximize water
    and fertilizer efficiency and cut down on production expenses by learning what
    their soil requires to be healthy. To maintain healthy and fertile soil over the
    long term, it is important to evaluate it regularly for signs of nutrient imbalances.
    Weekly data analysis utilizing the RNN model is used to monitor soil conditions,
    and farmers are updated on health-related information and comments about soil
    quality. For a more precise prediction, we compare the soil condition from the
    second week of monitoring with that from the first week. In a similar way comparing
    week 2 with week 1 generates correct results, comparing week 3 with week 2 and
    so on also yields accurate results. Measurements taken to enrich the soil of coffee
    plantations in arid regions When substantially monitoring and tracking various
    essential indicators such as electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids
    (TDS), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), soil moisture, soil temperature,
    carbon dioxide (CO2), and soil pH, agricultural practitioners can promptly detect
    potential issues and implement appropriate measures to uphold an optimal ecosystem
    for their coffee crops. The soil solution''s EC and TDS levels indicate salt content
    as indicated in Table 4. Table 4 Measurement Range to fertile the coffee plantation
    soil from dry land. Full size table CO2 levels rose somewhat from day 11–20, indicating
    a healthier soil microbial community. Coffee plants thrive best at 5.5–6.5 soil
    pH as illustrated in Fig. 9. The soil pH remained within the correct range during
    the monitoring period, ensuring that coffee plants could easily obtain nutrients
    as shown in Table 5. Rainfall is vital to soil hydration. The monitoring period
    was without significant precipitation from day one to day fourteen. This shows
    that irrigation was needed to maintain soil moisture levels throughout this era.
    Day 15 brought 15 mm of rain, restoring soil moisture. Coffee plant soil health
    measurements were within optimal levels for most of the 140-day monitoring period
    from week 1 to week 20. Figure 9 Weekly monitoring using the IoT Platform. Full

    Full size table Counter-factual recommendation RNN-IoT model uses historical data
    and real-time sensor readings to predict future soil states and potential crop
    threats. Based on these predictions, the system generates counterfactual recommendations—alternative
    actions your farm could take to achieve desired outcomes. Mobile application sample
    The mobile application was created with the open-source Google framework Flutter,
    employing JavaScript. The RCNN model has been integrated and implemented, resulting
    in the generation of recommendations. These recommendations are created using
    Counterfactual suggestions. Figure 10 is a discussion based on the question raised
    by the agriculturist from various parts of the coffee plantation growers. Soil-rich
    mobile-based applications will provide recommendations after analyzing sensor
    data. Agriculturist question was “How do soil conditions that are too dry, too
    wet, too cold, or too hot affect coffee plants”. The recommendation is generated
    as High or low soil pH can make it difficult for coffee plants to absorb nutrients.
    Solution: Apply soil amendments to adjust the pH to the optimal range. The specific
    type of soil amendment to apply will depend on the current soil pH and the desired
    pH range. Similarly, “How does rainfall affect coffee plants, and what can coffee
    growers do to mitigate the negative effects of extreme rainfall events”. The recommendation
    is generated as Insufficient or excessive rainfall can lead to water stress or
    soil erosion. Irrigate during periods of low rainfall and implement erosion control
    measures during periods of high rainfall. Monitoring rainfall patterns is important
    to ensure that coffee plants receive the right amount of water26. The proposed
    model is trained using the Training Set, which enables it to discover hyperlinks
    and patterns in the data. To minimize loss and enhance predictions. To evaluate
    the model''s performance and adjust its hyper-parameters, a validation set is
    utilized during its development. Evaluates the model''s ability to be extrapolated
    to new data, which helps avoid excess fitting. The testing set is utilized for
    the final and unbiased evaluation of the model''s performance once all training
    and hyper-parameter adjustments have been finished. Ensures the model''s ability
    to apply knowledge to unfamiliar data and offers an accurate evaluation of its
    capabilities as shown in Fig. 11. The total dataset is divided into 60% for training,
    20% for validation, and 20% for testing. The difference between predicted and
    actual values is computed using a loss function by mean square error. The loss
    is propagated backward through time, updating model parameters (weights and biases)
    to minimize the loss. Figure 10 Farmer’s query-based recommendation. Full size

    exhibits the success of a proposed theory27. The data represents the observed
    vs projected results for each week of monitoring. Within the realm of soil fertility,
    weekdays may be classified as several tiers of fertility. For instance, weeks
    1–7 exhibit low fertility, weeks 8–14 demonstrate medium fertility, and weeks
    15–20 showcase high fertility, making them suitable for cultivation as shown in
    Fig. 12. Figure 12 Multiple confusion matrix for monitoring soil accuracy. Full
    size image By using IoT sensors to track soil moisture, temperature, pH, and nutrient
    levels, coffee farmers can gain valuable insights into their crops'' health and
    needs. Figure 13 data can then be used to make informed decisions about irrigation,
    fertilization, and other agricultural practices—a 20-week soil monitoring study
    that tracks the soil condition in a coffee plantation. The study was conducted
    in a coffee plantation in Madekari, Coorg, and Karnataka, India. Ten IoT sensors
    were installed on the plantation, and data was collected every hour for 20 weeks.
    The sensors measured soil moisture, temperature, and pH at a depth of 10 cm throughout
    20 weeks. Due to heavy rainfall in the early weeks of the research, soil moisture
    was maximum. Dry weather diminished soil moisture. The study''s soil temperature
    peaked in the first weeks and then dropped as the weather cooled. pH was almost
    consistent throughout the investigation. Figure 13 IoT sensors monitoring land
    view. Full size image 20-week. The investigation produced soil moisture, temperature,
    and pH maps. These maps helped identify under and over-watered crop regions and
    regulate the irrigation system. The maps were also utilized to identify acidic
    and alkaline soil on the farm and adapt the fertilization program. Conclusion
    The foreseeable future of coffee production demands beyond merely cultivating
    a diverse range of coffee beans; it involves establishing a sustainable and lucrative
    coffee business that will endure for future generations. Utilizing sophisticated
    sensors allows for the monitoring of environmental variables, including precipitation,
    humidity, and temperature, to optimize agricultural productivity. Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices have the potential to accurately assess the levels of water
    and nitrogen present in soil. Furthermore, by assessing the CO2 concentration
    in agricultural areas, it is possible to accurately monitor evapotranspiration
    rates, therefore enhancing the monitoring of soil health. This requires equipping
    coffee growers with the necessary tools and expertise to develop intelligent soil—a
    flexible and robust ecosystem that supports the growth of healthy coffee plants
    while reducing environmental harm. Farmers are provided with immediate updates
    on the condition of their soil and receive alerts on any potential issues. This
    enables farmers to promptly address any early signs of soil degradation. The Recurrent
    Neural Network and Counterfactual Recommendations utilize advanced algorithms
    to forecast future trends and provide tailored soil cures for youthful agriculturists.
    Knowledgeable farmers make well-informed choices regarding their soil, leading
    to higher crop production, better quality, and more profitability. The proposed
    method has overcome all of the above drawbacks and achieved the predictable result
    for converting infertile land to fertile land sustainable for coffee plantations.
    The future direction is moving towards installed outside Internet of Things devices
    are subject to severe weather, dust, wind, temperature, and other environmental
    hazards. This is one of the main issues with these devices. Unexpected mechanical
    failure of the complex devices could occur as a result of unfavorable environmental
    circumstances. Therefore, the raw materials used to construct the Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices used in smart farming must be able to endure such harsh climatic
    conditions. This will ensure that the devices last longer and provide more consistent
    results. Coffee cherry early detection and recommendation based on advanced deep
    learning technology which empowers farmers to cultivate a sustainable future for
    coffee, one smart earth revolution at a time. Challenges and future possibilities
    Global research on the Internet of Things (IoT) and sensor-based smart farming
    have revealed positive results. It is employed in several small-scale agricultural
    domains a rural farm, where farmers have less technological expertise, may provide
    more challenges. Even so, the execution of the project on a broad scale is still
    awaiting completion. An obstacle of great importance is the financial burden associated
    with the deployment and installation of IoT-tagged sensors and accessories in
    vast agricultural areas. Furthermore, there is ambiguity regarding the expenses
    associated with implementation and the monetary benefits that may be obtained.
    Deploying IoT-enabled technology incurs substantial expenses for hardware, software,
    and system operation. Supplementary costs may encompass energy usage, system upkeep,
    service enrollment, and labor fees for operating combined hardware and software.
    Enhancing farmers'' digital literacy on a global scale is crucial to facilitating
    the extensive use of IoT technologies. Lack of comprehension and consciousness
    of IoT-based technologies in agriculture might result in the underutilization
    of intelligent systems in farming28. Government policymakers should develop economic
    strategies to facilitate the successful and efficient implementation of Internet
    of Things (IoT) technology by farmers in agricultural areas. Data privacy and
    security issues might hinder large-scale IoT and smart system adoption. Attackers
    can manipulate cloud server data to harm automated agricultural activities in
    farmlands. Attacks can negatively impact agricultural output and prevent good
    environmental management. IoT data security concerns contribute to the sluggish
    adoption of smart farming systems. Encryption is crucial for protecting critical
    data and digital systems in smart farming from global cyberattacks. Integrating
    cryptography with strong keys can reduce cyber threats on cloud systems. Additional
    methods, such as integrating multiparty computing with homomorphic encryption
    or block-chain, can yield accurate results. Experimental statement No plants and
    Animals are disturbed for research work. All image datasets information regarding
    plant-based processes or applications was obtained from publicly available and
    ethically sourced data and publications. Plant Collection materials are complying
    with institutional, national, and international guidelines and legislation. So
    we confirm that all methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines/regulations/legislation.

    system using IoT Article 05 January 2022 1 Introduction A particular volume of
    water is required to be provided to a crop at predetermined intervals throughout
    the period in which it is developing. Irrigation is critical to the accomplishment
    of any agricultural project. The process of supplying water to plants via the
    use of mechanical methods is referred to as irrigation. Particularly helpful in
    areas prone to drought or subject to unpredictable rainfall. It is impossible
    to overestimate the significance of water in the life of a plant. Because the
    principles of water management vary depending on the weather, it is essential
    to have a solid understanding of how the soil and plants interact with one another.
    The soil may be sandy, silty, clay, or any number of other textures. Every type
    of soil has both advantages and disadvantages, depending on how it was formed.
    Consider, for example, the high water absorption capacity of sand. However, the
    nutrients are immediately flushed down the drain. On the other hand, silty soil
    is made up of extremely small particles and has an exceptional capacity to store
    water for extended periods of time. Sadly, water has a difficult time draining
    through this soil because of its structure. The quality of the soil in all of
    its facets, including its ability to retain water and nutrients, is absolutely
    necessary for agricultural production. Therefore, in order to effectively manage
    the water requirements of the various types of soil, it is essential to have a
    solid understanding of the characteristics of the soil [1]. Even if there is sufficient
    precipitation in many agricultural places, there is not enough moisture for crop
    development for a number of different reasons. These causes include a lack of
    storage capacity and/or precipitation that falls at inconvenient times. It has
    been stated that the rainfall is insufficient if it is less than one hundred centimeters,
    as the irrigation system requires at least that much rain in order to function
    properly [2]. Irrigation is also necessary in regions that see fluctuating amounts
    of precipitation, such as the dry Sahel, which receives a lot of rain during the
    monsoon season but suffers from dryness during the winter months. In order to
    assist in the development of crops at times of the year when there is a deficiency
    in rainfall, water irrigation is necessary. The majority of the newest and highest-quality
    hybrid crop varieties need for a substantial amount of watering. As a consequence
    of this, it is very necessary to manage the flow of water in order to improve
    the yield and quality of the crops. Even the most common varieties of sugarcane
    and rice require a substantial amount of water to cultivate, which is demonstrated
    by the extensive and illustrious history of irrigation in the basin. This is something
    that has been well researched and written about. Each individual farmer is responsible
    for carrying out all aspects of agricultural labor, from sowing seeds and picking
    weeds to fertilizing, watering, and harvesting their crops. This process requires
    a significant investment of both time and water, in addition to a substantial
    amount of manual labor [3]. The method includes a number of decision-making phases
    that are spread out across the course of the agricultural cycle to enhance the
    productiveness of farming. Precision agriculture assists farmers in mitigating
    these issues while also increasing crop yields. This is accomplished by continuously
    measuring the soil’s temperature, humidity, temperature gradient, and pH. There
    are a number of industrialized countries in which precision farming is carried
    out exclusively through the use of the Internet of Things. The process of a computer
    being able to learn new abilities by itself through observation and repeated practice
    is referred to as machine learning [4]. In order for the algorithms to learn from
    the input datasets, gradually train the samples, and increase their performance,
    the equations need to be modified. Its foundation in real-world settings enables
    it to develop decision-making capabilities with relatively minimal input from
    humans. Machine learning-based algorithms are increasingly being used in every
    sector of the economy. On the other hand, the accuracy might be very different
    depending on the quality of the data that was utilized. As a consequence of this,
    the representations of the datasets and the variables that are being targeted
    are both essential components of the machine learning approaches [5]. The ability
    to predict the properties of the soil and plants, as well as the water level,
    together with other meteorological information, is vital for the irrigation action
    timing plan used in precision agriculture. When designing irrigation schedules,
    it is important to highlight the kind of water distribution and to take into account
    the buffer time of the system. Whether deciding when to water plants, the moisture
    level of the soil is an extremely important aspect. As soon as the set amount
    is reached, the playing field will start to get flooded. When it comes to the
    Internet of Things, new agricultural systems are beneficial because of the simplicity
    with which they make farm maintenance. The creation of such an automated system
    makes it possible to hydrate plants without the need for human involvement. Several
    different sectors have begun implementing IoT in order to increase their level
    of production. In today’s world, the Internet of Things is also being applied
    in farming in the form of smart farming. Devices connected to the internet of
    things have the ability to monitor the weather, find solutions to problems with
    irrigation, and assist farmers in increasing their crops in incremental steps.
    Innovative ideas are now necessary in the agriculture industry as a direct result
    of the growing population around the world and the accompanying rise in food consumption.
    Farmers can benefit from the Internet of Things in a number of ways, including
    increased crop productivity, improved harvesting yield, and proper field management;
    water monitoring; water usage limitation; crop monitoring; environmental impact
    prediction in advance; use of fewer people and fewer resources; prediction of
    environmental impact in advance; monitoring of water; and monitoring of crops.
    As a result of increased worldwide demand for freshwater and the concurrent expansion
    in global population, the central area of the planet is currently facing a severe
    lack of available freshwater resources. It is anticipated that by the year 2050,
    the current world population of 7.2 billion would have increased to over 9 billion.
    The vast majority of freshwater is consumed for uses related to household and
    agricultural production. The majority of industrialised countries are in dire
    need of intelligent irrigation systems since the rapid advancement of technology
    has rendered them indispensable [6]. The Smart Irrigation System is equipment
    that is considered to be at the cutting edge of technology when it comes to managing
    the flow of water in agricultural infrastructure. The SIS controller will automatically
    change the irrigation schedule so that it is optimal for the conditions of the
    soil, the current weather, and the prediction for the next week. The water-soil
    interaction as well as the crop water demand that goes along with it may both
    be established via the process of characterising the soil feature. Embedded system
    components, such as a microprocessor, together with the associated timers, sensors,
    and electrical valves, are responsible for regulating the flow of water in autonomous
    irrigation systems. As a result of this, the system is able to work in a more
    efficient manner. Controls for volume and timing, in addition to sensors that
    monitor the moisture content of the soil, are a few examples of automated irrigation.
    The controllers of the intelligent irrigation system each have their own embedded
    intelligence, which works in conjunction with the other integrated components
    of the system. These sophisticated controls keep an eye on the weather as well
    as other aspects of the surrounding environment. Based on their findings, they
    modify watering schedules and quantities so that water is neither wasted nor wasted
    too quickly. You have to be aware that the most recent generation of intelligent
    irrigation controllers set the watering schedule for the irrigation system based
    on weather forecasts. People’s confidence in the correctness of the data projected
    is essential to the operation of such a system since it relies on their input.
    This article presents IoT based Sensor integrated intelligent irrigation system
    for agriculture industry. IoT based humidity and soil sensors are used to collect
    soil related data. This data is stored in a centralized cloud. Features are selected
    by CFS algorithm. This will help in discarding irrelevant data. Clustering of
    data is performed by K means algorithm. This will help in keeping similar data
    together. Then classification model is build using the SVM, Random Forest and
    Naïve Bayes algorithm. Model is trained, validated and tested using the acquired
    data. Historical soil and humidity related data is also used in training the model.
    Section 2 presents literature survey of existing work related to intelligent irrigation
    system. Section 3 depicts the methodology part. Section 4 presents result analysis
    and discussion. This section includes performance comparison on the basis of certain
    parameters. Section 5 contains conclusion. 2 Literature survey Weakly-Secured
    Networks, often known as WSNs, are an emerging technology that have the potential
    to completely transform the agricultural industry. Maurya and Jain were kind enough
    to supply details on how to make efficient use of fuzzy logic in agricultural
    precision farming [7]. They assert that the information collected by field sensors
    is transmitted to a base station, which is then delivered to a centralised location.
    Through the use of a threshold hybrid route, the information that has been received
    by the sensors is transmitted to the base station. The authors use fuzzy logic
    to select the best cluster head in order to bring down the total amount of energy
    consumed. Farmers are able to utilise the data received by the base station to
    figure out how much water should be used for irrigation in various parts of their
    property by using the information. Farmers need to implement practises of precision
    agriculture in order to enhance their productivity. If this is the case, implementing
    WSN may significantly help farmers and other players in the agricultural sector,
    notably government irrigation agencies, make great judgements that aid in the
    forecasting of irrigation demands and crop yields. This might be a significant
    benefit of adopting WSN. A method for autonomous precision farming was developed
    by Dong et al. [8], and it makes use of centre pivot irrigation systems. This
    technological advancement makes use of sensor networks that are placed in the
    ground in order to monitor environmental elements in a field, such as the temperature
    of the soil and the moisture levels. As a result, sensors are installed, initial
    power settings are defined, and the network is maintained on a consistent basis
    in order to guarantee the most efficient utilisation of energy. In the past, a
    number of different user applications have been developed to automate and make
    the task of managing and scheduling irrigation systems more straightforward. Vellidis
    and his colleagues came up with a system that allows for more effective watering
    of cotton crops [9]. In order to establish the soil water balance in their system,
    the researchers analysed data sets collected from a variety of cotton-growing
    locations. An android mobile application was developed by the author with the
    help of the datasets. In addition to that, they have designed their app in such
    a way that it can pull weather information from surrounding weather stations.
    In order to achieve optimal levels of cotton production, the software was designed
    to carry out automated planning of the irrigation systems on the basis of the
    calculated irrigation requirements arrived at by applying both local and downloaded
    meteorological data. Imam et al. [10] conducted a study of the challenges associated
    with the design of wireless sensor networks and intelligent humidity sensors for
    use in precision agriculture. This was done with the goal of maximising the benefits
    that could be obtained. In the context of precision farming, they compared the
    performance of several microcontroller families and sensor node units with one
    another. In addition to this, an inventory of relative humidity sensor requirements
    along with modelling and interface methodologies was produced by them. Chen et
    al. [11] suggested that precision farming would be impossible without the use
    of agricultural IoT systems. Several farmers have benefited greatly from the automated
    control and data monitoring systems. The agriculture industry is rapidly turning
    to the use of machine learning in response to the pressing need to enhance traditionally
    employed practises. The capabilities of the IoT to perform remote monitoring and
    data collecting help farmers save both time and effort thanks to the utilisation
    of preexisting internet infrastructure as well as mobile and web-based applications.
    The Internet of Things system used in agriculture incorporates a wide range of
    functions, one of the most important of which is irrigation. As a result of developments
    in technology that have rendered conventional farming methods archaic, people
    are more interested in modern irrigation methods than they are in traditional
    farming. Traditional agricultural methods are no longer viable. The Internet of
    Things would be of enormous use to farmers since it would save them the time and
    effort necessary for manual monitoring of their fields. This is a big deterrent
    for many people living in metropolitan areas, despite the abundance of farmland.
    Farmers would gain greatly from the IoT. Data from sensors stored in the cloud
    might potentially be combined with methods of machine learning in order to provide
    users with assistance in planning for future output. A novel Internet of Things
    (IoT) enabled smart system was presented by Akshay and Ramesh [12] to predict
    the quantity of irrigation that is required for the field by sensing characteristics
    such as soil moisture, humidity, and temperature using a machine learning algorithm.
    This was accomplished by Akshay and Ramesh’s novel smart system. We resort to
    the K-closest neighbour strategy in order to circumvent the overfitting problem
    that occurs with the more traditional K-means and SVM methods. The outcomes of
    processing data using 3 weeks’ worth of predefined data are detailed, illustrating
    how the recommended method''s usage of the K-nearest neighbour algorithm may produce
    a completely automated irrigation system. The predictions made by the recommended
    system have a high degree of accuracy. The groundwater that is utilised for irrigation,
    home uses, and industrial reasons was analysed by Sarakutty et al. [13] in this
    particular paper. The writers also mention that in many extensive rural regions,
    irrigation is done with groundwater rather than surface water. Due to the fact
    that water is required for all forms of life on Earth, the problem of water conservation
    is an urgent one that has not yet been resolved. The global water system boosts
    the incomes and productivity of rural areas by providing assistance to farmers
    in reducing the impacts of drought and the variable nature of the weather. Irrigation
    is the most significant consumer of drinkable water but also contributes significantly
    to the depletion of ground water. The use of ground water is an unavoidable outcome
    brought about by the rising demand for agricultural goods. Because of this, it
    is very necessary to adopt cutting-edge technology in irrigation in order to make
    more efficient use of the water that is available. In a smart irrigation system
    enabled by the Internet of Things, in order to minimise the amount of water that
    is used for irrigation while yet being able to accurately estimate the rate at
    which soil moisture is being drained, Singh and others Data collected from field
    sensors and forecasts of the weather that may be available online are used to
    generate estimates of the amount of moisture in the soil. The GBRT has been demonstrated
    to be the most accurate of the several ML approaches that can be used to estimate
    the soil''s moisture content. The presented strategies have the potential to be
    a fruitful research avenue for reducing the amount of water required for irrigation.
    Pratyush Reddy and colleagues [14] have developed an intelligent irrigation system
    that is able to forecast the amount of water that a crop will require by making
    use of an algorithm that is designed for machine learning. The amount of water
    that is required for agricultural purposes may be approximated based on a number
    of different criteria, the moisture content, temperature, and humidity being the
    three most essential of these. The system’s sensors for measuring temperature,
    humidity, and wetness send data to a central CPU, which then links the device
    to the cloud. These sensors are placed in an agricultural field. The data gathered
    in the field is input into a decision tree algorithm, which is an effective tool
    for machine learning and enables efficient result prediction. Kirtana et al. [15]
    produced a work that combines the power of the internet of things (IoT) with an
    algorithm for machine learning in order to automate and speed up the process of
    developing new agricultural techniques. The planning and implementation of a smart
    irrigation system are described in depth in this article. This system makes use
    of machine learning techniques in order to fully and correctly automate the watering
    process. The sensor module is powered by solar energy, which results in a reduction
    in the system''s overall energy consumption and an improvement in the lifetime
    of the system. Singh and Sobti [16] investigated the potential applications of
    several ML algorithms in the field of agriculture as part of their research. In
    addition, the report shed light on the difficulties associated with merging IoT
    and WSN in order to achieve precision agriculture. It has come to light that the
    primary problems stem from a deficiency in intelligent infrastructure, accurate
    sensing technologies, careless water use, and an inability to predict important
    components that are required for irrigation. Therefore, according to the author,
    there is a significant demand for methods of machine learning that are both effective
    and efficient. 3 Methodology In this section, Fig. 1 presents IoT based Sensor
    integrated intelligent irrigation system for agriculture industry. IoT based humidity
    and soil sensors are used to collect soil related data. This data is stored in
    a centralized cloud. Features are selected by CFS algorithm. This will help in
    discarding irrelevant data. Clustering of data is performed by K means algorithm.
    This will help in keeping similar data together. Then classification model is
    build using the SVM, Random Forest and Naïve Bayes algorithm. Model is trained,
    validated and tested using the acquired data. Historical soil and humidity related
    data is also used in training the model. Fig. 1 IoT based Sensor integrated intelligent
    irrigation system for agriculture industry Full size image Important features
    are selected using CGS algorithm. K-Means Clustering [17] is one of the most common
    “Exploratory Data Analysis Techniques,” and if you want to evaluate the organisation
    of your data, you may make use of this technique, which gives you the opportunity
    to do so. It is a process that divides the dataset into a predetermined number
    of subsets in an iterative manner (clusters). In addition to making certain that
    the clusters do not intersect with one another, we checked to see that the data
    points contained within each cluster were as analogous to one another as was practically
    possible. The elements were grouped together into clusters according to their
    distances from the cluster''s centre, with the elements that were located the
    furthest away receiving the least amount of weight. The K-Means Clustering Algorithm
    was successful in explaining 86.6% of the variation in the data that was observed.
    K indicates that there is less variance inside a group but a greater degree of
    diversity between groups. A classifier known as a Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    [18] can be utilised to accomplish the task of separating data into linear and
    nonlinear categories. If you have more than one different group, support vector
    machine analysis can guide you through the process of building a hyperplane that
    maximises the distances that separate them. The number of classes must be added
    to the number of features to arrive at the total number of hyperplanes. The precise
    positioning and orientation of the hyperplanes can be determined by examining
    the points that make up the supports vector. With the assistance of these support
    vectors, it is possible to expand the margins of the hyperplanes. Support vector
    machines, often known as SVMs, are comprised of mathematical functions known as
    kernels. These kernels accept data as input and output it in the appropriate format.
    SVM kernels are available in a wide variety of shapes, such as linear, radial
    basis function, polynomial, and sigmoidal, amongst others. These kernels are included
    in accordance with the manner in which the data is dispersed. During the course
    of this investigation, we developed a support vector machine (SVM) classification
    model by making use of radial basis functions. A random forest (RF) is a type
    of statistical analysis in which numerous individual decision trees are blended
    to generate a single forest. In the end, the ensemble forecast that was generated
    by many disparate models (tress) is superior to the prediction that was generated
    by any one prediction model. RF can be applied in classification in addition to
    its use in regression analysis, which is one of its more common applications.
    The research led to the development of the classification RF, which utilises three
    hundred trees. Out of bag error decreases with rising tree counts, but eventually
    levels off at 50 trees, which may be used to analyse the error rate by creating
    a plot. In other words, the error rate can be evaluated by drawing a plot [19].
    The Naive Bayes (NB) algorithm is a type of supervised machine learning that is
    based on Bayes'' theorem as well as the concept that the features that are utilised
    as predictors are independent of one another within a particular class. The Naive
    Bayes model outperforms a large number of other sophisticated classifiers and
    is notably helpful for making multiclass predictions with enormous datasets. It
    is possible to calculate the posterior probability with the assistance of Bayes''
    Theorem. The posterior probability, denoted by the symbol P(W|Y), is computed
    using the formula P(Y|W) * P(W)/P(Y), where P(W) represents the prior probability
    of the predictor, P(Y|W) represents the probability of the predictor given class,
    and P(Y|W) represents the prior probability of the class. We were able to generate
    a density map for each of the seven predictor variables with the help of the Naive
    Bayes function [20]. 4 Result analysis and discussion We created a dataset of
    several environmental parameters such as soil moisture, Humidity, Temperature,
    Pressure, and Luminosity. To create comprehensive data set with all important
    parameters, we have used data sets available at [21]. Rice crop related data set
    has 42665 records. 35000 records used to train the classification model and 7665
    records used to test the classification model. IoT based soil and humidity sensors
    are used to acquire data. Features are selected by CFS algorithm. Results are
    represented in Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Amount of fresh water saved by proposed
    technique is presented in Fig. 7. Accuracy, precision, specificity, recall and

    42 percent. 5 Conclusion Precision agriculture depends on being able to predict
    the properties of the soil and plants, as well as the water level and other weather
    information. This is important for the irrigation timing plan. When making irrigation
    schedules, it''s important to pay attention to the type of water distribution
    and take the system''s buffer time into account. The level of moisture in the
    soil is a very important part of deciding when to water plants. When the set amount
    is reached, the playing field will start to get flooded.This article presented
    an Internet of Things (IoT)-based sensor integrated intelligent irrigation system
    for the agricultural sector. In order to collect data pertaining to the soil,
    humidity and soil sensors based on the internet of things are utilised. This information
    is kept in a centralised cloud storage system. The CFS algorithm is responsible
    for the selection of features. This will aid in removing irrelevant data. The
    K means approach is used to conduct the clustering of the data. This will assist
    in keeping related data together in one place. The SVM, Random Forest, and Naive
    Bayes algorithms are utilised next in the construction of the classification model.
    Using the data that was obtained, the model is then trained, verified, and tested.
    The training of the model additionally makes use of data relating to the soil''s
    history and the humidity. The K-means SVM hybrid classifier is producing superior
    results for classification, the forecast of water demand, and the conservation
    of fresh water through intelligent irrigation. Hybrid Kmeans SVM is saving fresh
    water up to 20 percent by intelligent irrigation. Data availability The data that

    Since the 21th century, the global population has experienced rapid growth. Despite
    efforts in the agriculture sector to keep up with the demand of food, the pace
    of population growth has outstripped agricultural production (Ahmed et al., 2024).
    Consequently, this imbalance has resulted in an uneven distribution of essential
    nutrients such as protein, fat and calories in the diet consumed by the people
    (Pradhan et al., 2019). According to United Nation’s estimates, there are over
    900 million malnourished people worldwide with one fourth of them being children
    under the age group of four or five. These young children are particularly vulnerable
    to the adverse effects of severe protein and energy malnutrition (PEM). The primary
    cause of inadequate access to nutritious remains a significant factor contributing
    to under-nutrition, especially among children in many developing countries (UN,
    2010). Over the past few decades, fish has emerged as a significant protein source
    in many developing countries (Ahmed and Ahmad, 2020, FAO, 2020, Ahmad et al.,
    2021. Ahmad et al., 2021, Ahmad et al., 2021a, Ahmad et al., 2021b; Ahmad et al.,
    2022). The nutritional value of fish is unquestionable as it is rich in high-quality
    protein, essential micronutrients and omega-3 unsaturated fatty acids. Notably,
    fish exhibits more pronounced satiating effects compared to terrestrial animal
    proteins like beef and chicken meat (Uhe et al., 1992). Around 60 % of people
    in developing countries heavily depend on fish for at least 30 % of their animal
    protein intake, while nearly 80 % of the population in most developed countries
    obtain less than 20 % of the animal protein from fish (FAO, 2022). However, some
    Asian countries show a relatively higher reliance on fish (Delgado, 2003). Despite
    fish plays a crucial role in sustaining a significant segment of the global population,
    with a major portion of the diet consisting of fish and fishery related products
    (Minar et al., 2012, Chakraborty et al., 2015, Gandotra et al., 2017). It’s availability
    is being compromised by unsustainable fishing practices in natural water bodies.
    This management is contributing to a deficiency in providing nutritionally adequate
    food for the populations of developing countries. Worldwide total catch of fisheries
    production in 2016 was around 91 million tons, involving about 79 million tons
    from marine waters and only 12 million tons from inland waters (FAO, 2018). By
    2030, an extra quantity or quantum of 37 million tons of fish for each year will
    be needed to meet the demand of current degrees of fish utilization for an extended
    world population. As capture fisheries is showing the indications of nearly stagnation
    for last one decade, there is a dire need to tap extra sources of resources that
    can be achieved through the mobilization of water bodies. Aquaculture emerges
    as a viable solution to this challenge, offering the potential to significantly
    augment overall fish production (Allan, 2004, Khursheed et al., 2023). To address
    the growing disparity between demand and supply on a global scale, advanced aquaculture
    technologies represent the sole viable recourse. Although different traditional
    techniques have already been employed in aquaculture, but recent technological
    advancements promise to reduce human intervention and enhance aquaculture productivity.
    Notably, AI stands out as a transformative force in the aquaculture industry (Mustapha
    et al., 2021). AI technologies are actively employed in monitoring and managing
    fish health and growth, leading to improved feed, diminished risk of disease outbreaks,
    and enhanced overall farm productivity. Geetha and Bhanu (2018) reported that
    the involvement of developmental algorithms and models in AI, enabling that conventially
    necessitate human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning and problem-solving.
    In the realm of aquaculture, AI facilitates the analysis of data derived from
    sensors and cameras to monitor fish behaviour, detect signs of disease or stress,
    employ automatic sensors for measuring fish length and weight, and optimize feeding
    regimes (Barreto et al., 2022, Føre et al., 2018, Tonachella et al., 2022). By
    analyzing this data using AI algorithms, researchers can develop predictive models
    that can identify the early signs of disease or stress in fish (Gladju et al.,
    2022). Sharma and Kumar (2021) emphasize the role of integrated sensors, biosensors,
    and AI in minimizing the reliance on antibiotics and other medications. Furthermore,
    AI contributes to the formulation of personalized feeding programs tailored to
    meet the nutritional requirements of individual fish, optimizing growth rates
    and fostering improved overall health and well-being (Kaur et al., 2021). It can
    also help to improve the management of fish reproduction, by developing predictive
    models that can identify the optimal conditions for spawning and egg production
    (Chapman et al., 2014, Migaud et al., 2013). This review comprehensively synthesis
    the application of AI to enhance the efficiency and sustainability of the aquaculture
    industry, particularly in the domains of fish reproduction, feeding, and growth.
    A compilation of prior studies on AI applications is presented in Table 1, Table
    2. Moreover, this paper aims to delve into the myriad applications of AI in aquaculture
    elucidating potential benefits and addressing the challenges and limitations that
    must be surmounted to fully exploit its potential. Table 1. An overview of some

    approximation of human intelligence in machines. The aim of AI includes computer-enhanced
    learning, reasoning and perception (Xu et al., 2021). In recent years, AI has
    grown an importance in aquaculture research and production, with both start-ups
    and established corporations developing new AI-based applications for the industry
    (The Lutz Report, 2023). Data mining and machine learning are two closely related
    techniques that are commonly used in the field of AI to analyze large amounts
    of data and extract useful insights and knowledge. While they share some similarities,
    there are also few differences between the two techniques (Sarker, 2022). Data
    mining refers to the process of extracting patterns and relationships from large
    datasets. It involves using a variety of statistical and computational techniques
    to identify trends, associations, and anomalies in the data. Data mining techniques
    can be used to explore the data, identify patterns and relationships, and develop
    predictive models that can be used to make decisions based on the data (Wu et
    al., 2021). Machine learning, on the other hand is a subfield of AI that involves
    the development of algorithms and models that can learn from data and make predictions
    or decisions based on that learning (Sarker, 2021). Machine learning algorithms
    are designed to identify patterns and relationships in data, and then use those
    patterns to make predictions or decisions about new data (Choudhury et al., 2021).
    There are several different types of machine learning algorithms, including supervised
    learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning (Mahesh, 2020). Supervised
    learning algorithms are trained on labelled data, where the correct answers are
    known, and are used to make predictions or decisions about new data learning (Mahesh,
    2020). Unsupervised learning algorithms, on the other hand, are trained on unlabelled
    data, where the correct answers are not known, and are used to identify patterns
    and relationships in the data (Patel, 2019). Reinforcement learning algorithms
    are used to train agents to take actions in an environment in order to maximize
    a reward. Both data mining and machine learning techniques are widely used in
    a variety of industries and applications, including finance, healthcare, marketing,
    and more (Sarker, 2021). They are particularly useful in fields where large amounts
    of data are available, and where there is a need to extract insights and knowledge
    from that data in order to make informed decisions. An overview of some studies
    related to AI in aquaculture is presented in Table 1. Considering the revolutionary
    of AI and machine learning, present review has been designed to summarize the
    role, importance and future perspectives of AI in aquaculture. Types of AI AI
    refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed
    to perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence, such as perception,
    reasoning, learning, and decision-making (Xu et al., 2021). AI is a broad field
    that encompasses various subfields and applications, and there are several types
    of AI (Fig. 1). Download : Download high-res image (229KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its types. Based on functionalities,
    types of AI are as below; Reactive AI: This type of AI is programmed to react
    to specific situations or inputs but cannot learn from past experiences or make
    predictions about the future (Sarker., 2022). Limited Memory AI: This type of
    AI can learn from past experiences and make decisions based on that knowledge,
    but it has limited memory and cannot consider a large amount of data (Xu et al.,
    2021). Theory of Mind AI: This type of AI can understand the beliefs, emotions,
    and intentions of other agents, making it useful for applications such as social
    robotics. Self-Aware AI: This type of AI has a sense of self and can understand
    its own capabilities and limitations. Based on Capabilities following are types
    of AI; Narrow AI: Weak AI, commonly referred to as narrow AI, is limited to performing
    a single narrow task. It advances along the spectrum of a single subset of cognitive
    talents. As machine learning and deep learning techniques advance, specialised
    AI applications are appearing more frequently in our daily lives (Sarker., 2022).
    General AI: General AI, also known as strong AI, is capable of understanding and
    learning any intellectual task that a human being is capable of. It enables a
    machine to apply knowledge and skills in a variety of contexts. So far, AI researchers
    have not been able to achieve strong AI. They have to figure out how to make machines
    conscious, programming a full set of cognitive abilities. Super AI: Outperforms
    human intelligence and is capable of performing any task better than a human.
    Artificial super intelligence envisions AI evolving to be so similar to human
    sentiments and experiences that it not only understands them, but also elicits
    emotions, needs, beliefs, and desires of its own. Its existence is still speculative.
    Thinking, solving puzzles, making judgements, and making decisions on its own
    are some of the critical characteristics of super AI (Xu et al., 2021; Sarker,
    2022). Potential applications of artificial intelligence in aquaculture Aquaculture
    stands as a rapidly expanding industry that demands significant technological
    advancements to improve farming practises. To enhance productivity, the development
    of novel farming methods is imperative and AI emerges as a key in many ways. Nowadays,
    AI gadgets are accessible to provide a more stable environment for the stock.
    Although there are several applications of AI in aquaculture, but here we discuss
    few of them in detail as below: 1. Use of AI in monitoring water quality. Effective
    water quality monitoring is paramount for the success of aquaculture operations
    (Lindholm-Lehto, 2023), given the multifaceted factors influencing it. Some of
    them are necessary to keep water at least as sustainable as possible. Fish activity
    can be directly impacted by the water quality due to the fish’s high reliance
    on the aquatic environment. Monitoring water quality is therefore a crucial problem
    to take into account, particularly in the fish farming industry (Arafat et al.,
    2020) and AI is increasingly being used to help in this area (Lu et al., 2022).
    This section aims to elucidate how AI can be effectively employed in monitoring
    water quality within aquaculture systems. By analyzing data from sensors that
    measure parameters such as temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH and ammonia levels
    (Dupont et al., 2018), AI algorithms can detect patterns and anomalies that may
    indicate problems with the water quality (Zhao et al., 2021, Khurshid et al.,
    2022). This can help farmers to take corrective actions before any harm is done
    to the fish. AI-powered water quality monitoring systems can continuously monitor
    multiple parameters in real-time, which can provide more accurate and timely information
    than manual monitoring methods (Javaid et al., 2022). This allows farmers to respond
    quickly to any changes in water quality, reducing the risk of fish mortality and
    other negative outcomes. AI assumes a pivotal role in developing predictive models
    that anticipate changes in water quality before they occur. It can be helpful
    in analyzing the historical data on water quality and other factors such as weather
    patterns and feeding schedules (Saeed et al., 2022). Besides, AI algorithms can
    predict the likelihood of changes in water quality and provide early warnings
    to farmers. Gunda et al. (2018) have developed an AI-based mobile application
    platform for water quality monitoring for bacterial contamination, where they
    have used a low-cost rapid test kit i.e., Mobile water kit for detecting the water
    quality for bacterial contamination. Moreover, AI algorithms can help farmers
    to optimize water quality parameters based on the specific needs of the fish species
    being farmed (Chiu et al., 2022). Aldhyani et al. (2020) developed advanced AI
    algorithms to predict water quality index (WQI) and water quality classification
    (WQC). For the WQI prediction, artificial neural network models, namely nonlinear
    autoregressive neural network (NARNET) and long short-term memory (LSTM) deep
    learning algorithm have been developed. In addition to this, three machine learning
    algorithms, namely, support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbour (K-NN) and
    Naive Bayes have been used for the WQC forecasting. Their results revealed that
    the proposed models can accurately predict WQI and classify the water quality
    according to superior robustness. Moreover, temperature is a critical factor in
    aquaculture, as it directly affects the health and growth of aquatic organisms
    (Mugwanya et al., 2022). AI algorithms can analyze data from temperature sensors
    in fish farms to monitor water temperature continuously. By this technique, the
    system can identify patterns and anomalies in the temperature data and provide
    real-time alerts to farmers if the temperature deviates from the optimal range
    for the specific fish species being farmed (Yang et al., 2021). This will allow
    farmers to detect changes in temperature quickly and take appropriate actions
    to maintain optimal conditions for the health and growth of the fish (Mustafa
    et al., 2016, Joseph et al., 2019, Chiu et al., 2022). By continuously monitoring
    the temperature, AI algorithms can also provide valuable insights to farmers on
    the impact of environmental changes on the fish and help to prevent potential
    problems that may arise due to changes in temperature (Føre et al., 2018). Besides
    this, AI algorithms can identify trends and patterns in the data, which can indicate
    potential risks to the health and growth of the fish (Manoj et al., 2022). This
    might be explained that when temperature increases rapidly, it may indicate a
    problem with the cooling system, which could lead to higher mortality rates for
    the fish (FAO, 2018). AI algorithms can also analyze data from other environmental
    factors such as water quality, feed management and weather patterns to provide
    a holistic view of the fish farm''s conditions (Lafont et al., 2019). By integrating
    this data, AI algorithms can provide more accurate and comprehensive insights
    to farmers on how different environmental factors can impact the health and growth
    of the fish (Niloofar et al., 2021). This can help farmers make more informed
    decisions on how to optimize their fish farm operations and prevent potential
    problems that may arise due to changes in temperature or other environmental factors
    (Gladju et al., 2022). Considering the findings of these studies, it can be inferred
    that AI algorithms can provide valuable insights to fish farmers. 2. Use of AI
    in disease detection and prevention A pivotal application of AI in bolstering
    the health and well-being of fish within aquaculture system revolves around disease
    identification and control. Numerous studies have focused on the use of AI for
    disease detection and management, optimization of feeding regimes and management
    of fish reproduction (Fig. 2). In the realm of aquaculture operations, the increasing
    utilization of AI is notably evident in the identification and treatment of fish
    infections (Li et al., 2023). AI can be used in analyzing the data from sensors
    and cameras to find indicators of illness or stress in fish. Cameras, for instance,
    can be used to observe fish behaviour and spot alterations that can point to stress
    or disease, such decreased activity levels or unusual swimming behaviour. Chen
    et al. (2022) reported that advanced disease identification based on fish behaviour
    and external appearance has been identified as a promising field for AI use. In
    addition, this detection system is based on underwater cameras or sensors to capture
    images that are sent through the cloud to the processing unit and scoring system.
    This gives artisanal farmers considerably more time to seek for management solutions
    (Darapaneni et al., 2022). Download : Download high-res image (513KB) Download

    in aquaculture. Analyzing fish photos for disease indicators is another method
    of applying AI to the identification of disease in fish (Yang et al., 2021). It
    can detect disease symptoms like lesions, odd behaviour, or discolouration by
    examining fish photos captured by cameras in the fish farm (Nik Zad, 2013, Chan
    et al., 2022). This can help farmers in early disease detection and treatment,
    limiting the demand for antibiotics and the risk of outbreaks. This method can
    assist aquaculturists in identifying fish infections sooner, which can enhance
    treatment results and lessen the disease''s ability to spread to other fish populations.
    Analyzing water quality data for disease indicators is another method of employing
    AI for fish disease identification (Setiyowati et al., 2022). Temperature, pH,
    and dissolved oxygen levels are a few examples of water quality variables that
    can have an impact on fish health and reveal the existence of specific diseases.
    AI programmes can be used to examine data on water quality and spot trends that
    can point out the presence of disease (Nayan et al., 2021). AI algorithms can,
    for instance, assess environmental information like temperature, precipitation,
    and nutrition levels to forecast when and where disease outbreaks are likely to
    occur (Elavarasan et al., 2018). This can assist aquaculturists in taking proactive
    steps to stop the spread of disease and lower the possibility of suffering financial
    losses (Rajitha et al., 2007). Besides, the use of antibiotics and other pharmaceuticals
    may be decreased by using AI tools and techniques to perform early interventions,
    such as modifying water quality indicators or delivering tailored therapies (Holmes
    et al., 2016). Furthermore, several studies explored the use of AI to analyze
    the video data from salmon farms to detect changes in behaviour that may indicate
    stress or disease. The researchers used a deep learning algorithm to identify
    behavioural patterns in the fish, and were able to detect early signs of disease
    with a high degree of accuracy. Wu et al. (2022) studied four major aspects of
    deep-sea aquaculture including intelligent feeding, water quality detection, biomass
    estimation, and underwater inspection. This transitional development has changed
    the traditional manual way to mechanization, then to automation, hence named as
    unmanned intelligent equipment. Use of these intelligent equipment in various
    fields of aquaculture can reduce labour cost, reduce threats and can increase
    working potential. Lee et al. (2000) used fuzzy logic-based control system for
    denitrification in a closed recirculation system. They developed a computer-control
    denitrifying bioreactor for a system housing squid for biomedical research. This
    Fuzzy logic can be used to process real-time inputs from sensors used to measure
    dissolved oxygen, oxidation–reduction potential and pH and in turn controls the
    pumping rates and addition carbon feed to the bioreactor. Overall, the use of
    AI to fish disease detection has the potential to dramatically enhance the health
    and wellbeing of fish populations raised in aquaculture. Table 3 shows some techniques
    which are being used in disease detection. However, further research is needed
    to explore the full range of applications of AI in aquaculture, and to develop
    more advanced and sophisticated AI algorithms and models. Table 3. Use of Artificial
    Intelligence (AI) in disease detection. S. No Disease diagnosis Technique/tool

    For determining fish health and growth rate during the growing stage, biomass
    is one of the most crucial factors (Li et al., 2020). The manual procedure for
    estimating biomass entails sampling using a fishing net or tray, catching each
    fish, weighing them individually, and then calculating the biomass (Martinez-de
    et al., 2003). It is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process, which makes
    it difficult to estimate a larger number of samples for precise biomass estimation
    (Cai et al., 2020). Additionally, it shows a higher level of measurement errors
    brought on by human error. This procedure stresses the fish, which may have negative
    consequences like growth retardation, nerve damage, and even death. Manually handling
    dead fish during post-processing for biomass estimation also compromises the texture
    and quality of the product (Zion, 2012). As a result, extensive research has been
    done to investigate alternative techniques for estimating biomass (Li et al.,
    2020). The use of AI offers new opportunities for modern aquaculture. Meanwhile,
    combining machine learning and vision can more precisely estimate fish''s size,
    weight, number, and other biological data. Machine learning and computer vision
    have emerged as powerful tools in various domains and their application in estimating
    the weight of fish showcases their potential in fisheries management and environmental
    monitoring (Monkman et al., 2019). Several studies and research projects have
    explored the use of machine learning algorithms to more accurately estimate the
    weight of fish. One notable approach involves utilizing computer vision techniques
    to analyze images of fish and extract relevant features for weight prediction.
    Bravata et al. (2020) highlights the implementation of convolutional neural networks
    (CNNs) to process images of fish and predict their weight with high accuracy.
    The study demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning in capturing intricate
    patterns and characteristics that contribute to weight variations among different
    fish species. Another study by Lopez-Tejeida et al. (2020) improved a method to
    obtain fish weight using machine learning and NIR camera with Haar Cascade Classifier.
    They reported that by the implementation of hardware and software adds an infrared
    light and pass band filter for the camera successfully, the fish was detected
    automatically, and the fish weight and length were calculated moreover the future
    weight was estimated. a. Size estimates: Body lengths of harvested fish are key
    indices for marine resource management. Some fisheries management organizations
    require fishing vessels to report the lengths of harvested fish (Tseng et al.,
    2020). Conventionally, body lengths of fish are measured manually using rulers
    or tape measures. Such methods are, however, time consuming, labour intensive,
    and subjective. Several researchers have used the ImageNet dataset and the Atlantic
    fish dataset to conduct algorithmic research on estimates of fish size. For estimating
    the length of European bass under various architectures, Monkman et al. (2019)
    suggested the R-CNN model. In addition, the author used OpenCV to calculate the
    image and increase accuracy in light of the image distortion. According to the
    findings, the typical deviation percentage was 2.2 %. b. Age determination: One
    of the main methods of fish age discrimination used presently is the automatic
    interpretation and recognition of fish age using fish otolith images (Bermejo
    et al., 2007). Machine learning has been successfully used for tasks like object
    recognition and other types of image analysis, and it is essential for otolith
    image-based age estimation. In order to determine the age of fish, Moen et al.
    (2018) used deep learning to automatically interpret otolith images and converted
    ImageNet pre-trained parameters to the trained CNN model through transfer learning.
    The experimental outcomes showed that the model performed well and could be used
    to compare the accuracy of artificial experts. The model was unable to accurately
    predict the youngest fish age area, which resulted in low prediction accuracy
    for specific ages. c. Sex determination: For the identification of the sex of
    fish, biological methods were used in the past (Du et al., 2017, Yarmohammadi
    et al., 2017, Webb et al., 2019). These methods had high detection errors and
    caused fish trauma. The machine learning method for identifying fish sex does
    not rely on the quality or age of the fish, but rather on the relative morphological
    parameters of the fish. In parallel, machine vision technology can effectively
    obtain the morphological parameters of the fish. For these reasons, the method
    of combining machine vision and machine learning can obviously identify the sex
    of fish in an effective manner (Barulin, 2017). Barulin (2019) conducted a study
    on Sex identification of starlet sturgeon based on based on scute structure using
    Boruta algorithm/Random forest algorithm. The experimental results showed that
    this approach performs well, and they also offer a positive outlook for using
    AI to determine a species sex. 4. Use of AI in fish feeding. The cost of feeding
    fish accounts for 40–50 % of the total operational cost of aquaculture (Ogunlela
    and Adebayo, 2016), while 60 % of the feed that is dispensed into the aquarium
    becomes particulates (Srivastava and Liu, 2015). These accumulated particles pollute
    the water, which uses oxygen to break them down and release ammonia, nitrogen,
    and other noxious substances that can stunt the growth of fish. While measuring
    the amount of fish feed intake remains a significant challenge, the amount of
    feed dispensed to match fish appetite levels plays a significant role in increasing
    fish productivity. AI can also help to optimize feeding of fish and AI software
    can calculate the ideal feeding schedule and serving size. This could improve
    feed use, reduce waste, and foster fish growth and health. One important area
    where AI can have a significant impact on fish behaviour, appetite, and growth
    rates is aquaculture feeding optimization. By taking into account elements like
    water temperature, dissolved oxygen levels, and the nutritional content of feed,
    AI may be used to develop prediction models that determine the ideal feeding schedule
    and quantity for a certain fish population. Through waste and the chance of overfeeding,
    this can have a detrimental effect on the environment by resulting in contaminated
    water. By reading the sensors in real-time, an optimal model for artificial intelligence
    may be employed to determine the shrimp biomass and determine the proper amount
    (Chen et al., 2022). AI can also be used to assess fish behaviour and hunger in
    real-time in addition to optimising feeding schedules. It has been reported that
    cameras and sensors can be used to keep an eye on activities like feeding, swimming,
    and other signs of stress or hunger (Barreto et al., 2022). Fish will then receive
    the ideal quantity of nutrition to support their growth and development by using
    this information to change feeding schedules and amounts in real-time (Lafont
    et al., 2022). Studies have reported that AI can also be used to develop individualised
    feeding plans for each fish, taking into account their genetic make-up, age, and
    body weight (Reyed, 2023). Precision aquaculture is a method for maximising growth
    rates and minimising the overall environmental effect of aquaculture operations
    (O''Donncha and Grant, 2019). Using AI for feeding optimization can significantly
    increase fish growth rates, appetite, and behaviour in aquaculture while lowering
    waste and having a minimally detrimental environmental impact (Føre et al., 2018).
    5. Use of AI in promoting growth rates. The optimal temperature for the growth
    of fish varies, depends on the species of fish reared. Maintenance of the optimal
    temperature, fish farmers can promote faster growth rates and larger fish (Uddin
    et al., 2022). However, if the temperature rises too high or too low, it can negatively
    impact growth rates (Sivri et al., 2007). There are several ways in which growth
    rates, aquaculture, and AI are interconnected. Foremost factor is to monitor growth
    rate. The growth rates of these organisms are critical to the success of the aquaculture
    industry. AI can be used to monitor and manage the growth rates of these organisms,
    ensuring optimal conditions for growth and maximizing production. In the current
    era modern and innovative and technical instrumental devices are using stereoscopic
    observations to measure the size, observe the shape, position and behaviour of
    fish and shrimps. It has been reported that “Sonar cameras” converts sound echoes
    into video images to use them in dark or turbid environments (Li et al., 2020).
    Studies have reported that water quality can be monitored in three dimensional
    in cages and large tanks by using autonomous vehicles that lift and lowers the
    sensor to develop 3-D data profiles (Edan et al., 2009). Whereas indoor recirculatory
    aquaculture system and underwater net-pen production environment were found more
    stable (Using sonar to help farmers solve the biomass problem, 2022). Moreover,
    AI can be used to develop predictive models that can forecast the growth rates
    of aquatic organisms (Hmoud Al-Adhaileh & Waselallah Alsaade, 2021). To effectively
    estimate growth rates, these models can take into account a variety of environmental
    variables, including water temperature, oxygen concentrations, and nutrition availability
    (Ansari et al., 2021). This can help farmers in reducing waste and streamlining
    their production processes. Based on a fish species'' development rate, water
    temperature, and other environmental conditions, a prediction model can be used
    to establish the ideal feeding rate for that species (Ghandar et al., 2021). In
    order to help farmers organise their operations more efficiently, the model may
    also forecast the anticipated yield and the date of harvest. Predictive models
    can not only increase manufacturing efficiency but also help stop disease outbreaks.
    Predictive models can identify early indications of stress or disease in aquatic
    species through environmental monitoring, enabling farmers to take preventative
    action and lessen the effect on production (Bell et al., 2022). Predictive modelling
    is a useful tool for farmers who want to maximise output while minimising environmental
    effect since it can boost growth rates, efficiency, and sustainability in aquaculture
    (Das et al., 2022). Another study examined the use of AI to optimize feeding regimes
    for salmon. They use machine learning algorithms to develop personalized feeding
    programs based on individual fish characteristics, and were able to achieve significant
    improvements in growth rates and feed conversion ratios (Barreto et al., 2022).
    AI algorithms may create individualised feeding schedules that satisfy each fish''s
    unique nutritional needs and maximise growth rates by accessing data on feeding
    behaviour and development rates (Metcalfe, 2019). 6. Use of AI in sustainability,
    efficiency and behaviour of fish. Aquaculture has the potential to be a sustainable
    food supply, but it needs to be carefully managed to prevent harm to the environment.
    It has been reported that AI can be employed to keep an eye on environmental factors
    like water quality, fertiliser levels, waste reduction, and productivity (Krishnan
    et al., 2021). The use of AI in aquaculture has the potential to boost productivity,
    promote sustainability, reduce disease outbreaks, and improve growth rates, making
    aquaculture a more viable and long-term source of food (Mandal and Ghosh, 2023).
    Fish feeding habits, activity levels, and social relationships can all be affected
    by temperature conditions. Certain fish species have been found to grow more aggressive
    in warmer temperatures. Some fish species are known to become more aggressive
    in warmer temperatures. Well-known examples are tilapia, a common freshwater fish
    raised for food that has been demonstrated to become more aggressive in warmer
    temperatures. This is thought to be caused by changes in their metabolism, which
    can have an impact on how they behave. Popular sport fish, largemouth bass have
    been seen to become more hostile in warmer water temperatures. This is assumed
    to be caused by changes in their food habits and increased metabolic activity.
    The behavior of various fish species in response to temperature changes is a fascinating
    area of study. Bluegills, a popular freshwater sunfish, exhibit increased aggression
    in warmer water likely due to heightened competition for resources such as food
    and habitat (Barber, 2007). Similarly, Atlantic salmon have been found to become
    more aggressive in warmer climates, which can lead to higher stress levels and
    increased succeptibility to diseases, potentially impacting their overall health
    and productivity (Portz et al., 2006, Svenning et al., 2022).). Coldwater fish
    called yellow perch have been seen to grow more aggressive in warmer weather (Stasko
    et al., 2012). Their feeding habits may vary as a result, and there may be more
    competition for few resources. Depending on the species and the particular environmental
    factors, the effect of rising temperatures on fish aggression may differ. Nonetheless,
    it is widely acknowledged that variations in water temperature can significantly
    affect fish behaviour as well as their general health and wellbeing. Several fish
    species become less active as a result of their slowed metabolisms and the need
    to conserve energy to keep their bodies warm in colder climates (Reeve et al.,
    2022). Which include a few fish species that slowdown in cooler weather (Power
    et al., 1999). Coldwater fish like trout become less active when the temperature
    drops. In order to save energy, they are known to seek out warmer water, such
    as at the surface or close to a warm tributary''s outflow (Heggenes et al., 2021).
    Another fish species that slows down in cooler weather is the catfish. As the
    water temperature is more consistent and they can preserve energy, they are known
    to go to deeper parts of a body of water. Freshwater fish with a wide tolerance
    for temperature variation include carp. However, they are known to become less
    active in colder temperatures and will often move to deeper areas of a body of
    water to conserve energy (Ficke et al., 2007). Pike are a type of predatory fishes
    that slowdown in cooler weather. They are known to travel to warmer water in deeper
    parts of a body of water where they can conserve energy. Besides, popular sport
    fish, walleye, become less active in cooler weather. In order to preserve energy,
    they are known to seek out warmer water, for example, close to a warm tributary''s
    outflow. This shows that depending on the species and the particular environmental
    conditions, the effects of cooler temperatures on fish activity might differ (Huntingford
    et al., 2006). Nonetheless, it is widely acknowledged that variations in water
    temperature can significantly affect fish behaviour as well as their general health
    and wellbeing. Consequently, fish producers can encourage healthy behaviours that
    produce fish with better health by maximising the temperature circumstances (Craig
    et al., 2017). The Tokyo-based Umitron Corporation created the Umitron''s system,
    a system for tracking swimmer behaviour, using AI technology. This system makes
    decisions about when and how much feed should be supplied in each fish cage based
    on real-time observation of swimming behaviour. This approach significantly reduces
    trash production, transportation and logistical needs compared to daily feeding
    as well as feed transformation efficiency. The fish are sold under the name “AI
    Sumagastsuo” in Tokyo (Umitron launches feed optimisation and mortality estimation
    software, 2022). 7. Use of AI in reproduction The study of reproductive mechanisms
    is crucial across various organisms, including, humans, animals, and plants, each
    with unique reproductive processes. Temperature plays a significant role in fish
    reproduction as certain species require specific temperature ranges for successful
    spawning. Fishermen can encourage effective reproduction and increase the number
    of fish in their farm by adjusting the temperature conditions. Freshwater or saltwater
    habitats can be used for aquaculture, which can use a variety of techniques include
    tank-based systems, net-pen systems, and integrated multi-trophic aquaculture.
    It has been studied that in aquaculture, AI can be used to enhance feeding and
    water quality, regulate fish populations, and prevent disease outbreaks (Prapti
    et al., 2022). Research on reproduction can be used in aquaculture to create fresh
    breeding plans that will boost the wellbeing and output of populations of farmed
    fish. In addition, there have been several studies exploring the use of AI for
    the management of fish reproduction. For example, one of the studies developed
    a predictive model to identify the optimal conditions for egg production in striped
    bass. Moreover, previous literature suggests that the use of AI in aquaculture
    has significant potential to improve the efficiency and sustainability of the
    industry. By enabling more effective management of fish reproduction, feeding,
    and growth (Mustapha et al., 2021), AI can lead to improved fish health and well-being,
    as well as increased productivity and profitability for fish farmers (Ubina and
    Cheng, 2022, Khan et al., 2018). 8. Use of AI in breeding programs. Based on genomic
    data, AI can be used to create prediction models of fish performance, allowing
    for more effective and focused breeding programmes for qualities like disease
    resistance and growth rate. AI systems may find genetic differences associated
    with particular features by analysing vast amounts of genomic data, and they can
    then utilise this knowledge to create prediction models of fish performance (Dixit
    et al., 2023). The performance of various fish populations under various environmental
    situations may thus be predicted using these models, as well as the top candidates
    for breeding to achieve particular objectives like disease resistance or growth
    rate. AI enables breeding operations to be more targeted and effective, which
    saves time and money while achieving desired features. By increasing the productivity
    and sustainability of fish populations, this can have a large positive impact
    on aquaculture and fisheries management (Mandal and Ghosh, 2023). Therefore, the
    use of AI and breeding programmes together has great potential to advance the
    fields of aquaculture and fisheries management as well as genetic quality and
    performance of fish populations. 9. Use of AI in conservation genetics. AI can
    be used to analyze genetic data from endangered or threatened fish species, enabling
    better understanding of their genetic diversity and potential for conservation.
    The conservation of these species is important for maintaining healthy aquatic
    ecosystems and preserving the biodiversity of our planet. Endangered or threatened
    fish species face many challenges, including overfishing, habitat loss, pollution,
    and climate change. In order to overcome these problems, conservation genetics
    can play a crucial role in understanding and addressing these challenges. Analysis
    of genetic data using AI algorithms, researchers can identify distinct populations
    within a species, as well as the genetic diversity within and among these populations
    (Vilhekar and Rawekar, 2024).This information can be used to develop more effective
    conservation strategies, such as targeting conservation efforts to areas with
    high genetic diversity or prioritizing the protection of distinct populations
    that may be more vulnerable to extinction (Vilhekar and Rawekar, 2024). Researchers
    can use AI to track alterations in the genetic diversity of fish populations that
    are at danger of extinction. They can also evaluate the success of conservation
    methods and spot possible dangers to the long-term survival of a species by monitoring
    changes in genetic diversity. AI can also assist researchers in finding genetic
    markers linked to characteristics like disease resistance or successful reproduction
    that are crucial for the survival and procreation of fish species (Palaiokostas,
    2021).. Using this knowledge, breeding strategies may be created that put an emphasis
    on maintaining certain qualities and support the species long-term survival. In
    general, the application of AI to conservation genetics can assist us in understanding
    and preserving fish species that are in danger of extinction and are crucial to
    the health of our aquatic ecosystems and the lives of those who depend on them.
    Conservation genetics is an important field that aims to understand and preserve
    the genetic diversity of endangered or threatened species. AI can be a valuable
    tool in this field, as it can help researchers analyze large amounts of genetic
    data more efficiently and accurately than traditional methods (Xu et al., 2021).
    By analyzing genetic data using AI algorithms, researchers can identify patterns
    of genetic diversity within a species, such as the presence of unique or rare
    alleles. This information can then be used to develop effective conservation strategies,
    such as targeted breeding programs or the establishment of protected habitats.
    Additionally, AI can help researchers identify potential threats to the genetic
    diversity of endangered species, such as the introduction of invasive species
    or habitat destruction (Branco et al., 2023). By identifying these threats early
    on, conservationists can take action to mitigate their impact and preserve the
    genetic diversity of vulnerable species. Overall, the use of AI in conservation
    genetics has the potential to greatly enhance our understanding of endangered
    and threatened species and help ensure their long-term survival. Overall, AI holds
    the promise of revolutionising the research of fish genomes and opening up new
    possibilities for aquaculture, fishery management, and environmental conservation.
    The ethical ramifications of genetic tools based on AI, though, are also a source
    of worry, and it''s important to make sure they''re used sustainably and responsibly.
    As a result, it''s critical to carefully weigh the possible advantages and disadvantages
    of AI in fish genome analysis and to make sure it''s applied in a way that''s
    advantageous to both people and the environment. Hence, AI has the potential to
    change the aquaculture sector by enabling more profitable, efficient, and sustainable
    production techniques. Yet, there are also worries about the price and availability
    of AI technology, as well as potential moral dilemmas with the treatment of animals
    and the environment. To ensure that AI is utilised responsibly and sustainably,
    it is crucial to thoroughly weigh the potential advantages and hazards of its
    usage in aquaculture. 10. Use of AI in fish genome. AI has the potential to revolutionise
    the study of fish genomes by enabling a speedier and more precise analysis of
    genetic data and accelerating the development of new genetic tools for use in
    aquaculture and fisheries management (Song et al., 2023). Fish genome research
    is one area where AI has showed considerable potential (Ditria et al., 2022).
    AI can assist researchers in swiftly and accurately analysing enormous amounts
    of genetic data due to the growing complexity of data analysis techniques and
    the availability of genomic data (De Alwis et al., 2022). In order to detect genetic
    variations and comprehend the activities of particular genes, it can be incredibly
    helpful for AI algorithms to learn from enormous amounts of data in order to recognise
    patterns and make predictions. By detecting desirable genetic features and enabling
    the selection of the best candidates for breeding, AI can assist in aquaculture
    and fisheries management to improve the breeding of fish species. By examining
    genetic diversity and locating genetic markers that can be used to follow fish
    movements and population changes, it can also assist in the monitoring of fish
    populations. AI can also be utilised to create novel genetic tools that can be
    used to improve the health and production of fish, such as gene editing technology
    (Rasal and Sundaray, 2020). AI has the potential to significantly advance the
    study of fish genomes, leading to important breakthroughs in aquaculture and fisheries
    management. Some of the potential applications of AI in fish genome analysis include:
    11. Use of AI in genome sequencing and editing. Large volumes of genomic data
    may be analysed using AI, allowing for quicker and more precise genome sequencing
    and assembly. AI can speed up the process of genome sequencing, a critical tool
    for determining the genetic makeup of fish species (Ruppert et al., 2019). AI
    algorithms can assist researchers in finding the most pertinent and instructive
    regions of the genome and speed up the synthesis of high-quality genome sequences
    by processing enormous amounts of genomic data. This can be very advantageous
    for fish breeding and selection in aquaculture. For instance, researchers can
    find desired features like disease resistance, rapid growth, and environmental
    adaptation by sequencing the genomes of several fish populations and examining
    genetic variants. Researchers can choose the best candidates for breeding with
    the use of AI, which can make the process much quicker and more precise than conventional
    techniques (Xue et al., 2023). This will ultimately increase the productivity
    and sustainability of aquaculture operations. In order to advance the research
    of fish genomes and enhance aquaculture techniques, AI and genome sequencing hold
    immense potential. In order to change fish genomes more effectively and precisely
    for purposes like increased growth and disease resistance, AI can be used to design
    and refine genome editing technologies like CRISPR-Cas9 (Ferdous et al., 2022).
    The science of genome editing, which makes use of instruments like CRISPR-Cas9,
    holds great promise for enhancing features in fish species including disease resistance
    and growth (Houston et al., 2020). Unfortunately, developing and refining genome
    editing technologies can take a lot of time and resources. By anticipating the
    most efficient target areas for genome editing and refining the CRISPR-Cas9 system''s
    design for optimum effectiveness and precision, AI can speed up this process (Jones
    and Wilson, 2022). AI systems can discover potential off-target effects and reduce
    the danger of unintentional modifications to the genome by evaluating vast volumes
    of genetic data. Researchers can create more effective and precise genome editing
    tools for use in aquaculture and fisheries management with the aid of AI. For
    instance, CRISPR-Cas9 can be used to change existing features to better fit changing
    environmental conditions or to introduce desired genetic traits such as disease
    resistance or increased growth into fish populations (Roy et al., 2022). Overall,
    the development of new genetic tools and interventions that can improve the health
    and resilience of fish populations is made possible by the combination of AI and
    genome editing technologies, which has enormous potential for improving the productivity
    and sustainability of aquaculture and fisheries management. Major challenges One
    problem is the absence of clear data and data sharing guidelines. A large amount
    of high-quality data is required to develop effective AI models and algorithms.
    There is currently a lack of common data formats and protocols to facilitate data
    sharing across different aquaculture enterprises and research institutions. This
    limits the application of AI in aquaculture and creates difficulties in collecting
    and analysing large amounts of data. Mustapha et al. (2021) reported that, there
    are various limitations and challenges that may hinder the extensive adoption
    of AI in aquaculture. One of them is security concerns associated with many levels
    of the interconnected systems and networks that will be required. It requires
    complex data acquisition to convert it into meaningfully capture the complexity
    and biological interactions found in many production systems. Deep learning AI
    requires large amounts of training data, which is typically difficult to come
    by. For some applications, this is further compounded by the turbidity and bio-fouling
    associated with many culture systems. Finally, cost-benefit considerations will
    largely determine the extent and pace of AI adoption. But the long term trends
    for adoption are increasingly apparent. In order to develop effective AI algorithms
    and models, large amounts of high-quality data are required. However, there is
    currently a lack of standardized data formats and protocols for sharing data across
    different aquaculture operations and research institutions. This makes it difficult
    to collect and analyze large amounts of data, and limits the effectiveness of
    AI in aquaculture. Aquaculture operations involve a wide range of variables, such
    as water quality, temperature, and feed inputs, that can interact in complex ways
    to affect fish health and growth. Developing AI algorithms and models that can
    effectively capture and analyze these complex interactions is a major challenge
    that will require continued research and development. Developing and implementing
    AI systems in aquaculture can be expensive, particularly for smaller-scale operations.
    There may be a need for investment in infrastructure and technology to support
    the implementation of AI in aquaculture. As AI systems rely on large amounts of
    sensitive data, there is a need to ensure that data is securely stored and transmitted,
    and that data privacy is maintained. Skill and knowledge gaps Data analysis, software
    development, and aquaculture domain knowledge are just a few of the abilities
    needed to build and implement AI systems in aquaculture. Programs for education
    and training might be required to fill in skill and knowledge gaps. These challenges
    need to be addressed if aquaculture is to completely benefit from AI. By creating
    effective AI models and algorithms, addressing concerns with data sharing, complexity,
    cost, privacy, and data security, AI can help aquaculture operations become more
    sustainable and efficient while also providing a stable and secure supply of high-quality
    seafood for the growing global population. It can also help close skill and knowledge
    gaps. Another issue is the creation of sophisticated AI models and algorithms
    that can account for the intricate and dynamic structure of aquaculture systems.
    A few of the several variables that can interact intimately in aquaculture operations
    to affect fish health and growth are temperature, feed inputs, and water quality.
    It will take ongoing research and development to create AI models and algorithms
    that can successfully record and evaluate these intricate interactions. Conclusion
    Because AI makes it possible to regulate fish growth, feeding, and reproduction
    more effectively and over the long term, the aquaculture industry could undergo
    a total transformation. AI can improve decision-making speed and accuracy, decrease
    the need for antibiotics, and lower the negative environmental effects of aquaculture
    operations. However, there are a number of challenges that need to be solved before
    aquaculture can completely benefit from AI. Some of them include the lack of standardized
    data and data communication protocols, as well as the need for advanced AI models
    and algorithms that can account for the complex and dynamic nature of aquaculture
    systems. Notwithstanding these challenges, the future of aquaculture AI looks
    bright. The aquaculture industry will likely see an increase in the use of AI
    as technology grows. Thanks to AI, fish production can be managed more effectively
    and sustainably, providing a consistent and safe supply of premium seafood for
    the world''s growing population. Future recommendations Despite these difficulties,
    aquaculture AI has a promising future. The advancements in sensor technology and
    data collection techniques have made it easier to collect and share high-quality
    data. Additionally, the progress in machine learning and deep learning algorithms
    allows for more sophisticated analysis of large datasets. As these technologies
    continue to evolve in the aquaculture sector, AI is expected to play a more significant
    role in the effective and sustainable management of fish production, as well as
    in improving the overall health and well-being of farmed fish. The following suggestions
    for upcoming research and development will help aquaculture fully reap the potential
    advantages of AI: Standardization of data and data sharing protocols Standardized
    data formats and protocols must be established in order to facilitate data exchange
    among various aquaculture companies and research institutes. This will make it
    possible to gather and evaluate vast volumes of high-quality data and will speed
    up the creation of efficient AI models and algorithms. AI algorithms and models
    need to be developed that can effectively capture and analyze the complex interactions
    between variables in aquaculture operations, such as water quality, temperature,
    and feed inputs. AI systems need to be integrated with existing aquaculture technologies,
    such as sensors and cameras, to enable real-time monitoring and decision-making.
    There is a need to develop low-cost AI systems that are accessible to smaller-scale
    aquaculture operations, and that can help to improve the efficiency and sustainability
    of these operations. AI can be used to develop predictive models that can forecast
    fish growth, feed requirements, and disease outbreaks, enabling more effective
    and efficient management of aquaculture operations. Collaboration between the
    aquaculture industry and academia can help to bridge skill and knowledge gaps,
    and facilitate the development and implementation of AI systems in aquaculture.
    By addressing these recommendations, AI can help to improve the efficiency and
    sustainability of aquaculture operations, and ensure a reliable and secure source
    of high-quality seafood for the growing global population. CRediT authorship contribution

  description: Saffron is a highly prized and globally demanded spice.Still, the rate
    of production is unable to keep up with the exponentially rising demand due to
    a variety of reasons. One of the major problems faced in increasing saffron growth
    is the lack of understanding of the best circumstances. Factors like Temperature,
    humidity, and light intensity play a vital role in the growth and development
    of plants, and continuous monitoring and control of these factors are necessary
    to ensure optimal growth. To address this issue this paper introduces an integrated
    automated system designed to empower farmers in optimizing production while simultaneously
    facilitating data collection for research purposes, aimed at enhancing both the
    quantity and quality of agricultural yields using the utilization of sensors and
    a live data streaming application. It allows for efficient management of saffron's
    growing operations and enables more accurate adjustments. The sensors can be remotely
    located in the saffron growing areas and connected to the app via wireless connections,
    allowing farmers to monitor these factors and suggest changes continuously. Using
    this system, farmers can ensure that the conditions for saffron plant growth are
    optimal at all times, leading to increased production. The developed app utilizes
    technologies such as ReactJS and Google Firebase, and also allows for real-time
    data streaming, enabling farmers to view the current conditions at any time and
    make adjustments accordingly. Additionally, a user-friendly mobile application
    is developed to enable farmers to easily oversee their cultivation conditions.
    This paper bridges the gap between existing research by integrating the factor
    of luminous intensity and its effect on Saffron during it's budding and growth
    stage, an area which is severely under researched and finds almost negligible
    mainstream integration in similar prototype models. Furthermore, the paper underscores
    the potential for future machine learning models by highlighting the provision
    for follow-up studies using the data collected through the prototype, thus fostering
    ongoing advancements in agricultural research and technology.

    Introduction Saffron (Crocus sativus) is renowned for its unique flavor, aroma,
    and natural coloring properties and medical applications. (Rezaee Khorasany and
    Hosseinzadeh 2016; Bingcong Xing et al., 2021) Saffron has potential medical applications
    that include its role as an antioxidant, mood enhancer (Peng Zhou et al., 2022),
    neuroprotective agent (Marx et al., 2019), anti-inflammatory, and potential benefits
    for cardiovascular health, weight management, eye health, cancer prevention, menstrual
    health, and skin health (Boskabady and Farkhondeh, 2016, Akhondzadeh et al., 2010,
    Agnihotri, 2015). However, further research is needed to confirm its effectiveness
    and safety for specific medical conditions. It should be used in moderation and
    under medical supervision (Amin et al., 2011, Bani et al., 2011), but its cultivation
    is characterized by substantial manual labor, making it one of the world''s most
    expensive spices. This study addresses a significant research gap in the field,
    focusing on the nuanced growth stages (López Córcoles et al., 2015) of saffron
    and the critical environmental factors that influence its development. The aim
    is to provide novel insights into optimizing saffron production through IoT and
    addressing the challenges posed by its cultivation, which have been relatively
    understudied in existing literature. The two major analytical points are: 1. Optimizing
    Growth Stages: It is hypothesized that understanding the specific environmental
    requirements at each saffron growth stage can lead to improved crop management
    practices, ultimately enhancing saffron yield and quality. 2. Greenhouse vs. Open
    Field Cultivation: The expectation is that greenhouse cultivation provides more
    precise control over environmental factors such as light, temperature, and humidity,
    leading to higher saffron production efficiency compared to traditional open-field
    methods. This comparative analysis fills a gap in existing research. The five
    major stages of the annual saffron cycle—sprouting, flowering, leaf development,
    daughter corm development, and dormancy—are influenced by various factors, which
    have been deduced and summarized from different works as below 1.1. Temperature
    Abbasi et al. (2009) and Nehvi et al. (2022) observed no bud growth during the
    first 30 days after leaf withering despite warm temperatures, but flowering commenced
    shortly thereafter. Interestingly, Molina et al. (2005) found optimal floral development
    within a range of 23–27°C for over 50 days, though exceeding 150 days resulted
    in floral abortion. A separate study by Zhang et al. (2023) highlighted the crucial
    role of temperature in flower emergence. They demonstrated that lowering the temperature
    to 17°C after initial incubation at warmer conditions (23–27°C) was essential
    for successful blooming. Higher temperatures, as reported by Wang et al. (2020),
    can impede flower initiation and even cause existing blooms to abort. Notably,
    their research showed that corms kept at 9°C produced no flowers at all. Further
    research by Li et al. (2022) investigated the impact of seasonal temperature fluctuations
    on saffron phenology. They observed rapid leaf withering followed by flower initiation
    in late spring/early summer when temperatures reached 20°C. Conversely, prolonged
    hot summers delayed flower emergence until late autumn when temperatures dropped
    to 15–17°C. 1.2. Humidity Research conducted by Singh et al. (2021) suggests that
    maintaining an average air temperature of 23.34°C and relative humidity of 65.71%
    for 60 days during corm incubation promotes efficient flower ontogenesis. However,
    for optimal sprout development, Zhao et al. (2019) found that 36 days of incubation
    at 19.77°C with 67.71% humidity was more effective. Interestingly, both excessive
    and deficient rainfall during the bud sprouting period have been linked to decreased
    saffron production and productivity, as noted by Kumar et al. (2018). Additionally,
    chilling periods in December and January, with mean aerial temperatures around
    2.4°C, appear to be crucial for successful saffron flowering, according to the
    findings of Khan et al. (2023). 1.3. Light intensity The role of light intensity
    in saffron cultivation remains somewhat enigmatic, particularly its impact on
    daughter bulb quality and seed yield. However, recent research by Chen et al.
    (2024) explored the effects of different light intensities and red/blue light
    combinations on saffron plants. Their findings suggest that a light intensity
    of 200 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹ with a 3R2B ratio might be optimal for maximizing stigma yield,
    quality, and nutrient content. On the other hand, studies by Liu et al. (2020)
    indicate that higher light intensities can compromise stigma yield and quality,
    despite promoting leaf growth and photosynthesis. Leveraging the wealth of knowledge
    obtained from previous studies, an IoT-based saffron system offers unprecedented
    opportunities to revolutionize saffron cultivation by providing precise environmental
    control, data-driven insights, and adaptive management strategies. This integration
    of technology and scientific understanding holds great promise for advancing saffron
    production efficiency and sustainability in the future. 2. Materials and methods
    2.1. Technologies used The technologies that have been used in developing the
    prototype after considering all of the parameters are: -ESP32 as the primary micro-controller
    -The sensors used are the DHT11 and an LDR -Database management is handled using
    Google FireBase -The app environment was set up and developed using ReactJS Other
    technologies used by researchers in the same field have included Arduino UNOs
    which are generally more expensive than the ESP-32. They have also used separate
    air moisture and temperature while we used a DHT 11 sensor that incorporates both
    these sensors as one and helps reduce the overall cost and size of the equipment.
    Each of them is explained in detail below: 2.1.1. ESP32 The ESP32 family of systems
    on a-chip microcontrollers features dual-mode Bluetooth and integrated Wi-Fi and
    is cost-efficient and less power-consuming. ESP32 series uses Tensilica Xtensa
    LX7 dual-core The Tensilica Xtensa LX6 dual-core or single-core microprocessor,
    or a single-core RISC-V microprocessor, which also has integrated antenna switches,
    power amplifiers, filters,low-noise receive amplifiers, RF baluns, and power-management
    modules. ESP32 used is shown in Fig. 1. Download : Download high-res image (112KB)

    LDR sensor and a 10 kohm resistor). 2.1.2. DHT11 sensor The widely used DHT11
    temperature and humidity sensor consists of an exclusive NTC for temperature measurement
    and an 8-bit microprocessor which is used to output the temperature and humidity
    measurements as data which is serialized (Bai et al., 2017). 2.1.3. LDR sensor
    The most common uses for photoresistors, also known as light-dependent resistors
    (LDR), are expected to discern the presence or absence of light or to gauge the
    power of the light. When the LDR sensor is exposed to light, the resistance reduces
    rapidly, perhaps even to scant ohms, hinging on the light intensity. In the dark,
    their resistance is very elevated, often reaching 1 M. LDRs are non-sequential
    devices consisting of variable sensitivity depending on the wavelength of the
    input light. Although they are exploited in many applications, other gadgets like
    photodiodes and phototransistors frequently perform this light-sensing function.

    sensor (under implementation) In our current prototype of the IoT-based saffron
    system, we are enhancing its suitability for outdoor cultivation conditions by
    incorporating a soil moisture sensor. This addition will enable real-time monitoring
    of soil moisture levels, a critical parameter for optimizing saffron cultivation.
    By accurately assessing soil moisture content, our system can dynamically adjust
    irrigation schedules, ensuring that saffron plants receive adequate hydration
    while preventing overwatering or drought stress. This proactive approach not only
    enhances plant health and productivity but also promotes water conservation and
    sustainability in saffron farming practices. With the integration of the soil
    moisture sensor, our prototype aims to provide farmers with a robust tool for
    efficient and environmentally conscious saffron cultivation in outdoor settings.
    2.1.5. Google firebase Developers can use Firebase, the Google-sponsored app development
    platform, to create web apps, for Android and iOS. Firebase provides tools to
    trail analytics, report and resolve issues regarding applications, and create
    business and test products. Following are some of the benefits of using Google
    Firebase: Google Analytics for Firebase offers free, unlimited reporting for up
    to 500 different events. Analytics provides actionable data for iOS and Android
    app users to make better decisions and app marketing. Authentication with Firebase
    Authentication simplifies the onboarding and opt-in experience for users and makes
    it easier for developers to create secure authentication solutions. These features
    support email and password authentication, phone authentication, and access to
    Google, Facebook, GitHub, Twitter, and more, providing a complete identity solution.
    Cloud Messaging: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) is a free, cross-platform messaging
    app that allows businesses to send and receive messages on iOS, Android, and the
    web. With Firebase Instant Database, a cloud-hosted NoSQL database, synchronization
    and storage of data between users can be done instantly between users. When the
    app is offline, it is still available because the device continues to connect
    to all users. Firebase and Crashlytics A real-time crash reporting tool called
    Crashlytics helps developers monitor, prioritize, and resolve security issues
    that make their applications vulnerable. their goods. With crash analysis, developers
    can focus more on building features for their applications rather than managing
    and troubleshooting crashes. Performance - Firebase Performance Monitoring Tools
    give developers information about the iOS and Android performance of their apps,
    allowing them to analyze where and how their apps are performing. When application
    performances can be improved. Developers can test iOS or Android apps on multiple
    connected devices in a single operation. They can view results, including screenshots,
    logs, and videos in the Firebase console. 2.1.6. ReactJS React is an open-source
    front-end JavaScript toolkit. It is used for creating user interfaces that are
    based on UI components. Sometimes it is known as React.js or ReactJS. Meta (previously
    Facebook) and a group of independent programmers and businesses are responsible
    for keeping it up-to-date. React can be the foundation for single-page, mobile,
    or server-rendered applications as it has similar frameworks like Next.js. React
    is only concerned with state management and presenting that information to the
    DOM that''s why creating React applications usually necessitates the use of extra
    libraries for routing and specific client-side functionality. 2.2. Application
    development 2.2.1. Application design The purpose of the application is to display
    and store real-time data, study the related objective, and help to improve on-field
    work. The designing of the application is done such that it is easy for even a
    layman to use and comprehend the application. Ease of user experience is made
    by using various UI/UX design methods such as providing white space and equal
    margin-padding to various components. Field testing is important for demonstrating
    the app in a live and demanding environment. As we move forward with our research,
    the next phase will focus on extensive field testing to validate the application''s
    performance in real-world scenarios, ensuring its effectiveness in practical on-field
    use. 2.2.2. Methodology The application is made using React JS, which is an open-source
    front-end JavaScript library used for developing user interfaces based on UI components.
    React can be exploited as a base in the development of single-page, mobile, or
    server-rendered applications The structure of the appis shown in Fig. 3 The application
    is synced with a real-time Firebase database, from which the app gets data simultaneously
    and displays it on its interface. Firebase web APIs (application programming interface)
    are used to communicate between the application and server, as shown in Fig. 4

    The app is integrated with the sensors that need to be installed in the field
    and collects live data that the user can access through the app, unlike the existing
    apps that only have static elements (Dhanaraju et al., 2022). Using the live data
    and the data that have been collected, the app compares the live data with the
    optimal data and helps farmers adjust the conditions to maximize their yield.
    This app currently focuses on saffron, but it will later be generalized to help
    farmers predict which crops will be beneficial based on the live conditions of
    the soil and field. This way, production can be increased significantly. 2.2.3.

    3. Experimentation This experiment aims to validate the effectiveness of an IoT-based
    saffron monitoring and optimization system utilizing an ESP32 device. The experiment
    is conducted in a saffron cultivation environment, where the ESP32 device, equipped
    with sensors for monitoring temperature, humidity, light intensity, and soil moisture,
    is installed. These sensors are calibrated to ensure accurate measurement of environmental
    parameters crucial for saffron growth and development. The ESP32 device is configured
    to log sensor data at regular intervals, which is then analyzed by optimization
    algorithms to generate recommendations for optimizing environmental conditions
    based on saffron cultivation requirements. The experiment employs a randomized
    experimental layout with treatment and control groups. Treatment groups receive
    optimization recommendations generated by the IoT-based system, while control
    groups do not receive any intervention. Throughout a predetermined validation
    period, environmental parameters and saffron growth stages are monitored and recorded.
    Data analysis focuses on evaluating the accuracy and effectiveness of the IoT-based
    system in providing monitoring and optimization recommendations. Preliminary results
    suggest that the IoT-based saffron monitoring and optimization system effectively
    monitors environmental parameters and generates timely optimization recommendations.
    Treatment groups receiving optimization recommendations demonstrate improved saffron
    growth and development compared to control groups, validating the system''s efficacy
    in enhancing saffron cultivation practices. This experiment contributes to the
    advancement of precision agriculture techniques in saffron cultivation, facilitating
    sustainable production and enhanced crop quality. Future research will aim to
    further refine the system''s algorithms and explore additional functionalities
    to optimize saffron cultivation under varying environmental conditions. 4. Future
    work In the next phase of our research, we plan to integrate a small pump into
    our existing IoT-based saffron monitoring and optimization system. This addition
    aims to automate irrigation by maintaining optimal soil moisture levels in the
    saffron cultivation plot. Our experimentation plan involves selecting a suitable
    pump, installing it in the cultivation plot, and calibrating it to deliver water
    based on soil moisture sensor readings. We will develop control algorithms to
    activate the pump when soil moisture falls below a predetermined threshold and
    integrate pump control functionalities into our IoT system. Through a series of
    experiments, we will validate the effectiveness of the integrated pump in promoting
    saffron growth and yield compared to manual irrigation methods. By automating
    irrigation based on real-time data, we aim to improve resource efficiency, enhance
    crop quality, and increase saffron productivity. 5. Results and discussions This
    study posits the conceptualization and realization of an Internet of Things (IoT)-based
    application designed for the surveillance and regulation of pivotal agronomic
    parameters, encompassing variables such as ambient temperature, relative humidity,
    and luminance levels. The overarching objective is to mitigate irrigation challenges
    while concurrently augmenting the cultivation practices of saffron. The resultant
    application, characterized by its intuitive and user-centric interface, harbors
    the capacity to bolster the qualitative and quantitative yield of saffron crops.
    A salient hallmark of this application is its capacity to amass and archive field-derived
    data, thus serving as a comprehensive repository that may be harnessed by researchers
    for investigative and multifarious purposes. Furthermore, the software is inherently
    adaptable, affording the ability to transition seamlessly from saffron cultivation
    to the cultivation of diverse exotic crops in prospective phases, although its
    current purview centers exclusively on saffron. The app is useful to index useful
    Luminous intensity, air moisture, and temperature data along with a radar for
    the optimum range criteria being met or not for a certain study interval. The
    paramount aim of this endeavor resides in the metamorphosis of conventional agricultural
    methodologies into the realm of smart farming, characterized by the judicious
    economization of both temporal and pecuniary resources for the agricultural community.
    A plausible extension of this initiative entails the infusion of IoT technologies
    within a controlled artificial environment, whereby scientific methodologies facilitate
    the cultivation of saffron and other crops within a smart agroecosystem, accompanied
    by rigorous performance assessment and analysis. The Light Dependent Resistor
    (LDR) sensor, a pivotal component in the research, has furnished us with essential
    data. This data, meticulously analyzed and cross-referenced with existing research
    datasets, has played a pivotal role in ascertaining an appropriate environmental
    range conducive to saffron cultivation. Notably, this dataset has been instrumental
    in forecasting optimal growth periods. From a forward-looking perspective, this
    data serves as a foundational basis for the envisaged implementation of opaque
    light-restrictive structures. These structures are strategically designed to regulate
    luminous intensity, thus fine-tuning it to the precise threshold prescribed by
    our application for saffron cultivation. This orchestration ensures that the luminous
    conditions are maintained within the ideal spectrum conducive to saffron growth
    and development. 6. Conclusion The research and prototype have successfully demonstrated
    the integration of cutting-edge technology to address critical challenges in saffron
    cultivation. By developing an innovative mobile application integrated with sensors,
    a tool has been developed for saffron farmers to monitor and manage their crop’s
    temperature and humidity levels more effectively. This project has several key
    takeaways: 1. Resource Optimization: By monitoring saffron fields remotely through
    the mobile app, farmers can optimize resource usage, such as irrigation. This
    also contributes to sustainable farming practices, conserving water and energy.
    2. Data Collection and Analysis: Over time, the data collected through our system
    can serve as a valuable resource for research and analysis. Researchers and agronomists
    can access this data to gain insights into saffron cultivation trends, climate
    change impacts, and improved crop management strategies. 3. Enhanced Crop Management:
    The integration of sensors provides accurate and reliable data on temperature
    and humidity, two crucial factors in saffron cultivation. This data allows farmers
    to take timely actions to prevent or mitigate adverse effects on the crop. As
    a result, saffron cultivation becomes more resilient and efficient. In summary,
    this research and project have successfully addressed the challenges faced by
    saffron farmers by providing a reliable, user-friendly, and data-driven solution.
    By embracing the potential of IoT and mobile technology in agriculture, we have
    not only improved saffron crop management but also contributed to the broader
    goal of sustainable and efficient farming practices. This research paves the way
    for further innovation in precision agriculture and offers a promising outlook
    for the future of saffron cultivation. CRediT authorship contribution statement

    The growing scarcity of freshwater is one of the main challenges to food security
    and sustainability, where agriculture annually consumes the most water [1]. For
    this purpose, precision agriculture (PA) has achieved significant progress in
    water management and crop production using technological advances in software
    and hardware [2]. Precision irrigation (PI) is the sustainable management of water
    resources, which involves the application of water to the crop to meet specific
    plant water demands in space and time, while avoiding excessive or insufficient
    irrigation and minimizing adverse environmental impacts [3]. In PA, the Variable
    Rate Application (VRA) is the assignment of agricultural inputs in a site-specific
    manner. The correct application of the variable rate needs the specific plant
    requirements, the precise position and the characteristics of the environment
    where the input will be applied. There are two strategies for VRA: Map-based and
    sensor-based. In Map-Based VRA, the prescription map is generated and loaded into
    a computer inside the machinery before it performs its activities on the field
    [4]. Sensor-Based VRA is the technology that integrates sensors for automatically
    detecting the value of specific parameters in the plants or the soil in real-time
    and for deciding which kind and quantity of agricultural input should be applied
    [5]. VRA technologies apply water, fertilizer, herbicide and other chemicals for
    weeds and disease control and seed selection in sowing [6]. The purpose of those
    technologies is to save water, fertilizers and chemicals, increase potential yields
    and the protection of the environment [7]. The variable rate irrigation (VRI)
    technology provides the ability to site-specifically apply water in the field
    to achieve potential water savings [8]; this enables the incorporation of water
    in the soil according to the temporal and spatial soil characteristics and plant
    demand at different growth stages [9]. The VRI technology aims to apply the right
    amount of water at the right time, in the right place of the field, reducing water
    waste and improving water use efficiency (WUE), which is the ratio between biomass
    produced to the rate of transpiration [10], [6]. The effectiveness of VRI depends
    on the delineation of management zones, irrigation infrastructure, crop type,
    weather conditions and field properties such as topography, soil texture and soil
    water retention curves; that influence soil water content and crop irrigation
    prescriptions [11]. Therefore, understanding these factors can provide a basis
    to achieve improvements in crop water productivity and the environment [12]. In
    VRI, water requirements are applied at different rates to appropriately match
    field variability using individual management zones and their real needs instead
    of a homogeneous input application on the field [13]. A management zone is a field
    area with similar attributes in soil and topography. According to the definition
    of management zones, several parameters are considered as crop and soil properties,
    sensor-based information, field attributes, management practices and yield maps
    [14]. The information about irrigation prescriptions in the management zones is
    linked with automatic site-specific irrigation systems using dynamic prescription
    maps [15]. However, these maps can be challenging because the spatiotemporal variations
    on a field are affected by biotic factors such as plant diseases and pest infestation,
    and abiotic factors such as water stress, cold, drought, soil and water salinity
    [16]. The development process for an irrigation prescription map aims to fill
    the spatially variable soil–water profile and use software available with VRI
    hardware, yield, elevation or electrical conductivity maps through precision agriculture
    software or soil–water balance approaches from satellite imagery or wireless sensor
    networks [17]. Additionally, these maps use soil water measurements, soil water
    balance calculations or plant stress-based methods for defining irrigation amounts
    and timing. Volumetric water content (VWC) sensors, soil water profile measurements
    by a neutron probe and soil matric potential (SMP) sensors are the most used technologies
    for irrigation scheduling based on soil water measurements [18]. The magnitude
    of soil water content (SWC) varies with time and location, but the pattern of
    spatial variability usually remains similar [19]. Scheduling using soil water
    balance allows estimating soil–water depletion with good performance through the
    reference evapotranspiration multiplied by the corresponding crop coefficient
    [20]. In addition, process-based and statistical/machine-learning models can determine
    irrigation amounts using soil water balance [21]. These models consider factors
    like data availability, scalability, quantification of plant water stress, model
    uncertainties and constraints, and participation and motivation of producers [22].
    Some plant-based irrigation scheduling strategies use dendrometers [23], sap flow
    sensors [24] or canopy temperature measurements [25], among others. Canopy temperature
    is used for irrigation management because it indirectly indicates plant water
    stress through canopy energy balance. Water stress arises when the quantity of
    water in plant leaves restricts photosynthesis and respiration. In water-stressed
    conditions, transpiration decreases, causing more energy to be converted to sensible
    heat at the canopy surface compared to non-water-stressed conditions. It causes
    plant canopy temperatures to rise above what would occur without water shortages
    [22]. Remote and proximal sensing technologies such as infrared sensors (IRT)
    and near-infrared and thermal imaging measure canopy temperatures. With canopy
    temperature and weather data, it is possible to provide information about environmental,
    soil and crop conditions for VRI and the development of dynamic irrigation prescription
    maps [26]. Canopy temperature can be measured using radiometers filtered to the
    thermal infrared wavelengths , making them non-contact infrared thermometers.
    These devices can measure an area ranging from a few to several according to the
    platform, typically categorized as ground-based, aircraft, or satellite. Ground-based
    platforms can be stationary or moving, with sensors handheld, portable, or on
    moving machinery like center pivots. Moving platforms offer more spatial coverage
    with fewer sensors but trade-off frequency, usually measuring at a single time
    of day at many locations, while stationary devices provide continuous measurements
    at one field location [27]. Satellite remote sensing includes constraints associated
    with the spatial and temporal resolution and the cost and durability of sensors
    and associated components required for wireless data transmission. The Unmanned
    Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer several advantages for canopy temperature measurements,
    including a spatial resolution of several meters, a repeat frequency of no more
    than a few days, and a short interval from field measurement to data availability,
    typically just a few minutes. These advantages complement the essential requirements
    of reasonable instrument cost, precision, accuracy, and the ability to cover a
    significant field area. However, regulatory barriers exist for flying UAVs in
    certain regions [28]. Questions have arisen regarding the economic viability of
    utilizing UAV platforms for thermal imaging due to the cost and the extensive
    post-processing needed to generate reliably accurate thermometric images of a
    field [29]. Ground-based sensors, such as canopy temperature measured by stationary
    IRTs offer advantages over satellite and aircraft thermal imagers for agricultural
    use, including simplicity, lower cost, lower power consumption, and, most importantly,
    higher accuracy [30]. Achieving adequate field coverage needs a relatively large
    number of sensors, which would depend on factors such as field slope, soil variability,
    crop profitability, and sensor cost. The main types of algorithms used in irrigation
    management with IRTs are water stress indices and time–temperature thresholds
    (TTT) [27]. The crop water stress index (CWSI) and integrated CWSI (iCWSI) provide
    irrigation trigger information through the cooling effect due to plant transpiration
    based on the normalized function of vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and temperature
    difference between canopy and air [22]. The biologically identified optimal temperature
    interactive console (BIOTIC, [31]) is the fundamental principle for the definition
    of the TTT. The crop canopy temperature is measured using IRT sensors and compared
    with a crop-specific temperature threshold value [32]. The daily total amount
    is increased by one minute for each minute that the canopy temperature is higher
    than the temperature threshold. If this total daily value exceeds the time threshold
    at the end of the day, an irrigation amount is scheduled for the next day, corresponding
    to the daily crop evapotranspiration [36]. Other constraints are established for
    the addition of minutes to the daily total value in the TTT calculations, the
    net radiation must be greater than [33] and minutes are not added if the wet-bulb
    temperature is greater than the threshold temperature minus , because relative
    humidity can limit cooling by evaporation. [34] found equation (1), to determine
    the wet-bulb temperature using relative humidity and air temperature values. (1)
    The TTT plant stress-based method is easily automated in the field, installing
    IRT sensors in fixed locations. When sensors are not stationary, canopy temperatures
    are modelled according to sensors in a reference location using equation (2) [35].
    (2) where is the calculated canopy temperature at the remote location (°C)and
    is the predawn canopy temperature (°C). is the canopy temperature at the remote
    location on the center pivot, at any daylight time measured by the IRT sensor
    (°C) and is the reference canopy temperature at the same interval as (°C), is
    the measured reference temperature at the same time as when the remote temperature
    measurement was taken (°C). For adjusting canopy temperature values, [36] advise
    to use an adjusted equation for temperatures detected by the IRT sensor ( ) using
    the sensor body temperature ( ) as in equation (3). (3) The CWSI uses the variation
    in canopy temperature as a function of water deficits and meteorological conditions
    [18]. It relates the difference in the crop canopy temperature measured using
    IRT sensors to the air temperature as a function of relative humidity [37]. The
    water stress index uses this temperature difference according to an upper and
    lower temperature baseline. Under the same prevailing environmental conditions,
    the upper and lower baseline temperatures determine the non-transpiring and fully
    transpiring crop temperatures [38]. The CWSI is a dimensionless value in a range
    between 0 and 1. A well-watered crop corresponds to 0, and a severely water-stressed
    cultivation corresponds to 1 [37]. The concept was extended to moving IRTs aboard
    center pivots, resulting in crop yield and water use efficiency comparable to
    or greater than manual irrigation scheduling using soil water profile measurements
    with a neutron probe [39]. Several studies have focused on developing ground-based
    remote sensing systems for center pivots, including algorithms [40], wireless
    sensor networks [27], low-cost wireless IRT networks [41], and software to generate
    site-specific prescription maps based on weather, plant, and soil water information,
    with a graphical user interface (GUI) and geographic information system (GIS)
    tools, enabling site-specific irrigation scheduling for variable-rate irrigation
    (VRI) center pivot systems [42], [43]. Irrigation scheduling methods based on
    IRT sensors have been applied to corn [44], grain sorghum [45], soybean [25],
    hibiscus potted plants [46], apple trees [47], [48], Indian mustard [49] and cotton
    [50] crops. In [28], IRT sensors were implemented in a center-pivot irrigation
    system to calculate crop evapotranspiration (ETc). These sensors use a two-source
    energy balance (TSEB) model and provide a reduction of errors in ETc and crop
    water stress calculations by partitioning surface temperature into soil and canopy
    components. [51] applied the TTT method to a center-pivot irrigation system with
    infrared thermocouples and a global positioning system mounted on the center pivot
    for a soybean crop. Irrigation prescriptions were defined with the data analysis
    after midnight to determine the next-day strategy. Irrigation was applied in only
    one direction using special nozzles. The sensors corrected the canopy temperatures
    on the center pivot using soil IRT sensors obtaining the correction equation (4).
    (4) [50] used canopy temperature sensors on the center pivot for obtaining the
    Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) by equation (5). (5) where is the crop temperature,
    is the average temperature of a wet reference and is obtained adding to the maximum
    dry bulb temperature recorded for the specific field day. [15] demonstrated the
    advantage of IRT sensors mounted on a center pivot with a global positioning system
    to provide spatial and temporal crop water status at the field scale. While most
    precision irrigation technology is too expensive and complex for average farmers,
    methods involving IRTs may become more appealing due to their lower costs and
    simplicity. This technology has the potential to simplify management while increasing
    yields and reducing water-related waste, making it an attractive option for producers
    [35]. IRTs on center pivots and irrigation scheduling algorithms have resulted
    in crop yields and water productivity equal to or greater than those achieved
    with soil water measurements and a field-calibrated neutron probe. Combining stationary
    IRT measurements with moving IRT arrays enhances the effectiveness of irrigation
    scheduling algorithms. Stationary measurements offer time series data while moving
    arrays provide spatially distributed data [52], [30]. Wireless data transmission
    is now accessible for IRTs, eliminating the need for cumbersome wiring and enhancing
    the ease of deploying IRTs in various settings [53], [54]. Furthermore, researchers
    use extensive datasets with canopy temperature and corresponding weather information.
    These datasets, in conjunction with machine learning, artificial neural networks
    and deep learning techniques, are being employed alongside energy balance models
    to estimate thermal stress indices and facilitate irrigation scheduling [55],
    [56]. Employing infrared thermocouples (IRTCs) on self-propelled irrigation systems
    such as center pivots present several challenges: - Estimating daily canopy temperature
    dynamics from a single measurement at each field location is challenging due to
    the uncertainty associated with the timing of these measurements [35]. - It requires
    automatic data collection and analysis to control the irrigation system based
    on the canopy temperature data [35]. - If a self-propelled irrigation system is
    in motion, it has made an irrigation decision based on prescription maps unless
    it acquires data moving without irrigating [35]. - The misalignment of the IRTCs
    over the rows occurs as the pivot moves around the field [35]. - The time–temperature
    threshold (TTT) and crop water stress indexes are canopy temperature-based algorithms
    that do not distinguish between soil and canopy temperature. This lack of distinction,
    even though differences can exceed 30 °C, can affect the apparent surface temperature,
    particularly during partial canopy cover. Consequently, instances of unnecessary
    irrigation events occurring early in the season, before full canopy cover, have
    been reported [45], [28]. - Concerns have arisen that the deflection of moving
    irrigation systems and other factors may degrade moving IRT measurements relative
    to stationary IRT measurements [30]. - Specialized hardware and software systems
    exist for defining irrigation prescription maps based on weather, plant, and soil
    water information. This software incorporates site-specific irrigation scheduling
    methods and automates the data collection and processing obtained from sensing
    systems. However, it only defines static irrigation prescription maps and does
    not facilitate real-time water application in the field [43]. - Calculation methods
    typically employ the empirical upper and lower limits of the temperature difference
    between canopy and air to estimate CWSI and iCWSI based on the standardized temperature
    difference. This approach introduces irreducible uncertainty and error [22]. -
    Existing precision irrigation tools often have inadequate user interfaces, making
    them difficult to use and resulting in a poor user experience [57]. Additionally,
    low accuracy characterizes these tools, leading to the reluctance of producers
    to adopt them [58]. - Most current precision irrigation decision-support systems
    assume that producers strictly adhere to the recommended irrigation decisions
    for each event without allowing any flexibility in the irrigation timing [22].
    - The increasing adoption of infrared thermometers (IRT) for crop irrigation management
    has contributed to the growth of surface temperature datasets. This trend emphasizes
    the need to develop data quality assurance and control (QA/QC) procedures like
    those used for agricultural weather station data [53]. - In-situ sensors currently
    available in markets are typically expensive or not cost-effective enough for
    widespread adoption. Furthermore, they often require installation and removal
    before and after the growing season for row crops, resulting in additional labor
    costs [59], [22]. According to the references consulted, there is a wide range
    of research opportunities and challenges in the commercial implementation of this
    technology. Further studies are needed to determine how to integrate the information
    acquired from IRT sensors and automatic irrigation application systems to prescribe
    and apply the site-specific irrigation needs in real-time during the growing season,
    using soil and crop characteristics under different environments [15], [6]. Currently,
    systems acquire data from the field and generate irrigation prescription maps
    before the irrigation procedure (static maps). This study aims to develop an innovative
    system for mapping real-time canopy temperature and defining prescriptions using
    IRT sensors on a center pivot and GPS data while the center pivot moves on the
    field. The proposed system consists of hardware and software developments whose
    final goal is to provide farm managers with accurate and frequently updated information
    about crop irrigation requirements. This paper shows only the real-time canopy
    temperature system. The prescription mechanism and the proposed system comparison
    with others will be reported in other publications. 2. Materials and methods The
    study was conducted from the Farm Services Unit of E.V. Smith Research Center
    in Shorter, Auburn University, Alabama, USA (32° 26′ 15″ N, 85° 54′ 57″ W, and
    32 masl), during the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons. The field experiences a subtropical
    humid (Cfa) climate, with average low and high temperatures of and , respectively,
    and an annual rainfall of (https://awis.aumesonet.com/). The same corn hybrid
    (Dekalb DKC62-08, Bayer Corp., Whippany, N.J.) was planted in both years. In 2018,
    the corn was planted in concentric rows, while in 2019, it was planted in straight
    rows at a row spacing of and a population density of [60]. Soil texture, bulk
    density, and soil water retention curves (SWRC) were determined at five points
    within the experimental area. These properties were measured at soil depths of
    , , and at each location. The percentage by mass of sand, clay, and silt was determined
    by a commercial soil laboratory (Water Agricultural Laboratories, Camilla, Ga.).
    Saturated undisturbed soil cores were analyzed using a hydraulic property analyzer
    (HYPROP 2, Meter Group, Pullman, Wash.) to establish the relationship between
    soil matric potential and volumetric soil water content (VWC) [61]. The soil matric
    potential of saturated undisturbed cores, measured with the hydraulic property
    analyzer, ranged from 0 to 0.08 MPa. Additionally, a dew point hygrometer (WP4C
    PotentiaMeter, Meter Group) was employed to determine the VWC versus soil matric
    potential relationship at 0.63, 1.5, and 3.3 MPa using disturbed soil samples.
    The data from both instruments were processed using HYPROP-FIT software (ver.
    4.1.0.0, Meter Group, https://library.metergroup.com/Manuals/UMS/HYPROP-FIT_Manual.pdf)
    to generate soil water retention curves (SWRCs) based on the traditional unconstrained
    van Genuchten model [62]. The volumetric soil water content (VWC) at field capacity
    (FC) was determined for all locations, while the permanent wilting point (PWP)
    was established at a soil matric potential of 1.5 MPa. Soil bulk density was calculated
    by dividing the weight of dry soil (oven-dried at 105 °C until reaching a constant
    weight) by its volume, using undisturbed soil cores. The experiment took place
    in a field irrigated by a seven-span, half-circle center pivot irrigation system
    covering 30 ha. The system (model 7000, Valmont Industries, Valley, Neb.) had
    a lateral length of 434 m and operated with a flow rate of 181.7 cubic meters
    per hour, with a line pressure at the pivot point of 0.241 MPa. Equipped with
    a middle-elevation spray application (MESA) sprinkler package, the system included
    pressure regulators rated at 0.103 MPa. It was retrofitted with a variable-rate
    irrigation (VRI) system featuring solenoid valves to control water application
    over each half span. Each half span, approximately 31 m in length, represented
    a grid of 2° arc, allowing for the prescription of a single irrigation rate for
    the group of sprinklers within each half span. The experiment utilized full and
    limited irrigation treatments, designated as T100 (100 % soil water replenishment
    to field capacity), T66 (66 % replenishment of T100), and T33 (33 % replenishment
    of T100). A randomized complete block design was implemented with three treatments
    and four replications in 2018 (12 plots) and six replications in 2019 (18 plots).
    Soil water content (VWC) in the root zone was measured using a time domain reflectometer
    (TDR-315L, Acclima, Meridian, Ida.) and a capacitance-type soil water sensor (ECH2O
    EC-5, Meter Group) at three depths. In 2018, sensors were installed from 21 May
    to 30 August, while in 2019, they were installed from 23 April to 5 August. For
    the T100 treatments, VWC changes (except for replication 1 in 2018) were monitored
    using TDR-315L and EC-5 sensors at 0.15, 0.3, and 0.6 m soil depths. The T66 and
    T33 treatments were assessed using only EC-5 sensors at the same soil depths as
    the T100 treatments. Dataloggers (Aquatrac, AgSense, Valmont Industries, Inc.,
    Huron, S.D., and model Em50, Meter Group) recorded VWC values at 30-minute intervals.
    Aquatrac dataloggers were used for TDR-315L sensors, while Em50 dataloggers were
    used for EC-5 sensors. Data collection began on 21 May 2018 and 28 April 2019.
    Irrigation rates were determined using VWC data from TDR-315L sensors in the T100
    treatment to replenish soil water to field capacity (FC) at a depth of 0.6 m.
    When soil water depletion from any T100 treatment reached 50 % of plant-available
    water (PAW), irrigation was applied to all treatments. The irrigation rate for
    each block was calculated based on the T100 treatment. For T66 and T33 treatments,
    irrigation rates were 66 % and 33 % of the T100 rate, respectively. Soil water
    depletion (SWD) was calculated by summing the depletion at each soil layer using
    data from four TDR-315L sensors in 2018 and three TDR-315L sensors in 2019. The
    irrigation prescription map was generated using Valley VRI (model 8.55, Valmont
    Industries, Valley, Neb.) and uploaded remotely to the Valley Pro2 panel located
    at the pivot point. Canopy temperature data were recorded using wireless IRT sensors
    (SapIP-IRT, Dynamax, Houston, Tex.) installed on a stationary mast in each experimental
    plot. IRT data collection began on May 13, 2018, and May 7, 2019, corresponding
    to the V7 vegetative growth stage. IRTs were installed 1 m above the canopy in
    the same crop row and 1.5 m from soil water sensors. Each IRT sensor targets the
    crop row throughout the growing season. Additionally, twelve IRT sensors (SapIP-IRT,
    Dynamax, Houston, Tex.) were installed on span 2 in 2018 and on span 7 in 2019,
    collecting data while the center pivot was moving. Dynamax IRT sensors were calibrated
    by the company before the experiments. IRT location accuracy was determined using
    a real-time kinematic (RTK) 297 Trimble GPS (Trimble Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA).
    The design principle follows the concept of a wireless sensor network (WSN) [63].
    The system has a set of IRT sensors installed on a center pivot, a global positioning
    system node (GPS), which communicates with a central or main station using a Zigbee
    protocol (IEEE 802.15.4). The central station uses an embedded computer (EC).
    The CE is responsible for data acquisition from the IRT sensors and performing
    water stress indices, storing the information in a database, configuring the capture
    modules, and interacting with the user through a graphic user interface (GUI).
    Irrigation prescriptions with IRT sensors measurements on the center pivot were
    modeled using the machine learning models NARX (Nonlinear Autoregressive Network
    with Exogenous Inputs) and LSTM (Long short-term memory), adjusting the best hyperparameters
    and using as inputs the air temperature and relative humidity, canopy temperature
    of sensors on stationary masts, canopy temperature of sensors installed aboard
    the central pivot and as output the corresponding irrigation prescription. This
    procedure is not the scope of this article, and details will be explained in forthcoming
    publications. The proposed system design for canopy temperature monitoring and
    water balance estimation in a center pivot involves hardware and software integration
    and communication components. This section describes the electronic devices required
    to satisfy the requirements defined in the research. First, the hardware for the
    IRT system, the GPS system and the embedded computer are presented, with a justification
    of their suitability and an exposition of their main features. Then, is discussed
    the methodological aspects of the software development process. Finally, are introduced
    the underlying mapping algorithms of canopy temperature. 2.1. Hardware components
    description Wireless sensor node architecture includes twelve SapIP-IRT Infrared
    Leaf Temperature (Dynamax, Inc., Houston, TX), equipped with an XBee RF module
    (Digi International, Minnetonka, Minn.). The SapIP-IRT has a highly accurate reading
    of , is very stable over time, and has a signal window and field of view (FOV).
    For a one-meter-wide target, the IRT must place three meters above the item or
    surface to measure (20 degrees FOV). Zigbee specifications are and a range of
    with a omnidirectional antenna - (high gain), rechargeable batteries, typical
    current of . The maximum battery voltage during charging is , and the minimum

    sensors, GPS receiver and server in the center pivot. The wireless GPS node in
    the center pivot end-tower uses a raspberry pi zero board, a solar panel, a 12
    V battery and a Garmin GLO GPS. GLO can receive position information from the
    GPS and the GLONASS satellite constellations, allowing it to connect to up to
    24 more satellites than devices that rely on GPS alone. The GLO GPS locks on satellites
    approximately 20 percent faster and remain connected even at high speed. GLO updates
    its position information ten times per second with WAAS, an accuracy of 3 m and
    12 h of battery life. The 12 IRT sensors mounted onto the center pivot acquire
    crop canopy temperature. Sensors and GPS node transmit temperature and geolocation
    data to the central station, that is, a small computer Raspberry Pi3 (Raspberry-Pi®
    Foundation North America, Inc) at the pivot point with Zigbee 2.4 GHz protocol
    and an algorithm developed in the Python programming platform (Python Software
    Foundation, version 3, Netherlands) for managing and visualizing data, and defining
    irrigation prescription. 2.2. Software development process According to [50],
    for an IRT sensor located on the pivot, the cover surface can be approximated
    as an elliptical footprint with the vertical axis (Fig. 2). The equation used
    to calculate the area and characteristics of that elliptical footprint was defined
    using Fig. 3. This figure shows the geometrical dimensions of the cover surface
    pattern. The parameters defined are : horizontal distance from the pivot lateral
    to the ellipse starting point, : horizontal distance from the pivot lateral to
    the point with the highest temperature value acquired by the IRT sensor, horizontal
    distance from the pivot lateral to the ellipse center and : the horizontal distance
    from the pivot lateral to the ellipse endpoint. , and represent the optical path
    length from the IRT sensor to , and , respectively. is the angle between the vertical
    IRT projection to the soil and , is de IRT Field of Vision (FOV), μ and τ are

    Consequently, from equation (11) is obtained equation (17). (17) Finally, the
    ellipse area calculation is determined using equation (18). (18) Using equation
    (18), for example, an IRT looking slightly forward of the drop hoses at an oblique
    angle to the of FOV, mounted on a pivot lateral ( above the ground), (in the horizontal
    plane) from the edge of a treatment plot, will have a resolution of approximately
    of crop surface and with FOV approximately of crop surface. Fig. 4 specifies the

    with an accuracy of 1–100 cm using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) in
    the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84). These coordinates where stored in three
    variables: , and These locations were converted to Universal Transverse Mercator
    (UTM) coordinates: , and Distances (from to ) and (from to ) were defined using
    the UTM coordinates, equations (19), (20). (19) (20) To calculate the distance
    between IRT sensors ( ), is divided by the number of sensors plus one. In this
    experiment, there were 12 sensors on the pivot, then . A list of sensor locations
    on the pivot , is generated by with . This list contains 12 values, equation (21).

    battery voltage, target IR temperature degrees Celsius resolution), and sensor
    body temperature. For example, the frame: corresponds to sensor 305, reading of
    canopy temperature. The algorithm uses a list of IRT serial numbers with codes
    of the 12 sensors installed on the pivot. This list contains 12 strings, equation
    (22). (22) Additionally, the code uses a dictionary with 12 key-value pairs. The
    keys correspond to the 12 serial numbers and a list of values acquired by 12 IRT
    sensors. The dictionary uses the notation tuples of Key (String): Values (List
    of float numbers), equation (23). S (23). The GPS distance concerning the pivot
    lateral is a constant defined by equation (24). (24) The angle between the pivot
    lateral and the GPS location is a constant defined by equation (25). (25) The
    algorithm to define the location of each sensor on the field in real-time uses

    3 using the equation (26). (26) • Adding with to define the pivot lateral angle
    . For determining the geographical position of each sensor, the algorithm uses
    a new dynamic center point . This location changes during the pivot movement,
    adding −90 degrees to the center pivot angle according to Fig. 4. 3. Results and

    Mapping Tool supports the system configuration (sensors, GPS node data acquisition
    and other parameters), data processing and map visualization. The design principles
    for the Infrared Mapping Tool in real-time were that it should provide the most
    accurate and site-specific information we could offer the irrigation manager with
    the selected technology. In addition, the Infrared Mapping Tool requires minimum
    user input, is very easy to manage and provides ready-to-use data output to irrigation
    prescriptions in real-time. The Infrared Mapping Tool can operate with Raspbian
    or Windows operative systems. This tool records data in plain text format (.txt)
    inside its memory block and in an external pen drive and generates a shape file
    with the information in real-time from the sensors and their locations. The system
    uses a VNC (Virtual Network Computing) connection for monitoring remotely using
    WIFI communication protocols, and data is sent to a server for processing after
    the acquisition if there is an internet connection. The central station uses a
    Raspberry Pi with a 3.2 in. touch screen. After the initial setup, the user interacts
    with the Main Screen (Fig. 7). If the system configuration does not need modifications,

    significant because they are stored and used to locate the IRT sensors on the

    role in achieving the sustainability of food production and ensuring regional
    water security [64]. Producers rely on personal experience and weather data to
    determine when and how much to irrigate using center pivot systems. A survey found
    that over 75 % of U.S. irrigation scheduling methods rely on rules of thumb like
    crop calendars and neighbor practices, while less than 25 % use science or technology-based
    approaches [65]. According to the recent advances, challenges and opportunities
    of precision irrigation described by [22], the most important topics are data
    availability and scalability, quantification of plant water stress, model uncertainties
    and constraints, and the participation of producers and motivation. Table 2 shows
    the challenges and contributions of the proposed system in this research. Table

    The developed system significantly enhances precision irrigation practices by
    enabling real-time water application according to crop water demand. This information
    allows for optimal irrigation precise determination timing and amounts across
    the field. Unlike conventional infrared thermography (IRT) sensor systems on center
    pivots, which generate static water need maps [42], [43], our system offers dynamic,
    real-time irrigation prescriptions with application in dynamic variable-rate technologies
    that adjust irrigation rates based on the changing conditions within the field.
    These prescriptions are vital because they consider the spatial and temporal variations
    in crop growth, crop water status, and soil water availability throughout the
    growing season. This capability represents a significant advancement in precision
    irrigation technology. The adoption of precision irrigation tools depends on their
    accuracy and user-friendly interfaces [57]. Our system provides an intuitive interface
    and dynamic decision-making, empowering farmers with the capability to make informed
    decisions about when to start or stop irrigation. Swift updates based on soil
    and plant conditions are crucial if irrigation is postponed [22], and real-time
    mapping eliminates the need for acquiring new data for the entire field and generating
    new prescription maps. Additional calibrations beyond the manufacturer''s factory
    settings were not applied to Dynamax IRT sensors (Dynamax, Inc., Houston, TX).
    A study conducted in a controlled temperature chamber showed that root mean squared
    errors between factory-calibrated IRT brightness and black-body temperatures (ranging
    from 15 °C to 55 °C) were mostly within 0.75 °C, while ambient temperatures in
    the chamber were varied from 15 °C to 45 °C. However, the temperature differences
    between the target and ambient temperatures in the controlled chamber (up to 40
    °C) were much larger than those typically encountered in field conditions (10)°C).
    Field testing using a lysimeter indicated that post-factory calibration versus
    factory calibration had minimal impact on calculated crop evapotranspiration [66].
    This suggests that an additional post-factory, sensor-specific calibration would
    have little justification over using only factory-calibrated temperatures in the
    field. Moreover, conducting a post-factory calibration over a range of ambient
    and target temperatures would necessitate a blackbody surface and chamber with
    variable temperature control, equipment that is rarely available [53]. Therefore,
    IRT data that solely rely on factory calibration are more likely to be suitable
    for practical applications in this project. The ZigBee Remote Control protocol
    offers several significant advantages over other systems. It provides low-power
    transmission, robustness, high security, and high scalability, with the ability
    to support high node density. Additionally, it leverages wireless control and
    sensor networks in IoT applications [67]. In wireless communication systems deployed
    in agricultural fields, security and privacy are crucial to ensure data confidentiality.
    Zigbee addresses these concerns by employing the 128-bit advanced encryption standard
    (AES) [68]. The AES algorithm encrypts the data and verifies data integrity using
    a message authentication code generated by encrypting the IEEE MAC frame. Xbee
    modules use the AES-CTR mode for encrypting the payload. Compared to IEEE 802.15.4,
    Zigbee adds two extra security layers to the network and application layers, utilizing
    AES 128-bit encryption. The distributed security model is limited to routers and
    end devices. If a router detects a powered-up existing network, it can join the
    secured network; otherwise, it can form a distributed secured network and assign
    network keys to newly joined routers and end devices. While this model is simple,
    it does not offer the highest level of security. We use the centralized security
    model, which is more complex and secure than the distributed model. The network
    coordinator is responsible for authenticating and validating each device attempting
    to join the network [69]. While these encryptions enhance security, they limit
    the delay in network communications (latency), the speed at which data is transmitted
    (throughput), link quality, power consumption and longevity of the network. However,
    the increased energy consumption for encryption is recommended in agricultural
    IoT applications [70]. Security measures implementation can significantly enhance
    the security of Zigbee networks. Nevertheless, like any technology, the effectiveness
    of security measures depends on how they are implemented and maintained [71].
    Without adequate security configurations, Xbee devices are vulnerable. These devices
    are built with a preconfigured global link key, making them susceptible to man-in-the-middle
    attacks. The equipment in IRT sensors and central station should be placed in
    protective enclosures to prevent damage from insects, rodents, and weather conditions.
    These enclosures must be both weatherproof and tamper-resistant. Environmental
    sealing can protect against moisture and dust, which can negatively impact the
    performance of electronic components. Adequate ventilation may also be necessary
    to prevent overheating. It is recommended to use reliable power sources, such
    as solar panels or batteries, to ensure the continuous operation of the electronic
    system. Backup power sources may be required in the event of power outages. Dynamax
    IRT sensors offer remote monitoring capabilities, enabling the tracking of the
    electronic system''s performance and the detection of any issues related to the
    power system. Regular inspection and maintenance of the electronic system are
    crucial to ensure optimal performance. This includes checking for signs of damage,
    cleaning components, and replacing worn-out parts. Preventive maintenance was
    conducted monthly, while general corrective maintenance and functional tests were
    performed whenever the sensors were installed on the central pivot, and the routers
    and central station were placed in the field. To prevent damage from rodents,
    all exposed cables near the soil were covered with flexible metal tubes. The scalability
    in the developed systems depends on the transceiver devices used in the wireless
    sensor network. ZigBee networks offer several benefits, particularly in large-scale
    deployments, due to their energy efficiency and flexibility. [72] refers to Zigbee
    networks as personal area networks (PANs) and states that each network has a unique
    PAN identifier (PAN ID) shared among all devices in the network. Zigbee devices
    can join a network by either being preconfigured with a PAN ID or by discovering
    nearby networks and selecting a PAN ID to join. Zigbee defines three device types:
    coordinator, router, and end-device [73]. In Zigbee networks, there should be
    only one Coordinator node per network, serving as the controller responsible for
    selecting the network channel, organizing the network, and synchronizing the wireless
    sensor network. The coordinator selects the channel, PAN ID, security policy,
    and stack profile for the network. It initiates the network, selects the channel
    and PAN ID (64-bit and 16-bit), and manages other functions that define, secure,
    and maintain the network. Routers are responsible for maintaining the infrastructure
    of the ZigBee network. These nodes do not gather data or start the message transmission
    but only transmit data from router to router or from the end devices to the coordinator.
    These devices cannot sleep and must always remain powered on. Finally, end-devices
    do not route. They are responsible for gathering data and delivering it to the
    nearby router or coordinator. The scalability of the proposed system in this paper
    does not have restrictions by communication infrastructure because designers have
    made all ZigBee nodes small, lightweight, and energy-efficient, allowing the connection
    of up to 65,535 nodes [74]. Dynamax utilizes the IRT SALH data logger system,
    housed in a weatherproof enclosure, which can link to repeaters to collect data
    from up to 25 wireless IRT sensors and three routers [75]. In this research, we
    designed and implemented a datalogger that allows the connection of more IRT sensors,
    integrating one coordinator, multiple end-devices and routers, leveraging the
    capabilities of ZigBee technology and improving system scalability. Table 3 lists
    the required hardware for implementing the wireless sensor, GPS, and central station
    nodes, along with their current costs. The number of wireless sensor nodes used
    depends on the central pivot size, and a span can accommodate several IRT sensors.
    Based on the current design and the study field characteristics, the cost of implementing
    the entire hardware in the center pivot with twelve SapIP-IRT Infrared Leaf Temperature
    (Dynamax, Inc., Houston, TX) nodes is US$8,964.32. We implemented this hardware
    to ensure the system performs correctly. One key focus of future work is reducing
    implementation costs and optimizing modules'' energy consumption. Table 3. Costs

    1461.11 According to the University of Georgia’s crop production budget [76],
    a center pivot irrigation system can consume diesel and electricity per every
    irrigated acre-inch (Table 4). These costs are strictly related to the center
    pivot movement when watering. Table 4. Cost analysis for center pivot installation:

    373.36 313.22 195.05 Reviewing the current procedure for canopy sensors on central
    pivot systems reveals the need to move the pivot across the field, acquire data
    along its path, generate irrigation prescription maps, and adjust pivot movement
    for irrigation based on these prescriptions [42], [43]. Additionally, any incidental
    rain or operational problems with the central pivot that render the system inoperable
    for hours or days render the initial prescription obsolete, necessitating new
    routes for new prescriptions. The system proposed in this research addresses these
    challenges. Moreover, by eliminating field steps required for generating irrigation
    maps, the operating costs of the center pivot are reduced respect to Table 4.
    It is important to note that the values presented in Table 4 do not include these
    data acquisition processes, which contribute to higher implementation and operation
    costs when using the conventional mapping method with IRT sensors on the center
    pivot. 4. Conclusions The proposed technology contributes to agricultural irrigation
    management through its cost-effective implementation and capabilities of mapping
    crop canopy temperatures using a wireless network of infrared thermometers on
    a center pivot. It incorporates Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) with scalability
    options, IoT capabilities, and web data availability. The technology enables precise
    plant water stress quantification based on canopy temperature and soil water content,
    facilitating real-time irrigation prescriptions while the center pivot is in motion
    on the field. Canopy temperature sensors do not require additional calibration,
    guaranteeing highly accurate readings of +/- 0.5 °C. Enhancing the GPS receiver
    accuracy is imperative because it guarantees the determination of the sensor''s
    position on the center pivot. GLO2 GPS can receive position information from GPS
    and GLONASS satellite constellations, can use 24 extra satellites to lock approximately
    20 % faster and remain connected even at high speed but with an accuracy of 3
    m. To enhance the GPS module, we can use receivers with Differential Global Positioning
    System (DGPS) as Real-time kinematic positioning (RTK) or augmentation systems
    such as Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) in U.S.A. or European Geostationary
    Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) in Europe. NARX and LSTM neural network models
    were trained to predict irrigation prescriptions using ambient temperature, relative
    humidity, and plant cover temperature as input data. These temperatures were measured
    by the sensors installed on the ground and aboard the central pivot. The irrigation
    prescription was used as output data. They achieved RMSE values ranging from 0.56
    mm to 4.18 mm in RMSE. Additionally, the correlation coefficient values exceeded
    0.8, indicating that the models effectively tracked the irrigation prescription
    behavior using canopy temperature sensors. Several research activities are proposed
    as future work. Exploring LoRaWAN technologies can enhance transmission distances,
    thus improving the efficiency and reach of sensor networks. Additionally, efforts
    to reduce the costs of sensors and data acquisition systems can continue, making
    these technologies more accessible to farmers. Another promising area is the development
    of algorithms for fusing data from ground, drone, and satellite sources, which
    could significantly enhance spatial resolution in irrigation management. Furthermore,
    research focusing on refining irrigation prescription models in diverse environments
    and improving irrigation amount calculations based on soil water demand and plant
    physiological regulations is essential. Finally, researchers must develop models
    that consider the effects of measurements in soil rows and crop plants. This research

  description: Assessing the quality of land is a very important step that precedes
    the planning of land use and taking management decisions; for example, in the
    agricultural field, it can be used to evaluate the suitability of the land for
    planting crops, determine the suitable irrigation system type, or adjust the agricultural
    inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides according to the requirements of each
    zone in the land. The spatial–temporal dynamic nature of land characteristics
    entails also updated evaluation process and updated management plan. The present
    paper tries to exploit the advances in information and communication technologies
    to develop a conceptual design of a dynamic system that accommodates the spatial–temporal
    dynamics of the agricultural soil characteristics to realize a land suitability
    assessment (LSA) based on a factor analysis method. The proposed design combines
    IoT technologies, web development, database, and digital mapping and tries to
    consolidate the system with other functionalities useful for decision support
    and suitable for different cases. The paper conducted a survey and made comparisons
    to select the best technologies that fit the current use case implementation and
    presents its reproducible conceptual modeling by developing the static and dynamic
    views through schemas, diagrams, message sequence charts, IoT messaging topic
    tree, pseudocode, etc. The functionality of the design was validated with a simple
    implementation of the system model. To our knowledge, there is no previous significant
    contribution that has addressed a LSA IoT use case. The proposed design automates
    the LSA process for more accurate decision-making, saving cost, time, and effort
    consumed in repeated field trips. It is characterized by flexibility and centralization
    in its offered services of spatial analysis, detection, visualizations, and status
    monitoring. The design also allows for remote control of field machinery.

    and Big Data Chapter © 2021 Introduction The Internet of things (IoT) is the network
    of any physical object that contains sensors and/or actuators and has the capability
    to process and send data over the Internet. IoT represents a main pillar of technological
    revolution in nearly all the application fields: industry, agriculture, medicine,
    military, etc. Therefore, IoT becomes the focus of attention of both research
    and industry. The literature is full of many proposals for IoT reference architecture
    and frameworks (Fremantle, 2015; Guth et al., 2016; Ngu et al., 2017; Saemaldahr
    et al., 2020; Abd El-Kader and Mohammad El-Basioni, 2013; Mohammad El-Basioni
    and Abd El-Kader 2020), IoT enabling wireless technologies development, IoT messaging
    protocols (Al-Masri et al., 2020; Naik, 2017; Tournier et al., 2021), and replete
    with many IoT use cases. In Srinivas et al.’s (2018) study, a use case was proposed
    for employing IoT technology in developing a smart healthcare system that contains
    an intelligent medicine box associated with sensors and a server for regular health
    monitoring. This smart medicine box with wireless Internet connectivity helps
    patients to get regular healthcare and creates easy communication between doctor
    and patient without meeting physically. The proposed medicine box helps the patient
    to take the right medicine at the right time. In Zhang et al.’s (2018) study,
    an architecture for the Internet of intelligent things in smart hospitals was
    proposed, and an infusion monitoring system case study to monitor the real-time
    drop rate and the volume of remaining drugs during the intravenous infusion was
    developed. An automatic real-time system for automated vehicle parking based on
    IoT was proposed by Patil et al. (2020). In the field of entertainment, IoT was
    used to understand the foot traffic of people at events; this IoT application
    visualizes the attendee traffic patterns in real time to help sponsors understand
    the best places to advertise and to ensure that the attendee count stays within
    the fire code compliance of the venue (Mendix Technology, 2021). IoT plays a key
    role in precision farming, as it allows continuous deep remote analysis, understanding,
    and control of agricultural processes leading to agriculture sustainability. This
    is clearly evident in the existence of various use cases for IoT in precision
    farming. IoT-based applications were developed for remote monitoring of the field
    information (Trimble Inc, 2021; Corizon, 2021; AgrIOT, 2021; Abd El-Kader and
    Mohammad El-Basioni 2021). In Shylaja et al.’s (2021) study, an IoT-based smart
    device is proposed for crop monitoring using machine learning. Instead of using
    the classical learning schemes, it introduced a new scheme called Modified Learning
    based Field Analysis Strategy (MLFAS) that predicts the status of the crop in
    the field by analyzing the real-time input data acquired and reports this to improve
    the decision-making process. The work of Kaburuan et al. (2019) represents an
    IoT system for monitoring the performance of indoor micro-climate horticulture
    based on farmers’ treatment from planting until harvest time. The soil, water,
    air, and image data from the field were integrated with the weather data of the
    Indonesian Meteorological Agency data. Just as the IoT is used to monitor climate
    and crops, it is also used for cattle monitoring where it senses and conveys data
    about the environment and cattle health. This application takes advantage of real-time
    data in the early treatment of any critical condition that threatens the cattle
    health and life before the matter worsens and disease spreads, for example. In
    Suresh and Sarath’s (2019) study, the proposed cattle monitoring system is composed
    of data-gathering nodes implanted on the cattle and contains sensors to measure
    important health parameters such as temperature, humidity, heart rate, and fall
    frequency. The system includes a mobile node that acts as a gateway that receives
    data from the data-gathering nodes and sends it to the IoT cloud platform for
    analysis. The monitoring system proposed by Shabani et al. (2022) also senses
    the important health parameters of the cattle: body temperature, heart rate, humidity,
    and location. The main contribution of the system is a microservice-based architecture
    which works as a bridge between the implanted devices and the IoT cloud application,
    uses machine learning to produce a percentage for the health of each head of cattle,
    and notifies the farm manager of critical situations in real time. Other complete
    systems (Dutta et al., 2022; Trivedi & Chatterjee, 2022; Unold et al., 2020) have
    been developed to monitor cattle health including the monitoring devices, the
    cloud system, and the end-user application, differing in the types of sensors,
    the communication technology, the application features, and the algorithm used
    to analyze data, classify activities, and detect conditions. IoT technology is
    used for remote control of farms, just as it is used for remote monitoring. Hence,
    it is used to automate sustainable agricultural systems and support their sustainability.
    Perhaps, one of the most sustainable agricultural systems that can benefit from
    IoT is the aquaponics system where it needs intensive monitoring and control.
    IoT-enabled aquaponics systems were proposed in the literature; in Haryanto et
    al.’s (2019); Hassoun et al. (2023) and Ezzahoui et al.’s (2022) study, smart
    aquaponics systems were proposed that monitor and control the water temperature,
    level, acidity degree, and fish feed using the readings of a number of sensors
    such as ultrasonic sensor, pH sensor, and temperature sensor. In addition to this,
    IoT has been widely used to monitor and control the environmental parameters in
    greenhouses (Joseph et al., 2020; Padmini et al., 2019; Shamshiri et al., 2021).
    Regarding the agricultural systems which depend on management zone delineation
    and spatial analysis, few researches have talked about exploiting IoT technology
    in such systems. For example, Kang et al. (2012) suggested using IoT to deliver
    the data mashup which is used in zone management to produce intelligent decision-making,
    and they drew a simple conceptual system architecture for such a system without
    giving a specific implementation. In a research by Monteleone et al. (2020) exploring
    the factors affecting the adoption of precision agriculture for irrigation management
    in the context of Agriculture 4, in an experimental case study, the use of IoT
    was casually mentioned for implementing variable rate irrigation and zone management
    by producing irrigation prescription map, but also without details of the specific
    implementation. This paper talks about a specific IoT use case which is the land
    suitability assessment (LSA). With the importance of LSA in achieving sustainable
    land-use planning especially in crop management practices, to the best of our
    knowledge, no or a small number of researches have addressed the exploitation
    of IoT to improve this process using the real-time data transmitted by the sensing
    devices deployed on the field. For example, the work proposed by Vincent et al.
    (2019) addresses the replacement of manual data collection with IoT-based sensors
    for LSA, but it mainly concentrates on the design of the multiclass classification
    used in land assessment. It only stores the data in the Amazon Web Service (AWS)
    cloud platform where it is used to develop the classification model which can
    be used later for future assessments. The proposed conceptual design is for a
    complete software system for IoT-based LSA ready to receive data that comes from
    the field and stores and processes it based on a standard multi-criteria classification
    method. Also, it implements other functions such as spatial analysis. It is the
    generalization of our case study proposed by Mohammad EL-Basioni et al. (2022).
    The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) had proposed
    a standard framework that specifies the procedures of the land suitability assessment
    process. In general, the process incorporates three steps. The first step is to
    select the influencing factors and grade the weights and relative values for the
    factors. The second step is to integrate the maps and database in GIS. Finally,
    the suitability score of each land segment is calculated, and the land suitability/classification
    maps are generated with respect to the given use. The various land-use suitability
    maps of a land are essential tools for planners and decision-makers to take the
    most suitable decision for this land use, management, and selection to allocate
    with the pre-plan, especially when they are taking into account sustainable development
    and economic competitiveness (Mu, 2006). The multi-criteria land suitability analysis
    generic model can be expressed as a land suitability measure, \\({\\text{LS}}\\),
    computed by a function of several indicators as shown in Eq. (1): $${\\text{LS}}=f\\left({indicator}_{{\\text{1}}},{indicator}_{{\\text{2}}},\\dots
    \\dots ,{indicator}_{{\\text{n}}}\\right)$$ (1) These indicators have a cumulative
    effect on land suitability as well as a separate effect that should be analyzed
    (Mendoza, 1999). These indicators are selected based on their sensitivity to management
    practices, ability to describe major soil processes, ease and cost of sampling
    and laboratory analysis, and significance (Tesfahunegn, 2014). These indicators
    are indexed in terms of some of their related soil parameters, and rating scores
    are given to these parameters. The proposed system concentrates on land evaluation
    for sustainable crop production which depends mainly on the soil parameters and
    quality indices: fertility, chemical, and physical. The proposed system is built
    on the aforementioned approach, based on the parameters used and the model and
    formulas proposed by El Baroudy (2016). The used parameters include nitrogen (N),
    phosphorus (P), potassium (K), zinc (Zn), organic matter content (OM), soil salinity
    (S), the exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP), the carbonate (CaCO3) content,
    soil pH (PH), drainage (R), the texture (T), the soil depth (D), the slope (F),
    the surface stoniness (Y), the hard pan depth (HP), the hydraulic conductivity
    (G), and the water holding capacity (WHC). Some of these factors are related to
    the soil fertility properties, and some others are related to the chemical and
    physical properties of the soil. The criteria or the parameters used to measure
    each index can be varied; that is, some of the parameters considered in each index
    formula can be excluded, and the formula is modified accordingly. The variability
    in soil properties, especially over large areas, and the change in soil over time
    have made the owners of large-scale farms to periodically analyze soil to test
    its health and determine the most appropriate treatment and use. These large-scale
    farms resort to the variable rate application technology to optimally deal with
    this variability, where it allows adjusting the amount and rate of agriculture
    resources throughout the farm according to each specific region’s needs without
    excess or negligence that harms the crop and without wasting resources and harming
    the environment. The data from soil analysis is used to produce a prescription
    map which guides the variable application. A variable rate irrigation system is
    used in farms which have center pivot systems. According to the prescription map,
    the center pivot control system cycles control the switching of sprinklers and
    vary the speeds to achieve the desired application rates in each section of the
    farm. The farms which have tractors with onboard computers and adjustable rate
    spreaders, seeders, or sprayers can be used in variable rate fertilizer application,
    variable rate seeding, or variable rate pesticide application, respectively, by
    loading the prescription map to the computer. Using IoT technology in the generation
    of prescription maps maximizes the benefit of the variable rate application by
    improving spatial resolution and addresses the issue of soil change over time
    thus improving temporal resolution as well. Therefore, these large-scale farms
    with computerized agricultural application equipment are potential customers for
    IoT-based systems for spatial analysis and management zone delineation in variable
    rate application, hence the proposed system. One of the most important tasks of
    scientists and technical specialists involved in agricultural planning is land-use
    planning, especially the LSA process. The functionality provided by the proposed
    system that allows the LSA maps to be generated automatically from real-time data
    and stored historical data makes it a desirable and very useful tool for these
    scientists. The rest of this paper is organized as follows, the “Materials and
    methods” section identifies the technologies that were used to build the system
    and the tools that were selected to implement these technologies, and then, it
    formulates the IoT-based LSA use case design including its static and dynamic
    view. The “Results” section represents a small-scale implementation of the proposed
    design to validate the functionality and suitability of the selected technologies
    and tools to the system use case. The “Discussion” section discusses the work
    presented in this paper and the development of IoT use cases for farm enterprises
    in general. Finally, the “Conclusion and future work” section concludes the paper
    and specific directions for future work. Materials and methods This section reviews
    the selection of technologies and tools for system implementations and contains
    system modeling. Selection of technologies The main technologies which build the
    proposed system are web application development, digital mapping, database, and
    IoT. The following sub-sections review recent trends in these technologies and
    set criteria for technology selections for the system implementation. Web application
    technologies The web application user can access it through the web browser where
    he can use its functions and perform some tasks that need interactions with a
    remote server over a network, which can be the Internet, using a client–server
    connection paradigm. Accordingly, developing a web application incorporates two
    types of development: front-end development and back-end development. The front-end
    development, or the client-side programming, is responsible for all the elements
    and layout the user directly interacts with on his browser. The back-end development,
    or the server-side programming, is behind-the-scene functionality that enables
    the front-end functionality; it represents everything the user does not see or
    directly interact with, but in fact, it powers what is happening. Front-end development
    Mostly, there will not be a front-end webpage that can dispense with the presence
    of the HyperText Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) coding.
    HTML is the organizer of the page structure, and CSS is responsible for its component
    formatting and styling. To make the front-end webpages dynamic, a programming
    language is needed, and JavaScript is undoubtedly the most popular language used
    to do so. JavaScript is an event-based runtime scripting language that can use
    the HTML Document Object Model (DOM) to add animations, automatic refreshments,
    and adjustments according to events such as user input timers and also server-side
    events; therefore, it supports the functionality of the webpage with which the
    dropdown lists, the buttons, the checkboxes, the tables, the menus, etc. of the
    webpage become functional and interactive with the users. In addition, JavaScript
    can fetch additional web content dynamically and run web-based software. Developing
    with JavaScript, we will generally need to use some JavaScript libraries, may
    be with templating engines or frameworks. Libraries are used to speed-up and facilitate
    development where they contain pre-written ready-to-use JavaScript functions;
    the two most popular JavaScript Libraries are jQuery (Vats, 2021) and React JS
    (JavaTpoint, 2021). Table 1 presents their important features which can be used
    for making a comparison to decide which one is more suitable for implementing
    the proposed system. Table 1 Comparison between jQuery and React JavaScript libraries
    Full size table JavaScript frameworks are collections of JS libraries that not
    only include JS code snippets, but also provide developers with a template for
    arranging the JavaScript code on their website. They are scaffolds for building
    your front end. They usually include some way to structure the site files (for
    example, via components or a CSS preprocessor), make AJAX requests, style your
    components, and associate data with DOM elements. There are other less common
    languages through which one can do front-end development depending on the framework,
    for example, Flutter uses Dart and Django uses Python. But nowadays, the most
    frameworks getting popular are Angular and Vue.js. Angular uses TypeScript programming
    language and offers an incredible structure, providing easy two-way data binding,
    an MVC model, a built-in module system, a routing package, dependency injection,
    and other exciting features. Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework used
    to build web interfaces and one-page applications. The HTML extension and the
    JS base made Vue a favored front-end tool; it is used by Adobe, Alibaba, Gitlab,
    and Xiaomi. Table 2 shows Angular’s and Vue.js’s important features. Table 2 Comparison
    between Angular and Vue.js JavaScript front-end frameworks Full size table Templating
    engine is a way to display information on the user’s browser. It aims to describe
    what we want to show. Templating engines such as Handlebars.js, Embedded JavaScript
    Templates (EJS), Underscore.js, and mustache allow to store HTML/CSS/JavaScript
    components and insert JavaScript variables into them. But does the web application
    of the proposed system need a front-end framework or is vanilla JavaScript with
    some libraries and templating engines as needed sufficient? Fig. 1 shows the relative
    ranking for these two methodologies in terms of ecosystem evolution rate and continuous
    support, constriction feeling in the design, productivity/learning curve, application
    size and complexity, maintainability, collaboration of developers and ease of
    understanding codes, and abstraction/ease of learn and use. Fig. 1 Ranking for
    the front-end development approaches in terms of some important development metrics
    Full size image Back-end development The traditional back end is a mix of four
    components: the server, databases, software, and operating systems. It includes
    the code that connects the web to a database and manages user connections and
    code that powers the web app itself. Its job is to (1) access the information
    that users require through the application, (2) combine and transform such information,
    and (3) return the information in its new shape to the requester. Back-end development
    works in tandem with the front end to deliver the final product to the end user.
    The following sections talk about each back-end main component. Application (middleware/server-side
    software/API): the application is the underlying code bridging the clients to
    the database and other back-end and cloud resources, it is what ultimately drives
    the web service. The most common back-end programming languages can be categorized
    into: The Object Oriented Programming (OOP) languages: languages which follow
    the imperative programming model that uses statements that change a program’s
    state. An imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform.
    OOP is used when there are many things with few operations. Popular OOP languages
    are Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, ASP.NET, Python, and PHP. The Functional Programming
    (FP) languages: languages which follow the declarative programming model: a high-level
    program in which the coder “declare” the results that he wants the language tool
    to output without writing explicit commands, and the tool processes the declaration
    and produces the required output. The functional language is non-imperative. The
    state transitions are represented in pure functional language by functions; it
    treats all computations as the evaluation of mathematical functions. Functional
    is used only when there are few things with more operations (performing many different
    operations for which the data is fixed). Popular functional languages are SQL,
    F#, and R. It is always up to the programmers or developers to choose the programming
    language concept that makes their development productive and easy. But what are
    the hypotheses for the selection? What are the language categories and the language
    to use in the system implementation? First, for choosing the programming paradigm,
    as the choice is problem-specific, it is more likely to use a mix of the two approaches
    depending on the current problem at hand, which is the best way to implement it.
    In case of mathematical problems, FP can effectively implement it. In other cases,
    if a problem can be decomposed into a number of procedural steps and when performing
    many different operations for which the data is fixed, go functional; if, on the
    other hand, a problem involves groups of inter-related agents and when performing
    small operations for mutable data, an OOP approach is likely to be better. Second,
    what is the OOP programming language that will be used? The popularity is not
    the sole reason which makes us select the programming language, but it is a good
    indicator of the need of developers, who we are from them, to learn and use the
    language; therefore, the language popularity indicator accompanied by reviewing
    its application and features can be the rule for selection. According to the StackOverflow
    Developer Survey result 2020 (Fig. 2), JavaScript is the most commonly used OPP
    language and then Python and Java, C#, PHP, TypeScript, C +  + , and C. And according
    to frameworks, libraries, and tool StackOverflow trends up to the year 2020 (Fig.
    3), Node.js takes the top spot as it is used by half of the respondents. Fig.

    popularity Full size image Fig. 3 Frameworks, libraries, and tool StackOverflow
    trend survey Full size image Node.js is technically not a language but a runtime
    environment for JavaScript with some specific useful libraries that can be used
    by JavaScript. It is better suited for building scalable, event-based, real-time,
    data-driven, I/O heavy, fast applications, accessing or performing any non-blocking
    operation of any operating system, like creating or executing a shell script,
    accessing any hardware-specific information, or running any back-end job. As it
    helps us to use JavaScript from outside of the browser, it enables JavaScript
    to be used in the back end as well as the front end and in any OS, solving JavaScript
    compatibility issues. In addition, its event-driven back-end nature enables it
    to handle multiple synchronous database read/write/update requests, bearing in
    mind that the IoT is characterized by the collection of a huge amount of data.
    It is actually very common to use more than one back-end programming language,
    and there are a number of ways this can be done, for example, calling libraries
    that are written in another language or as separate processes. Node.js has different
    packages developed for interfacing with other languages or runtime environments.
    Node.js frameworks include: Express.js: This is a minimalist web application framework
    that is used to build a number of mobile applications and APIs. Socket.io: It
    is used for building real-time web applications. It is a JavaScript library that
    allows the bidirectional data flow between the web client and server. Asynchronous
    data I/O, binary streaming, and instant messaging are some of the most important
    features of this framework. Derby: This is a real-time data synchronization engine
    for Node.js that allows multi-site, real-time concurrency, and data synchronization
    across clients and servers. Sails.js: This framework has gained traction through
    the development of chat applications, dashboards, and multi-player games. It is
    most famous for building data-driven APIs. Due to the previous analysis, we will
    concentrate on the Node.js technology. Servers: they are responsible for managing
    all back-end processes such as exchanging data among different clients, managing
    databases, reacting to users’ posts, and sending emails. Rather than the need
    to have physical servers, now, cloud services, such as Amazon and Azure, provide
    virtual servers on which the developers deploy their server applications. In addition,
    with the Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) cloud service model, the developers can concentrate
    only on developing the front end. The system includes servers: Web server: Node.js
    has a built-in module called HTTP that can create an HTTP server, while Express
    is a Node.js web application framework built on the HTTP module, adding more functions
    to what it offers to increase the convenience of building web servers. IoT server:
    Node.js is equipped with libraries that support IoT messaging protocols; node-coap
    is a client and server library for CoAP; rhea is used for developing AMQP client
    and server. MQTT protocol and socket communication which are commonly used in
    IoT applications are supported in Node.js: Mosca is a Node.js MQTT broker which
    can be used standalone or embedded in another Node.js application, and MQTT.js
    is a client library for the MQTT protocol. Database: Node.js supports relational
    databases (e.g., MS SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite) and NoSQL databases
    (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra, LevelDB, Redis). BaaS databases can also be used allowing
    us to focus on developing the client-side, such as Firebase, Parse Server, Hoodie,
    Horizon, and feathers-nedb. Most BaaS providers use NoSQL databases. According
    to StackOverflow developer survey result 2020 for databases (Fig. 4), MySQL occupies
    the first rank in popularity among developers, followed by PostgreSQL and Microsoft
    SQL Server. Fig. 4 Stackoverflow developer survey for databases Full size image
    What to use in the proposed system front-end and back-end development The proposed
    IoT-based system is not considered to be a large-size and complex application.
    By reference to Fig. 1, the frameworks are harder to learn especially since it
    is imperative to also learn the underlying code of the framework to use it better
    and for the purpose of customization and adding functionalities, and all of these
    increase the production time using frameworks. With respect to the constriction
    in the design, some frameworks are described to be opinionated, their design is
    based on principles that are not suitable to the application we want to develop
    or increase the application footprint by unnecessary unusable codes, and at the
    same time, their customization is a too tricky and nontrivial task; this raises
    the need to study the features of the available frameworks, compare them, and
    then select the appropriate one to study and use; this is also not an easy task
    and may result in an inaccurate choice. All of these reasons in addition to the
    availability of a variety of JavaScript libraries and the guarantee of related
    good and continuous support, it is preferred to build the proposed system from
    scratch using the front-end design approach—vanilla JavaScript with some libraries
    and templating engines—by trading off the frameworks’ built-in functionalities,
    reliability, and maintainability. By the same token, jQuery is preferred over
    React due to easiness to learn and use, short time-to-market, better documentation,
    and other good features such as lightweight, feature-rich, and cross-browser compatibility.
    Naturally, HTML and CSS, along with other HTML, CSS, and JavaScript-appropriate
    libraries, are essential for the proposed system front-end development. It is
    expected to use libraries and plugins for supporting specific helper functions
    such as Bootstrap CSS framework for getting design templates for some interface
    components; Font Awesome which is a font and customizable icon toolkit; JSZip
    for creating, reading, and editing.zip files; html2canvas for taking screenshots;
    SheetJS for spreadsheets manipulation; and Google Chart libraries. The real-time,
    scalability, and concurrent processing and harvesting a vast amount of data are
    the main needs for precision agriculture and IoT applications, and all of these
    metrics are realized by Node.js; therefore, as indicated earlier, our choice fell
    on using Node.js to implement the back end of the system and interface it with
    other FP languages if needed. Using the same language—JavaScript—in both front
    and back ends is an advantage. Relational database will be used to manage the
    proposed system’s structured data and represent the relations between them. Node.js
    can be interfaced with both of the two most popular database management systems
    MySQL and PostgreSQL. PostgreSQL is an object-relational database. While MySQL
    is simple and easy to understand and manage which improves its speed performance
    for simple applications, PostgreSQL is preferred for implementing the proposed
    system for supporting complex queries on large data volumes and due to its support
    for NoSQL features and a large number of data types including JSON. Finally, the
    proposed system back end will use the Express web server. Figure 5 summarizes
    the system web app development technologies. Fig. 5 The selected web development
    technologies for the proposed system Full size image IoT technologies The IoT
    will utilize the existing networking infrastructure, technologies, and protocols
    currently used in homes/offices and on the Internet. The IoT runs over the existing
    TCP/IP network infrastructure. Exchanging data through messages is fundamental
    for the development and deployment of IoT applications. The IoT protocols, or
    the IoT messaging application protocols, can take the publish/subscribe model
    or the request-response model, some of them use UDP and some others use TCP/IP.
    Figure 6 describes the trends in the worldwide interest in three popular messaging
    protocols: MQTT, CoAP, and AMQP. Fig. 6 Google trends for three well-known IoT
    messaging protocols Full size image The publish/subscribe model has a lot of characteristics
    and advantages that make it suitable for IoT scenarios especially the proposed
    near-real-time system case, including asynchronous many-to-many communication,
    decoupling between senders and receivers in time, space, and synchronization,
    reliability, and scalability. The publish/subscribe paradigm is supported by both
    MQTT and AMQP; however, AMQP is heavyweight and therefore not suitable for battery-operated
    IoT devices, while MQTT is very lightweight. This is one of the main reasons why
    MQTT is the de facto standard for IoT messaging (HiveMQ, 2021) and more widely
    used than AMQP in IoT applications and the reason why we selected it as the adopted
    IoT technology for the proposed system (Fig. 7). Fig. 7 The selected IoT technology
    for the proposed system Full size image Digital mapping technologies Google Maps
    is a feature-rich online mapping framework that supports numerous geospatial functionalities,
    and it is the first mapping service and API the developers think of choosing when
    integrating maps into a web application. It has earned the trust of web, iOS,
    and Android developers around the world. However, Google Maps increased the cost
    of its API calls—reaches $14 for 1000 map calls—and made the number of free API
    calls per month nearly 30 times less; this makes the search for alternatives a
    must. The two most prominent alternatives to Google Maps API are Mapbox which
    offers free 50,000 API calls monthly and $0.5 for each subsequent 1000 calls (Osypenko,
    2021) and OpenStreetMap which is free. The OpenStreetMap is considered to be a
    great geographic database of the world, but it does not offer a lot of mapping
    functionalities, so usually, it is better to use a more powerful service built
    on its data such as Mapbox. Mapbox is one of the largest providers of maps for
    websites and mobile apps. Their service is used by GitHub, Pinterest, Foursquare,
    and other popular companies. Mapbox offers advanced features such as location
    search, route finding, augmented reality, and many tools to help in integrating
    maps and other Mapbox online web mapping services—such as Directions, Geocoding,
    and Static Images. Mapbox is characterized by custom maps, very good performance
    in loading maps, the ability to deal with a huge amount of data to visualize and
    extract conclusions to take appropriate actions, and geospatial mapping support.
    These features make it a good fit for the proposed system type. Turf.js is an
    open-source JavaScript library used to perform advanced geospatial analysis in
    browsers and Node.js, and works with Mapbox. It includes traditional spatial operations,
    helper functions for creating GeoJSON data, and data classification and statistics
    tools. Figure 8 illustrates the selected mapping technologies. Fig. 8 The selected
    digital mapping technologies for the proposed system Full size image Measuring
    and transmission technologies There are several methods to measure the soil parameters
    for computing the quality indices and assess land suitability. Some parameters
    can be sensed with MEMS sensors available commercially or proposed in the literature,
    on-the-go vehicle-based sensors, handheld measuring devices, or soil sampling
    and laboratory analysis. Returning to the parameters of soil fertility, chemical,
    and physical properties mentioned previously, we find that the parameters that
    can be measured by industrial sensors embedded in MEMS-based wireless deceives,
    deployed in the field, communicate, and send data in real time are N, P, K, S,
    WHC, D, PH, T, and F. The sensor can be an integrated sensor that measures more
    than one soil parameter or a sensor dedicated to measuring a specific parameter.
    The soil NPK sensor (Soil NPK Sensor 2023) can measure the fertility and nutrient
    parameters N, P, and K. The soil EC-moisture-salinity-temperature sensor (Soil
    EC-Moisture-Salinity-Temperature Sensor 2023) can be used to measure and compute
    S, WHC, and D. The soil nutrient sensor (SEM225 Series Soil 2023) can be used
    to measure S, WHC, D, along with the PH value. The RS-PH-N01-TR-1 (Soil PH Sensor
    2023) is a sensor dedicated to measuring PH. Acoustic sensors can be used to measure
    T and D, and the soil slope/tilt sensor such as 0750–9002-99 MEMS tilt sensor
    and inclinometer (0750–9002-99 ± 90° RS-485 IP67 MEMS Tilt Sensor and Inclinometer
    2023) and the dual-axis inclinometer (AXISENSE-2 V-OUT TILT SENSOR FLOOR MOUNT
    2023) can be used to measure F. In the literature, a frequency-domain integrated
    sensor was proposed for in situ estimation of G (Xu et al., 2022), while the ring
    infiltrometer tool is already used for this. Optical sensors were proposed in
    the literature to measure OM, while commercially available handheld electromagnetic
    sensors, such as Geonics EM-38 Ground Conductivity Meter 2023, are used for infield
    measurement of OM as well as R and T. A handheld soil penetrometer is used to
    measure HP. The Zn is deduced from remote sensing data or from other influencing
    factors, such as the PH and T, Soil sampling and laboratory analysis can be used
    to provide information about Zn, HP, ESP, CaCO3, and Y. The data reported by the
    battery-operated devices deployed in the field in such a system is not characterized
    by a high data rate, but the devices require low power consumption for a longer
    lifetime, and the long-range bidirectional secure communication and low cost are
    preferred. These requirements are satisfied by the unlicensed low-power wide-area
    network technology, especially LoRaWAN. LoRaWAN has long been used for agricultural
    and environmental monitoring; its communication range reaches 5 km in urban areas
    and up to 15 km in rural areas (LoRa and LoRaWAN 2023). LoRaWAN is composed of
    end devices handling the sensing and actuation and performing bidirectional LoRa
    communication with the gateways which connect them to a server. The server manages
    the network through different pieces of software used for authentication and authorization
    and session management, network configuration and performance monitoring, data
    routing and selection of the gateway for a downlink, handling uplink messages
    duplication, processing application data, encryption/decryption and integration
    of data into existing management systems or IoT platforms, etc. Formulating the
    IoT use case: system design This section tells the story, identifying the need,
    the problem, and the requirements, which motivate constructing a proposed system
    use case. Then, the section goes on to explain the static structure and the dynamic
    behavior of the system. Narrative description of the system use case Some study
    areas can be employed to produce most types of vegetables and fruits including
    potatoes. It is a large area of high spatial variation and is characterized by
    using modern cultivation methods such as pivot irrigation. These modern cultivation
    methods often are associated with the variable rate application of agricultural
    inputs to encounter and exploit the high spatial variability of the field phenomena.
    Assuming the existence of all the required hardware used in applying the variable
    rates whether built-in or added to the modern agricultural equipment, the challenge
    is in developing the plans that control how the rate should be varied in the different
    field regions which is usually based on geo-referenced sampling of field data.
    This process, to be accurately achieved, requires experience, may require the
    hiring of skilled persons to achieve it, and repeated modification of the plan
    requires more data collection throughout one season; therefore, it consumes a
    lot of effort, time, and money. The proposed system use case uses the IoT technology
    and recent trends in programming and web development to enable the automation
    of data collection with higher temporal and spatial resolution, automate the spatial
    analysis and management zoning process, and facilitate, centralize, and improve
    decision-making. The system depends on the existence of sensing devices deployed
    in the field in certain points with known geographical positions, takes periodical
    samples of the field phenomena, and reports their values in real time in addition
    to laboratory values determined after analysis of soil samples taken at the same
    positions by special different devices. These laboratory values are inputted to
    the system manually. The system is prepared to manipulate field data related to
    soil, climate, and plant. All the data is stored in a database with its geographical
    coordinates for historical reference. The real-time data along with the stored
    laboratory values are used to infer the values of phenomena along the field by
    interpolation, and then, each region which has the same range of values and accordingly
    indicates a specific performance and requires special management is delineated
    whether it is contiguous or spread over the field area, all of this using real
    maps of the earth. Examples of management zone map usage include phosphorus and
    potassium management zone maps for variable fertilizer application, management
    zone maps for soil texture and soil water content can be used for variable irrigation,
    climate zone maps can be used for weed control, chlorophyll content measurement
    maps can be used for nitrogen management, and soil electrical conductivity maps
    can help for explaining yield variation. Moreover, the system allows for the spatial
    analysis of soil quality indices of fertility, chemical properties, and physical
    properties. The spatial analysis of these soil quality indices is used to derive
    the land suitability assessment classes for crop production. The appropriate decision
    is not limited only to the application in the appropriate place but also to the
    appropriate decision time so that the system should raise alerts immediately when
    certain conditions exist. Likewise, appropriate decision-making may need to be
    done based on reviewing historical data and representing it in different forms
    including management zone maps. The system should be characterized by flexibility
    in modifying the modeling equations, parameters’ values, adding and removing items,
    selection from different options, and different types of user accounts with different
    privileges. The system should be tailored for any land and not limited to only
    one field such that the user can manage all his belonging farms from his place
    through the application, apply to them all the system functionalities, and accordingly
    be able to compare their characteristics. The maximum benefit of this system is
    when all the incorporated parameters are measured in near real time through the
    field devices, but as mentioned before, not all parameters have commercially available
    MEMS sensors to measure them. Some parameters are still measured by handheld devices
    or through laboratory analysis of soil samples, and their values are then entered
    into the system manually, for example, through spreadsheets, for use in analysis
    with continuous data received from the field nodes. Referring to the “Measuring
    and transmission technologies” section, the sensor nodes deployed in the field
    will be LoRaWAN end devices of “class A,” each containing the four sensor types
    which measure the indicated real-time parameters. As outlined above, the equation
    used to calculate a soil quality index can be modified by omitting some parameters
    and modifying the exponent accordingly by decreasing its denominator by the number
    of omitted parameters. Thus, besides having one type of node containing all the
    sensors that are included in the analysis, there can be three types of nodes according
    to the embedded sensors used separately: Type1 sensor node which is a fertility
    sensing node containing soil NPK sensor, Type2 sensor node which is a physical
    property–sensing node containing tilt sensor and acoustic sensors, and Type3 sensor
    node which is a chemical/physical property–sensing node containing soil nutrient
    sensor. The system is designed and configured to receive all values included in
    the LSA equation in the sensor node message payload, the actually sensed parameters
    will have values, and the unsensed parameters are marked with NULL. The parameters
    manually entered into the system are retrieved from the corresponding table, and
    likewise, NULL values are ignored in analysis calculations. The sampling frequency
    is the same for all sensors in a single node and can be configured remotely. Whenever
    a new message is received from a node, its measured sensors’ data is stored in
    the appropriate tables accompanied by the reception time and date. The last record
    of each node is treated as the recent data from this node, while the system service
    that will be mentioned later “Nodes Status Monitoring panel” alerts if a node
    ceased sending for a specified time. Thanks to the long LoRa range, the star-of-stars
    topology is satisfactory to such a system; any node deployed in a plot of agricultural
    land can reach a gateway deployed anywhere within that plot or beyond. Taking
    into account its minimum communication range, it can be said that an outdoor LoRa
    gateway, which costs an average of $600, can serve a circular area equal to more
    than 18,000 feddan. The appropriate number of nodes for a given field can be determined
    depending on the soil sampling scheme used. For example, if grid sampling is used,
    at least one node might be placed in the center of the cell or at a random position
    within the cell. The approximate price range for the soil NPK–integrated sensor
    is $28–95, and the price of the 4-in-1 soil nutrient–integrated sensor is $51.
    The tilt and acoustic sensors are cheaper especially when a quantity is purchased.
    A microcontroller board with a LoRa transceiver costs about $20. The sensor node
    contains other components such as a GPS module and batteries. Taking this into
    consideration, it can be said that the cost of such a sensing station containing
    all the sensors is no more than $340. As mentioned above, the system use case
    model is adapted to the fact that some phenomena still do not have corresponding
    MEMS sensors, the flexibility required in modeling soil quality indices, different
    types of sensors, different sampling frequencies of nodes, the possibility of
    one or more devices stopping transmission, and different measurement scales by
    mapping the parameter values to a specific set of factor scores provided by the
    land suitability assessment model as will be illustrated later. The static view
    of the system The topology for the system hardware and artifacts is summarized
    in the UML deployment diagram depicted in Fig. 9 which shows the system nodes
    including a central physical server consisting of back-end and front-end artifacts.
    The core of the back end is the Node.js application which loads the modules required
    for the server functionalities, mainly, the Express web service, the Nodemailer
    for email sending, and PostgreSQL client modules for connection to the PostgreSQL
    database with a specified connection configuration. The back-end works as an MQTT
    server as well as an MQTT client; the back-end MQTT client connects to the MQTT
    server using the MQTT protocol. Likewise, the system nodes include instances for
    user devices which connect to the system back end through HTTP and WebSocket,
    and instances for the IoT devices in different farms represented by MQTT clients
    reside on the sensor actuator nodes or on a base station which sends the data
    of the sensor actuator nodes on behalf of them, forwards the configuration, and
    commands messages to them. Fig. 9 Deployment diagram of the proposed system Full
    size image The dynamic view of the system In the following, the dynamic behavior
    of the system will be modeled, starting by describing the functionalities and
    the high-level design requirements of the system including actors influenced by
    the use case diagram in Fig. 10. There are about thirty-eight use cases and seven
    actors associated by different relationships. The administrator and normal user
    actors are generalized to their parent actor, the Internet user, and they are
    associated with use cases specific to their roles with two levels of privileges
    that require successful system login. The functionality of the “Open landing page
    and browse App website” use case is extended by some other supplemental use cases,
    and they communicate with the server application. The behavioral diagrams in the
    subsequent discussion describe the implementation of these use cases from different
    aspects. Fig. 10 The proposed system use case diagram Full size image The land
    suitability index, LS, is computed based on three thematic indices: fertility
    quality index, FQI; chemical quality index, CQI; and physical quality index, PQI,
    from Eq. (2): $${\\text{LS}}=\\mathrm{FQI }\\times \\mathrm{CQI }\\times {\\text{PQI}}$$
    (2) The selection of parameters that affect each index is based on the growth
    requirement of the crop. Each index is calculated by multiplying factor scores
    for each affecting parameter and then raising the product to a power equal to
    the reciprocal of the number of factors. The numerical rating of the parameter
    factor scores is based on experts’ suggestions and a review of the literature.
    The FQI, CQI, and PQI are computed from Eqs. (3)–(5), and as mentioned before,
    some of the parameters involved in the computation of each index can be omitted
    and the equation modified accordingly. Based on the value of LS, the land suitability
    class is determined according to the used suitability rating classification to
    unclassified, highly suitable, moderately suitable, marginally suitable, and unsuitable.
    $${\\text{FQI}}={\\left({S}_{{\\text{N}}}\\times {S}_{{\\text{P}}}\\times {S}_{{\\text{K}}}\\times
    {S}_{{\\text{zn}}}{\\times S}_{{\\text{OM}}}\\right)}^\\frac{1}{5}$$ (3) $${\\text{CQI}}={\\left({S}_{{\\text{S}}}\\times
    {S}_{{\\text{ESP}}}\\times {S}_{{\\text{CaCo}}3}\\times {S}_{{\\text{PH}}}\\right)}^\\frac{1}{4}$$
    (4) $${\\text{PQI}}={\\left({S}_{{\\text{R}}}\\times {S}_{{\\text{T}}}\\times
    {S}_{{\\text{D}}}\\times {S}_{{\\text{F}}}{\\times S}_{{\\text{Y}}}{\\times S}_{{\\text{HP}}}{\\times
    S}_{{\\text{G}}}{\\times S}_{{\\text{WHC}}}\\right)}^\\frac{1}{8}$$ (5) Before
    delving deeper into describing the interactive behavior of the system, it is worth
    introducing the stored data, the tables, and relational diagrams; Fig. 11 shows
    the system database schema. Each of the three tables allNodesData, labParameters,
    and lastRecords contains the values of the field phenomena: allNodesData stores
    all the records of real-time values that come directly from the field corresponding
    to all the nodes deployed in any registered land, and in addition to that, the
    table record stores the soil quality indices computed in terms of its fields’
    values. The table labParameters contains the values of the phenomena determined
    by on-site measurement or laboratory analysis of soil samples corresponding to
    all the nodes deployed in all the registered land, and these values are inputted
    into the system manually. The table lastRecords stores only the last record of
    each node of its real-time, lab, and computed parameters. The registeredFields
    table stores the registered land information. The two tables allEvents and Conditions
    are related to storing the tested event specifications. The Factors table is dedicated
    to storing numerical rating of factor scores to facilitate changing this rating
    according to the crop and the suitability assessment purpose. The rating scheme
    can be expressed as follows: for parameter x, the factor score is s1 if x < low
    bound, s2 if x \\(\\in\\) [low bound, intermediate limit], s3 if x \\(\\in\\)
    [intermediate limit, high bound], and s4 if x > high bound, where the bounds of
    these ranges are numerical values. In another possibility, in which x takes a
    discrete value represents a code corresponding to a textual description of x,
    for example, the soil texture can be SiC, silty clay; SiCL, silty clay loam; and/or
    CL, clay loam, expressed as numerical codes of 1, 2, and 3, and in this case,
    the range is an array of numerical codes that describe the parameter value. Fig.
    11 The proposed system database schema Full size image The Factors table stores
    the scheme through fields that identify the parameter, the range type whether
    numerical range or array of discrete values, and fields that identify the bounds
    of a numerical range, while the codes array is stored in the range_Minimum field,
    and field for storing the factor score. Data dictionaries for additional explanation
    of database schema tables are available in the Appendix. The pseudocode in Fig.
    12 represents the computation of the three quality indices. The computation of
    the indices begins when a data message is received from a node by fetching the
    values of all parameters of this node from the table that is dedicated to storing
    the laboratory values. The considered value of each parameter is its fetched value
    if it is not NULL; otherwise, it takes its value from the received massage whether
    a numerical value or NULL. The pseudocode then illustrates the computation of
    the CQI as an example of an index computation. The code loops through the parameters
    influencing CQI and uses the Factors table to determine these parameters’ factor
    scores. The If statement in line 37 checks the range type whether it is a numerical
    range of the low bound only, a numerical range of the high bound only, a codes
    array, or a numerical range of two limits, and then, it makes the appropriate
    test to see if the parameter value falls within the range. Then, it considers
    the factor scores of the parameters in the computation only if it is not NULL
    and modifies the exponent accordingly. Fig. 12 Pseudocode for land quality indices

    server environments that run on a single physical server are represented in the

    diagram for the proposed system Full size image The Events and Actions settings
    service includes transactions among three objects shown in Fig. 12. They are the
    user browser which controls the front-end content of the system, the server-side,
    and the database. The browser or the front-end code sends the HTTP GET request
    to the server to retrieve the Events and Actions settings webpage and sends HTTP
    POST requests with the data of a newly formulated event or the data of existing
    event(s) to be ignored. The server-side responds to these requests by doing the
    required interactions with the database to add or ignore the specified events
    and by rendering and sending the requested page with the appropriate local variables
    or sending the login page if the authentication failed. All the front-end pages
    use an established WebSocket connection between the sever and the browser to receive
    the Alert event. The Mapping service transactions which are described in Fig.
    14 include POST requests to add and ignore lands and the associated database manipulation
    statements. The server-side continuously updates the GeoJSON representation of
    the lands’ data, and the Mapping page periodically gets this data to display it
    on the map. In the Virtual Coordinates Spatial Analysis service, Fig. 15, the
    WebSocket connection is used for listening to the Spatial Analysis Update event
    issued by the server periodically to send the updated data of the parameter considered
    for the analysis. The browser can post new settings of the 3D plot to be considered
    by the server when computing the subsequent plot parameter data. The sequence
    charts of the three services aggregated to the Real-time Data Visualization service
    are shown in Figs. 16, 17, and 18. They mainly depend on event-based transactions
    between the browser and the server. The Historical Data Visualization as shown
    in Fig. 19 includes a POST request for historical data retrieval from the database
    containing the primitives for fetching and preparing the data, upon which the
    server follows these primitives and submits the result back to the browser through
    event-based communication. The IoT massaging–related interactions and topic tree
    are shown in Figs. 20 and 21, respectively. The MQTT client of the server-side
    subscribes to the data channels of all the registered lands, while the IoT devices
    in each land publish data through the land data channel. On the contrary, IoT
    devices play the role of subscribers but to the channels of the application commands,
    while the server plays the role of publisher that publishes its commands to the
    devices through these channels. These interactions entail other transactions with
    the database, the browser, and the mail server. The different states and state
    transitions accompanied by the system can be summarized by the server-side lifetime
    conditions as depicted in Fig. 22. The server always is in the listening state
    on the system communication ports, and in the event of receiving a request through
    them, it transits to the processing state of the received request. Three timers
    control the server operations, two always-on timers: one of them is for periodically
    checking all the deployed node status and the other one is for periodically checking
    the saved events to detect if one of them is realized. The third timer is for
    periodically updating the virtual coordinates spatial analysis plot, and it is
    always on only if this service is enabled by a POST request. All the states have
    a transition to the final state in the event of a server shutdown, but it is not
    indicated completely in the figure for clarity and simplicity. The flow of some
    of the system operations and the system’s different function implementation details
    are described in the following activity diagrams. Figure 23 describes the node
    status check flow of operations, while Fig. 24 describes the implementation of
    the event checking activities, and the details of the handle_event(event id) function
    are further described in Fig. 25. Fig. 23 Node status checking activity diagram

    Full size image Results This section contains the results of validating the selected
    technologies and the system functionalities with respect to its IoT use case specification
    through a small-scale implementation. The validated functionalities are developing
    a functional Node.js back end, developing an interactive front-end webpage that
    sends the user inputs, issuing events to the back end, and receiving issued events
    from the back end, and a functional PostgreSQL implementation can be used to store
    and retrieve data, an IoT publish/subscribe valid connection from an Internet
    IoT device to the server and the display of its data in real time, and finally,
    the spatial analysis functions of the digital map. IoT real-time connection validation
    An interactive webpage is developed to display the data sent by remote devices
    immediately as it arrives in tabular and graph forms (Fig. 26a). The webpage uses
    HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the EJS templating language to embed JavaScript into
    HTML templates to implement the dynamic table from the list of items sent by the
    server to the webpage when rendering it and the CanvasJS Charting Library to implement
    the dynamic graphs. The MQTT library is used for implementing the publish/subscribe
    interaction, and the Socket.io library is used to enable the real-time web app
    service for updating the graphs. The Eclipse Paho client library is used for implementing
    a remote device. Fig. 26 The interactive webpage to test real-time data display

    Full size image In this validation example, the “mqtt://broker.hivemq.com” public
    broker is used, where the remote devices Node1 and Node2 are connected to it and
    publish their data to the topics “Node1/data” and “Node2/data,” respectively.
    As the server subscribes to these two topics, it receives the data sent through
    them. Figure 26b shows the tables and the graphs as they are updated with Node1
    and Node2 data that is immediately sent by the server via issuing UpdateGraph
    events. Node2 is subscribed to the topic “cmds/sprinkler1/status,” the server
    publishes to this topic a payload “Open” to command the node to open the sprinkler
    if the node temperature value becomes greater than 20 and the sprinkler is currently
    closed, and in a similar way, it publishes to this topic a payload “Close” to
    command the node to close the sprinkler if the node temperature value becomes
    less than 10 and the sprinkler is currently opened. Figure 27 shows that when
    the temperature of Node2 fell below 10 and the sprinkler was in the Open status,
    the server sent the Close commend which was successfully received by the node
    as indicated by the message “*****Closed *****.” Fig. 27 The bidirectional IoT
    connection test Full size image Form input and database retrieval validation A
    database table was constructed to store the data of the IoT devices. A webpage
    (Fig. 28) was developed to submit the specification of the data that the user
    wants to retrieve from the table. The server fetches the required data and emits
    an event with it to the webpage where it is displayed in the graph. Fig. 28 Webpage

    Full size image Spatial analysis functionality validation Mapbox and turf library
    were employed to perform the spatial analysis. Two methods were implemented: in
    the first one, the required phenomenon values of sample data points from a study
    region (the region appears in Fig. 29a) and the “turf.interpolate” were used to
    generate a grid of values covering the whole study region. Then, the number of
    zones and breaks/ranges for the zones values were determined to be four zones
    with breaks [8,10,16,20,30], and the “turf.isobands” was used to draw the isobands
    that represent the different zones (the different specified ranges of the interpolated
    grid points’ values) as shown in Fig. 29b. Then, the isobands were cut to fit
    the area of the study region as shown in Fig. 29c, where the Mapbox Draw tools
    were used to delineate the study region boundary. Fig. 29 The spatial analysis
    result using Mapbox and turf library. a The study area, b the computed isoband
    fit the Bounding Box of the study region, c the isoband fit the area of the study
    region Full size image In another method, the spatial analysis can be performed
    using the K-means algorithm using turf.clustersKmeans on the interpolated grid
    values of sample data points. Figure 30 represents another area shape of a study
    region; here, the numberOfClusters was specified to be seven. As shown in Fig.
    30, the algorithm clustered the data into seven clusters: (1) Cluster0: min value

    paper is about a software solution acting as a part of a complete end-to-end software
    and hardware system for a farm enterprise. Figure 31 summarizes the work done
    in this paper in graphical form. Fig. 31 Graphical abstract of the proposed solution
    Full size image Technology-wise, the solution represents an IoT Web App; application-wise,
    the solution is mainly a land suitability assessment tool for environmental and
    agricultural production sustainability; market-wise, it can be considered an enterprise-scale
    field monitoring and mapping software product. The IoT use case is formulated
    taking all of these three aspects into account. Starting application-wise, we
    turned to the agricultural experts to find out their recommendations on a specific
    important agricultural aspect that needs to be digitally transformed and performed
    smarter, and the choice fell on the land suitability assessment process. As a
    product, estimating its market size helps in identifying whether such a system
    really has potential customers and whether it is expected for it to succeed and
    sustain. The precision agriculture market is segmented into seven application
    types; as shown in Fig. 32, the yield monitoring and field mapping applications
    are on and expected to remain on the throne of revenue generation. Likewise, as
    shown in Fig. 33, the market share of software occupies the second rank in the
    precision agriculture market offerings, and it is expected to increase. Fig. 32

    Full size image As previously mentioned, the system’s potential customers are
    owners of large private farms, government for large-area state-owned agricultural
    lands, and scientists in the field of agricultural and soil applications. These
    customers need to take precision decisions on land use and management, decrease
    field trips, save time and effort, decrease labor costs, prevent the waste of
    agricultural inputs, monitor the field with a high spatial–temporal resolution,
    decrease human errors in measurements and analysis, model agricultural operations
    based on experts’ knowledge, control their farm equipment and conditions remotely,
    improve crop quality and size, increase profits, preserve the environment, etc.
    At this time, the system use case can be narrated. The features of the proposed
    design are selected to meet these needs and add value in a way that increases
    the chance of the system to become effective and to gain a competitive advantage.
    The system is designed not to depend on the human factor in taking readings and
    analysis; it is prepared to communicate with the smart devices in the field and
    take readings from them directly, store the data, and process it based on the
    experts’ models of spatial analysis. In addition to that, it also allows for data
    input from humans. The spatial analysis and land suitability assessment maps are
    produced automatically in real time and from historical data. Based on these maps,
    the users can compare lands and differentiate the application of agricultural
    inputs to different regions of the land according to their real need. Regardless
    of the main purpose of the system, its proposed design augments it with other
    features that generally meet the need and satisfy the customers of the market
    segments related to the system, such as remote control, detections and alarms,
    and spatial analysis using virtual coordinates. A good feature of the proposed
    system is its ability to interoperate with governmental initiatives and regional/international
    spatial data infrastructures. Every country has a land cadastre database, which
    stores cadastral information and metadata for its agricultural lands such as unique
    identification, owner information, area, location, boundaries, soil quality characteristics,
    irrigation system, and crops. This information can be used by interested governmental
    or non-governmental entities, with appropriate authorization privileges, to improve
    the land-use analysis and thus achieve sustainable land management. Recently,
    many countries, including Egypt, have turned to digital transformation and developed
    strategies for it, including, as an important part, the automation of the land
    cadastre database. Egypt is working to automate the agricultural tenure system
    and build a comprehensive and integrated geographic database on agricultural tenure,
    land cadastre, and related activities at the republic level, which will lead to
    the integration of geographic data for government agencies and the ease of exchanging,
    displaying and analyzing information and preparing future plans through establishing
    a national center for spatial data. The establishment of this center would ensure
    the provision and availability of a base map for all sectors of the state, with
    the aim of raising the efficiency of planning decisions, providing cooperation
    and coordination in implementing policies and foundations of uses, and facilitating
    the sharing and exchange of information between government agencies. Assuming
    that the local land cadastre database follows the international standard (Land
    Administration Domain Model (LADM)) in its implementation, the National Center
    for Spatial Data is the source of the data related to the two packages: Party
    and Administrative. The proposed system is related to the Spatial Unit package
    and its sub-package Representation and Survey, and in addition, the model can
    be extended by associating classes related to land suitability indices. The system
    will be the source of the spatial and soil-related data. The connection of the
    system to the local land cadastre database can be through a remote database connection
    or through an MQTT connection. The second option is preferred for several reasons,
    such as bandwidth, security, and loose coupling, and can be implemented by integrating
    the local land cadastre database with an MQTT client. The system topic tree will
    be expanded to include a topic, under the land code level, related to land suitability
    indices. The MQTT client of the database system subscribes to this topic for all
    the registered lands in the proposed system, while the MQTT client in the proposed
    system back end publishes this topic periodically for all lands. The published
    data can be the land suitability assessment map itself. This requires the database
    system to securely maintain land codes associated with the corresponding land
    data and also requires an update in the MQTT server access control list (ACL)
    for restricting the subscription to these topics to the MQTT client of the local
    land cadastre database and the publication on each of these topic to the relevant
    land, where the client ID of each land represents its land code. This is of course,
    in addition to the existing rules that restrict the subscription/publication between
    the proposed system back end and the MQTT clients of the lands. Through the standard
    format that the local database follows, external databases can connect to it and
    access its stored data based on the established database authorization rules.
    The technology-wise design entails selecting the IoT enabling technologies and
    tools and before that putting the criteria upon which the selection will be made.
    The process followed in developing the proposed IoT system can be summarized and
    generalized as shown in Fig. 34. Fig. 34 Generalized IoT software development
    process for farm enterprise Full size image Another important matter that cannot
    be overlooked and is crucial for satisfying the needs of such enterprise-scale
    IoT system customers is ensuring accurate readings of the IoT devices. Ensuring
    and improving sensor data quality can be done in several stages and forms. During
    device design, sensors can be calibrated by comparing the sensor reading to a
    standard value. The accuracy and precision of readings can be improved through
    the calibration process by adjusting the design, including the sensor settings,
    and using appropriate filters to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, until acceptable
    accuracy is achieved. It is recommended to perform the calibration over the full
    range of the sensor reading and in different environmental conditions. Also, periodic
    recalibration is recommended to tackle the drift of sensor readings over time.
    Continuous monitoring together with using appropriate validation methods of sensor
    readings is important to ensure data accuracy and precision. The aim of validation
    is to detect device malfunction and anomalies in devices’ readings such as bias,
    dropout, and outliers. The number of published literature on the topic of designing
    software systems for land suitability assessment, soil spatial analysis, and management
    zone delineation is not considered many. Some rely entirely on manual input, and
    others exploit the embedded system and web technologies to automate and improve
    some processes done manually in the commercial geospatial processing programs
    that were not specifically developed for agricultural applications, but they have
    not exploited the IoT technology. A sample of previous work will be discussed
    below. The research by de Freitas Coelho et al., (2018) proposed an embedded system
    consisting of a single-board computer and sensors and running an application developed
    using Python and PyQt designed to perform the data analysis immediately after
    data collection, eliminating the need to come back and forth frequently to and
    from the laboratory to collect more data from the field for analysis. The application
    first filters the data through outlier and inlier analysis, then performs kriging
    interpolation, and finally produces and visualizes the spatial analysis map resulting
    from K-means clustering. This system did not benefit from the communication network
    technology, as the readings are taken manually and through a single device, which
    adds effort and time consumption until a single collection of field data is completed
    and makes it unsuitable for large-area fields. In addition, the motivation of
    the work which is avoiding the need to return to the field to collect more data
    to tackle problems in the sampling strategy can be addressed by performing the
    analysis done by the proposed system using any PC or laptop in the field. Another
    limitation of the system is the use of collected points in defining the field
    boundaries. The research by Werner et al. (2020) developed a web-based spatial
    analysis application integrated with R language for the statistical and geostatistical
    analysis and creation of thematic maps. It offers generating the maps using both
    inverse distance weighting and kriging methods. The application automates some
    processes such as fitting the best model for a semivariogram. Sample data was
    used to validate and calibrate the application output with ArcMap. The work describes
    the application software layer that provides a friendly interface to the user
    but generates grayscale maps. A software system for multi-criteria LSA for different
    types of cultivating crops in tropical and subtropical regions was proposed by
    Elsheikh et al. (2013). It offers the ability to add a new type of crop by adding
    a new record to the crop records. It is built using GIS Model Builder, Python
    scripts, and Visual Basic and uses attribute tables and digital mapping with GIS
    capabilities to display the output upon which the decision-makers build their
    decisions. The outputs were validated by subjective comparison based on knowledge
    of whether the crop was already grown on the land assessed, and expert judgments
    were also consulted to validate the outputs. The research by Kang et al. (2012)
    addressed the use of IoT technologies for zone management delineation. It does
    not go beyond a conceptual model that specifies the possible architecture and
    usage of such a system. Postolache et al. (2023) found that there is no large-scale
    or commercially available IoT system for horticulture and then proposed an IoT-based
    system for soil fertility evaluation in horticultural farms to aid in detecting
    plant stress and improve irrigation and fertilization decision process which needs
    not only the current value of soil nutrient but the historical nutrient data.
    The sensing nodes sense some soil and climate parameters and use Wi-Fi or LoRa
    for communication. The sensed parameters are soil moisture, pH, and N, P, K, relative
    humidity, and temperature and it offers plug-and-play sensor extension. The system
    contains a mobile application used to visualize measurement data points, as well
    as graphs of the time change in parameter value. The sensibility of the sensors
    and the functionality of the system were tested. In Martis et al.’s (2022) study,
    machine learning enabled an IoT platform to predict a crop suitable for the Kharif
    and Rabi seasons for cultivation. The prediction model was trained with different
    datasets and used to perform time-invariant classification. The system also provides
    suggestions to enhance soil fertility. The system is composed of end device sense
    N, P, K, EC, and pH; a relay unit is used to collect and convey data in a prespecified
    frame format using MQTT, and the communication between devices is through Wi-Fi
    and LoRa; and an intelligence unit runs the machine-level algorithms as a service
    on Dual Intel Xeon. From the prediction results, a rule-based recommendation system
    was designed to specify the best soil treatment. Table 3 infers specific characteristics
    of these works compared to the proposed system. Table 3 Comparison between the
    proposed system and previous work Full size table Conclusion and future work This
    paper presents the development of a conceptual design of a dynamic system that
    accommodates the spatial–temporal dynamics of the agricultural soil characteristics
    to realize a land suitability assessment (LSA) based on the factor analysis method.
    The IoT-based LSA software system is built using other enabling technologies.
    It utilizes web development to augment the system with a user-friendly interface
    that can be opened by any browser from anywhere. The system uses the database
    technology to store the raw and processed field data. Furthermore, the system
    uses digital mapping toolboxes to manage the geographic information of the agricultural
    fields and the data layers of their sensed data. The paper reviewed the recent
    trends in the system-enabling technologies and the selection of the approaches
    that were used to design and implement the proposed system. A vanilla JavaScript
    front end with some libraries for providing some functionalities communicates
    with a Node.js back-end through HTTP methods and WebSocket communication. The
    Node.js application deploys modules for the web server, MQTT client, and server;
    it communicates with the devices deployed in the field using the MQTT protocol
    and communicates with the PostgreSQL database. The device tier of this IoT system
    contains “class A” LoRaWAN end devices that are deployed according to the soil
    sampling method used, with a LoRaWAN gateway serving a circular area of at least
    18,000 feddan through star-of-stars topology. The node contains a LoRa transceiver
    and four sensors to measure soil parameters N, P, K, S, WHC, D, PH, T, and F,
    and furthermore, it contains a GPS module to assign geospatial positioning information
    to the sensed data. Depending on the sensors integrated into the node, three types
    of nodes can be produced: the first one contains the soil NPK sensor that senses
    soil fertility parameters, the second one contains the tilt sensor and acoustic
    sensor that sense some soil physical properties, and the third one contains the
    soil nutrient sensor that senses some soil chemical and physical properties. These
    different types of nodes add the possibility of eliminating the involvement of
    some parameters in the analysis and reducing the cost of the solution. Message
    sequence charts, deployment, use case, activity diagrams, database schema, and
    topic tree are used to describe the static and dynamic views of the system design.
    The paper validates only the functionality of the selected technologies with a
    small-scale implementation example. Referring to the description of the proposed
    system, the discussed previous related work, and Table 3, it can be concluded
    that the proposed system is the only system that benefits from the IoT technology
    and offers the LSA together with spatial analysis and prescription map generation
    facilities at large-scale areas. The proposed work is the only work that augmented
    the system design description with a survey of possible implementation technologies
    before making selections based on criteria; the design is also augmented by reproducible
    standard visual modeling. The proposed system offers some additional functionality
    which can be described as a powerful precision agriculture software and not a
    dedicated program to perform specific functions. The sketched generalized IoT
    software development process for farm enterprises is also considered a contribution
    of this work. On the other hand, we find that the system has some shortcomings,
    such as not performing filtration or any preparation of the raw data first before
    storing and processing it. Regarding the system cost, the IoT technology in general
    is expensive, but what matters are the benefits resulting from its application
    and the payback period of each specific use case. The work in this paper is dedicated
    to the low-level software layer of the system use case and the selected technologies,
    and implemented functionalities have been validated. Other systems have calibrated
    the results with real data as they feature a complete system including an implementation
    of a web or mobile application. The application software layer of the proposed
    system is addressed in Mohammad EL-Basioni et al.’s (2022) study, where the system
    output is calibrated with real data. In summary, the work in this paper represents
    the specification of a low-level software layer of an IoT-based system for a use
    case not considered before and has advantages over similar previous work. The
    proposed design needs enhancements to represent channels for future work. It is
    better to provide different options for interpolation methods; it is better to
    provide different options for LSA methods; while maintaining the advantage of
    being able to set different crop criteria, it is necessary to support more than
    one crop at the same time; and a complete implementation of this generalized system
    with large-scale real experiments, accompanied by recording, analyzing, and discussing
    the results to assess the real impact of the system, needs to be addressed further.

    of a Low-cost IoT-Based Water Quality Monitoring System Chapter © 2023 Introduction
    One of the most important natural sources is water which is gifted to the human
    (Najah Ahmed et al. 2019). However, the water resources have been deteriorated
    and contaminated in increasing pace due to the advancements of community and considerable
    amount of people tasks. Earth’s surface is covered by 71% of water, whereas freshwater
    is just 2.5% where lakes and rivers contain only 0.3% (Musambachime 2005). Indeed,
    freshwater is finite source which influence surrounding environments involved
    in lakes, rivers and the goodness of food that is consumed (Yahya et al. 2019).
    Throughout human activities, for example waste or industrial pollution, the rivers’
    and lakes’ water could be dangerously contaminated (Madadi et al. 2015; Najah
    et al. 2011). Such activities could lead to death, or at least illness, of animals
    which consume, or live in, water (Najah et al. 2011). Moreover, this would influence
    of vegetation growth surround that specific area where it could additionally lead
    to harm the people throughout disease (Ighalo et al. 2021). In order to provide
    safety to our surrounding environment, it is highly required to monitor pollution
    level of water, air, etc. It is needed to purify the polluted elements once it
    surpasses the safety limits. As known, “Prevention is better than cure,” consequently
    it is needed to be alerted prior the pollution level surpasses the safety lines
    (Saha et al. 2017). For water pollution, it can occur anywhere and is rapidly
    expanding (Bird et al. 2019). The causes of water pollution are also numerous,
    including household waste, factory waste that uses chemicals, as well as waste
    from rubbish that is dumped carelessly into rivers. Based on reports from the
    Director-General of Environmental Control and Damage of the Ministry of Environment
    and Forestry (KLHK), as much as 68% water quality of river in 34 Indonesian provinces
    was greatly polluted throughout 2015 (Bank 2016). Indeed, at all times consumable
    water is the most needed element for all creatures, including human; thus, it
    is highly needed to overcome all the obstacles that it faces in real-time operation.
    Reasons behind these obstacles revolve around growing population, aging infrastructure,
    etc. Thus, it is necessary to proceed forward more advance approaches for water
    quality monitoring (Vijayakumar and Ramya 2015). Furthermore, for better quality
    of water monitoring, it is essential to identify every modification in the pattern
    of water quality variables from period to period in order to ensure its purity
    in real time (Das and Jain 2017). Quality of water is required to follow certain
    laws and terms which are needed to be consistently monitored (Chen et al. 2020).
    Hence, Internet of Things (IoT) enables modernistic approaches as well as probabilities
    to maintain the water quality (Alahi et al. 2018). Cheap gadgets which are linked
    together capable to be to functionalized in particular areas like rivers, lakes
    and close to the coastline or nearby the industry complexes (Khatri et al. 2018).
    IoT capable regularly keep track of water variables and by integrating all linked
    devices, it will create a system that will play an important role in alerting
    the authorities immediately once abnormal changes occur. IoT in the form of new
    intelligent system which is able to observe the quality of water in real time
    as well as provide clear interpretation of the data (Dupont et al. 2018). This
    approach is reliable, suitable and inexpensive technique to provide management
    of environment and mitigate human health cases (Maher 2018). Indeed, nowadays,
    almost all of approaches utilized in the favor of quality of water assurance include
    physical sampling and then via costly laboratory tests. The replacement is to
    automatically progress via cheap sensors implementation located in points and
    progress of the data which is collected. Therefore, a quality monitoring system
    of river water was created through adapting the IoT technology that can monitor
    quickly and efficiently. Manoharan and Rathinasabapathy (2018) have carried out
    an experimental research that has utilized Internet of Things and wireless sensor
    network for monitoring quality of water. This suggested approach possesses low
    power, low cost, scalable and long range for monitoring of quality of water using
    LoRa module. Cloete et al. (2016) proposed a monitoring system of water quality
    via utilizing of carb farming via IoT approach toward providing information to
    farmers to control reliable quality of water levels in the pond. This approach
    has contributed toward boosting the rate of crab survival and obtain greater soft
    shell crab yield (Niswar et al. 2018). Irawan et al. (2021) suggested a monitoring
    system for water quality for ponds of aquaculture that depends on the low-range
    internet of things (NB-IoT) approach. Yue et al. (1997) has used IoT for the real-time
    water quality monitoring integration which has provided a friendly user interface
    besides infographics as well as a simple approach to the communication with sensors
    and to configure the controllers. The Citarum River in the Bandung Basin of Java
    Island, Indonesia, is well-known around the world for its appalling pollution.
    The official Indonesian water quality control guidelines are exceeded by a variety
    of pollutants. Devices for water quality measurements can be expensive, particularly
    for those living in rural and remote communities. In additional to that these
    devices require regular maintenance and repair, which can be difficult in areas
    with limited access to trained personnel and spare parts. Therefore, there are
    needs to advance technique such as IoT monitoring systems which can be extremely
    beneficial to rural communities in terms of monitoring water quality. By providing
    real-time data on water quality, rural communities can take proactive steps to
    protect their water source and ensure it remains safe for drinking and other uses.
    Finally, by providing real-time data, rural communities can make better informed
    decisions about water management and conservation (Hartono et al. 2022; Manoharan
    and Rathinasabapathy 2018). Two parameters widely investigated by researchers,
    pH and turbidity of being more easily and affordably analyzed than microbiological
    parameters and can also be assessed using online equipment (Cloete et al. 2016).
    A study carried out by Irawan et al. (2021) developed monitoring system for measuring
    three parameters including pH and turbidity. Hence, for quality monitoring system
    to this river, it needs a sensor of water pH as well as a sensor of turbidity
    that are connected toward the microcontroller as the controller and is connected
    to a cloud service namely (Antares) to store data for displaying purpose on Android.
    Therefore, this study aims to create, by utilizing IoT, a device that is capable
    of measuring water quality parameters in the form of pH and turbidity on a regular
    basis to monitor water quality. Furthermore, the proposed device is created to
    be progressed continuously and quickly. The methodology of the proposed device
    is that LoRa is used to send all measurement and processing using an Arduiono
    Uno microcontroller which is combined in a printed circuit board (PCB). All measurement
    data are sent to Antares as a cloud service to store data and then display it
    on an Android-based smartphone. Then, the results of the proposed system will
    be compared with actual measurements in order to examine the reliability of the
    accuracy level that the proposed system has achieved. Internet of Things Internet
    of Things is a computational notion which describe wide-ranging linkage to the
    Internet, converting normal appliance to linked gadgets (Yue et al. 1997). The
    main cue lies beyond Internet of Things’ concept is hiring enormous number of
    smart devices that are able to sense the surrounding environment, transmit and
    process data that is collected, followed by comment on the environment (Sisinni
    et al. 2018). As illustrated by Gunturi et al. (2018) in Fig. 1, the IoT is a
    conceptualization in which specific items possess the capability to convey data
    to a network with no need for person-to-person interaction or from person-to-computer
    gadgets. The IoT has developed quickly from the wireless convergence technology,
    the Internet as well as micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS). According to Asthon
    (2010), IoT was first introduced by Suresh et al. (2018). The concept of IoT can
    be interpreted as an ability to expand the benefits of continuously connected
    internet connectivity. IoT has capabilities like sharing data, remote control,
    etc. All are connected to the network through embedded sensors and are always
    active (Suresh et al. 2018). Fig. 1 Concept of IoT Full size image Low-power wide
    area network LPWAN is representing a novelty of communication model, which would
    supplement old cellular as well as short-range wireless approaches in delivering
    variety of IoT applications’ needed specifications (Hernandez et al. 2017). LPWA
    technologies provide unparallel groups of characteristics involving wide-range
    area connection in low data and low power rate devices (Raza et al. 2017). It
    is a sort of wireless telecommunications network prepared for long distance that
    works on a machine to machine network coverage, with wider range, requirements
    of low power, as well as less development expenses of cellular networks, and LPWAN
    can become an IoT network backbone where each object can be connected and communicate
    without human intervention (Nurliyana Kafli 2017). Referring to Fig. 2, LPWAN
    capable of widely categorized into two categories called licensed LPWAN (such
    as 5G IoT, EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M-IoT, as well as NB-IoT), and free licenses or LPWAN
    which are not licensed (RPMA, LoRa, Telensa, and SigFox) (Augustin et al. 2016).
    Fig. 2 Range for wireless, power consumption, and data rate communication technology
    comparison Full size image LoRa (long range) is a modulation technique that allows
    the transfer of long-distance information using VHF/UHF radio frequencies (Khutsoane
    et al. 2017). LoRa was patented by Semtech (2019). The application of this LoRa
    varies from various fields, especially within the area of IoT, and LoRa is used
    in M2M (machine to machine) communication or is intended for use in “Long-lived
    battery-powered devices” (Kodali 2017). Referring to Fig. 3, LoRa architect network
    into three devices: Nodes or end devices, which act as data senders. Gateway,
    which acts as a successor to raw data sent from end devices using assistance from
    networks such as Ethernet, 3G, and 4G LTE. LoRa network server is a device where
    data sent over the LoRa network is stored. LoRa network server can be a personal
    web server, or a cloud server such as ThinSpeak. Fig. 3 LoRa architect network
    Full size image Antares is a brand under PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia that specifically
    operates on the IoT platform, and antares.id is a web that provides Internet of
    Things technology services to various applications that serve various types of
    consumers. The service is a cloud that can store data and can display the results
    of the parameter data that has been tested. Design system The utilization of Internet
    of Things (IoT) technology is highly needed to determine water pollution automatically
    and quickly due to water pollution impact on humans’ health and loss of material
    as well as the difficulty of human supervision. This study has developed a monitoring
    system for water quality which capable of providing water quality in a river utilizing
    the technology of Internet of Things utilizing communication of LPWAN LoRa. This
    targets to relieve boost awareness of public regarding the necessity of healthiness
    water quality. Indeed, water quality is beneficial when it is without the presence
    of microorganisms, tasteless and colorless (IRLANE MAIA DE OLIVEIRA 2017). According
    to Marselina et al. (2022), condition of river water is categorized based on water
    quality index: Excellent Quality of water meets every criterion to be utilized
    as a clean water source. Good Quality of water narrowly or rarely violates criteria
    to be used as a clean water source. Fair Quality of water sometimes violates criteria,
    perhaps via a huge margin, to be used as a clean water source. Bad Quality of
    water usually violates criteria to be used as a clean water source via a significant
    margin. Very bad Quality of water does not suit any of clean water source criteria.
    In Indonesia, nine factors are taken into consideration by the National Sanitation
    Foundation Water Quality Index (NSF WQI): turbidity, total solids, temperature,
    pH, DO, BOD, nitrate, total phosphorus, and fecal coliform (Marselina et al. 2022).
    In this study, two parameters were chosen (pH and turbidity). In addition to being
    more easily and affordably analyzed than microbiological parameters, these parameters
    can also be assessed using online equipment (Cloete et al. 2016). This study system,
    which is illustrated in Fig. 4, is developed utilizing a microcontroller called
    ATmega328P-AU which is linked with various sensors for capturing predetermined
    variables such as pH and turbidity air. ATmega328P-AU runs the controller; after
    that by utilizing the module of LPWAN LoRa communications, the measured data pass
    to the Antares cloud service from the sensor. To be possibly approved on an Android
    smartphone, the measured data shall be processed in the cloud database. Fig. 4
    Diagram of system block Full size image As described in Fig. 5, the proposed approach
    shall initiate, once linked to a source of voltage as well as linked to the initialization
    of internet connectivity. The sensor shall identify and capture the variable in
    which the outcomes of the reading data of the sensor shall be progressed utilizing
    a microcontroller. After that, the size of data shall be passed by LPWAN LoRa
    toward LoRa gateway that shall be kept within the Antares database. The reading
    data outcomes shall be kept in the cloud in which could be shown on Android smartphone.
    Fig. 5 System flowchart Full size image ATmega328P-AU It consists of an 8-bit
    CMOS low-power microcontroller relied upon the structure of RISC which empowers
    AVR via progressing robust tracking in one period. It reaches the outcomes of
    1 MIPS per MHz which the proposed technology needs an advancing in the consumption
    of power against increased speed. ATmega328P-AU an amalgamated circuit, besides
    its capability of a computer in a programmable chip, can manage peripherals such
    as LEDs, servos, motors and sensors (Cain and Cross 2018). LoRa RFM95 The long-range
    low-power transceiver model RFM95 possesses a spectrum communication spread which
    is an extremely long range. This is capable to achieve a longer distance from
    the conventional technique relied on FSK modulation. The RFM95 LoRa model has
    been widely utilized like the transceiver to receive as well as transmit signals
    (Dala and Arslan 2021). The model has the highest flexibility for consumers to
    identify on error correction rate (CR), spread spectrum modulation bandwidth (BW)
    and spreading factor (SF). RFM95 LoRa specifications are programmable bit speeds
    of up to 300 kbps, + 14 dBm PA high efficiency, high sensitivity − 111 to − 148
    dBm, effective bitrate 18–37.5 kbps, bandwidth 7.8–500 kHz, spread factors 6–12
    and 868/915 MHz frequency range. pH sensor The pH sensor (DFRobot Analog pH Meter)
    serves to measure acidity or basicity in the surrounding water. The pH functionality
    revolves around the alkalinity’s or acidity’s measurement of a solution. Its scale
    is ranged from 0 to 14, whereas 7 is a neutral point. Values higher than seven
    denotes an alkaline or basic solution; meanwhile, values lower than seven denotes
    an acidic solution (Fadel and Shujaa 2020). As stated in Table 1, the pH sensor
    specifications are the power supply 5 VDC, signal output analog, size 43° 22 mm,
    measurement range 0–14 pH, and accuracy 0.1 pH (25C). Table 1 Description of pH
    sensor Full size table Turbidity sensor Turbidity is a water cloudiness measurement.
    Turbidity is used to identify the degree where loses transparency of water occurs.
    Turbidity is categorized as a good water quality measurement (Parra et al. 2018).
    The turbidity sensor (DFRobot Analog Turbidity) serves to measure acidity or basicity
    in the medium of water. As stated in Table 2, the turbidity sensor specifications
    is power supply 5 VDC, signal output analog, size 38 × 28 mm, measurement range
    0–300 NTU, and accuracy 0.1 NTU. Table 2 Turbidity sensor’s specifications Full
    size table Wiring system Black box made of acrylic is chosen as the main material
    for making boxes and packaging of this tool. With the consideration that it is
    not easy to get wet and water does not quickly get into the black box, and also
    the price is quite affordable. Board, which is demonstrated in Fig. 6, utilizes
    a DFRobot analog pH sensor (pH) connected with an analog pin, and DFRobot analog
    turbidity sensor (Turbidity) is linked to an analog pin. Formerly, pH sensor and
    turbidity sensor should be calibrated to obtain reliable outputs in pH and turbidity
    levels. Fig. 6 Wiring sensor Full size image Software system design In this system,
    there are two water diagrams, namely the programming flow diagram on the microcontroller
    and android application design display from android. This is because the programming
    on the microcontroller is only limited to the data read via the sensor and followed
    by passing them toward the cloud, while the programming on the android is useful
    to get data from the cloud. Figure 7a describes the process of the android application.
    It describes the flowchart of the program embedded in the ATmega328-AU controller
    which works from initiation to sending sensor read data to the Antares cloud.
    The thing that needs to be done is to initialize the access point to connect to
    the internet and then determine the pin used. Then, the sensor data were uploaded
    to the cloud. Programming was done using Arduino IDE (Arduino pro or pro mini
    ATmega328P 3.3 MHz). Figure 7b describes how, after getting the data from the
    Antares cloud, the output is displayed in Android. Android programming has two
    programming languages, namely using Java as the main programming language to run
    the process of the application and XML as programming to create the design of
    the application display. Fig. 7 a Application flowchart process. b Android application
    design display Full size image LoRa Based on the Regulation of the Minister of
    Communication and Informatics of the Republic of Indonesia Number 1 of 2019 concerning
    the use of radio frequency spectrum, it is stipulated that for LPWA LoRa to operate
    at a frequency of 920–923 MHz, the maximum effective isotropic radiated power
    (EIRP) for the gateway and end node, respectively, 400mW and 100mW, and a maximum
    duty cycle of 1%. The duty cycle will limit the time interval for sending data.
    The channel occupation time for sending measurement data is about 100ms. When
    using a duty cycle of 1%, the permitted time interval for sending data is every
    10 s. When measuring river water quality, a short sampling period is optional.
    Measurement every 5 min is enough to monitor the condition of the river water
    in real time. So that each communication channel on LoRa will be able to serve
    3000 sensor nodes with reasonable media access control. However, in the case of
    measuring river water quality, the number of nodes needed to monitor the river
    as far as the gateway’s coverage radius of 5 km requires 50 nodes. So there is
    no need for special arrangements for access to communication media. Result and
    discussion The results of the quality monitoring system of river water, which
    are illustrated in Fig. 8, that have been carried out will be tested and analyzed.
    The test that is carried out serves to get the results of each system that has
    been designed and realized. The data obtained from the test results are then analyzed
    in order to determine the extent of the suitability of the system to the target.
    Testing is implemented to ensure the functionality of the system. Therefore, various
    tests were conducted. Fig. 8 River water quality monitoring system Full size image
    For pH sensor, testing aims to determine whether the sensor is working according
    to the expected standards or not. Tests are carried out to equalize the results
    of the measurement value on the pH meter (Orion pH/ISE meter) and the pH sensor.
    Throughout the testing process the accuracy of the pH sensor, first measuring
    the distilled water by the sensor and the pH meter to find out the difference
    between the sensor measurement and the pH meter in measuring distilled water.
    Furthermore, ten measurements are made via the sensor and one measurement via
    the pH meter with the specific fluid. The ten measurements’ results via the sensor
    are then averaged in order to be compared with the pH meter metric results to
    identify how much the percentage error is generated. Tests have been implemented
    thirty times. The data acquired from the water pH’s outcomes are utilizing DFRobot
    analog pH meters and Orion pH/ISE meters as illustrated in Fig. 9. Fig. 9 DFRobot
    analog pH meters and Orion pH/ISE meters sensor graph Full size image The highest
    values of pH achieved are 8.19, 8.18 and 8.18; meanwhile, the lowest pH values
    are 8.08, 8.05 and 8.19 in Buah Batu, Sukapura and Sukabirus, respectively. Furthermore,
    the average value of pH sensor is 8.12, 8.11 and 8.14 in which the percentage
    error occurred 0.61%, 0.37% and 0.25%. From Fig. 9, it could be shown which water
    pH measuring the value of the DFRobot Analog pH meter sensor is less than the
    value of the Orion pH/ISE meter measurement because of the average sensor error
    value is 0.27%. From the test results above, this sensor can function properly
    to observe quality of river water in real time, where the results obtained for
    the pH of water in the Citarum river still meet the requirements for clean water
    based on the Minister of Health Regulation Number: 416/MEN.KES/PER/IX/1990 because
    it is still between the maximum and minimum levels allowed (6, 5–9). From the
    results of sensor testing that has been done, it can be concluded that the sensor
    has responded to changes in the acidity level (pH) in the measured liquid as shown
    in Fig. 10. The average percentage of errors obtained is 0.27%. The percentage
    error is due to sensor sensitivity and ADC conversion. This level of error considers
    acceptable in comparison with previous study (Irawan et al. 2021). Fig. 10 Turbidity
    sensor testing graph Full size image For turbidity sensor testing, this test is
    performed to determine the level of accuracy of the sensor. The value generated
    by the sensor will then be compared with the value from the measuring instrument.
    The turbidity measuring instrument used is the Eutech TN-100. As for the samples
    tested are Aquades, river water Citarum in stone fruit, Sukapura, Sukabirus and
    Babakan Ciamis. In the process of testing the turbidity sensor, ten measurements
    are made via the sensor and one measurement via the turbidimeter for the self-same
    fluid. The ten measurements’ results via the sensor are then averaged in order
    to compare them with the measured values. Turbidimeter to find out what percentage
    of errors are created. The process of testing is implemented on 5 unsimilar fluids.
    Tests have been implemented thirty times. The data gained from the water turbidity’s
    outcomes utilizing DFRobot Analog Turbidity Meters and Eutech TN-100 as shown
    in Fig. 11. Fig. 11 DFRobot analog turbidity meters and Eutech TN-100 graph Full
    size image As for the results of the sensor accuracy test that has been carried
    out, it can be concluded that the sensor has responded to changes in the measured
    fluid turbidity level. When the turbidity in the water increases, the measurement
    made by the sensor increases as seen in Fig. 11. From Fig. 11, it is clearly shown
    which water turbidity measuring that the DFRobot analog turbidity meter sensor
    value is below the Eutech TN-100 measurement value due to the average sensor error
    value is 7.02% as illustrated in Fig. 12. Fig. 12 Turbidity sensor testing graph
    Full size image In order to test of consumption of power targets to identify the
    overall power required once the gadget is transmitting (sends data) as well as
    idle (static condition). Size of data relies on the pH sensors measurement results
    in which tests of turbidity implemented thirty times. The data are achieved from
    capturing gadgets linked toward power supplies of direct current (DC). Based on
    Fig. 13, by using 30 times of testing, the power amount obtained on every condition
    of transmission of data with a medium of 0.0788 A to transmit and 0.0213 A for
    idle. Power is a multiplication among voltage and current magnitude. Voltage consumption
    is utilized in gadgets of 3.3 V; after that, the overall power amount is obtained
    from every condition: from the table above, we can illustrate it with a graph
    as a result of the pH sensor response in real time. Fig. 13 Idle and transmit
    power consumption Full size image To observe quality of river water in real time,
    as shown in Fig. 14, the results obtained for water turbidity and pH in the Citarum
    river still meet the requirements for clean water based on the Minister of Health
    Regulation Number: 416/MEN.KES/PER/IX/1990 because it is still below the maximum
    allowable value (25 NTU) for turbidity and within the permissible maximum levels
    that considered between 6.5 and 9 for pH. Fig. 14 Real-time measurement Full size
    image Based on Table 3, the results of power consumption from 2 types of conditions
    are obtained. The average power consumption is in these two conditions; maximum
    power on idle conditions is 7095 mW and 26,004 mW on transmit conditions. The
    charger of the battery utilized presuming the capability of a 4500 mAh is stated
    in Table 4. Table 3 Results of power consumption Full size table Table 4 Battery
    charger Full size table With regard to delay and packet loss testing, testing
    data size, delay, and packet loss to the Antares cloud aims to determine the performance
    of the system when connected to the internet. Data size testing aims to determine
    the amount of data capacity measured on the sensor, delay to determine the speed
    status of the transmitted data, and packet loss to determine the condition of
    the total number of data packets lost during data transmission. Tests have been
    implemented thirty times within 5 min. Data gained from the sending data’s result
    toward a LoRa gateway where the results are plotted in Fig. 15. Fig. 15 Delay
    time to LoRa gateway Full size image As shown in Fig. 15, the average timing achieved
    is 7.1 s for the data sending delay toward Cloud Antares. The obtained results
    showed that the lowest frequency levels achieved is 920,100 MHz with 7 s of delay;
    meanwhile, the highest frequency is 921,500 MHz with 8 s of delay. Furthermore,
    the mean result is 920.960 MHz for the frequency and 129.2 bps for bandwidth of
    the passing data toward the LoRa gateway. Referring to Fig. 16, the mean outcome
    is 2.6 s for the delayed period which is computed for the data that are sent toward
    cloud service of Antares from LoRa gateway. Furthermore, it happens single time
    packet loss on testing to 7; this means that 7 data did not pass to the Antares;
    however, it is kept in the LoRa gateway. Node’s move will not affect power consumption
    because the transmission power is fixed according to regulations, while the delay
    in sending data from the node to the LoRa gateway is not much different for distances
    of 100 m to 5000 m, with results that can still be acceptable for water quality
    measurements. Fig. 16 Time delay from LoRa gateway to cloud Antares Full size
    image Therefore, it can be concluded through comparison of various technologies
    that LoRa is the most suitable for communication between the sensor nodes and
    the gateway (Simitha and Subodh Raj 2019). Hence, such system can be adopted as
    reliable tools for rural communities in monitoring the quality of water. Conclusion
    Due to the water pollution impact on humans’ health and loss of material as well
    as the difficulty of human supervision, the utilization of Internet of Things
    (IoT) technology is needed to determine water pollution automatically and quickly.
    Therefore, this research has proposed, with help of IoT technology, a tool which
    is capable of monitoring the water quality quickly and efficiently through the
    sensors of pH as well as sensors of turbidity. The sensors are linked to a microcontroller
    as a controller and connected to a cloud service, called Antares, to store data
    for displaying purpose on android. The outcomes of this research are summarized
    as follows: 1. The designed device has a fairly large level of accuracy of each
    sensor, namely the pH sensor of 99.73% and the turbidity sensor of 92.98%. 2.
    The overall consumption of power needed when transmission of data is 244.2 mW
    for minimum power and 260.04 mW for the highest power. 3. The sending data delay
    to the Antares cloud is comparatively short since it has an average timing period
    of 2.6 s. This is possible due to the adjustment of the system from Antares in
    the data processing process. 4. Referring to the outcomes of water quality testing
    parameters of Sungai Citarum, an average pH of 8.14 and turbidity of 11.15, so
    that Sungai Citarum still meets the requirements of clean water quality according
    to Regulation of the Minister of Health No: 416MEN.KES/PER/IX/1990, namely pH
    ranged from 6.5 to 9 and maximum turbidity 25 NTU. As the results of the proposed
    system are promising, it is highly recommended to utilize the proposed approach
    in further experimental research. Further work should examine the capability of
    this system, after necessary development, as flood mitigation tool by the utilization
    of the water discharge parameter. References Alahi MEE, Pereira-Ishak N, Mukhopadhyay

    and content Abstract In fog-based IoT systems, every fog can behave differently
    due to context and vulnerabilities. In smart irrigation systems, some fog nodes
    use more or fewer computing resources to analyze the data according to sensor
    location, soil moisture, plant species, or seasons. Therefore, fog behavior should
    consider distinct contexts. Federated learning support fog-based IoT systems to
    detect faster the behavior of fog nodes as it enables them to perceive previous
    behaviors from their peer nodes. We develop and assess an unsupervised federated
    learning system to identify fog anomalies. We consider experiments with seven
    rounds of four minutes, executing K-Means in every node to obtain local centroids,
    and the system merges them in the cloud to calculate global centroids, sending
    them back to the fog nodes. This paper evaluates the accuracy and time a fog node
    needs to predict a behavior already identified by another fog node. We assess
    the CPU usage and the time the cloud takes to compute global centroids using thousands
    of local cluster centers and measure the prediction time for different fog hardware.
    We observe that the cloud CPU usage and time to obtain the global centroids vary
    according to the number of fog nodes and the number of fog behaviors. Our results
    also show that, in the worst case, our system predicts a behavior by around 50
    ms. In contrast, a non-federated approach must wait for the current round to end,
    as 51.3 s in our results. Therefore, our approach shows promising results for

    Intelligent edgeFederated learningFog computingInternet of ThingsUnsupervised
    learning 1. Introduction Fog computing can reduce the volume of data transferred
    to the cloud and decrease the IoT system response time [1,2] as it is physically
    located near the end devices, like sensors and actuators [3]. Besides these advantages,
    fog nodes are vulnerable to attacks and anomalous behaviors [4], which is not
    feasible to monitor manually [5], due to their massive numbers and distinct performance
    behaviors during execution. Cook et al. [6] ratify that detecting anomalies using
    supervised learning algorithms may cause adversities because the system cannot
    perceive new unknown behaviors on the fly. The heterogeneity of fog nodes considers
    the diversity of hardware resources, security policies, data analysis duration,
    and demands CPU and RAM usage [28]. Therefore, each fog node may have different
    expected performance behaviors. Let us consider, for example, two fog nodes with
    the same hardware configurations, where the expected behavior of the first one
    is receiving 200 packets per minute and 60 % CPU usage, but the second one expects
    1000 packets per minute and 20 % CPU usage. Therefore, each fog node can have
    distinct and unlabeled anomalous behaviors, which makes it appropriate to use
    unsupervised learning [14] to detect new behaviors. Knowing every fog behavior
    is essential because the expected behavior can vary according to context features.
    For example, in a smart hospital, a fog node can demand more or less hardware
    and network resources to store and analyze data because the data analysis frequency
    and duration depend on attributes like the number of patients, seasonality, and
    specific sickness endemic peaks. The same happens in a smart irrigation system,
    where some fog nodes use more or fewer computing resources to analyze the data
    according to sensor location, soil moisture, plant species, or annual seasons.
    This paper proposes the FL-Means system that uses unsupervised federated learning
    [7] to streamline the detection of fog node performance behavior (where one behavior
    is a single data cluster). FL-Means addresses the fog node''s veracity challenge
    (detection of expected and unexpected performance behaviors), preliminarily introduced
    by the TW-IoT framework [9]. However, TW-IoT focuses on general concepts without
    proposing or evaluating fog behavior veracity. Here, we consider that the same
    IoT system can have many fog nodes demanding different levels of computing resources
    (behaving differently). Our system can detect every fog node''s expected and anomalous
    performance behaviors, regardless of context variations. Also, it perceives these
    behaviors faster because it uses federated learning. Our system executes an unsupervised
    learning K-Means algorithm [8,31] in every fog node to recognize its performance
    behaviors individually. It also transmits these behaviors as local cluster centroids
    to the cloud side, and the cloud calculates global centroids, sending them to
    all fog nodes. Therefore, all fog nodes use global centroids to identify behaviors
    that occurred previously in other fog nodes and can make accurate predictions.
    Our system also preserves data privacy among fog nodes and the cloud because it
    only transmits data centroids [10], improving the IoT data trustworthiness [9].
    We assess FL-Means in three scenarios, using simulated sensors: (1) agility: evaluate
    FL-Means against a non-federated baseline approach, simulating several behaviors
    in two fog nodes, (2) scalability: explore the system scalability by varying the
    number of fog nodes sending local centroids to the cloud, and (3) heterogeneity:
    analyze the heterogeneity using different fog node hardware to verify the sample
    prediction time, the time to compute local centroids, and the time to receive
    the global centroids. In Scenario 1, we observe two situations where FL-Means
    predicts the fog node behaviors from 1710 to 8043 times faster than the baseline
    approach. Our approach also shows that FL-Means presents higher prediction accuracy
    for these cases but has similar accuracy to the baseline for other situations.
    In Scenario 2, we perceive that the number of behaviors and fog nodes affects
    the CPU usage and time to compute global centroids. When we test 100 local centroids
    for 12 cluster centers, the cloud calculates the global centroids in 1.02 ± 0.01
    s, and for 1000 fog nodes, this computation took less than seven seconds. Finally,
    in Scenario 3, we observe that even in the worst case, using Jetson Nano CPU computation,
    the fog node obtains the local centroids in 2.46 ± 0.02 s, it receives the global
    centroids in 3.18 ± 0.15 s (considering 100 fog nodes), and executes sample predictions
    in 46.77 ± 0.41 ms. We also have evidence that the FL-Means system may support
    the cloud in monitoring all fog node behaviors because the cloud receives the
    behaviors'' centroids from every fog node, decreasing IoT management costs. This
    paper unfolds the sections as follows: Section 2 details the background, Section
    3 covers the related work, Section 4 explains our unsupervised federated learning
    system, Section 5 reports the used methodology, Section 6 reveals our results,
    Section 7 presents the discussion, and finally Section 8 presents the conclusions
    and future work. 2. Background This section clarifies concepts about IoT Stages,
    clustering (unsupervised learning), and federated learning. 2.1. IoT stages This
    paper considers a fog-based IoT system unfolding four computing stages, three
    (thing, mist, and fog) at the edge and a fourth stage at the cloud side. The thing
    stage [11] perceives a context by sensors and executes the system''s decisions
    using actuators. The mist stage [12] can pre-process data before transmitting
    it to the fog stage [3], which can perform system decisions, and may reduce network
    traffic between the edge and the cloud. The cloud stage [13] has more computing
    power than fog and can analyze historical data to improve and make robust decisions.
    2.2. Clustering Unsupervised machine learning, also known as clustering, can cluster
    data samples without prior knowledge of any data category [14,35]. Clustering
    algorithms identify similarities between data samples to generate clusters through
    different strategies, like data density or distance between samples. Consequently,
    these algorithms use the data to create a data model that represents the found
    clusters. Some clustering algorithms only group data samples but do not predict
    which group a new data sample belongs. The algorithms K-Means, Mean-Shift, and
    BIRCH do not have this prediction limitation, also, it is well-known that K-Means
    compute predictions faster than Mean-Shift and BIRCH [14,31,36]. K-Means also
    is faster than other algorithms, according to the results in [36], which evaluated
    data reduction based on machine learning algorithms for fog computing in agriculture.
    The K-Means algorithm begins by randomly defining values for K clusters centroids.
    After that, K-Means iteratively calculates the arithmetic mean distance between
    the centroid and the cluster data points, assigning the computed mean values to
    each K centroid until the data points stay in the same cluster. The Mean-Shift
    algorithm uses the density-based clustering strategy to iteratively search the
    centroids of regions with the highest data points density. Then, Mean-Shift assigns
    these regions as the final clusters. BIRCH is a hierarchical algorithm that builds
    a data tree with leaves corresponding to subclusters and has a threshold value
    that limits each subcluster radius. BIRCH also groups subclusters at the ending
    of execution to obtain a K number of clusters. For K-Means, we mandatory need
    to determine the number of K clusters to generate a data model. However, it is
    impossible to speculate the number of K that obtains the best model. Therefore,
    we can evaluate it by calculating a validation index like Calinski–Harabasz [15].
    The Calinski–Harabasz index can decide the optimal number of clusters, revealing
    the best clustering when the index reaches the highest possible value. 2.3. Federated
    learning Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique that
    enables a computing system to train models from decentralized data sources [7].
    In other words, the federated learning approach supports an IoT system to collaboratively
    join different information from distinct edge nodes, enhancing the system''s decisions.
    In IoT, for example, the cloud can create a global model by aggregating individual
    local models of edge nodes. Imteaj et al. [16] and Hosseinalipour et al. [17]
    describe an FL approach in which the edge nodes collect data, generate a local
    model, and send the local gradients to the cloud. When the cloud receives these
    gradients, it runs a federated averaging algorithm to create a global model and
    transmit the global model gradient to edge nodes [7,10]. In IoT, using federated
    learning can also preserve local data privacy because it does not require exposing
    raw data records through the network [10]. 3. Related work Cook et al. [6] expose
    the challenge of detecting anomalies in IoT systems, considering contextual information,
    prior knowledge, scalability, and resource constraints. They also suggest that
    using a classifier for anomaly detection may pose difficulties in perceiving unexplored
    anomalies. Li et al. [18] present a literature review for federated learning,
    and they mention that “existing FL frameworks construct based on supervised learning
    method.” Moreover, they mention federated training for unsupervised machine learning
    as a new research frontier. Sater and Hamza [19] present a federated learning
    approach called FSLSTM to detect sensor energy consumption anomalies in smart
    buildings. They tested the FSLSTM against deep learning models with three types
    of sensors and observed that their proposal presented higher accuracy for detecting
    these anomalies. Yadav et al. [20] propose a federated unsupervised deep learning
    approach. Their approach uses autoencoders to learn unlabeled data and generate
    its own feature set. They evaluate their proposal using a dataset named CICIDS
    without the data labels, obtaining an accuracy of 97.75 % after 100 training rounds.
    Servetnyk, Fung, and Han [21] present an unsupervised federated learning approach
    for unbalanced data that combines the weight computation strategy with an algorithm
    like K-Means. They artificially generate a dataset with 16 clusters and 50 data
    points per cluster. In experiments, they observed that their proposal clustered
    the data better than centralized K-Means, and their results only focused on measuring
    clustering performance metrics. Ahmad et al. [32] proposed a streaming anomaly
    detection algorithm named HTM and evaluated their approach against other techniques
    using a benchmark called NAB. In the evaluation, they mainly measured latency
    and the NAB score. The study considered sensor temporal noise anomalies but did
    not concern a fog-based scenario. Sivanathan et al. [33] categorized the behavior
    of different IoT devices and developed an unsupervised clustering method to identify
    each device''s normal network traffic behavior. The authors also considered retraining
    models for detecting behavior changes due to a firmware upgrade of devices and
    obtained 94.7 % accuracy. Kumar, Karthik, and Nair [22] present a federated K-Means
    clustering that uses K-Means models as local models and calculates the cluster''s
    centroids average in the cloud. The authors assessed their proposal using well-known
    MNIST and EMNIST datasets. However, the study only focused on measuring the model''s
    accuracy. They also do not consider the continuous changeability of the optimal
    number of clusters for every single edge node. Examining the related work, the
    authors do not consider an IoT scenario containing thousands of fog nodes with
    distinct expected behaviors that can individually change according to the seasonality
    (such as the period of the day, month, or season of the year). Therefore, the
    main contribution of this paper is to present a system that can iteratively identify
    new behaviors of fog nodes using a clustering approach to predict the expected
    behavior of individual nodes, also considering the temporal features for distinct
    contexts, like in a smart irrigation system, where some fog nodes use more or
    fewer computing resources to analyze the data according to sensor location, soil
    moisture, plant species, or annual seasons, for example. Our system can also select
    the best model and identify all the fog node behaviors, which may favor diagnosing
    future faults of each node behavior. 4. FL-means system In this paper, we propose
    a system named FL-Means [34] that uses unsupervised federated learning to discover
    new unlabeled fog node behaviors during system execution, also enabling a fog
    node to identify the other fog nodes’ behaviors. FL-Means has a component executing
    on fog nodes and another on the cloud side, respectively named Fog-FL and Cloud-FL
    (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3). Fog-FL and Cloud-FL only transmit clusters centroids
    between fog nodes and the cloud side. In other words, these components do not
    transfer raw data; thus, our system enhances data privacy because it does not
    expose any collected information. Download : Download high-res image (375KB) Download

    cloud-FL component. Fog-FL collects a dataset named workingDB (Figs. 1 and 2),
    which has data samples such as CPU and RAM usage (%), packet delay among sensors
    and fog node (in milliseconds), throughput (Kbps), and the number of packets arriving
    in fog node by every T seconds. Before loop1 execution (Fig. 1), we feed the WorkingDB
    with a few data samples to obtain the known behaviors. During loop1 running, the
    Fog-FL continues to collect these data samples, inserting them in another dataset
    named samplesDB. On the fog side (Fig. 1), the FL-Means system executes five steps
    iteratively: (i) it uses WorkingDB as input to train different K-Means data models
    by varying K values, and it utilizes the Calinski–Harabasz index to decide the
    best model to select (ii) it extracts the clusters centroids of the selected model
    and sends it to the cloud, (iii) it receives new global centroids from the cloud,
    (iv) predicts each sample behavior (cluster) calculating the Euclidean distance
    of these samples from the global centroids and decide if the sample behavior is
    anomalous or not (we consider the expected behavior as the cluster that has more
    data points occurrences in workingDB), and (v) it updates workingDB by inserting
    the data samples of samplesDB in workingDB, because, during Fog-FL execution,
    samplesDB may have new behaviors that are not already stored in workingDB. Additionally,
    the FL-Means system normalizes every input data sample before generating a model
    or predicting its clusters. The Fig. 2 example details the steps presented in
    Fig. 1 and the interaction between the model generated from workingDB and the
    samplesDB. In the Fig. 2 example, the system contains a model from workingDB with
    two known behaviors (A0 and A1). Initially, the system generates a local model
    from workingDB and receives the global model from the cloud. During loop2 execution
    (step 4), it predicts every sample (line) of samplesDB as A0 or A1 behavior. After
    round 1 (all steps''s first execution), the system creates a new workingDB (by
    joining it with samplesDB). In rounds 2 and 3, the system uses the new workingDB
    formed after rounds and repeats the steps mentioned in Fig. 1. However, after
    round 3, the new workingDB model learns a new behavior A2, and now the system
    can detect it when it occurs in any fog node. Therefore, the system joins the
    initial workingDB with the subsequents samplesDB because it can generate models
    from data that appeared during execution time. The system receives each fog''s
    local centroids on the cloud side (Fig. 3). It computes the Euclidean distance
    between every local centroid to verify if it is lower than a threshold value and,
    in turn, marks the centroids that obey this condition. After that, the cloud merges
    the marked centroids by calculating these centroids’ arithmetic mean, and then
    we obtain new centroids values, which refer to combining similar fog node clusters
    centroids. Then, FL-Mean obtains the global centroids being: all the centroids
    of the fog node clusters that Cloud-FL did not merge and the merged fog node centroids.
    Finally, it sends global centroids to all fog nodes. In Fig. 3, the word pass
    means that there is no action for the algorithm execute. 5. Methodology We explore
    three Scenarios: (1) FL-Means against a baseline approach (without global centroids),
    (2) system scalability with thousand local centroids, and (3) FL-Means heterogeneity,
    using different fog node hardware configurations. In the experiments, we use CrateDB
    [23] to support workingDB and samplesDB and run the SenSE simulator [24] to generate
    a dataflow of thousands of packets (which contains the timestamp of the packet
    creation time). We also employ a naïve Linux stress-ng tool to overload the fog
    node CPU and RAM. For Fog-FL (Fig. 1), we configure T = 5 s and i = 48, and for
    Cloud-FL (Fig. 3), we set the threshold value = 0.2. In the experiments, we also
    use the dataset collected by Fog-FL in reference [25]. In the experimental environment
    (Fig. 4), we include the four IoT stages (Section 2.1): SenSE represents the thing
    and mist stages, while Fog-FL and Cloud-FL play the role of the fog and cloud
    stages, respectively. For every scenario, we assess all the distinct time metrics
    with 30 replications, from which we calculate the arithmetic mean, the standard
    deviation, and the 95 % asymptotic confidence intervals. Download : Download high-res

    (for scenario 3, the fog runs SQLite3 [27] instead of CrateDB). Our simulated
    environment data flow (Fig. 4) is based on the real scenario developed for the
    SWAMP project [29,30], which developed an IoT smart water management system focused
    in high-precision smart irrigation. The project had four pilots: (i) MATOPIBA
    Pilot, in Luís Eduardo Magalhães - Brazil, (ii) Guaspari Pilot, in Espírito Santo
    do Pinhal - Brazil, (iii) Intercrop Pilot, Cartagena - Spain, and (iv) CBEC Pilot,
    San Michele/Fosdondo - Italy. In our experiment, we use time-driven sensors because
    we considered the environment for smart irrigation, as shown in [11]. Zyrianoff
    et al. [11] presented and evaluated a 5-layer IoT architecture with different
    configurations for smart agriculture and smart cities applications. In the investigation,
    the authors explained that real smart cities applications can use more event-driven
    sensors, in contrast to real smart agriculture applications that focus on time-driven
    sensors. 5.1. Scenario 1: accuracy and prediction time We use the Mosquitto MQTT
    Broker [26] to intercommunicate all IoT stages, and every stage runs on the Linux
    Ubuntu 18.04 operating system with an Intel Xeon E5620 processor with 2.4 GHz
    and 4 GB RAM. In Scenario 1, we compare our FL-Means system against a baseline
    approach, which is a system that only relies on the fog side. Therefore, the baseline
    does not include steps 2 and 3, mentioned in Fig. 1, without any federation learning
    technique. It also predicts samples (see step 4 of Fig. 1) using the naïve prediction
    method of the K-Means algorithm. 5.1.1. Performance behaviors for fog A We first
    simulate behavior A0 for 10 min and A1 for 20 min, and in subsequent rounds, execute
    behaviors A2 and A3 [25]. • A0: Null packet load (no network traffic). • A1: 1000
    packets per minute and CPU load by 70 %. • A2: 1500 packets per minute, CPU load
    by 100 %, and RAM by 50 %. • A3: 200 packets per minute and CPU load by 40 %.
    5.1.2. Performance behaviors for fog B We initially run behavior B0 for 10 min,
    B1 for 20 min, and B2 for 10 min. In subsequent rounds, execute behaviors B3,
    B4, and B5 [25]. • B0: similar to behavior A0. • B1: 500 packets per minute. •
    B2: 500 packets per minute and CPU load by 80 %. • B3: similar to behavior A1.
    • B4: similar to behavior A2. • B5: similar to behavior A3. 5.1.3. Timeline of
    behavior simulation We execute the experiments in 7 rounds (4 min each), using
    two fog nodes, Fog A and Fog B. As mentioned in Sections 5.1.1 and 5.1.2, before
    starting the experiments, the workingDB of Fog A has data records of behaviors

    2: scalability We explore Cloud-FL scalability considering Fog A and Fog B with
    the local centroids of rounds 1 and 7 (see Sections 5.1.1, 5.1.2, and Fig. 4).
    We also evaluate both fog nodes with 12 local centroids. Our experiments simulate
    fog nodes sending 2, 10, 100, 500, 1000, 5000, 10,000, 20,000, 30,000, and 40,000
    local centroids to the cloud (half Fog A and half Fog B). The cloud runs on Linux
    Ubuntu 18.04 operating system with an Intel Xeon E5620 processor with 2.4 GHz
    and 4 GB RAM. We consider three configurations: • Conf.1: Fog A uses two local
    centroids from round 1 (Sections 5.1.1 and 5.1.3), and Fog B uses three centroids
    from round 7 (Sections 5.1.2 and 5.1.3). • Conf.2: Fog A uses five local centroids,
    and Fog B uses six centroids from round 7. • Conf.3: Fog A uses 12 distinct clusters,
    and Fog B uses the same 12 centroids. 5.3. Scenario 3: heterogeneity We explore
    the FL-Means heterogeneity executing the Fog-FL component using different hardware
    devices. We assess Fog-FL in a Raspberry Pi 4, a Jetson Nano developer kit, and
    a personal computer (PC) with an Intel Core i7 processor. The cloud runs on the
    Linux Ubuntu 18.04 operating system with an Intel Xeon E5620 processor with 2.4
    GHz and 4 GB RAM. We consider three configurations for the fog node hardware:
    • Raspberry: Raspberry Pi 4 Computer Model B running Linux 20.04 operating system
    with Quad-core ARM A72, 1.5 GHz, and 4GB memory. • Jetson: Jetson Nano Developer
    Kit running Linux 20.04 operating system with a Quad-core ARM A57, 1.43 GHz, and
    4 GB memory. • PC: A physical personal computer using an Intel Core i7-5500U processor
    with 2.4 GHz, 8GB RAM, and running Linux 20.04 operating system. 5.4. Metrics
    In scenario 1, we analyze the following metrics: (i) the Calinski–Harabasz index
    for every round; (ii) the number of clusters (it suggests the number of groups
    that fit better according to the Calinski–Harabasz validation index); (iii) the
    confusion matrix (assesses the K-Means data model accuracy); (iv) Accuracy of
    predictions (we evaluate the FL-Means system against baseline); (v) Euclidean
    distance between centroids of Fog A and B behaviors to identify which behaviors
    are similar; (vi) Time BDF, as the time that a fog node needs to correctly predict
    behaviors already learned by other fog nodes (FL-Means against baseline); (vii)
    Time to predict a known behavior in a single sample, where we assess FL-Means
    against a baseline. In scenario 2, we analyze the following metrics: (i) time
    to compute the global centroids and (ii) CPU usage of the Cloud-FL component.
    In scenario 3, we evaluate the (i) Time-Local as the time to compute the local
    centroids, (ii) Time-Global as the time to compute local centers and receive the
    global centroids, considering that a fog node is the first of 100 fog nodes to
    send the local centroids and the last to receive, (iii) Time-Pred-Fog as the time
    to K-Means sample prediction in a fog node (without federated learning) and (iv)
    Time-Pred-FL as the time of sample prediction using the global centroids. 6. Results
    In this section, we reveal our experiment results. 6.1. Results of scenario 1
    Scenario 1 presents the results for individual fog nodes (A and B), and we report
    the results for the FL-Means system against the baseline approach (see Section
    5.1). 6.1.1. Results for each fog node individual behaviors Before each round,
    the Fog-FL component (Fig. 1) runs the Calinski–Harabasz validation to select
    the best clustering model, varying the number of clusters by two up to 10, where
    we obtained the results shown in Fig. 6, Fig. 7. After Fog-FL decides the number
    of clusters, we observe that it corresponds to the number of simulated behaviors
    for Fog A and B (as shown in Table 1 and Fig. 5), except for rounds 6 and 7 of
    Fog A. Download : Download high-res image (295KB) Download : Download full-size

    finds the exact number of simulated behaviors for all rounds of Fog B. For rounds
    6 and 7 of Fog A, the Calinski–Harabasz validation suggests four clusters (Section
    5.1.1) but also identifies one more behavior (A4). After analyzing the A4 data
    points, we perceive that the system correctly identifies this new behavior because
    the delay of its samples is twice the value of behavior A1 records. Therefore,
    considering 5 clusters for the models in the last two rounds of Fog A is valid.
    Then, in these rounds, Fog A correctly perceives behaviors A0, A1, A2, A3, and
    A4. We generate a confusion matrix for the last selected models of Fog A and Fog
    B (Fig. 8). The confusion matrix presents the main diagonal tending to approximately
    98 % accuracy for Fog A and 100 % accuracy for Fog B (on a scale of 0.0–1.0),
    where rows and columns symbolize the simulated behaviors and the found clusters.
    Therefore, we perceive that the models are appropriate when comparing the clusters
    with the simulated behaviors (including found behavior A4). Download : Download

    the baseline We observe that during single sample predictions in Fog A (Fig. 9),
    the FL-Means system and the baseline approach present an accuracy lower than 80
    % for round 3 and equal to 0 % for round 5. The system generates these results
    because it does not immediately recognize the new behaviors A2 during round 3
    and A3 during round 5 (see timeline in Fig. 5). Download : Download high-res image
    (261KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 9. Accuracy of predictions for
    fog A. We can observe that behavior A3 never happened before round 5, for Fog
    A or Fog B (see Fig. 5). Therefore, the both systems (federated and non-federated)
    cannot perceive A3 until round 5 finishes, when will be generated a model created
    by a new workingDB with characteristics of behavior A3 (as mentioned in explanation
    of Fig. 2). In Fog A, the correct prediction of these new behaviors will only
    happen when the next round starts; in other words when Fog A generates a new k-means
    model that includes these behaviors as new clusters (see Table 1). During round
    3, for example, Fog A only knows the behaviors A0 and A1 (and behaviors B0, B1,
    B2, and B3 of Fog B if using the FL-Means system). However, no fog node has identified
    A2 yet (see Fig. 5), and it needs to wait until the next round to recognize this
    behavior because A2 is unprecedented for the entire system. In round 5, for example,
    the accuracy is 0 % (Fig. 9) because A3 is the only simulated in this round (see
    Fig. 5). However, the system can identify this behavior in the subsequent round
    6 because, after round 5, Fog A generates new models containing the most recent
    samples and identifies new clusters. In rounds 1, 2, 6, and 7, we observe an accuracy
    of 100 % for both approaches. In round 4, the FL-Means system presented an accuracy
    of 93.8 % against 100 % for baseline. In Fog B, we observe that the baseline does
    not correctly predict the behaviors B4 during round 4 and B5 during round 6 but
    that the FL-Means system detects these behaviors correctly and reveals the most
    accurate prediction values for all assessed rounds (Fig. 10). Therefore, the FL-Means
    system is most advantageous than the baseline because, in rounds 4 and 6, it detects
    the behaviors B4 (identical to A2) and B5 (like A3) without the Fog B needing
    to wait for the next round (to generate a new data model). Therefore, the FL-Means
    system identified B4 and B5 correctly in Fog B because the system previously learned
    them as Fog A behaviors (see timeline in Fig. 5 and Table 1). Download : Download

    predictions for fog B. During round 4, the Fog B individually only knows 4 clusters:
    B0, B1, B2, and B3 (see Table 1), but using the FL-Means system, it also knows
    that the behavior B4 is similar to A2 because Fog A model already knows the three
    clusters: A0, A1, and A2 (see Table 1 and Fig. 5). Analyzing Table 2, we also
    observe that the FL-Means system merged the behaviors B4 and A2 because the Euclidean
    distance between their centroids is lower than 0.2 (our threshold value). Table

    the non-federated baseline approach presents a 0 % accuracy prediction during
    round 6 (Fig. 10) because we only simulate behavior B5 during this round. During
    round 2, even when Fog B uses FL-Means, it cannot identify the behavior B3 (identical
    to A1) because the Euclidean distance between B3 and A1 is higher than 0.2 (see
    Table 2). Therefore, in this case, FL-Means has an accuracy near the baseline
    approach (Fig. 10). The FL-Means system computes the Euclidean distances between
    similar behaviors above the threshold value for A1 and B3 until round 3 (Table
    2). However, in the following rounds, the distances of A1 and B3 decrease, and
    the system recognizes these behaviors as similar (Table 2). We also verify that
    FL-Means correctly recognizes and merges all other identical behaviors A0 and
    B0, A2 and B4, and A3 and B5 since their first occurrences because the distances
    between their centroids are lower than the threshold value (Table 2). The FL-Means
    system reveals an enormous gain considering the time BDF metric (Fig. 11) because
    it was 1710 times faster in round 4 and 8043 times faster in round 6 than the
    baseline approach, which needs to wait for the next round to identify the new
    behavior correctly. However, FL-Means and baseline are statistically tied in round
    2 because the distance between the behaviors A1 and B3 is not lower than 0.2 at
    this moment (see Table 2), and it needs to wait for the next round to detect the
    behavior B3 individually (see Table 1). In typical situations, we verify that
    both approaches present similar time costs to predict a known behavior in a single
    sample, around 30 ± 2 ms. Download : Download high-res image (175KB) Download

    of scenario 2 In Scenario 2, we analyze the system scalability, where we send
    two up to 40,000 local centroids to the Cloud-FL component. In our experiment,
    each local centroid refer to the number of fog nodes that send cluster centroids
    to Cloud-FL to generate global centroids (see Section 5.2). Fig. 12 shows that
    the time to compute global centroids for 100 fog nodes is, on average, 0.19 ±
    0.01, 0.35 ± 0.03, and 1.02 ± 0.01 s for Conf.1, Conf.2, and Conf.3, respectively.
    We also note that Conf.3 takes 6.82 ± 0.02 s for 1000 fog nodes, and Conf.3 takes
    31.08 ± 0.02 s with 5000 fog nodes to compute global centroids. Besides, these
    times present a correlation coefficient of 0.99996, 0.99991, and 0.99989 for Conf.1,
    Conf.2, and Conf.3, respectively. Download : Download high-res image (219KB) Download

    fog nodes expands (Fig. 13), with a correlation coefficient of 0.92724. Download

    explores the heterogeneity of fog nodes by using three different hardware configurations:
    Jetson, Raspberry, and PC (see Section 5.3). In this scenario, the fog node generates
    and selects one data model to extract the local centroids (Fig. 1.). For the Time-Local
    metric, we observe that the PC configuration takes 5.85 times lower than Jetson
    and 2.28 times lower than Raspberry (Fig. 14). Download : Download high-res image

    generate local centroids (Time-Local) and for the fog node to obtain global centroids
    with 100 fog nodes (Time-Global). We also measure the Time-Global metric, which
    consists of a fog node calculating local centroids, sending them to the cloud,
    and receiving the cloud centroids (after the cloud sends the same global centroids
    to another 99 fog nodes). Therefore, the time to obtain the global centroids (Time-Global)
    is formed by the time to compute local fog node centroids, the time for the cloud
    to calculate the global centroids, and the time to receive the centroids from
    the cloud. For the Time-Global, we perceive that PC presents the lowest values
    and that Raspberry takes 1.81 times lower than Jetson for this metric (Fig. 14).
    In Fig. 14, we also discovered that Raspberry demands less time to process local
    centroids than Jetson because the FL-Means code runs on a CPU of 1.43 GHz against
    1.5 GHz of Raspberry Pi 4. In Fig. 15, we note that Time-Pred-FL elapses faster
    for every hardware configuration than Time-Pred-Fog. For Time-Pred-Fog, we observe
    that the PC configuration demands, on average, 7.27 less time to predict a sample
    against the Jetson and 3.76 times less than the Raspberry. We also perceive that
    even using the Jetson configuration, the Time-Pred-FL takes less than 47 ms to
    decide a sample cluster. Download : Download high-res image (157KB) Download :

    7. Discussion Based on the results, we observed that FL-Means presents accuracy
    and time gains for predicting unknown fog node behaviors. In an IoT scenario where
    at least one fog node has already learned a new behavior, the FL-Means system
    saves other fog nodes time to predict the same behavior when it appears to them
    for the first time. We also highlight that our system can detect new fog node
    behaviors by continuously training local models with the appropriate number of
    behaviors because it uses Calinski–Harabasz validation every round. Scenario 1
    shows that FL-Means does not merge the behaviors A1 and B3 when B3 appears in
    round 2 because the distance between them is higher than 0.2. In round 3, Fog
    B already learns B3 but does not recognize B3 as the same as A1. The distances
    between B3 and A1 only reduce when the behavior B4 appears at the end of round
    4 because B4 has data samples with the highest RAM and CPU usage, changing the
    cluster centroid of B3. We observe that the threshold for behaviors A1 and B3
    is higher than 0.2 in rounds 1 and 2, delaying the system to perceive that behaviors
    A1 and B3 are similar. Also, supposing we set the threshold to 0.1, the FL-Means
    will not detect that behaviors A2 and B4 are similar. Therefore, it is essential
    to report that the threshold value impacts the prediction time and accuracy results.
    Scenario 2 evidences that the cloud side demands more CPU usage and time to compute
    global centroids when the number of fog nodes increases. Scenario 3 shows that
    FL-Means executed correctly for the three different fog node hardware tested.
    We advise using a cloud component to compute the global centroids for fog nodes
    with the same hardware. For example, one Cloud-FL should calculate data from Raspberry
    fog nodes, and the other should receive data from Jetson fog nodes. The FL-Means
    system enhances IoT trustworthiness by enabling every fog node to learn all other
    fog node behaviors faster without sending any local raw data, only transmitting
    the centroids of the clusters, preserving privacy. Also, the FL-Means system supports
    the cloud in monitoring all expected and anomalous fog node behaviors because
    the cloud always receives the behaviors'' centroids from fog nodes. 8. Conclusion
    This paper presents an unsupervised federated learning system (FL-Means). The
    FL-Means system enables a fog-based IoT application to recognize fog node behaviors
    faster when they have already occurred in different fog nodes. It can also detect
    new behaviors by grouping them in clusters using the K-Means algorithm. We assess
    the FL-Means in three Scenarios: (1) when it identifies each fog node behavior
    individually and against a baseline approach (without the federated learning technique),
    (2) testing scalability, and (3) exploring heterogeneity. In Scenario 1, we execute
    the experiments in seven rounds of four minutes each, using a cloud server and
    two fog nodes that we call A and B. The FL-Means system correctly clustered all
    simulated behaviors for both fog nodes individually. In Scenario 1, we evidence
    that using FL-Means, Fog B adequately predicts the unknown behaviors only Fog
    A previously knew. FL-Means reveal 95.8 % accuracy against 79.2 % of the baseline
    in round 4 and 100 % against 0 % of the baseline in round 6. In the same situation,
    the FL-Means system predicts the behaviors in Fog B faster in rounds 4 and 6 than
    in the baseline approach. Examining Scenarios 2 and 3, with 100 fog nodes, we
    observe that the fog node needs to generate the local model and that our federated
    system only requires milliseconds or at least one second more to calculate a global
    model. We also have evidence that predicting a sample behavior using federated
    learning is faster than not using it. Therefore, our approach shows promising
    results for time-critical IoT applications. A complete system to detect anomalies
    and network attacks can be built on top of FL-Means, but we focused on detecting
    performance anomalies related to context. In future work, we intend to reduce
    FL-Means time response and explore fog nodes with distinct kinds of datasets,
    including network attacks. CRediT authorship contribution statement Franklin Magalhães

    4.0. Keywords: Agriculture 4.0; Circular Economy; environmental sustainability;

    The increase in the world’s population in recent years and the forecast to reach
    9 billion by 2050 impact the need to increase food productivity [1] using the
    same agricultural areas, with reduced costs and less environmental impact. Factors
    such as extreme weather events, more demanding consumers, population concentrated
    in urban centers, and scarce natural resources are the major challenges to be
    faced [2]. In this context, some technologies of Industry 4.0 implemented in agriculture
    in recent years have generated impacts in several regions with climate change,
    scarcity of drinking water, and soil degradation, and in this context, some Industry
    4.0 technologies [3] can contribute to the management of inputs for planting and
    harvesting, the optimization of soil [4], water, and fertilizer use [5], an increase
    in productivity and food quality, and a decrease in environmental impacts [6]
    with the replacement of fossil energy sources by bio-renewable ones [7]. The digital
    revolution has had a great impact on development in several areas [8,9,10,11],
    and in agriculture [12], water use management projects [5] with controlled irrigation
    [6], use of soil parameter sensors [13] with nutrient application [14], and real-time
    monitoring [15] of increasingly unfavorable weather conditions in many regions
    [16] are options for smart agriculture [17]. The digitalization of agriculture
    [18] with the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies [19] has the potential to
    expand productivity, better control the product life cycle, aid cooperation in
    the production chain [20], reduce environmental impacts, improve food safety with
    reduced food waste [21], and increase the sustainable use of natural resources
    [22,23], and resilience to supply in times of scarcity [24]. The collection of
    large volumes of on-farm data [17,25], indicating weather and planting conditions
    [26], more detailed knowledge about planting and harvesting [27], and decreased
    waste [28], makes processes more controlled [17,25] and serves to support farmers
    in data-driven decision-making processes [21,29,30]. Integrating smallholder farmers
    into innovative trends [31] contributes to keeping young people in the countryside
    with rural tourism and social entrepreneurship activities, diversifying household
    income [32]. Additionally, various technological solutions are still restricted
    to large agricultural conglomerates and are more focused on profit than on food
    security and social context [33]. The Agriculture 4.0 revolution is an opportunity
    for farmers to meet the challenges in food production and enable the creation
    of added value by combining innovative technologies: precision agriculture, information
    and communication technology, robotics, and Big Data [34]. The increase in food
    production and, consequently, the consumption of natural resources, combined with
    other industrial activities, have increasingly affected environmental, social,
    and economic conditions [35]. Thus, the concept of the Circular Economy, with
    examples in China in the 1990s, in the use of natural resources [36], presents
    a change in the form of business and can contribute to the sustainable development
    of society [37]. The objectives of the Circular Economy are to reuse materials
    through recycling processes [38] and with the principles of conservation of natural
    resources, balancing consumption between renewable and non-renewable resources,
    with a longer lifetime of resource use and a reduction in the negative effects
    of productive systems [39]. These are important factors that can be applied with
    the new technologies of Industry 4.0 in precision agriculture to generate environmental,
    economic, and social balance. A few studies have explored various technologies
    in agriculture, but none have addressed an Integrated Service Architecture or
    its role in promoting the Circular Economy by illustrating how these technologies
    interact and collaborate. Moreover, the implementation of technologies was limited
    to an automation process such as irrigation control, fertilizer control, or even
    the storage of harvest variables and provision of some computerized support for
    farmers. Considering the great demand for food production, food safety, innovations,
    and new technologies to evaluate and minimize environmental and social impacts,
    no studies were found that can provide information to farmers about farm management,
    natural resource use needs, plantation and harvest data, and support for strategic
    or operational decision making. Based on the findings, this research aims to propose
    a Service Architecture that integrates Industry 4.0 technologies with the Circular
    Economy principles to promote sustainable development in agriculture. The paper
    provides a structured examination beginning with an introduction, followed by
    a detailed methodology in Section 2, an exploration of the Service Architecture
    for smart agriculture in Section 3, and ending with comprehensive conclusions
    in Section 4. 2. Methodology The study employed a systematic literature review
    to select and analyze scientific research on Industry 4.0 technologies applied
    in agriculture and their associated environmental, economic, and social gains.
    Bibliometrics enabled the identification of diverse publications, along with the
    use of quantitative and graphical data [40] and a systematic literature review
    to develop content analysis, coding, and categorization of data [41]. The systematic
    review applied in this research is characterized as a scientific, replicable,
    and transparent method [42]. Data verification was performed by two researchers
    to reduce researcher error and bias [43], by filtering the selected research [44]
    through systematic reviews and analyses with the adoption of inclusion and exclusion
    criteria [45]. The initial stage of planning the systematic literature review
    involved the definition of the research protocol, which included the search strategies,
    selection criteria, and analysis of the selected articles. For this study, the
    research objective was to propose a Service Architecture that enables the promotion
    of a Circular Economy in Agriculture 4.0. The next step was the definition of
    the search terms and a consistent scientific procedure, including the definition
    of a set of keywords referring to Industry 4.0-enabling technologies. They were
    created as shown in Table A1, and with the use of logical operators OR and AND,
    the search strings were built in the Scopus digital library, as presented in Table
    A2. For the information collection step, the authors utilized the Scopus database
    chosen for its technical and scientific content, as well as content from areas
    related to the objectives of this article. A total of 1425 articles were identified,
    and these will be comprehensively detailed in the Bibliometrics section (Section
    3.1). In Table A3, the inclusion and exclusion criteria utilized in the systematic
    literature review are presented. A systematic literature review was undertaken,
    revealing a total of 755 articles. From this pool, 271 articles underwent thorough
    content analysis, leading to the identification of 114 articles specifically addressing
    the application of Industry 4.0 technologies in agriculture, as illustrated in
    Table 1. Table 1. Industry 4.0 technologies used in farms, production, and supply
    chain in the food agriculture sector. 1 = Farm; 2 = Factory; 3 = Supply Chain;
    4 = Big Data. 3. Service Architecture for Smart Agriculture In this section, the
    bibliometric review and the proposed Service Architecture for smart agriculture
    will be presented. 3.1. Bibliometrics The initial search using the specified strings
    (refer to Table A1) resulted in a total of 1425 articles, categorized into various
    types, as outlined in Table A4. Figure 1 shows the number of studies classified
    by year. It is notable that there is a growing interest in the adoption of Industry
    4.0 technologies in agriculture. This interest is influenced by factors such as
    the increase in the world population and the necessity to produce higher-quality
    food, enhance productivity per hectare, and ensure sustainability throughout the
    agricultural chain. Figure 1. Distribution of selected articles published by year.
    The utilization of IoT on farms, as the most widely adopted technology, involves
    the incorporation of sensors and devices for measuring soil and environmental
    characteristics. Subsequently, the adoption of IoT technologies, the cloud, Big
    Data, and AI (artificial intelligence) [78] signifies that farms not only monitor
    soil and environmental data but also store them in cloud services. With the utilization
    of tools such as artificial intelligence within the Big Data ecosystem, they can
    already add value in business management and decision-making processes. Another
    crucial aspect is the integration of IoT and AI within a context where computing
    is transitioning to the edge, involving microcontrolled systems and artificial
    intelligence algorithms. This transition contributes to reducing latency in communication
    networks [86]. 3.2. Proposed Architecture Following the findings of the systematic
    literature review (Section 2), the articles were analyzed and evaluated based
    on their contribution to constructing a layered structure. This structure facilitates
    the organized placement and integration of technologies. Figure 2 illustrates
    the proposed architecture developed to promote a Circular Economy in Agriculture
    4.0. Figure 2. Proposed architecture. The architecture depicted in Figure 2 consists
    of sensors, connections between farm machinery, local and remote networks (via
    the Internet), cloud platforms, storage utilizing Big Data technologies, and computer
    systems operating both in the cloud and in computer centers. The information generated
    by expert systems, data analysis, and the utilization of artificial intelligence
    provides outputs in the form of dashboards, directs actions on connected equipment,
    and facilitates decision making, both at the strategic and operational levels.
    This architecture comprises three layers: the “Farm Scenery” data collection layer,
    the ”Cloud Storage” data collection layer, and the “Information Processing, Analysis,
    and Output” central processing layer responsible for processing and outputting
    information for decision making: “Farm Scenery” layer: Precision agriculture is
    conducted here through the application of Industry 4.0 technologies. This involves
    sensors for the automated real-time collection of agricultural data, including
    water consumption, land use, and other input variables. The sensors and machines
    are interconnected through wireless networks in an IoT system. “Cloud Storage”
    layer: Data collected via wireless sensor networks, positioned at various points
    in the plantation, are transmitted to the cloud. This process is facilitated by
    a gateway, which serves to convert communication technologies from the sensor
    network into Internet access technologies. “Information Processing, Analysis,
    and Output” layer: The received data undergo analysis using computational tools,
    and the resulting information is utilized for decision making, both at the control
    center level and within the farm itself. Information visualization is made accessible
    through graphic panels on local computers or mobile devices, printed reports,
    and commands for direct action on devices installed on the farm, thereby enabling
    some processes to be fully automated. The architecture will be elaborated by organizing
    the findings of the systematic literature review obtained from digital databases
    into the three layers of the proposed structure. 3.2.1. Farm Scenery Layer Data
    digitization in agriculture begins with identifying the variables to be controlled
    when planting on farms [84], such as temperature, moisture, and soil nutrients,
    as well as weather conditions such as humidity, air temperature, light, crop nutrients
    [76], and pest control [121]. IoT enables this through sensors installed at various
    points on the farm, exchanging information between electronic devices [113] and
    applied in agriculture to provide monitoring of weather, soil thermal conditions
    [81], and water [29,30], pest and disease detection [103], and product traceability
    [101]. Industry 4.0 technologies applied to agriculture enable real-time data
    collection, input management, soil control, disease prevention, increased production,
    optimizing resources, and generating income [114]. The use of drones with IoT
    sensors is already a possibility for data collection in scenarios where the installation
    of sensor networks is not possible [91]. Temperature affects crop growth and the
    breeding of bacteria, and through a system of collecting air and soil temperature
    and humidity, a mathematical model was developed that evaluates environmental
    conditions and compares them with established standards, generating alerts for
    decision making by farmers [126]. The need to reduce the use of natural resources
    such as water and fertilizers in agriculture, the treatment of waste generated
    in planting, harvesting, and food industry processing activities, and the increase
    in production [14] have been the driver for the deployment of Industry 4.0 technologies
    in agriculture [117]. The analysis of climate conditions for agriculture is based
    on three factors: resource management, ecosystem conservation [114], and adequate
    services to farmers using information technology, thus generating profitability,
    product quality, and reducing the environmental footprint, with less use of pesticides
    [90]. Crop irrigation uses a source of water that is transported through pipelines
    and with on-and-off actuating devices and valves that then control the flow of
    water. The amount of water depends on each crop, and several forms of irrigation
    can be used, such as drip, sprinkler, furrow, and manual [127]. A simulation of
    irrigation control applied on farms in Brazil, with the use of IoT technologies,
    is a model considering the parameters of water requirements and irrigation time,
    which directly affect water use efficiency and evapotranspiration [30]. On the
    other hand, a low-cost system with environmental data acquisition can provide
    measurements of air temperature and velocity, soil temperature, pH, and dissolved
    oxygen, and thus control plant growth and environmental impacts [26]. A potato
    production system in Cyprus [114] was developed by using a sensor network to collect
    air and soil characteristics, and the data were sent to the cloud, where they
    were stored and analyzed, thus providing services to farmers for pest control
    and commands for automatic irrigation and fertilization [95]. Climate change has
    a strong impact on agriculture, and parameters such as water scarcity, soil degradation,
    increased energy needs, population growth, and increased demand for food impact
    the search for solutions [114]. For instance, the construction of smart greenhouses
    makes it possible to manage environmental variables [113] with control of humidity,
    air quantity, temperature, and favorable characteristics for plants [28,111] using
    models to manage heating, ventilation, CO2 control, and artificial lighting in
    an infrastructure that contributes to precision, sustainable, and manageable agriculture
    [113]. The data collected by the various sensors dispersed throughout the crops
    need to be sent for storage and analysis to extract information that can assist
    in decision making and return automated commands for control, since the Internet
    is not yet fully available in agricultural areas. It becomes necessary to use
    wireless network technologies in agriculture digitization projects, collecting
    data from distributed sensors in the field [4,84]. Applications with wireless
    sensor networks in smart agriculture include covering large areas with interconnecting
    sensors [6] and gathering large amounts of data. Activities in agriculture have
    integrated IoT technologies in robotic systems and been applied in planting, harvesting,
    and food production to enable cooperation between workers and smart systems and
    information sharing in the food production chain [107]. A proposed innovative
    smart IoT-based system based on microprocessors and a Single-Board Computer (BSC)
    for data logging using various sensors [50] can monitor soil moisture, air humidity,
    air temperature, and UV light, supporting precision irrigation of crops and enabling
    real-time exploitation of data for minimization of errors, as well as forecasting.
    In Colombia, on a coffee farm, wireless sensor networks are used to collect leaf
    condition data remotely through image analysis processing, detect diseases on
    the plantation [94], and generate information for pesticide application. This
    strategy decreases the risks of crop loss and improves the productive performance
    of the farm [112]. Automated fertigation [109] is applied in precision agriculture
    by collecting data on moisture and soil characteristics, and through an IoT system
    and sensor networks with ZigBee technology, the system was developed to control
    fertilizer use and reduce water consumption [14], thus providing reduced environmental
    impacts [95]. The growth of the number of sensors scattered in agriculture can
    generate a large amount of data, and latency problems may occur in sending data
    through technologies such as Bluetooth in relevant virtual network scenarios [75].
    Applications using machine learning [93] with a prototype for acquiring data from
    multiple sensors, machine learning algorithms, Geo statistics, and localization
    of IoT devices [115] are examples. The case study using computer vision [94] and
    machine learning [27] for inspecting coffee leaves on a farm in Colombia is an
    important practical example. The use of tractors in agriculture [3] plays an important
    role in farms and [98] modern combustion systems with electronic systems, including
    the use of algorithms and artificial intelligence [78], managing fuel injection,
    reducing pollutant emissions, lowering fuel costs [5], and improving environmental
    and economic gains. Tractors equipped with GPS (Global Positioning System), through
    the CAN-BUS (Controller Area Network) protocol, transmit the data of tasks performed
    and, after analysis, evaluate the most appropriate use of the tractor, extending
    the useful life and reducing maintenance costs [87]. In research conducted in
    Brazil, agricultural machines equipped with automation technologies have proven
    very productive in sowing, spraying, fertilizing, and harvesting activities, doing
    so autonomously, with relevant economic gains and lower cost per hectare [3].
    An automatic irrigation control system using IoT, with data input from weather
    stations and soil moisture sensors interconnected by gateway LoRa (Long Range)
    networks and command messages sent by the MQTT protocol (Message Queuing Telemetry
    Transport) [6], adapts the efficient use of water on a plantation, generating
    savings and better product quality [8]. It is important to note that using advanced
    technologies such as IoT and AI to manage irrigation is a way to maximize crop
    yield while minimizing water consumption, in line with Agriculture 4.0 principles
    [51]. Nonetheless, intelligent sensing systems based on the edge-computing paradigm
    are essential for the implementation of Internet of Things (IoT) and Agriculture
    4.0 applications, and the development of edge-computing wireless sensing systems
    is required to improve sensor accuracy in soil and data interpretation [47]. The
    Farm Scenery layer is presented in Figure 3, and the environmental variables to
    be collected are environmental humidity, temperature, luminosity, temperature,
    pH, water flow, and soil parameters, as shown in Table 2. Figure 3. Farm Scenery
    layer of Integrated Service Architecture to promote Circular Economy in Agriculture
    4.0. Green Circle = Start Process, Red Circle = End Process, Dotted Line = Comments,
    Flat Line = Information Flow. Table 2. Input variables used for soil monitoring
    and irrigation. 3.2.2. Cloud Storage Layer The data collected through wireless
    sensor networks, installed at various points of the plantation, are sent to the
    cloud with the use of a gateway, which is equipment that converts communication
    technologies of the sensor network to Internet access technologies, such as networks
    with LoRa technology [79]. Smart horticulture incorporates a variety of technologies,
    devices, protocols, and computational models to enhance farming processes. Blockchain,
    Big Data, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and edge processing provide
    capabilities and solutions for storing, analyzing, and managing the vast data
    generated by components [74]. The data collected from sensors on the farm and
    sent for storage in a cloud environment (Figure 4) are transformed into information
    that will be used for decision making in agricultural management actions. Thus,
    autonomous systems of irrigation control and fertilizer application can be built,
    contributing to the economy of financial resources for the purchase of these inputs;
    environmental gains, with a reduction in the use of scarce resources in nature
    and in workers’ exposure to some of these products, are obtained, along with social
    gains, such as a reduction in diseases, accidents, and sick leave [102]. Figure

    Economy in Agriculture 4.0. Dotted Line = Comments, Flat Line = Information Flow.
    With an architecture for monitoring variables of the air, soil, planting, and
    harvesting in a corn plantation and using sensors interconnected in wireless networks
    and communication gateways, the data are sent for cloud storage to allow its analysis
    [16]. 3.2.3. Information Processing, Analysis, and Output Layer After the stage
    of data analysis using computational tools and the extraction of information,
    the next stage is the output, with the visualization of information through graphical
    panels available on web pages or mobile devices such as smartphones, printed reports,
    and commands of action in devices installed on the farm, making some processes
    automated. The use of software for agricultural planning provides management of
    farms, the production chain, and the distribution of the food produced [121].
    The monitoring of environmental variables is context-sensitive and provides information
    to end-users such as farmers, agronomists, and traders for decision making and
    supporting agricultural production [16]. Machine learning plays an important role
    in data processing, collection, extraction, and mining activities using algorithms,
    neural networks, and artificial intelligence, which are applied in a variety of
    areas, such as energy, transportation, mining, shipping, healthcare, banking,
    security, and agriculture. Security requirements using machine learning in industrial
    systems [97], which analyze Blockchain-based strategies to preserve privacy in
    industrial systems with data security in sensors [19], can lead to product traceability
    and automated logistics management, saving time and financial resources [108]
    and decreasing food waste [88]. The application of machine learning and analysis
    techniques in agriculture and livestock provides productivity gains with the management
    of animal health and flock management, thereby improving land use, controlling
    animal nutrition, and reducing the environmental impacts generated [96]. The use
    of technologies in data processing in agriculture offers opportunities for the
    integration of diverse systems. A review of the technology standards used in cyber-physical
    systems (CPSs) [125] applied in advanced manufacturing builds the ontology of
    the 5C architecture layers (connection, conversion, computation, cognition, and
    configuration), thus enabling the integration of sensors, actuators, and protocols
    and their application in various areas. In agriculture, CPSs are used in planting
    and harvesting equipment, collecting information on soil conditions and water
    resources, and storage in cloud systems for further processing [107]. The use
    of IoT platforms with microservices involves independent processes acting on specific
    activities, such as, for example, data collection of soil, climate, and parameters
    of irrigated rice and cotton crops [110]. The platform involves hardware and software
    in the cloud, and focuses on irrigation management, presented scalability, flexibility,
    robustness, security, and performance, with possibilities of commercial applications
    in other agricultural crops. An infrastructure using low-cost IoT and free software
    code to monitor weather conditions in organic crops, in a greenhouse, automatically
    controls and generates information made available through graphs on web pages
    with HTML protocol (HyperText Markup Language) [28]. The organization of farms
    by management zones [109] reduces costs for fertilization, pesticides [82,83],
    and water, and with the agricultural records of each one, one can have a decision
    more suitable to the needs of the crop. This strategy applied in a vineyard in
    Spain allows the crops to be classified into three levels of interest: soil, plant,
    or product, thus creating a map with overlapping layers to determine wine quality
    [25]. Sugarcane is planted in several fields on a farm, and as the plantation
    matures, fields are selected for harvesting, which is called harvest windows.
    A model to guide planting and harvesting on farms in South Africa [122] caused
    increased productivity and optimization based on historical data collected when
    adjusted in real-time. A machine routing system is possible in sugar production
    using sensors and IoT techniques, replacing labor and providig more suitable routing,
    higher repeatability, decreased fuel consumption, and better process control,
    with economic and environmental gains [116]. The management of agricultural supply
    chain activities, with the adoption of ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems
    and BI (Business Intelligence) techniques, enables communication between those
    involved in the agricultural chain [105], more adequate control, faster solutions
    [7,104] to respond to climate variations, pest control, crop harvesting and management,
    and market trends [118]. Ref. [121] presents studies among farmers in Maranhão,
    Piauí, Tocantins, and western Bahia, in soybean, corn, cotton, coffee, sugarcane,
    beans, and fruit crops where production and marketing integration, material flow
    automation, data management, and more accurate diagnostics to support strategic
    decisions have been adopted as tools of smart farm managers. The presentation
    of information in graphical dashboards becomes a decision support tool for farmers,
    with the use of Internet environments and mobile devices making access much easier
    and more intuitive [7,28]. The Information Processing, Analysis, and Output layer
    is shown in the Figure 5. Figure 5. Information Processing, Analysis, and Output
    layer of the Integrated Service Architecture to promote Circular Economy in Agriculture
    4.0. Red Circle = End Process, Dotted Line = Comments, Flat Line = Information
    Flow. 3.2.4. Service Architecture for Smart Agriculture The substantial volume
    of data generated through the utilization of IoT in agriculture is stored via
    networks and cloud computing. Leveraging Big Data and analytics strategies, it
    facilitates enhanced production by aiding decisions concerning planting, harvesting,
    and production, and automatically issuing commands for irrigation, thereby saving
    the scarce resource of water [5]. A system facilitating the collection of crop
    data, including air temperature, humidity, and soil temperature, stored as input
    variables in the cloud, has undergone analysis to derive actionable insights for
    controlling corn crop cultivation [16]. Utilizing a wireless network architecture
    to connect sensors and a LoRa communication gateway for data transmission to the
    cloud, the subsequent step involves data analysis and extraction of information
    for decision making. This process also includes sending commands to regulate irrigation
    valves, fertilizing devices, lighting control, and heating/cooling systems, embodying
    an autonomous application [16]. A prototype for autonomous irrigation, developed
    and deployed in a farmer cooperative in Spain, gathers data on air temperature,
    humidity, and soil characteristics. These data are transmitted via a LoRa network
    with a coverage range of 5 km to a cloud server. Subsequent analysis returns commands
    for irrigation control, while mobile applications provide information to farmers
    [100]. In Indonesia, image processing using machine learning algorithms was applied
    on a cocoa farm. Texture data of the beans, collected remotely and transmitted
    to the cloud, underwent classification using artificial intelligence techniques,
    demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional visualization methods
    [106]. The processing of vast sensor-generated data on farms is routed to the
    cloud [114,119]. Leveraging Big Data tools [85,117], these data are analyzed and
    converted into actionable information for managerial decision making and issuing
    automation commands for field equipment. A decision support system incorporating
    AI and a suite of machine learning algorithms aids in enhancing overall crop harvest
    quality and accuracy in precision agriculture [52]. This research utilized a dataset
    downloaded from Kaggle, containing eight features with seven independent variables,
    including N, P, K, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall. Furthermore, optimization
    techniques were employed to further enhance performance in smart factories. Figure
    6 illustrates the complete design of the Integrated Service Architecture derived
    from the results of the systematic literature review of selected articles, aimed
    at promoting the Circular Economy in Agriculture 4.0. Figure 6. Operational vision
    of the Integrated Service Architecture to promote Circular Economy in Agriculture
    4.0. Green Circle = Start Process, Red Circle = End Process, Dotted Line = Comments,
    Flat Line = Information Flow. In the layer designated as “Information Processing,
    Analysis, and Output” within the Integrated Service Architecture aimed at advancing
    the Circular Economy in Agriculture 4.0, the references are categorized according
    to their respective applications, including irrigation control systems, fertilizer
    and pesticide application, crop management, greenhouses, and organization and
    management. These classifications are presented in Table 3 for clarity and ease
    of reference. Table 3. Management systems and outputs used in Intelligent Agriculture.
    3.2.5. Economic, Environmental, and Social Gains The integration of Industry 4.0
    technologies in agriculture empowers farmers with control over crucial resources
    such as water, nutrients [109], pesticides, energy, machinery, robotic devices
    [77], and human resources [32]. Data-driven decision making and innovative business
    models [119] are instrumental in enhancing production strategies [13], reutilizing
    process waste [114], and minimizing losses across the agribusiness chain. Consequently,
    economic benefits can be assessed by analyzing the efficient management of input
    resources utilized in production, alongside the increased availability of high-quality
    products offering added value to consumers. This added value encompasses aspects
    such as product differentiation, enriched nutritional content, and innovative
    packaging strategies, contributing to market competitiveness and profitability
    in agriculture. Environmental benefits are quantifiable through monitoring resource
    consumption indicators such as water usage, nutrient management, and greenhouse
    gas emissions. Furthermore, sustainable agricultural practices may lead to ecosystem
    restoration, biodiversity conservation, and soil health improvement, thereby enhancing
    environmental value and resilience. Social benefits encompass improvements in
    food security [1], reduced dependency on hazardous inputs, and the creation of
    employment opportunities in rural areas [32]. Initiatives fostering inclusivity
    and community engagement contribute to the formation of social capital and overall
    societal well-being. 3.2.6. Circular Economy Important resources for food production
    are wasted, with only 40% of irrigation water reaching the plants, and merely
    5% of the applied fertilizer being transformed into nutrients absorbed by humans.
    Soil degradation affects between 30 and 85% of agricultural land, exacerbating
    food insecurity issues [39]. Following the linear production model for food production
    is no longer sustainable, especially in a scenario where necessary resources are
    increasingly scarce [128]. Therefore, to minimize the utilization of finite natural
    resources, it is imperative to adopt the principles of Circular Economy, which
    include preserving and enhancing natural capital by managing finite stocks and
    balancing renewable resource flows, optimizing resource yields through the circulation
    of products, components, and materials in technical and biological cycles, and
    fostering system effectiveness by addressing and mitigating negative externalities
    [39]. Figure 7 illustrates systems of the Circular Economy in a diagram, showcasing
    the management flow of renewable energy and finite materials, while highlighting
    the fundamental principles of circularity. Figure 7. Diagram of Circular Economy
    systems [129]. In the systematic literature review on Agriculture 4.0 and the
    associated technologies, only two articles were identified that mentioned the
    Circular Economy, along with a study outlining the barriers to its adoption [84],
    highlighting the lack of incentive and governmental support. Main challenges identified
    include pesticide usage and unproductive laborers [83]. Although the Circular
    Economy was not explicitly referenced, several articles demonstrated evidence
    of its application. Therefore, based on the ReSOLVE framework, evidence of Circular
    Economy implementation in Agriculture 4.0 was identified. This includes models
    for Regenerate (soil regeneration, nutrient recovery, utilization of renewable
    energy, and finite resource reuse), Share (equipment and technology sharing, as
    well as waste sharing), Optimize (automation, pesticide and water usage optimization,
    and energy consumption optimization), Loop (remanufacturing, reverse logistics,
    and recycling), Virtualize (information virtualization and remote service utilization),
    and Exchange (integration of new technologies such as IoT, cloud, Big Data, and
    robotics). The ReSOLVE framework operationalizes these principles through six
    key actions: Regenerate, Share, Optimize, Loop, Virtualize, and Exchange, as shown
    in Figure 8. Figure 8. Framework ReSOLVE—adapted from [130]. These actions involved
    analyzing the articles to ascertain the evidence of Circular Economy usage, which
    was then compiled and is presented in Table 4. Table 4. Variables to evaluate
    evidence of practices of use of Circular Economy in Agriculture 4.0. 4. Conclusions
    This paper presents a systematic literature review on Industry 4.0 technologies
    applied in agriculture, analyzing 114 selected articles to fulfill the research
    objective of proposing an integrated Service Architecture to promote the Circular
    Economy in Agriculture 4.0. A systematic literature review is chosen over traditional
    analysis due to its comprehensive and rigorous synthesis of existing research,
    which provides a nuanced understanding of the topic and helps identify gaps in
    the literature. This approach ensures that the work is grounded in thorough knowledge
    of existing research, enhancing the credibility and validity of the findings and
    advancing knowledge in the field. Research indicates that farms are increasingly
    leveraging IoT for sensor connectivity as a foundational step towards embracing
    a data-centric approach. This transition is underscored by a shift towards a culture
    of data-driven decision making, facilitated by the integration of advanced analytics
    and AI within cloud-based Big Data ecosystems. This research adds to our understanding
    of how Industry 4.0 technologies are currently applied in agriculture, identifying
    both the technologies used and their application areas. Studies have shown that
    farms are utilizing Industry 4.0 technologies for irrigation control [6,30,109,110,114,120];
    fertilizer and inputs [95,110,114]; planting and harvest management [26,28,111,116];
    agricultural greenhouse systems [113]; and area-based planting organization [7,25,109,121,122].
    A few studies were found on evaluating economic, environmental, and social gains
    generated by adopting Industry 4.0 technologies on farms and the connection between
    Industry 4.0 technologies adopted on farms and the Circular Economy. Therefore,
    the authors proposed an Integrated Service Architecture to promote the Circular
    Economy in Agriculture 4.0, composed of three layers: Farm Scenery, Cloud Storage,
    and the Information Processing, Analysis, and Output layer. The Farm Scenery layer
    is responsible for executing precision agriculture, utilizing sensors to automatically
    collect data and interconnecting them through wireless networks in a system known
    as the Internet of Things. The Cloud Storage layer is responsible for gathering
    data from various points on the plantation and transmitting them to cloud servers,
    facilitated by gateways. The Information Processing, Analysis, and Output layer
    is tasked with analyzing the received data. It utilizes tools from the Big Data
    ecosystem to generate information, aiding in decision making, issuing automatic
    commands to activate irrigation control equipment and inputs, and presenting management
    reports on graphical screens accessible via computers or mobile devices. These
    reports encompass economic, environmental, and social gains. This paper enriches
    existing theory by introducing a novel Service Architecture designed to advance
    Circular Economy principles within Agriculture 4.0. The proposed framework aims
    to foster economic, environmental, and social benefits, thereby enhancing sustainability
    in agricultural practices. The practical contribution centers on developers’ ability
    to utilize the proposed architecture to construct monitoring systems with IoT,
    applications for decision-making analysis, and management tools, fostering a data-driven
    decision culture on farms. The societal contribution lies in the potential to
    alleviate food insecurity and reduce waste. As a limitation of this research,
    its initial application is solely on farms. However, there is potential for expansion
    into the broader agribusiness supply chain as future prospects emerge. Future
    research includes adapting this Integrated Service Architecture for use in other
    activities within the agricultural chain, incorporating specific input variables
    and output indicators on screens and autonomous systems as needed. Another possibility
    is integrating other actors in the agribusiness chain into the Integrated Service
    Architecture, thereby enhancing the management of the agricultural ecosystem.
    Additionally, it can broaden the practical applications or policies that stem
    from this study. Author Contributions Conceptualization, W.A.V., G.C.d.O.N. and

    Agriculture plays a crucial role in providing sustenance and employment opportunities
    to millions of people around the world. As the global population continues to
    grow exponentially, there is an increasing demand for food production. Unfortunately,
    the amount of cultivable land is limited and is rapidly dwindling due to urbanisation
    and environmental degradation [1,2]. Therefore, there is a pressing need to improve
    crop yields to meet the growing demand for food. Modern farming techniques can
    optimise every aspect of the crop production process, from planting to harvesting.
    Precision agriculture, Solar Insecticidal Lamp Internet of Things (SIL-IoTs),
    and many other innovative ideas leverage technology to achieve this optimisation
    [3,4,5]. By prioritising sustainable and efficient farming practices, it is possible
    to ensure that agriculture remains a viable source of sustenance and employment
    for generations to come. Through efficient implementation of these smart techniques,
    farmers can increase their yield and improve the efficiency of their operations.
    The escalating worldwide water crisis is a significant worry, given the rising
    population and the need for fresh water. To tackle this problem, embracing sustainable
    water usage practices is imperative, particularly in agriculture, where water
    is a crucial resource. A viable solution is the adoption of Smart Irrigation Systems
    (SIS), which can track pertinent factors and regulate physical devices like water
    pumps to minimise water wastage by irrigating only when required [6,7]. Furthermore,
    sustainable farming practices can enhance soil health, reduce greenhouse gas emissions,
    and promote biodiversity [3]. Such approaches can also improve the overall quality
    of the produce and increase the economic sustainability of farming operations.
    The integration of IoT, edge computing, and AI has transformed the landscape of
    farming practices [8]. However, with these innovative approaches come new challenges,
    such as increased complexity, system safety, reliability, trustworthiness, and
    vulnerability [9,10]. To ensure the dependability of these systems, it is essential
    to understand their composition and inner workings and potential failures that
    may arise during operation. This proactive understanding of the system and its
    behaviour will help to mitigate risks from the design time and optimise the efficiency
    of such systems. In the case of large-scale smart farming, the failure of these
    systems can have devastating consequences on nature, people, agricultural production,
    and finances. Therefore, conducting a credible failure analysis of IoT-based technology
    during the conceptual design phase is crucial to ensure the development of safe
    and reliable IoT-based agricultural systems. While in this study we focus on the
    qualitative failure analysis of the IoT system, a recent overview of physical
    security and safety issues in IoT can be found in [11]. Failure analysis methods
    are indispensable in safety-critical domains, encompassing diverse sectors like
    aviation, automobiles, and industrial control systems [12]. Among these methods,
    Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) stands out as a widely acknowledged and highly effective
    technique for analysing failures in safety-critical systems [13]. By employing
    graphical models, FTA provides a systematic representation of the logical connections
    between failures and their root causes, offering valuable insights into potential
    vulnerabilities and areas for improvement in complex systems. The structured and
    methodical FTA method is an effective approach for identifying potential system
    failures, assessing risks, and developing strategies to prevent them during system
    design [13,14,15]. This approach is particularly useful in examining failures
    across a range of systems, including smart agriculture [13,14,15,16,17,18]. By
    utilising a visual and deductive approach, the FTA method identifies potential
    safety risks, predictive failure of the system, critical failure scenarios, and
    the shortest path to system failure [17,18]. The FTA process involves understanding
    system functions and components, identifying possible failure modes, determining
    the root cause of failures, and proposing corrective actions to address them [19].
    The FTA method remains a well-established approach for assessing the safety and
    reliability of agricultural systems, contributing to improved performance and
    enhanced productivity. Therefore, incorporating the FTA method into the iterative
    design process of smart agricultural systems ensures that safety considerations
    evolve with the system design, promoting ongoing improvement and cultivating a
    proactive risk management culture within the agricultural industry. Despite the
    wide adoption of the FTA model as a safety analysis method, the reliance on FT
    has some inherent limitations, such as being a manual process, not supporting
    reusability, being prone to human errors, and becoming cumbersome when the failure
    behaviour becomes complicated [13,20]. Model-driven approaches are being adopted
    from the functional system design domain to the safety analysis environment to
    overcome these challenges and keep up with the latest advancements in the overall
    system design approach. In the model-driven environment, the Model-Based Systems
    Engineering (MBSE) approach is rich with various system models and diagrams, which
    can effectively model system architecture, and through their extension, model
    failure behaviour that can be viable for Model-Based Safety Analysis (MBSA) [21].
    Recent studies in the safety analysis domain are now proposing the utilisation
    of MBSA approaches for the generation of the FTA process to simplify design trade-offs,
    increase IoT design flexibility, and reduce cost and time-to-market constraints
    [22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31]. This study utilises the use of the MBSA paradigm
    to create an FTA model of an IoT-based SIS in a SysML environment for a viable
    safety assessment. It is worth noting that although IoT-based agricultural systems
    are gaining more trust from the public, the MBSA approach of safety analysis is
    not being used as much in the intelligent agricultural domain as it is in other
    safety-critical domains. However, the failure of monitoring systems in agriculture
    can have a significant impact on food security and result in enormous financial
    loss. This article presents a novel MBSA approach for safety analysis of an IoT-based
    SIS. The framework leverages IoT-based SIS and focuses on the conceptual design
    phase to identify potential failure behaviours of the system. It generates detailed
    failure models for the system and its components, formalising them through MBSA-generated
    FTA diagrams. The method’s granular flexibility enables a better understanding
    of how individual component failures can cause system-wide safety problems, thereby
    improving system dependability and failure risk mitigation. The framework’s efficacy
    is demonstrated through a case study of IoT-based SIS. This approach represents
    a significant step towards proactive and comprehensive failure analysis in innovative
    agricultural ecosystems, aligning technological advancements with the goal of
    system analysis approaches. The article is divided into sections to provide a
    comprehensive overview of the IoT’s role in smart agriculture. It begins with
    an introduction and then moves on to Section 2, which provides a comprehensive
    overview of IoT’s role in smart agriculture. This is followed by a review of manual
    safety analysis methods in Section 3, and MBSA methods are covered in Section
    4. Furthermore, Section 5 then describes the proposed framework in detail and
    demonstrates its application in a case study, which can be found in Section 6.
    This article concludes with Section 7, summarising the key points discussed and
    suggesting potential areas for future research. 2. Applications of IoT in Smart
    Agriculture This section provides a detailed overview of how IoT technology is
    leveraged to promote sustainable and intelligent farming practices. From monitoring
    soil moisture levels to tracking livestock, the IoT has revolutionised how agriculture
    is managed and optimised for greater productivity and efficiency. 2.1. Smart Irrigation
    System Freshwater scarcity is a critical global challenge that we must address,
    as only 2.5 % of Earth’s water supply is freshwater, with a mere 31.3 % available
    for human use, with the rest being in the form of glaciers or ice caps [32,33].
    Agriculture consumes a vast amount of this resource, and as the demand for food
    increases, it is essential to manage water resources efficiently [34]. IoT technology
    offers a promising solution. By combining sensor networks, smart tech, and the
    Internet, we can measure critical parameters like soil moisture and temperature
    to enable real-time data analysis for accurate irrigation control [35]. With the
    integration of microcontrollers and wireless communication, IoT tech can facilitate
    the development of automated irrigation systems that conserve up to 90 % of water
    compared with traditional methods [36]. Several studies have proposed the use
    of an integrated sensor/actuator node network to measure various physical parameters
    such as soil moisture, air temperature, humidity, water level, water flow, and
    luminous intensity [37,38]. Leveraging smart Internet-based technology can help
    optimise water usage and improve crop yield, contributing to long-term resource
    sustainability. By incorporating IoT tech in agriculture, a comprehensive solution
    to freshwater scarcity can be provided, leading to better water conservation and
    benefiting farmers, consumers, and the environment. 2.2. Pest Control and Plant
    Disease Monitoring The agricultural industry has experienced significant changes
    due to the IoT, particularly in pest control and plant disease monitoring [39].
    Farmers can now utilise advanced deep learning methods to identify pests, diseases,
    weeds, and yield and assess soil suitability for different crops. With the help
    of image processing, machine learning, and Logistic Decision Regression (LDR),
    researchers have achieved impressive accuracy rates in detecting pests and plant
    diseases, leading to better crop management practices and improved yields [39,40,41].
    Smart agriculture has been introduced which utilises an IoT architecture that
    employs deep learning techniques to detect insects, diseases, weeds, and soil
    nutrients and predict crop yield with greater accuracy. This has revolutionised
    the industry, as sensor data have improved the accuracy and reliability of disease
    detection through innovative data analysis methods. Recently, there has been a
    surge of interest in using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image analysis,
    which have the potential to further enhance the accuracy and speed of disease
    detection. CNNs effectively identify plant diseases, pests, and nutrient deficiencies
    and predict crop yield [42,43]. Integrating IoT with advanced deep learning methods
    has transformed the agricultural industry, paving the way for innovative solutions
    to old problems. More farmers are expected to embrace this technology in the coming
    years, leading to increased productivity and better crop management practices.
    2.3. Use of Drones and Harvesting Robots The agricultural industry has significantly
    transformed since the introduction of drones and IoT devices. These advanced technologies
    have revolutionised traditional cultivation methods by reducing physical strain
    and streamlining the process [44]. The introduction of intelligent agricultural
    systems has paved the way for implementing innovative methods to monitor soil
    conditions, spray pesticides and fertilisers, and transmit sensor data for analysis
    [45]. Drones have emerged as one of the most promising tools in agriculture. With
    high-resolution cameras, they can capture images of crops from an aerial view,
    providing farmers with an accurate measurement of crop damage caused by pests
    or weather, especially in challenging terrain [46]. They can also monitor crop
    growth and identify areas that require fertilisation or irrigation. In addition
    to drones, agricultural robots integrated with IoT devices and sensors are used
    for various tasks such as seedling, harvesting, weed detection, and pest control.
    These robots are designed to operate autonomously and can be programmed to perform
    specific tasks with precision and accuracy. Moreover, they can collect and transmit
    data in real time, enabling farmers to make informed decisions and take corrective
    actions quickly. Developed nations are adopting these technologies to enhance
    agricultural efficiency while minimising costs and time [47,48]. Implementing
    IoT devices and drones in agriculture can potentially increase crop yields, reduce
    labour costs, and minimise the use of harmful chemicals [49]. Therefore, integrating
    these advanced technologies in the agricultural industry is a significant step
    towards creating a sustainable future for the world. 2.4. Vertical Farming and
    Smart Greenhouse Vertical Farming (VF) has emerged as a modern agricultural technique
    wherein crops are grown on vertically inclined surfaces, predominantly in high-rise
    buildings. This innovative practice has gained immense popularity in recent years,
    owing to its ability to offer several advantages beyond food security. As per
    Kalantari et al. [50], VF has the potential to revamp urban design and architecture,
    augment food safety and security, and reduce environmental pollution. With the
    rapid advancement of digital technologies, IoT devices, artificial intelligence,
    and other cutting-edge technologies are increasingly being incorporated into VF.
    According to Siregar et al. [51], IoT devices and AI are being employed to monitor
    and control VF environments, and researchers such as those found in [52,53,54]
    have proposed methodologies that integrate sensors and IoT techniques for smart
    VF. Additionally, Kaur et al. [55,56] demonstrated how hydroponic VF could be
    carried out using IoT-based sensors with minimal water and soil usage. By harnessing
    these innovative ideas, VF has the potential to enhance crop yields while minimising
    resource usage, making it an attractive option for sustainable agriculture. Apart
    from IoT and machine learning, studies also explore using artificial intelligence
    to build smart greenhouses. For instance, Maraveas and Chrysanthos [57] conducted
    a detailed review of AI’s use in building smart greenhouses and explored methods
    to optimise their usability. Also, Gracia et al. [58] reviewed the usage of Artificial
    Neural Networks (ANNs) in greenhouse technology and proposed models to integrate
    IoT devices and ML for innovative agriculture development. Therefore, integrating
    cutting-edge technologies like IoT and AI in VF has immense potential to transform
    crop growth, enhance food security, and reduce environmental impact. 2.5. Tracking
    and Monitoring Livestock Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) is a modern approach
    that utilises IoT technologies to provide farmers with advanced tools for monitoring
    cattle behaviour, diagnosing diseases, managing their welfare, and improving overall
    management [59,60]. In recent years, significant progress has been made in developing
    web and mobile applications that use sensors and IoT devices to monitor livestock
    behaviour and environmental factors. Researchers have identified key technologies
    that have proven effective in PLF, including Radio Frequency Identification (RFID),
    Global Positioning Satellite (GPS), Digital Twin technology, and AI [60,61]. These
    technologies have improved data collection and analysis efficiency, enabling farmers
    to make informed decisions about their livestock. Furthermore, researchers have
    proposed efficient methods for monitoring cattle behaviour and environmental factors
    using indoor Ultra-WideBand (UWB) location data, accelerometer data, and automatic
    monitoring systems based on sensors. These methods allow farmers to monitor their
    cattle more accurately and in real time, improving the overall health and well-being
    of the animals. Additionally, smart geofencing methods that rely on IoT and General
    Packet Radio Service (GPRS) have been suggested for remote monitoring and controlling
    cattle, making it easier for farmers to monitor their livestock from a distance
    [61]. Other methods for herd location monitoring using Bluetooth and GPS have
    also been proposed, making it easier for farmers to track the location of their
    animals and ensure their safety and security. IoT technologies in PLF have transformed
    the livestock industry, allowing farmers to leverage advanced tools and technologies
    to manage their livestock more efficiently and effectively [62]. With continued
    advancements in this field, we can expect to see even more innovative solutions
    that will further improve the quality of life for livestock and enhance sustainability.
    2.6. Effects of Sensor-Based IoT Device Failures in Smart Agriculture As the demand
    for sustainable and efficient agricultural production grows, farmers are increasingly
    adopting smart farming practices that rely on IoT technology. However, these practices
    come with risks. If the sensor-based IoT devices used in agriculture fail, it
    can have severe consequences for the entire system. The impact can range from
    environmental pollution to decreased crop yields or even famine. In the long run,
    these hazards can also damage soil health and fertility, crop disease control,
    supply chain management, and farmers’ trust in IoT technology. These risks can
    lead to economic collapse in rural areas, affecting farmers and related industries.
    Therefore, it is crucial to develop strategies to mitigate the risks associated
    with sensor-based IoT device failure in agriculture, particularly given that harsh
    weather conditions can make these devices prone to failure. 3. Overview of Manual
    Failure Analysis Methods Failure analysis is a systematic approach to investigate
    and comprehend the underlying causes of failures in various systems, products,
    or processes [26]. The primary objective of failure analysis is to prevent similar
    failures from happening in the future [12]. Failure analysis is extensively employed
    to analyse potential safety-related issues in domains where safety is critical.
    It is crucial to perform appropriate failure analysis on the conceptual design
    of IoT-based agricultural systems to ensure the design is safe and dependable
    [63]. Safety and reliability analysis are the two most significant dependability
    attributes, and they are used extensively in many safety-critical sectors. Below
    is a discussion of some of the well-known failure analysis methods. 3.1. Failure
    Mode and Effects Analysis Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is a proactive
    approach in safety-critical domains. It identifies and evaluates the potential
    failure modes of a system, assessing their impact on safety, reliability, and
    performance [14,64]. FMEAs are often attributed to the US military, who first
    utilised this technique in the late 1940s to mitigate potential failures and minimise
    sources of variation during munitions production [20,65]. Notably, FMEA is also
    used for failure analysis of smart agriculture [66]. Using FMEA, critical components
    and functions are identified, and failure modes are evaluated based on their severity,
    probability of occurrence, and detectability [67,68]. The Risk Priority Number
    (RPN) is calculated for each failure mode, and necessary mitigation strategies
    are adopted. High-RPN failure modes are prioritised through improved design, redundancy,
    maintenance, or additional safety measures [67]. 3.2. Bayesian Network A Bayesian
    Network (BN) is a sophisticated probabilistic model that is extensively utilised
    in various engineering domains, particularly in testing and verifying the safety
    properties of IoT systems. Employing a BN model aids in recognising and reducing
    risks by representing interdependencies and uncertainties [65]. The safety problem
    is defined, relevant components are identified, and probabilistic dependencies
    are established to achieve the utilisation of the BN model in the safety analysis.
    Numerical values are then assigned to calculate the probability of specific events
    occurring. Each variable is represented as a node, and the directed edges between
    nodes indicate the probabilistic dependencies between the variables [65,69,70].
    The Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs) specify the probabilistic relationships
    for each node based on the values of its parent nodes. The Bayesian Network supports
    both qualitative and quantitative analysis. Qualitative analysis involves graphical
    representation, while quantitative analysis involves assigning numerical values
    to the parameters in the BN, such as conditional probabilities in CPTs, to calculate
    the probability of a specific event occurring or estimate the likelihood of different
    events [18,71]. 3.3. Markov Analysis Model The Markov model is a mathematical
    framework used to study systems that change over time through a sequence of discrete
    states. It is beneficial for analysing systems with memoryless properties [72].
    These are systems where the future state depends only on the current state and
    not on the sequence of states that came before it. The model assumes that a system
    exists in one of several discrete states at any given time and can move to another
    state with specific probabilities [73]. A state transition matrix that captures
    these transition probabilities defines the system’s behaviour. Markov models are
    often used to analyse the behaviour of systems based on the exponential distribution
    of failure. The steady-state probabilities of the model can be calculated by solving
    the system of linear equations defined by the model [73]. 3.4. Petri Net A Petri
    Net is an essential graphical and mathematical modelling approach for analysing
    and describing intricate, concurrent, and distributed systems. It is a highly
    effective method for modelling and understanding systems in which multiple entities
    interact asynchronously and dynamically [65]. Typically, PNs are denoted as four-tuple
    N = (P, T, A, K), a bipartite graph that we discuss in detail below: 𝑃={ 𝑝 1 ,
    𝑝 2 , 𝑝 3 ,…, 𝑝 𝑛 } is a finite set of places: Places represent states or conditions
    within the system. They are typically depicted as circles or ovals in a PN diagram.
    𝑇={ 𝑡 1 , 𝑡 2 , 𝑡 3 ,…, 𝑡 𝑛 } is a finite set of transitions: Transitions represent
    events or actions that can occur within the system. These are typically depicted
    as rectangles in the diagram. Transitions cause changes in the system’s state
    by consuming tokens from input places and producing tokens in output places. 𝐴⊆(𝑃×𝑇)∪(𝑇×𝑃)
    is a finite set of arcs: Arcs (also known as edges) connect from places to transitions
    or transitions to places, indicating the flow of tokens between them. There are
    two types of arcs: Input Arcs and Output Arcs. 𝐾={1,2,3,…} is a finite set of
    tokens: Tokens are small symbols or markers. Each place can hold a certain number
    of tokens, representing the presence or availability of resources, objects, or
    entities. They can move between places through transitions, following the defined
    flow of arcs. The PN model follows basic rules for activating transitions based
    on the availability of input tokens. The behaviour of PNs is determined by the
    movement of tokens and interaction between transitions. Coloured, timed, and stochastic
    PNs are variations of PNs that address specific aspects of system modelling and
    analysis [65,74,75]. An example of a simple PN is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1.
    Example of a Petri Net model. 3.5. Fault Tree Analysis The FTA method is a systematic
    graphical methodology widely used in engineering, safety, and risk assessment
    to thoroughly analyse the causes of failures within complex systems. It originated
    in 1962 at Bell Phone Laboratories and was initially crafted to evaluate the failure
    behaviours of the launch control system of the LGM-30 Minuteman intercontinental
    ballistic missile (ICBM) as part of the United States’ strategic deterrent forces
    [20,76]. Over the years, FTA has evolved into a pivotal tool for failure analysis,
    finding applications in diverse domains, including industrial safety-critical
    systems, and gaining momentum in IoT-based applications. FTA’s versatility is
    evident across various applications, spanning safety analysis in smart homes [77,78]
    to generic IoT systems [79,80], electric vehicles [81], industrial fire detection
    and prevention systems [82], industrial robots [17], self-healing industrial systems
    [83], and cyberphysical systems [15]. Additionally, FTA has successfully analysed
    the failure behaviour of smart agriculture systems [76,84], showcasing its adaptability
    across diverse domains. The FTA technique systematically identifies factors contributing
    to system failures and assesses the probability of such failures, solidifying
    its position as one of the most prominent techniques for dependability analysis.
    Recognising its significance, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)
    has endorsed FTA as a leading method for failure analysis [13,85,86]. In Figure
    2, the FTA model employs a logical and graphical diagram to pinpoint critical
    components for improvement, preventing future failures. The diagram outlines the
    hierarchy of events and utilises logic gates such as AND, OR, and Voting gates
    to model different systems’ behaviour. In an AND gate, all child events must occur
    for the parent event, whereas in an OR gate, any single child event can activate
    the parent event. The Voting gate requires a specific number of events (e.g.,
    2 out of 3), as the diagram indicates. The green triangle symbol facilitates the
    breakdown of the tree into smaller components for more accessible representation.
    Figure 2. Example of a fault tree. The fault tree is constructed using a top-down
    approach, starting with a top event causing the overall system failure. This top
    event is then decomposed into intermediate events using logic gates, representing
    the immediate causes of the top event. The recursive breakdown continues until
    the analysis reaches the component level failure or root causes that cannot be
    further decomposed. The ultimate goal is to assess how the top event will occur
    in the tree, representing the system failure. The analysis can be conducted qualitatively
    and quantitatively. Qualitative analysis involves obtaining Minimal Cut Sets (MCSs),
    the smallest combinations of root causes or basic events (BEs) leading to system
    failure. Identifying MCSs helps understand critical combinations of component
    failures or events. On the other hand, quantitative analysis uses failure rates
    of components or probabilities of root causes to predict system failure. Considering
    the type of logic gates used between events, the system failure probability can
    be calculated [12,20]. While FTA possesses strengths shown in Table 1, such as
    providing a structured approach for failure analysis, there are also acknowledged
    weaknesses [12,20]. These include the potential for human error in tree creation,
    a cumbersome process, lack of support for reusability, and inherent limitations
    of manual-based system analysis methods. Table 1. Strengths of Fault Tree Analysis
    Approach. 4. Model-Based Approach in Safety Analysis of IoT Several approaches
    in MBSA have been developed to model both functional and nonfunctional properties
    of modern and embedded systems, including those in the IoT environment. These
    modern and formal methods utilise modelling languages that draw from general engineering
    models or domain-specific models and profiles. In contrast to manual safety analysis
    techniques used with informal models discussed in Section 3, MBSA approaches have
    been developed to automate and semiautomate the process. These computer-based
    approaches facilitate safety analysis and support various aspects of system design.
    MBSA approaches can generate compositional analysable safety artefacts based on
    systematic modelling of systems’ static, dynamic, and failure behavioural patterns
    using existing modelling languages and their extensibility mechanisms. The MBSA
    approaches are model-driven and can manage system complexity while performing
    coherent, formalised, structured, and rigorous system safety analysis. Safety
    analysis approaches have been developed using various modelling languages, including
    Unified Modelling Language (UML), SysML, and Architecture Analysis and Design
    Language (AADL) as well as Hierarchically Performed Hazard Origin and Propagation
    Studies (HiP-HOPS) [20,31,87,88]. Additionally, these models are unambiguous,
    based on standardisation and various automation support tools, and possess a high
    level of abstraction to model the heterogeneity of IoT-based systems. The proposed
    approach used in this study is based on the UML/SysML modelling approach. 4.1.
    The Unified Modelling Language UML is a powerful modelling language that enables
    one to systematically visualise a system using modelling diagrams and conduct
    a formal analysis. It is widely used for systems and software specifications and
    can be customised to suit specific domains. With numerous diagrams and extensions,
    UML can effectively describe a system’s components, hierarchy, and states. UML
    diagrams are grouped into two categories: behaviour and structure [30]. Behaviour
    diagrams capture the system’s dynamic behaviour, while structure diagrams describe
    the system’s static structure. Some popular UML diagrams include activity, state
    machine, sequencing, timing, use case, class, and component diagrams. UML is a
    reliable tool for high-quality modelling of safety-critical systems and has been
    adopted as a standard by the Object Management Group [29]. 4.2. System Modelling
    Language The SysML is a general-purpose graphical modelling language that was
    developed in 2003 on top of the UML specifically for system development, such
    as software, hardware interactions, and dependencies, among others [22,28]. The
    SysML is similar to UML; however, some diagrams in UML were removed, and others
    more specific to system engineering design were added. Two groups of SysML diagrams
    can be used to describe a system: behaviour and structure. The behaviour diagram
    showcases how the system operates, while the structure diagram highlights the
    system’s static structure. Popular SysML diagrams that are widely used include
    the block definition diagram (BDD), internal block diagram (IBD), parametric,
    and state machine diagram (SMD) [27]. A Broad List of SysML diagrams that can
    be used for various modelling of system features is shown in Figure 3, and a high-level
    description of the diagrams is provided in Table 2. Figure 3. SysML Diagrams.
    Table 2. Overview of some of the Notable UML/SysML Diagrams. The uniqueness of
    both UML and SysML is their extension mechanisms, which are known as profiles.
    A UML/SysML profile defines an extension of the language in terms of stereotypes
    (concepts in the target domain) and tagged values (the attributes of the stereotypes).
    For instance, the UML profile for Modelling and Analysis of Real-Time and Embedded
    Systems (MARTE) provides an analysis framework called the Quantitative Analysis
    Model (GQAM), enabling performance specification in UML models. The Dependability
    Analysis Modelling (DAM) is a domain-specific profile of SysML designed to address
    safety concerns such as safety metrics, transitions from safe to failure states,
    and triggers leading to those transitions. In a safety analysis based on MBSA
    approaches, the static structure of the system and its components are annotated
    with failure behaviours, and the resulting models are transformed to develop system-level
    failure analysis models [26]. Studies have been conducted using SysML/UML to develop
    FT and FMEA [28,89,90,91,92]. Various methodologies have been used for FTA generation,
    such as transforming the MBSA design developed in SysML using IBD and SMD to FTA
    artefacts based on a failure mapping pattern [25]. Other approaches have used
    programming languages to parse the XML model file generated from the source model
    and automate a formal model. Notably, the XML file of the source model was parsed
    in the Python language to safety analysis artefacts [93], ATLAS Transformation
    Language (ATL) [24], and Eclipse Modelling Framework [23]. The MBSA offers several
    advantages, including a composition that enables an easy understanding of the
    effects of altering one or more components or subsystems on the entire system’s
    safety assurance. Additionally, it supports reusability, reduces human errors,
    and facilitates iterative system design. 5. Proposed Safety Analysis Approach
    The approach proposed in Figure 4 uses the MBSE method, which combines the benefits
    of MBSA and safety analysis models. This technique preserves the advantages of
    MBSA over other static FTA methods while establishing the link between the IoT
    system architecture and the analysis models. Figure 4. Proposed MBSA framework.
    The MBSA framework described in Figure 4 for modelling of an IoT-based SIS involves
    a systematic process, utilising SysML diagrams and software tools compatible with
    SysML for precise modelling of the IoT system. The open-source SysML-compatible
    tool Papyrus was employed to initiate the analysis, seamlessly integrating with
    other Eclipse-based tools. This tool creates models that accurately represent
    the system’s static, functional aspects, and failure behaviours. The first step
    in our proposed approach involves creating diagrams that capture the static architecture,
    functional behaviour, and potential failure scenarios of the system in the SysML
    environment using Papyrus–Eclipse-based open-source software (Website for Papyrus
    tool: https://eclipse.dev/papyrus/). This includes creating SysML diagrams such
    as BDD, IBD, and SMD to build a comprehensive model of the IoT system’s architecture,
    functional structure, and failure characteristics. The created diagrams are then
    combined using a specific methodology, which we define in the subsequent section,
    to create the FTA from the models. Notably, the failure behaviours of each component
    are annotated using a DAM profile, transforming the source model into a formal
    analysable model for safety analyses. The DAM profile defines stereotypes, tagged
    values, and constraints, which are applied to the SysML SMD model to accurately
    articulate the system’s failure behaviour. Once the DAM profile is imported, aligned
    with the SMD diagram, and configured with DAM stereotypes, the Papyrus software
    tool facilitates a seamless transition, bridging static and functional modelling
    for fault tree generation. The fault tree logic is specified to generate the fault
    tree automatically, providing the necessary input for the tool. To ensure a high
    level of consistency and accuracy in our methodology, we heavily depend on Papyrus’s
    robust support for SysML and the DAM profile throughout our process. Alongside
    Papyrus, we incorporate other software tools, such as Drawio (Drawio tool website:
    https://app.diagrams.net/), to streamline the transition from SysML modelling
    to fault tree generation. Our overarching approach adheres to the MBSA framework,
    supports iterative system development, provides a systematic and structured method
    for constructing an FTA and conducts a qualitative safety analysis of the IoT-based
    SIS. In the subsequent section, we delve into the intricacies of this process,
    providing a comprehensive understanding of our methodology. 5.1. Static System
    Modelling To create the system’s static architecture model, we utilised BDD to
    represent the system’s different compositions and hierarchical structures. We
    divided the system into components using predefined blocks that logically indicate
    the system’s hardware and software. Additionally, we defined relationships among
    the components and the overall system regarding dependencies, generalisations,
    associations, aggregation, and inheritance. 5.2. Functional Configuration Modelling
    To develop the failure behaviour of an IoT system, it is crucial to have a comprehensive
    understanding of its internal structure. One way to achieve this is by creating
    an IBD representing the system’s properties and interconnections. This visualises
    the system’s decomposition, facilitating an understanding of how information flows
    between its elements. The IBD depicts the system’s internal configuration using
    its components, ports, and data flows. The IBD illustrates how a malfunction can
    propagate throughout the system by combining connectivity and flow. A well-defined
    internal structure and an understanding of its behaviour are fundamental to ensuring
    system safety and reliability. By providing a visual representation of the system’s
    properties, interconnections, and internal configuration in an MBSA environment,
    these diagrams facilitate an understanding of the system’s behaviour, identifying
    potential malfunctions and designing measures to mitigate them. 5.3. Failure Annotation
    To effectively model the failure behaviour of a system, it is essential to understand
    its functional features and the nominal state of each component. This involves
    analysing the system’s overall function, any redundancy designed into the system,
    and the behavioural characteristics of individual components. It is necessary
    to depict how the system elements can fail, how they change from one state to
    another, and the conditions that cause these changes. SMDs display the different
    states of the components and how their state can change. Using the system’s decomposed
    BDD, various nominal and failure states of the system are developed, along with
    their corresponding transitions and triggers, as SMDs. However, more than SMDs
    are needed to provide all the necessary information to model the failure features
    of an IoT system. To address this, the SMD was extended through the use of the
    DAM Profile, a UML extension mechanism that models the metamodel of the system.
    The DAM Profile is particularly effective for failure modelling through its stereotypes,
    such as DaStep, which represents the failure and error states of the system. The
    tag value under DaStep represents the transitions and triggers of the components.
    Using the DAM Profile, unique stereotypes and tag values can be applied to annotate
    the failure of system components accurately. The Data-Intensive Computing Environment
    (DICE)-integrated simulation environment was employed to achieve this goal. 5.4.
    Component Fault Tree Generation In the paradigm of MBSA, it is possible to convert
    a source MBSA model into a target safety artefact by creating links between the
    two. The ultimate goal is to produce an executable model to analyse the system’s
    safety. To achieve this, it is essential to have a comprehensive understanding
    of both the source and target languages. Our approach involves transforming SysML
    SMDs into component-based models that can be analysed to determine the contribution
    of each component to the overall system failure. This approach simplifies the
    iterative design process by enabling the replacement of components with a higher
    failure rate and more resilience. The resulting component-based model is generated
    via failure modelling, identifying potential failures and enhancing overall system
    safety. To create a component-level fault tree (CFT), each system component failure
    represented as SMDs is mapped to obtain the corresponding component tree, generating
    several trees that can be studied to detect possible failures. 5.5. System Fault
    Tree Generation The system-level FT is a target model designed to conduct a comprehensive
    system failure analysis. It combines individual FTA models of system components
    to create a single, unified tree structure using the system’s IBD. The IBD instances
    are utilised to merge the various CFTs. This allows the model to represent the
    relationship between components based on their configuration in the IBD. Static
    gates are employed to illustrate the configuration of the components better. For
    instance, an OR gate indicates series configurations where the system fails if
    any components fail. On the other hand, an AND gate is utilised for parallel configurations
    where the system only fails if all components fail. This level of detail allows
    the model to predict potential failures and their causes more accurately. At the
    top of the tree, the undesired event represents the overall failure of the system.
    Prior to that, the previous top-level undesired events in each component FTs are
    intermediate events. This detailed approach allows for a more thorough understanding
    of the system’s potential points of failure and can help identify areas for improvement
    and optimisation. 6. Illustrative Example To demonstrate our proposed MBSA approach,
    we used the IoT-based Smart Irrigation System presented in Figure 5. Using this
    system, a farmer can remotely monitor the status of a field and control the water
    pump(s) to irrigate the field whenever needed without being physically present
    in the field. In normal operating conditions, this system will monitor different
    parameters of a field, and based on the monitoring knowledge, it will decide when
    and for how long to irrigate the field. It uses a temperature sensor (TS) and
    a moisture sensor (MS) for monitoring. TS monitors the temperature of the field,
    and MS monitors the soil moisture. TS and MS continuously sense the respective
    parameters and report them to the IoT gateway/controller for further processing.
    The communication between the sensors and the IoT gateway takes place via a wireless
    medium. An Arduino board or Raspberry Pi can be considered as an IoT gateway.
    A battery powers the board. The IoT gateway converts the analogue signals received
    from the sensors to digital values and sends these values to the edge cloud server.
    The communication between the edge cloud server and the gateway occurs through
    a wireless medium. Figure 5. Architecture of an IoT-based Smart Irrigation System.
    6.1. Static System Modelling To create a formal system composition using the MBSA
    approach, it is crucial to have static configuration modelling. The system’s functional
    components and dependencies are depicted in the BDD shown in Figure 6, with SIS
    as the context. Direct composition relationships and SysML relationship link symbols
    were utilised to represent composite blocks in the system. Figure 6. Block definition
    diagram model of an IoT-based Smart Irrigation System. 6.2. Internal Configuration
    System Modelling The IBD Model of the system is crucial for effectively utilising
    MBSA modelling in system architecture. The SysML IBD depicts the system’s context
    and intricate, interdependent relationships among its components, accurately portraying
    data flow through ports and item flow symbols. The context blocks in SIS accurately
    represent interactions between different components as depicted in Figure 7. Figure
    7. Internal block diagram model of an IoT-based Smart Irrigation System. 6.3.
    Failure Annotation Modelling of the System In the provided Figure 8a,b, the failure
    annotations of two system components, namely the temperature sensor and power
    source, are displayed based on the SysML SMD. The metamodel was extended using
    the DAM Profile. In the SysML extension mechanism, DAM Stereotypes DaStep extends
    the SysML parent model to represent the state of failure and error in the system.
    The tag value under DaStep describes the transitions and triggers of the components.
    The nominal and failure states of the components are shown, where the failure
    states are represented by no output from the temperature sensor and power source
    failure. DAM stereotypes represent the transitions and triggers of the components
    to illustrate the failure and error states. The extended SMDs include failure
    to capture sensor readings, false sensor readings, and loss of control. The transition
    link indicates the triggers responsible for the state change, and various triggers
    are defined for other system components. Figure 8. Example of failure annotation,
    (a) failure annotation of a temperature sensor and (b) failure annotation of a
    power source. 6.4. Model Transformation from MBSE Model to FT 6.4.1. Component
    Fault Tree Generation To create the corresponding CFT, each system component’s
    one-to-one SMDs are mapped. In the CFT, the component’s overall failure is TE,
    while the IEs represent various functional states’ failure or error deviation.
    BE represents their triggers. To illustrate, the SMDs created in Figure 8a,b are
    mapped to their respective CFTs, as shown in Figure 9. Figure 9. Mapping of component
    state machine diagram to component fault tree for (a) a temperature sensor and
    (b) a power source. 6.4.2. System Fault Tree Generation The different components’
    fault trees generated are mapped based on the instances of the components in the
    system’s IBD. Accordingly, the overall system FT of SIS obtained is presented
    in Figure 10. The TE denotes the system failure condition, which is “the failure
    of the system to irrigate the field when needed”. The list of BEs and IEs and
    their description representing various basic device failures or communication
    failures between devices is provided in Table A1 in Appendix A. Figure 10. Fault
    tree generated for IoT-enabled SIS. 6.5. Qualitative Failure Analysis of the System
    Depending on the role(s) of a component in the system and its interactions with
    other components in the system, the failure of the component can have an enormous
    impact on the failure of the system. Therefore, this system’s qualitative failure
    behaviour analysis aims to identify its potential causes. For failure behaviour
    analysis, we identified “the failure of the system to irrigate the field when
    needed” as a system failure condition. Considering this event as the top event
    of the fault tree, we developed the fault tree shown in Figure 10. This FT contains
    19 unique basic events and the root causes that can contribute to the system failure.
    These root causes are either an internal failure of the devices or the failure
    of the communication between devices. As seen in Figure 10, physical damage to
    the sensors or erroneous readings from the sensors is considered as the failure
    of the TS and MS, which are represented by the events TSF (temperature sensor
    failure) and MSF (moisture sensor failure). In the fault tree, five basic events—FCRG,
    FCGC, FCFC, FCTG, and FCMG—represent communication failures between system components.
    Note that, due to simplicity and brevity, we considered these communication failure-related
    events at an abstract level. This means we do not decompose these events further
    to show why a particular communication failure occurs. However, one can explore
    these events further by considering all the causes of a typical wireless communication
    failure. Similarly, the failure of the edge cloud is presented by the event ICS
    (internal failure of the edge cloud server) due to simplicity. Again, this event
    can be decomposed further by considering many potential causes of a cloud server
    failure, including hardware and software failures. We analysed the fault tree
    in Figure 10 to identify the MCSs and obtained 94 MCSs; each of these MCSs can
    cause the system to fail. Out of these 94 MCSs, 71 MCSs are of order 2 and 23
    are of order 1. The order of an MCS represents the number of basic events contributing
    to that MCS. If all the basic events are equally probable to occur, then the higher
    the order of an MCS, the lower the criticality of that MCS is. Therefore, in this
    example, the first-order MCSs, such as “Water level is inadequate in the reservoir
    (WLIR)”, “Random Failure of Water Pump (RFWP)”, “Switch Failure (SWF)”, “Internal
    Failure of Relay (IFR)”, “Human Error (HE)”, “Random Failure of Gateway (RFG)”,
    and “Gateway Battery Failure (GBF)”, are the most critical ones. Therefore, actions
    should be taken to reduce the likelihood of these events. For instance, for the
    events related to communication failure, multiple communication media can be considered,
    so that if one medium fails, another can be used for successful communication.
    7. Conclusions The integration of IoT technology into agriculture heralds a transformative
    era, albeit one fraught with challenges, particularly in areas of the dependability
    and trustworthiness of these systems to operate as expected over their mission
    time. Understanding the intricacies of individual component failures and their
    systemic impact is pivotal for ensuring the robust performance of agricultural
    IoT systems. As the agricultural landscape evolves, researchers are at the forefront
    of developing sophisticated analysis and verification frameworks essential for
    fostering intelligent systems contributing to long-term food sustainability. This
    study serves as a testament to the effectiveness of the MBSA approach in dissecting
    the failure behaviour of an abstract IoT-based Smart Irrigation System. Leveraging
    a model-driven methodology, the investigation not only illuminated the nuances
    of system failure but also showcased the MBSA approach’s merits—characterised
    by meticulousness, error reduction, model reuse, and adaptability to iterative
    processes. The fault tree generated through this approach systematically identified
    component failures as basic events, delineating their interconnected pathways
    leading to system failure. This granular analysis empowers stakeholders to pinpoint
    the root causes of system failure and implement remedial measures crucial for
    maintaining operational integrity. While the present study concentrated on qualitative
    analysis, future investigations hold promise in transitioning to quantitative
    assessments by incorporating components’ failure rates or probabilities and considering
    various failure distributions over time. Furthermore, the MBSA approach’s inherent
    flexibility opens avenues for including additional complex failure conditions,
    such as “unnecessary irrigation” or “insufficient irrigation duration”, demonstrating
    its ease of adaptation for diverse failure analyses. In the evolving landscape
    of agricultural technology, security considerations emerge as a paramount concern.
    Acknowledging the potential vulnerabilities to safety failures induced by malevolent
    attacks, future research endeavours should delve into fortifying the system against
    security threats and malicious operations. As we navigate the ever-expanding realm
    of IoT in agriculture, a continuous commitment to robust analysis, adaptability,
    and security considerations will undoubtedly shape the future of sustainable and
    resilient smart farming systems. Lastly, the proposed approach requires scalability,
    which can be achieved using a dynamic FTA. This tool is useful for modelling complex
    systems’ time- and function-dependent failure behaviour. By incorporating a dynamic
    FTA, we will be able to gain a more accurate understanding of how a system behaves
    over time and how different functions and components interact. This information
    can optimise framework performance, reduce risks, and improve the system’s overall
    dependability. Author Contributions Background, A.A. and M.M.R.; proposed methodology,

    has a huge impact on the mass- and energy fluxes across the soil-atmosphere interface
    and is therefore of critical importance (Seneviratne et al., 2010). Moreover,
    soil moisture is an essential variable for drought assessment and forecasting
    (Enenkel et al., 2016), but also the water source for plants and a critical regulator
    of inland water bodies. Therefore, knowing spatio-temporal variability of soil
    moisture is crucial for optimizing soil moisture monitoring networks, improving
    climate and hydrological modelling, calibrating remote sensing-based soil moisture
    estimates, and improving ecosystem and agricultural management (Vereecken et al.,
    2014). Spatio-temporal variability is controlled by environmental or local conditions
    such as vegetation, physicochemical soil properties, vertical extension of the
    unsaturated zone and topography but also by meteorological and climatic conditions
    (Grayson & Western, 1998), with their relative contribution being scale dependent
    and site-specific (Suo et al., 2018; Vanderlinden et al., 2012). Vereecken et
    al. (2014) reviewed different methods used at the field to catchment scales to
    analyse the spatio-temporal dynamics of soil moisture and to characterize their
    patterns and controlling factors: geostatistics, wavelet analysis, temporal stability,
    and empirical orthogonal functions. Most frequently, soil moisture spatial and
    temporal variability analysis has been based on the mean relative differences
    approach introduced by Vachaud et al. (1985) and known as temporal stability (TS)
    analysis. In the TS methodology, the ratio (the relative difference, RD) between
    soil moisture bias (deviation of soil moisture at a specific location/site and
    time from the spatial mean) and the spatial mean is averaged across time to get
    the mean relative difference (MRD). These values give an idea about the spatial
    variation of soil moisture across a scale of interest during a specific period,
    which may be considered a measure of accuracy of the spatial mean (Gao et al.,
    2015). The (temporal) variability of RD referred by Gao et al. (2015) as a precision
    term reflects the degree of (in)stability of the MRD. Its application has been
    conducted across a range of scales and yielded promising results in terms of understanding
    such variabilities and their controls (soil properties, vegetation, topography,
    and rainfall) and finding the most representative location of the spatial mean
    soil moisture in an area of interest (Dari et al., 2019; Hao et al., 2020; Vanderlinden
    et al., 2012; Zhao et al., 2020). Another common approach to study the spatio-temporal
    variability of soil moisture, mostly applicable for up-downscaling of soil moisture
    from ground base to satellite data and vice versa, is based on the study of the
    comparison between soil moisture spatial mean and its variance for a certain time
    period (e.g. Famiglietti et al., 1998; Martínez et al., 2014). This type of relation
    shows a property of natural populations to have some degree of aggregation (e.g.
    mutual attraction) or regularity (e.g. mutual repulsion) (Taylor, 1961). Taylor
    (1961), analysing different populations densities of animals, viruses, and algae,
    proposed a simple power law to relate the mean and the variance whose coefficients
    depend on the population and scale. In hydrological studies, it can be considered
    that aggregation happens when everywhere we have either dry or wet conditions
    or disaggregation when different factors lead to differential wetting/drying in
    intermediate soil moisture states. This gives rise to the convex-upward-type of
    relation (Famiglietti et al., 1998) with maximum spatial variance at intermediate
    spatial mean of soil moisture and decreasing spatial variance for drier (dry branch)
    and wetter conditions (wet branch). Martínez et al. (2014) found that the slope
    of the “dry branch” depends on soil hydraulic properties. Several authors found
    a hysteretic behaviour between these statistics related to the presence of vegetation
    in modelling and catchment monitoring studies (Martínez et al., 2014; Rosenbaum
    et al., 2012). Moreover, there are studies in which higher variation in soil moisture
    was found in topsoil measurements (e.g. 0–0.20 cm) compared to the subsoil (0.20–0.50 m),
    for example, (Cheng et al., 2017; Duan et al., 2017; Martinez et al., 2013; Xu
    et al., 2021), and vice versa (Gao et al., 2015; Hu et al., 2010). These factors,
    meteorology/climatology, soil properties, and vegetation, affect the mean soil
    moisture mean and variance relation differently and might be intertwined depending
    on the region, scale of the study and measurement depth below the surface (Suo
    et al., 2018). Soil moisture spatial and temporal variability has been also studied
    by separating a time invariant term (the mean soil moisture over a period of study,
    Mtn) and a time-variant term (the deviations from the mean soil moisture, or anomalies,
    Atn) from the time-series of soil moisture at a particular site (Stn, e.g. Brocca
    et al., 2014; Mittelbach & Seneviratne, 2012). Formally, this is expressed as
    follows: where t stands for the time of observation of soil moisture and n to
    the location. Mittelbach and Seneviratne (2012) found from a large-scale soil
    moisture monitoring network in Switzerland that the spatial variance of soil moisture
    is dominated by the time-invariant component. Furthermore, their study revealed,
    applying the TS approach, that that sites identified as being most representatives
    of the spatial mean (MRD ≈ 0) did not correspond to the most representative sites
    of the average soil moisture anomaly within the network. Those results raised
    significant awareness with important implications for understanding and applying
    the spatio-temporal features of soil moisture relevant in the validation of spatial
    soil moisture satellite retrievals and climate and hydrological modelling. Few
    studies have addressed this issue (Brocca et al., 2014; Dari et al., 2019; Gao
    et al., 2015; Mittelbach & Seneviratne, 2012; Peng et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2020)
    and further research is needed covering different scales and conditions. Most
    of the variability found in soil moisture studies, at scales ranging from 0.6
    to 31 500 km2, corresponds with the time-invariant term of soil moisture among
    monitoring stations (Brocca et al., 2014; Dari et al., 2019; Mittelbach & Seneviratne,
    2012; Peng et al., 2016). This is consistent with most temporal stability analysis
    studies which indicate that the variability of the mean relative differences is
    attributed mainly to spatial rather than to temporal variations (Martinez et al.,
    2013; Vanderlinden et al., 2012). However, Gao et al. (2015) observed that, under
    certain circumstances, mostly related with the meteorological patterns, the temporal
    (anomalies) term might be significant too. Studying six soil moisture monitoring
    networks worldwide, Brocca et al. (2014) observed that half of the networks showed
    a minimum in the spatial variability of temporal anomalies for intermediate soil
    moisture values, which is in contrast with the widely recognized behaviour of
    soil moisture data. While this pattern has been sometimes recognized (Brocca et
    al., 2014; Mittelbach & Seneviratne, 2012), the occurrence, identification, and
    understanding of its shape, characteristics, and controlling factors in different
    environments need further research. The selected study site is a groundwater-dependent
    coastal wetland area of high ecological value and is representative of a large
    number of similar environments at global scale, such as the Camargue wetlands
    or China''s coastal wetlands (Sun et al., 2016), threatened by climate change
    and human activities such as tourism, and agriculture (Camacho et al., 2022).
    Therefore, a refined scientific understanding of soil moisture variability and
    its determining factors is of critical importance for management issues and the
    conservation of these kinds of protected habitats. The present work expands the
    issues explored in previous research in several ways. In this study, we investigate
    the relationship between the first and second statistical moments of different
    components of soil moisture variability and rank stability at two different depths.
    Furthermore, the effect of wetting and drying periods on the different components
    of spatial soil moisture variability is explored. Finally, our study area shows
    several singularities compared to previous studies. The study area is rather small,
    which may have an impact on the spatio-temporal patterns of variability, and means
    that similar meteorological conditions were experienced at all locations. Furthermore,
    it has a drier climate and is highly dependent on groundwater levels. 2 METHODS
    2.1 Site description The Doñana National Park (DNP) is one of the largest wetlands
    in Western Europe (Dimitriou et al., 2017; Green et al., 2017). Due to its crucial
    ecological value, the DNP is protected as a Natural World Heritage Site, Biosphere
    Reserve and Ramsar Site (Figure 1). FIGURE 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Study site and monitoring locations. The climate is classified as dry sub-humid
    Mediterranean with Atlantic influence with average annual rainfall of 550 mm,
    mostly concentrated in the cold season, and showing important interannual variability
    in the last 70 years between 250 and 1100 mm (Custodio et al., 2009). The average
    annual air temperature ranges between 17 and 18°C depending on the distance to
    the coast, and there are about 3000 h of sunshine per year. The DNP contains unconsolidated
    Plio-Quaternary sediments forming the regional Almonte–Marismas aquifer. The sediments
    are made up of fluvio-marine and alluvial sands, gravels, silts, and marls, with
    a thickness ranging from a few meters inland to more than 150 m at the coast (Manzano
    & Custodio, 2007). Whereas aeolian sands of a dune belt are overlaying the western
    part, the eastern part is covered by estuarine sediments of the saltmarshes. The
    thickness of the dune belt, which evolved by aeolian deposition during the Quaternary,
    limiting access to the ocean is variable with the highest dune of 35 masl. The
    Almonte Marismas aquifer is unconfined in the western part of the aeolian sands
    with generally high hydraulic conductivities while groundwater is confined below
    the silty-clay deposits of the floodplain. The selected study site within the
    DNP is a highly groundwater-dependent wetland area located in the dune belt of
    the western unconfined part of the Almonte Marismas aquifer. The depressions between
    these dune areas frequently intercept the groundwater surface, forming more than
    100 mostly small groundwater-dependent ponds (Sacks et al., 1992). Large parts
    of the area are flooded intermittently during wet years, and depth to groundwater
    level is generally small, ranging from 0.5 m close to the pond areas to above
    10 m in the dune crests. Stabilized dunes with scrub vegetation cover the major
    part of the DNP. The aquifer feeds a large number of ponds, most of them seasonal,
    and some small streams (Fernández-Ayuso et al., 2018). Nonetheless, intensive
    agricultural activity in the surroundings of the park and tourism has led to the
    deterioration of water resources in the last decades. A major amount of groundwater
    has been extracted for crop irrigation and for a nearby coastal touristic coastal
    resort which is partly affecting some peridunal ponds (Dimitriou et al., 2017;
    Suso & Llamas, 1993). In addition, global warming may accelerate the desiccation
    and disappearance of the lagoons due to the increasing frequency and duration
    of dry periods (Sousa et al., 2009). Therefore, the selected field site provides
    excellent conditions and relevance to study the spatio-temporal soil moisture
    variability and its controlling factors for wetland conditions. It improves the
    current understanding of soil moisture variability, and provides a scientific
    basis for the ecological protection of wetlands at a global scale. 2.2 Soil moisture
    sensors Five locations within a spatial extent of 5 × 25 km in the DNP were chosen
    to conduct this study encompassing a wide range of soil properties, vegetation
    coverage, and groundwater levels typical for the study area. Between 2012 and
    2017, at each site soil moisture sensors were installed horizontally in undisturbed
    soil in an opened pit wall, that was refilled after installation, Sensor installation
    depths ranged between 0.1 and 3.0 m depending on the site. To make measurements
    of different sites comparable, two reference depths, 0.35 and 0.5 m, were selected
    and soil moisture was linearly interpolated between depths when sensors were not
    installed at the reference depths. The hydrological year 2017/2018 was selected
    for statistical analysis because it had a maximum number of operating sensors
    and a minimum number of gaps in the soil moisture time series. Absolute instead
    of relative values of soil moisture, such as the relative saturation or degree
    of saturation, were used. Relevant specific information for each site is compiled
    in Table 1. TABLE 1. Location of sampling sites, groundwater level, instrumentation
    and sediment characteristics. Site UTM coordinates Sensor Hydraulic head measurements

    Bare soil The soil moisture sensors provide data of volumetric water content,
    temperature, and electrical conductivity. Their sampling volumes and accuracies,
    as provided by the manufacturers, are 0.0025 m3 and 2% for the Decagon GS3 (Decagon
    Devices, www.decagon.com) and 0.0060 m3 and 3% for the Campbell CS 650 sensors
    (Campbell Scientific, https://www.campbellsci.es/cs650), respectively. The accuracies
    of GS3 sensors have been provided based on factory calibrations for mineral soils
    with salinities ranging from 0 to <5 dS/m which applies to the soil types analysed
    at our measurement points. Additionally, soil specific calibration was performed
    for the CS 650 sensors using undisturbed soil sampling stainless steel rings of
    0.053- and 0.103-m diameter which confirmed gravimetrically the VWC measured by
    both types of sensors. All soil moisture raw data are included in supporting information
    files (STable1_Cortafuegos_7_DT1, STable2_Cortafuegos_7_DT2, STable3_Palacio Marismillas,
    STable4_Laguna Larga, STable5_LLanos Marismillas, STable6_Lysimeter Field profile,
    STable7_Santa Olalla_P2_All, STable8_Santa Olalla_P3_All, STable9_metadata soilmoisture).
    2.3 Hydraulic head measurements At the sites Llanos, Laguna Larga and Santa Olalla,
    where no piezometers were available at a close distance, we installed shallow
    piezometers of less than 5 m depth with 1 inch diameter and with 2 m filter screen.
    We equipped them with level sensors (OTT-Orpheus Mini) for continuous monitoring
    at 30 min intervals. At the Llanos site, continuous measurements were substituted
    by manual readings due to technical problems of the measurement device. At the
    Cortafuegos site, manual readings of a nearby piezometer between 2017 and 2021
    of 18.5 m depth and with 2 m filter length were used to calculate statistical
    data of the depth to the piezometric level in Table 1. At the Lisímetro site (altitude
    38 masl), manual readings of a nearby well of 30 m depth, with filter screens
    between 8–16 and 18–26 m depth located at 50 m distance (altitude 31 masl) were
    available for the years 2009–2017, indicating an average depth to the piezometric
    level of 6 m from the piezometer reference level, which corresponds to an average
    groundwater level depth of 13 m from the Lisímetro site reference. Response tests
    at all sites showed recovering piezometric levels within 30 min after pumping
    in all locations indicating good hydraulic connection which is typical for the
    type of sediments of the study area. 2.4 Sediment sampling and analysis Undisturbed
    samples at all five locations were taken using a jackhammer and transparent plastic
    liners of 1 m length and 0.0508 m diameter. A large number of soil samples analysed
    in a previous study of Kohfahl et al. (2016) showed the low variability of physicochemical
    soil properties within their respective geological units. To test the representativity
    of the selected sites, sediment analyses were carried out at the CN IGME CSIC
    laboratory in Tres Cantos, Madrid (Spain). Grain size distribution was analysed
    according to DIN 18123 (DIN, 1980). X-ray diffraction analysis was carried out
    using a Panalytical XPert Pro instrument, with a copper tube and graphite monochromator,
    and using a XCELERATOR detector. 2.5 Spatio-temporal analysis The presented study
    applies the approach proposed by Mittelbach and Seneviratne (2012). The spatial
    mean of soil moisture at any time t and its spatial variance are given by: (1)
    (2) where S represents soil moisture, subscript t and n represent time and site
    respectively, μ stands for mean value, σ2 is variance, and σ is standard deviation.
    The subscripts and refer to temporal and spatial statistics, respectively. Analogously,
    the time-invariant temporal mean of absolute soil moisture at any site n is defined
    as: (3) where T is the number of sampling time steps. Similar to Mittelbach and
    Seneviratne (2012), we use the symbol Mtn to refer to the time-invariant temporal
    mean of absolute soil moisture in the following. The temporal anomalies, Atn,
    are obtained by subtracting the temporal mean of each site from Stn, (4) Equation
    (5) relates the spatial variance of volume water content data with the spatial
    variance of the temporal mean and the spatial variance of the temporal anomalies
    . (5) Temporal stability was evaluated following the methodology of Vachaud et
    al. (1985) in terms of the differences between measured soil moisture at location
    n and time t and the spatial mean of soil moisture at time t (Equation 6). (6)
    The ratio of the differences in (6) and the spatial mean of soil moisture at time
    t are then calculated to obtain the relative differences of soil moisture (RD)
    and averaged over time and expressed as a relative difference of soil moisture
    from the spatial mean at time t, to obtain the also called mean relative difference
    or MRD (7) Mean relative differences and the standard deviation of RD provide
    a measure of the average deviation from the spatial mean and the temporal variability
    of this measure and are computed by: (8) (9) A similar approach is applied to
    the decomposition terms of Stn, (Mittelbach & Seneviratne, 2012), computing, on
    both the time-variant and the time-invariant term, their mean deviation from the
    spatial mean and the corresponding standard deviation according to: (10) (11)
    (12) (13) 3 RESULTS 3.1 Sediment analysis Macroscopic and granulometric analyses
    are compiled in Table 2 revealed homogeneous middle to fine grained sands at all
    sites. TABLE 2. Macroscopic and granulometric sediment analyses. Site Sediment

    Larga Above 0.7 m depth: medium grained sand with occasionally interbedded shell
    and brown coloured areas indicating iron precipitates. X-ray diffractometry showed
    quartz to be the dominant mineral at all locations, and calcite as secondary mineral
    with traces of K-feldspar, plagioclase, dolomite, illite and chlorite. The capillary
    fringe has not been measured directly but according to generally accepted knowledge
    middle grained sands may show a vertical extension of several decimetres (Hudak,
    2000). Supporting information is included in sediments.zip. 3.2 Hydraulic head
    measurements of the different sites Hydraulic head measurements between 2010 and
    2021 show large differences between the different sites. Whereas Laguna Larga
    and Llanos present shallow depths below 1.8 m to the piezometric level with almost
    identical fluctuations, the Lisímetro and Cortafuegos sites present significantly
    greater groundwater depths of more than 2 m and the Santa Olalla site shows intermediate
    levels between these endmembers. 3.3 Time-invariant and time-variant components

    and time-invariant terms of soil moisture (Equation 4) at the 0.35 and 0.5 m depths.
    The rainfall time series shows typical Mediterranean conditions characterized
    by moderate rainfall events during fall, winter and spring and dry conditions
    during summer (Figure 3a). Depth of groundwater level is shown for three locations
    where data were available for the monitored period (Figure 3e). Measured piezometric
    levels of Cortafuegos 7 and Lisímetro yield an average depth around 2 and 7 m,
    respectively, but no continuous time series were recorded during the soil moisture
    monitoring period (Figure 2). Very dry conditions are observed at the beginning
    of the study period (less than 0.15 m3 m−3 at the 0.35 m depth and below 0.20 m3 m−3
    at the 0.5 m depth). Fast responses during moderate rainfall events are indicated
    by a steep increase of the soil moisture in two stations with very shallow groundwater
    levels, showing maximum values of soil moisture from late winter to the beginning
    of the spring, and, finally, a gradual dry down until late summer when minimum
    Stn is reached again. In contrast, the remaining stations with average groundwater
    levels of more than 1 m below the surface show a less pronounced soil moisture
    increase. FIGURE 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Time series of hydraulic head
    measurements at the different sampling points. Dashed lines indicate time window
    of documented soil moisture measure. The decomposition of soil moisture into its
    time-variant and time-invariant components shows that the time-invariant component
    introduces a large proportion of variability. The spatial and temporal patterns
    found at the 0.35 and the 0.5 m depths were similar to each other, although higher
    variability in Mtn can be found at 0.5 m depth compared to 0.35 m depth (Figure
    3c,g). Looking at Mtn, two main groups of stations can be identified: Llanos and
    Laguna Larga belong to a “wet” group having 5–6 times larger soil moisture than
    the “dry” group that contains the remaining stations (Cortafuegos, Santa Olalla
    and Lisímetro). In the wet group areas, groundwater levels usually lay within
    a depth of 1 m, while the groundwater level in the dry group areas is deeper.

    mean of soil moisture Stn (b,f), its temporal mean Mtn (c,g) and time-varying
    (anomalies) Atn (d,h) at 0.35 and 0.5 m. Temporal anomalies (Atn), which reflect
    the time-variant (temporal) soil moisture component, show similar patterns across
    stations at both depths, although higher variability can be found at 0.35 m than
    at the 0.5 m depth (Figure 3d,h). The most significant negative deviations from
    the means occur during the summer–fall periods in both years when soil moisture
    values are the smallest. Then values lay close to 0 after the first fall rainfall
    events until the end of winter. Conversely, positive deviations from the means
    start during the spring rainfalls until the beginning of summer, followed by practically
    0 values from beginning to mid-summer. 3.4 Contribution of time variant and invariant
    components to total variance Figure 4c,g shows soil moisture spatial variance
    and its decomposition into time-variant, and , and time-invariant, , terms (Equation
    5). Months after an extended period without rainfall, such as September and October
    2017, there is a very low standard deviation of absolute soil moisture (Figure
    4a,e, stage I). However, with the first precipitation events in November 2017
    (Figure 4a,e, stage II), spatial variability of soil moisture starts to increase
    up to an almost constant value until the arrival of moderate rainfall events during
    March and April in the beginning of stage III (Figure 4a) when soil moisture variability
    increases sharply and remains relatively constant until mid-summer (Figure 4a
    stage IV) when soil moisture drops. FIGURE 4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint

    soil moisture Stn (a,e), and temporal anomalies Atn of (b,f). Spatial variances
    of soil moisture, time invariant temporal means and temporal anomalies according
    to Equation (5) expressed in m3 m−3 (c,g) and as percentage (d,h). Vertical discontinuous
    lines separate the different stages. The highest variance of average Atn occurs
    during extreme periods with dry conditions in the late summer of 2017 and 2018
    (Figure 4b,f, stages I, and V) but also after moderate rainfalls in March 2018
    (stage III). Minimum values were observed during intermediate conditions when
    soil moistures of the individual stations are getting close to their average values
    (stage II in Figure 4b,f). Variance of the time-invariant terms, , is the highest
    contribution to the soil moisture spatial variance for most dates and depths except
    for very few days during spring and summer 2018, in which the covariance term
    gives the largest contribution at 0.35 m depth. Generally, the variability of
    anomalies, , contributes very little to the total variance. Only during the driest
    conditions at the beginning and the end of the monitoring period, does its contribution
    approach or exceed 100% of (Figure 4d,h). As it can be observed in Figure 4d,h,
    the covariance term has a similar temporal pattern with mean soil moisture, which
    according to Equation (5) is negative when the spatial mean of anomalies is negative.
    Therefore, the covariance term has a relevant role during specific periods, especially
    during the driest ones, similar to that of the temporal mean during the wettest
    days, mainly at the 0.35 m depth. 3.5 Relation between spatial variance and spatial
    mean of soil moisture and its components Figure 5 shows different relations between
    the spatial mean of soil moisture and anomalies versus statistical parameters.
    Temporal information is provided by colours that refer to the sampling month to
    explore potential time-dependencies in their patterns. The range of average soil
    moisture states is intermediate to dry, for example, less than 0.25 m3 m−3, which
    corresponds with the “dry branch” of the typical convex type of relation between
    spatial mean and variance of soil moisture (Famiglietti et al., 1998). Maximum
    values of the spatial variability lay within the range 0.02–0.03 in both cases.
    Spatial mean and variance of soil moisture at a depth of 0.50 m behave more linearly
    than at 0.35 m (Figure 5a,d). The time dependence is evident in both cases as
    observed from the arrangement of coloured points where sequences of points belong
    to data from the same or consecutive months. A hysteretic behaviour can be observed
    between the wetting, October 2017–April 2018, and the drying periods, April–September
    2018, especially at the 0.35 m depth. FIGURE 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Spatial variance of daily soil moisture plotted against its spatial mean (a,d),
    spatial coefficient of variation of daily soil moisture plotted against its spatial
    mean (b,e), spatial variance of daily anomalies plotted against its spatial mean
    (c,f). The different colours indicate daily data of the individual months. Dashed
    lines indicate hysteretic behaviour. The coefficient of variation of soil moisture
    generally shows a negative dependence on mean soil moisture (Figure 5b,e). Like
    in the previous case, less scattered data and less evident hysteretic response
    can be found at 0.5 m than at the 0.35 m depth. Also, here the time dependence
    is evident in both cases. Figure 5c,f illustrate soil moisture behaviour for both
    depths of the dynamic anomalies'' terms. Results show a parabolic shape with the
    lowest spatial variability of temporal anomalies for intermediate conditions where
    moisture contents are close to their temporal mean values, and a clear time dependence
    can also be observed. Maximum values approach the 0.005 (m3 m−3)2 threshold in
    both cases. However, at the 0.35 m depth, April and May 2018 show a differential
    and more scattered behaviour than the rest of the data points. Looking at the
    relation between the spatial variability of anomalies and the spatial variability
    of soil moisture (Figure 6), a clear concave upward relation comes out at both
    depths where minimum values of coincide with the spatial variability of the time-invariant
    soil moisture component, , (Figure 6a,d). Interestingly, larger slopes can be
    seen for than for with almost a linear relation for the last. Furthermore, little
    dispersion can be observed in the graphs except for a few data points corresponding
    to March and April 2018 during moderate rainfall events (p > 25 mm day−1, Figure
    3a). FIGURE 6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Spatial variance of temporal anomalies
    plotted against spatial variance of soil moisture (a,d). Spatial covariance of
    time-invariant mean and temporal anomalies plotted against (i) spatial variance

    Colours represent months and the horizontal dashed lines indicate the change between
    positive and negative correlation between and and the vertical dashed line indicates
    the minimum of spatial variance of temporal anomalies. A positive and almost linear
    relation can be observed between and , as shown in Figure 6b,e. Again, March and
    April 2018, with moderate rainfall events, give data points that behave differently.
    Also, a clear distinction can be established between data points from the beginning
    of March with and late March with . A parabolic relation can be identified between
    and with similar patterns at both depths (Figure 6c,f). A threshold value between
    −0.015 and −0.002 (m3m−3)2 establishes the change between the positive and negative
    correlation between and . The time dependence observed previously in Figures 4,
    5 is still evident, demonstrating a strong effect of time (or soil moisture state)
    on the variability of soil moisture and its time variant components. 3.6 Relation
    between spatial variance and spatial mean of soil moisture and its components
    Mean relative differences of soil moisture, , are presented in Figure 7a,e, where
    the reference value of 0 represents the average spatial mean. The range of mean
    relative differences was similar in both depths, ranging from −75% and −80% for
    the driest site Lisímetro to +125% and 130% in the wettest location Llanos at
    0.35 m and 0.50 m depths, respectively. Results show that Santa Olalla is the
    station with the soil moisture values closest to the spatial mean among the investigated
    locations at both depths. Noticeably, all stations have soil moisture values that
    are very far from the spatial mean on average, which is related to the large variability
    in the time-invariant term of soil moisture and the absence of a “transition”
    location that shares robust common features with the “dry” and “wet” groups of
    stations. FIGURE 7 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Rank stability plots of the

    be expected. Figure 8 shows the ranks of the decomposed , and . At the 0.35 m
    depth, these practically coincided with the ranks of . Only, Lisimetro and Cortafuegos
    switched their ranks in as compared to and as a consequence of the insignificant
    difference (at the p = 0.01 level) between their median values. On the other hand,
    the ranks of and were the same at the 0.50 m depth but differed from those of
    . Yet differences in and between Laguna Larga, Cortafuegos and Lisimetro were
    insignificant (at the p = 0.01 level), the station with the smallest value of
    , Llanos, was also the station with the largest . This differential ranking between
    the 0.35 and 0.50 m and between the time-variant and time-invariant terms at the
    0.50 m is most probably related to changes in the relevance of the different controls
    of soil moisture at the topsoil compared to the subsoil. FIGURE 8 Open in figure

    contributions of dynamic and static components to the spatial and temporal soil
    moisture variability in a wetland area in an arid climate through the analysis
    of the first and second order statistical moments. Compared to previous studies
    (Brocca et al., 2014; Dari et al., 2019; Mittelbach & Seneviratne, 2012; Peng
    et al., 2016; Rötzer et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2020), the present study is applied
    at a different scale, involving a considerably smaller area, e.g. representing
    an average area of 25 km2 per site., in a dryer climate where groundwater is an
    important control level on soil moisture dynamics. Although the number of sites
    under study could be relatively small to study the spatial structure of soil moisture
    variation, the number of sites per unit area is higher compared to Networks like
    SASMAS (Australia, eight stations for an area of 6500 km2) or SWISSMEX (Switzerland,
    14 stations for an area 32 000 km2) where spatial and temporal variability of
    soil moisture has been studied to analyse their controlling factors and degree
    of variability. The total number of installed sites in the DNP is higher than
    5, however, due to incomplete time series or very different installation depths
    they could not be considered for statistical data analysis in this study. Nevertheless,
    their soil moisture variability completely concurs with the selected five sites
    and therefore a larger number of sites would not change the results of this study.
    Furthermore, a large number of soil samples analysed in a previous study of Kohfahl
    et al. (2016) showed the low variability of physicochemical soil properties within
    their respective geological units. Absolute instead of relative values of soil
    moisture, such as the relative saturation or degree of saturation, were used.
    Therefore, prior knowledge about soil properties is not needed and the related
    measurements (time variant and invariant components can be related directly with
    other terms of the water balance). Not only that, but also it makes these results
    comparable with previous studies, for example, Brocca et al. (2014); Mittelbach
    and Seneviratne (2012). The decomposition of Stn into its time-variant (temporal
    anomalies) and time-invariant (temporal mean) components significantly improved
    the current understanding of the Stn spatio-temporal dynamics in this area. Temporal
    anomalies, Atn, show more similar patterns between stations than either the soil
    moisture or the time-invariant components, as observed in previous studies (Brocca
    et al., 2014; Dari et al., 2019; Mittelbach & Seneviratne, 2012; Peng et al.,
    2016; Rötzer et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2020). The temporal mean, Mtn, was also
    very helpful in understanding the differences between sites and the most important
    factor controlling Stn spatial variability in this region: the groundwater level.
    Similar sediment composition and hydraulic properties as well as almost identical
    meteorological patterns across the study area due to its small-scale make groundwater
    level the primary source of variability both spatially and temporally. Whereas
    the wet sites showed fast responses and reached saturated conditions during specific
    spring periods due to the rise in groundwater levels after rainy periods, the
    dry sites, due to a greater depth of groundwater, had low soil moisture values
    throughout the monitoring period with only small increments after prolonged rainfall
    periods (e.g. March–May 2018). Between these endmembers, one station (Santa Olalla)
    is influenced during certain periods by the groundwater level given its short
    distance to a nearby pond (Figure 1), as can be mainly observed from its Atn during
    April 2018 (Atn between 0.15 and 0.20 m3 m−3) matching with the piezometric level
    peak (Figure 3d,h). Average variability in Stn was similar at 0.35 m and 0.50 m
    depths. Previous studies have reported increasing variability with depth (Gao
    et al., 2015; Hu et al., 2010) and decreasing variability with depth (Cheng et
    al., 2017; Duan et al., 2017; Martinez et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2021). The difference
    between studies and soil properties, topography, and subsoil characteristics within
    each region are the reasons for the increase or decrease in soil moisture variability
    with depth that can explain the different conclusions obtained in other studies
    (Vanderlinden et al., 2012). More significant variability in Mtn in this study
    area at the 0.50 m depth is mainly due to the role of groundwater level that increases
    Mtn at Santa Olalla, Laguna Larga, and Llanos, which is less critical at the 0.35 m
    depth. The larger variability in Mtn at 0.5 m depth is partly compensated by smaller
    time-variant terms which results in a similar variability of Stn at both depths
    (Figures 3, 4). The spatial variability of soil moisture and anomalies showed
    different relations with spatial mean soil moisture (Figure 5). The typical positive
    relationship between and corresponding with dry to intermediate conditions agreed
    with previous studies (Brocca et al., 2010; Famiglietti et al., 1998; Martínez
    et al., 2014). Therefore, maximum variability in Stn corresponds with intermediate
    . The observed peak registered in our area may or may not represent the maximum
    soil moisture spatial variability value. However, during the study period, the
    meteorological patterns did not provide wetter conditions to evaluate whether
    variability can start decreasing after 0.2 m3 m−3 for the wettest soil moisture
    conditions registered in our area. Nevertheless, we observed maximum values of
    spatial variability in the same order of magnitude as the different soil moisture
    networks (250–150 000 km2) studied by Brocca et al. (2014) who attributed such
    variability to climate. In contrast, our study site, where spatial climatic variability
    is almost nonexistent, reaches such a degree of variability by means of the control
    imposed by groundwater on soil moisture. The pattern of, versus behaved differently
    compared to previous studies in Australia, Spain, and Switzerland (Brocca et al.,
    2014) and China (Gao et al., 2015), showing an evident concave upward relation.
    One possible reason for that is soil moisture monitoring depth; Brocca et al.
    (2014) studied the topsoil where more complex relations and fluxes occur compared
    to the subsoil, introducing additional variability sources. This is consistent
    with Gao et al. (2015), where the scattering in this relation decreases with increasing
    soil depth. However, soil type and climate do not seem to explain that, as no
    evident pattern can be extracted from the range of situations studied by Brocca
    et al. (2014). Interestingly, intermediate conditions present a minimum variability
    of Atn, which has implications for soil moisture data assimilation and calibration
    of environmental models (Brocca et al., 2014). Disruptive events such as rainfall
    periods break the continuity in the time dependence of the spatial variability,
    giving rise to hysteretic behaviour such as between the wetting, October 2017–April
    2018, and the drying periods, April–September 2018, especially at the 0.35 m depth
    (Figures 4, 5) consistent with previous studies (Fatichi et al., 2015; Martínez
    et al., 2014; Mascaro & Vivoni, 2016; Rosenbaum et al., 2012). Hysteretic patterns
    exhibit the relative contribution of biotic and abiotic factors in controlling
    the soil moisture spatial variability. Fatichi et al. (2015) suggest that under
    mediterranean conditions and relatively homogeneous soil the biotic factors mostly
    control the appearance of hysteresis during drier states (Figure 4a,d) and abiotic
    factors (physicochemical soil properties and groundwater levels in our case) during
    wetter states. In general, the time-invariant term, Mtn, had the most considerable
    contribution to the total variance of Stn (Figure 4), as previously observed in
    other studies (Brocca et al., 2014; Dari et al., 2019; Gao et al., 2015; Mittelbach
    & Seneviratne, 2012; Peng et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2020). The contribution of
    the time-invariant component was primarily dependent on season or, more specifically,
    on soil moisture conditions. During almost a half of the period studied, the contribution
    of to exceeded 100%, compensated with the reduction of spatial variability introduced
    by the covariance term. The variability of anomalies is practically irrelevant
    during most of the monitoring period, except for extreme dry and wet conditions.
    Conversely, during specific moments in the wet season, at 0.35 m depth, the covariance
    term contributes the most and positively to . It highlights the different roles
    of controls acting on both groups of stations and the wide range of conditions
    within this study area, even though the scale is relatively small (approximately
    125 km2). In large-scale studies where only topsoil is explored, for example,
    Brocca et al. (2014) and Rötzer et al. (2015), the time-invariant term is almost
    always the most significant contributor to soil moisture variability and generally
    attributed to climatic variability. This is especially evident from remote sensing
    studies, where small-scale heterogeneities cannot be captured effectively. This
    study shows that even though groundwater level depth is a time-variant variable,
    it significantly affects soil moisture''s time-variant and time-invariant terms.
    On the one hand, the position of the capillary fringe with regard to the sensor
    depths determines the large difference in the time-invariant term of soil moisture
    between sites, creating a dry group and a wet group, as soil properties, vegetation,
    topography, and rainfall variability have a weaker influence on the differences
    between sites in this region. Nevertheless, on the other hand, groundwater level,
    as a dynamic state variable, generates variability in the time-variant terms of
    soil moisture, especially when soil dries and groundwater levels go down, in the
    influencing locations giving rise to some variability in the time-variant terms
    that have a negative correlation with soil moisture during these periods. 5 CONCLUSIONS
    AND OUTLOOK This study provides an enhanced understanding of the behaviour of
    time invariant spatial variabilities and temporal anomalies of soil moisture variability
    under very different conditions compared to previous studies. The results of the
    statistical and temporal stability analysis of a coastal wetland of southwestern
    Spain are summarized as follows: Groundwater level evolution is the primary control
    of soil moisture variability, in contrast to a large number of previous studies.
    Results at the two different depths are very similar except that the time-invariant
    component shows a slightly higher variability at 0.5 m depth than at 0.35 m, whereas
    the time variant variability is higher at 0.35 m depth. The time-invariant term,
    Mtn, makes the most considerable contribution to the total variance of Stn. The
    spatial variability of temporal anomalies is much lower than the soil moisture
    data. The time-variant terms, especially for the case of the covariance between
    soil moisture anomalies and time-invariant soil moisture means, have a considerable
    effect on soil moisture variability under extreme conditions. The spatial standard
    deviation shows a minimum for intermediate moisture conditions when temporal anomalies
    with regard to the long-term mean are considered. This is an interesting feature
    and possibly indicates that the local features (e.g. soil properties) play a more
    significant role for soil moisture dynamics during extreme conditions. The ranks
    of soil moisture differences correspond mostly with the ranks of time-invariant
    soil moisture differences. Therefore, soil moisture variability is mostly controlled
    by time-invariant soil moisture differences. In contrast, time-variant soil moisture
    has only a minor influence and therefore their ranks are not consistent with the
    ranks of soil moisture differences and time-invariant soil moisture differences.
    During wetting periods, the variance increases with gaps in the daily mean of
    the spatial soil moisture leading to scattering. This is attributed to the discontinuous
    progression of wetting due to moderate rainfall events because the wetting front
    is not descending as a homogeneous surface. In contrast, the variance decreases
    more regularly during drying periods without gaps. The results of this study are
    in good agreement with the published research. The study reveals the importance
    of the soil moisture dynamics instead of absolute values which is very useful
    for modelling applications which can be better calibrated to predict for example
    soil moisture dynamics in future climate scenarios. Furthermore, it delivers a
    clear improvement for evaluating remotely sensed soil moisture products and a
    valuable data source for different kinds of numerical tools such as climate or
    groundwater models. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work has been financed by the CLIGRO

  description: The shortage of water stands as a global challenge, prompting considerable
    focus on the management of water consumption and irrigation. The suggestion is
    to introduce a smart irrigation system based on wireless sensor networks (WSNs)
    aimed at minimizing water consumption while maintaining the quality of agricultural
    crops. In WSNs deployed in smart irrigation, accurately determining the locations
    of sensor nodes is crucial for efficient monitoring and control. However, in many
    cases, the exact positions of certain sensor nodes may be unknown. To address
    this challenge, this paper presents a new localization method for localizing unknown
    sensor nodes in WSN-based smart irrigation systems using estimated range measurements.
    The proposed method can accurately determine the positions of unknown nodes, even
    when they are located at a distance from anchors. It utilizes the Levenberg–Marquardt
    (LM) optimization algorithm to solve a nonlinear least-squares problem and minimize
    the error in estimating the unknown node locations. By leveraging the known positions
    of a subset of sensor nodes and the inexact distance measurements between pairs
    of nodes, the localization problem is transformed into a nonlinear optimization
    problem. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive simulations
    and experiments were conducted. The results demonstrate that the proposed method
    achieves accurate localization of the unknown sensor nodes. Specifically, it achieves
    19% and 58% improvement in estimation accuracy when compared to distance vector-hop
    (DV-Hop) and semidefinite relaxation-LM (SDR-LM) algorithms, respectively. Additionally,
    the method exhibits robustness against measurement noise and scalability for large-scale
    networks. Ultimately, integrating the proposed localization method into the smart
    irrigation system has the potential to achieve approximately 28% reduction in
    water consumption.

    1. Introduction The global challenge of water scarcity is a pressing issue. Consequently,
    there is considerable emphasis on water consumption and irrigation management.
    Conventional agricultural irrigation involves a significant amount of water usage
    [1]. Hence, there is a growing need to explore smart agriculture approaches designed
    to diminish water consumption without compromising the quality of agricultural
    crops. Smart irrigation, driven by advancements in technology, holds great promise
    for optimizing water consumption and increasing crop productivity. One of the
    key technologies enabling smart irrigation is wireless sensor networks (WSNs)
    [2]. These networks comprise spatially distributed sensor nodes that collect and
    transmit data on environmental conditions such as soil moisture, humidity, and
    temperature. In the context of smart irrigation systems, WSNs play a crucial role
    in monitoring and controlling these environmental parameters, facilitating efficient
    water usage and targeted crop management [3]. WSNs offer several advantages in
    the domain of smart irrigation. Firstly, they enable real-time and continuous
    monitoring of environmental variables, allowing farmers to receive decisions concerning
    irrigation schedules, fertilizer application, and pest management. This data-driven
    approach enhances precision irrigation practices by enabling tailored interventions
    at the individual plant level. Secondly, WSNs eliminate the need for manual data
    collection, reducing labor costs and improving operational efficiency. Additionally,
    WSNs provide a scalable and cost-effective solution, as they can be deployed over
    large agricultural areas, covering extensive farmlands [4,5,6]. Accurate localization
    of sensor nodes within the WSNs is crucial for achieving the desired precision
    and effectiveness of smart irrigation systems. Node localization is the process
    of identifying the physical positions of the sensor nodes within the network.
    Precise node localization enables spatially aware monitoring and control, allowing
    for targeted actions based on the specific conditions of different areas within
    the agricultural field [7,8]. For example, localized data on soil moisture levels
    can be utilized to implement irrigation strategies that precisely deliver water
    where and when it is needed, minimizing wastage and optimizing plant growth. The
    localization of sensor nodes in WSNs has been a subject of extensive research
    due to its critical role in various applications, including smart irrigation systems.
    Traditional localization techniques rely on Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers
    or manual surveying methods, which may not be feasible or economical for large-scale
    deployments. Moreover, these methods often assume that the positions of all nodes
    are known or can be accurately measured. However, in practical scenarios, it is
    common to have a subset of nodes with known positions while the locations of other
    nodes remain unknown or imprecisely known [9,10]. The problem of localizing unknown
    nodes in WSNs has garnered significant attention due to its relevance in various
    applications [11,12,13,14,15,16,17]. In the context of smart agriculture, accurate
    localization of the unknown nodes allows for complete coverage and spatially aware
    decision-making. This capability permits precise and controlled water distribution
    to designated regions within agricultural fields. Through accurate identification
    of sensor node positions, the system adjusts irrigation strategies in response
    to real-time data, ensuring targeted water delivery at optimal times and locations.
    Such localization accuracy effectively minimizes water waste, mitigates the risk
    of over-irrigation, and facilitates customized irrigation scheduling. By estimating
    the coordinates of the unknown nodes based on their range measurements to anchor
    nodes with known positions, the overall network performance can be improved, resulting
    in more effective resource allocation and optimized irrigation strategies [18].
    In this paper, we address the challenge of localizing unknown sensor nodes in
    WSN-based smart irrigation systems. We propose a new localization method that
    can minimize the error in node localization. The proposed method utilizes multi-hop
    localization concept presented in [9] to accurately determine the positions of
    unknown nodes, even when they are located at a far distance from anchors. The
    range measurements are derived from the estimated distances between pairs of sensor
    nodes, typically obtained from received signal strength (RSS) measurements. By
    formulating the problem as a nonlinear least- squares optimization task, the proposed
    method leverages the Levenberg–Marquardt (LM) optimization algorithm to reduce
    the error in estimating the node locations. Through extensive simulations and
    experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed
    method. The results highlight its potential for practical implementation in real-world
    smart irrigation applications, ultimately contributing to sustainable resource
    management and increased crop yields. The motivation behind this research is twofold.
    Firstly, accurate localization of all sensor nodes enables fine-grained monitoring
    and control, facilitating precise water allocation and targeted interventions
    in smart irrigation systems. Secondly, the localization method presented in this
    paper can be extended to various applications beyond smart irrigation, where the
    availability of accurate node positions is essential for efficient operation and
    decision-making. The key contributions of this work can be summarized as follows:
    Proposing a new localization method to localize unknown nodes in WSN-based smart
    irrigation systems using range measurements and the LM optimization algorithm.
    Demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method through extensive simulations
    and experiments, highlighting accurate node localization amidst measurement noise
    and even when nodes are situated far from anchors. Highlighting the scalability
    of the proposed method for large-scale networks, showcasing its potential for
    practical implementation in real-world scenarios. Calculating the reduction in
    water consumption achieved through the implementation of the proposed localization
    method in the smart irrigation system. Table 1 provides a comprehensive list of
    the abbreviations and definitions utilized in this paper. Table 1. Abbreviation

    proposed method along with problem formulation and the mathematical framework
    for localizing unknown nodes using range measurements. This section also outlines
    the steps of the LM optimization algorithm. Section 4 presents the simulation

    the paper and suggests potential avenues for future research. 2. Related Work
    In this section, we provide a summary of the existing literature on node localization
    techniques in WSNs. Localization plays a crucial role in WSNs by enabling spatial
    awareness and precise monitoring in various applications, including smart irrigation
    systems. Numerous methods and algorithms have been proposed to address the node
    localization problem, aiming to achieve accurate and efficient localization results.
    We categorize the related work into three main approaches: range-based, range-free,
    and hybrid localization techniques [19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28]. Range-based
    localization techniques rely on distance or range measurements between sensor
    nodes to estimate their positions [19,20,21,22]. The authors in [19] consider
    the RSS method for location identification. In [20], an unconventional localization
    method employing the least-squares method was presented. The localization of target
    nodes is achieved in [21] through the combined utilization of angle-of-arrival
    (AOA) and RSS measures. In [22] the authors use time-of-arrival (TOA), time-difference-of-arrival
    (TDOA), and the Chan algorithm to coordinate the unknown sensors. For instance,
    the well-known GPS is a range-based localization technique widely used in outdoor
    environments. However, GPS is not suitable for obstructed environments, making
    it less practical for smart irrigation systems. Moreover, equipping each sensor
    node with GPS receivers incurs significant expenses. Range-free localization techniques,
    on the other hand, do not rely on distance measurements but instead exploit connectivity
    information between sensor nodes to estimate their positions [23,24]. One common
    range-free approach is the centroid algorithm, which calculates the centroid of
    a set of anchor nodes to estimate the position of a target node [23]. Another
    range-free method is the distance vector-hop (DV-Hop) algorithm, which utilizes
    hop-count information and communication range to estimate distances between nodes
    [24]. These range-free techniques are often computationally efficient but may
    sacrifice localization accuracy compared to range-based methods. Hybrid localization
    techniques aim to combine the strengths of both range-based and range-free approaches
    to achieve more accurate and robust localization results [25,26]. These methods
    typically leverage both distance measurements and connectivity information. For
    instance, the iterative triangulation and trilateration (ITT) algorithm combines
    triangulation using distance measurements and trilateration using range-free connectivity
    information [25]. By leveraging the complementary nature of these two approaches,
    hybrid techniques can improve localization accuracy and overcome the limitations
    of individual methods [26]. The work in [9] proposes a regularized least-squares
    multi-hops localization algorithm specifically designed for WSNs. The algorithm
    aims to improve localization accuracy by incorporating both range-based and range-free
    localization techniques. The authors recognize the limitations of individual localization
    methods and propose a hybrid approach that integrates the advantages of range-based
    and range-free techniques. They introduce a regularization term to the least-squares
    optimization problem, which helps to mitigate errors and uncertainties in range
    measurements and connectivity information. By iteratively solving the optimization
    problem, the algorithm estimates the positions of unknown nodes based on the observed
    range measurements and connectivity information from neighboring nodes. While
    the work in [10] focuses on addressing the localization challenge in WSNs, our
    proposed approach complements this work by specifically targeting the localization
    of unknown sensor nodes in WSN-based smart irrigation systems. Our method leverages
    range measurements and the LM method to minimize localization errors and enable
    accurate positioning of the unknown nodes. Through extensive simulations and experiments,
    we showcase the effectiveness and scalability of our approach, contributing to
    the body of knowledge in localization techniques for smart irrigation applications.
    While various localization techniques have been proposed for WSNs, few studies
    specifically address the problem of localizing unknown nodes in the context of
    smart irrigation systems. The localization methods developed for smart irrigation
    systems often rely on known anchor nodes with GPS receivers or manual surveys.
    However, outfitting every sensor node with GPS receivers incurs significant costs.
    Moreover, in practical scenarios, the locations of some sensor nodes may be unknown
    or imprecisely known. This presents a unique challenge that requires specialized
    localization algorithms to estimate the positions of these unknown nodes. In this
    work, we propose a new method that addresses the challenge of localizing unknown
    sensor nodes in WSN-based smart irrigation systems. By utilizing range measurements
    and leveraging the LM optimization algorithm, our method aims to minimize the
    error in estimating the node locations. Through extensive simulations and experiments,
    we demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method, showcasing
    its potential for practical implementation in real-world smart irrigation applications.
    In the following section, we present the problem formulation and describe the
    mathematical framework for our proposed localization method. We then provide details
    on our approach, emphasizing the utilization of the LM algorithm for accurate
    node localization. 3. Proposed Localization Method A smart irrigation system based
    on WSNs presents a contemporary and forward-thinking approach to achieving efficient
    and sustainable irrigation practices. This system integrates a network of N sensors
    strategically positioned within the soil, plants, and environment to monitor and
    gather crucial data concerning soil moisture, temperature, humidity, rainfall,
    and other pertinent parameters. Within our WSN, the locations of K sensor nodes
    are known, while the exact positions of the remaining M = N − K nodes are unknown.
    Nonetheless, we can overcome this challenge by employing a nonlinear least-squares
    approach to predict the locations of the unknown M nodes. The locations of these
    sensor nodes must be determined from the distances to nearby nodes (for example,
    estimated from the strength of signals received from those nodes). This section
    introduces the proposed method for localizing unknown sensor nodes in WSN-based
    smart irrigation systems using estimated range measurements. The proposed method
    effectively determines the positions of unknown nodes, even when they are distanced
    from anchors. The procedures of the proposed method are divided into two stages:
    the first stage is to formulate distance estimation into a nonlinear least-squares
    problem. Then, in the second stage, we apply the LM optimization algorithm to
    address this problem and minimize errors in estimating the unknown node locations.
    The next two subsections explain these procedures. 3.1. Nonlinear Least-Squares
    Problem Formulation The distance measurements can be represented by an undirected
    graph, as shown in Figure 1. In this figure, the number of vertices in the graph
    is N. The first M = N − K vertices represent the nodes with unknown positions.
    These nodes are denoted as the free nodes. The last K vertices are the nodes with
    known positions and are the anchor nodes. Figure 1. Network model example with
    9 anchor nodes (squares), 21 free nodes (circles), and 98 edges. The node coordinates
    are denoted as follows: 𝑝 1 =( 𝑥 1 , 𝑦 1 ),  𝑝 2 =( 𝑥 2 , 𝑦 2 ), …,𝑝 𝑁 =( 𝑥 𝑁
    , 𝑦 𝑁 ), (1) In Equation (1), the vectors p1, …, pN−K are the unknowns in the
    problem where the vectors pN−K+1, …, pN give the positions of the anchor nodes
    that are known. The RSS technique based on the radio propagation path loss model
    [27,28] is used to estimate the distance between a free node and an anchor node.
    The RSS in dBm within the log-normal shadow-fading model is expressed as [18]:
    RSS dBm ( 𝑑 𝑛𝑚 )= 𝑃 0 dBm ( 𝑑 𝑟 )−10𝛾 log 10 ( 𝑑 𝑛𝑚 𝑑 𝑟 )− 𝑆 𝜎 (2) where P0 represents
    the RSS at a reference distance dr, γ is the path loss exponent, dnm is the true
    distance between mth free node and nth anchor node, and Sσ denotes the log-normal
    shadowing effects, which follow a Gaussian distribution with a mean of zero and
    a variance of σ2. Using Equation (2), the estimated distance can be written as:
    𝑑 ̂  𝑛𝑚 = 𝑑 𝑟 log −1 10 ( 𝑃 0 dBm ( 𝑑 𝑟 )− RSS dBm ( 𝑑 𝑛𝑚 ) 10𝛾 ) (3) The edges
    in Figure 1 indicate the pairs of nodes for which a distance measurement is available.
    There are L edges, denoted by (i1, j1), …, (iL, jL). The L distance measurements
    are given as follows: 𝑑 𝑙 =‖ 𝑑 𝑖 𝑙 −𝑑 𝑗 𝑙 ‖+ 𝜀 𝑙 , 𝑙=1,2,…,𝐿 (4) where εl represents
    the measurement error. To estimate the location of the free nodes, we minimize
    the error function as follows: ∑ 𝐿 𝑙=1 (‖ 𝑑 𝑖 𝑙 −𝑑 𝑗 𝑙 ‖− 𝑑 𝑙 ) 2 = ∑ 𝐿 𝑙=1 (
    ( 𝑥 𝑖 𝑙 − 𝑥 𝑗 𝑙 ) 2 + ( 𝑦 𝑖 𝑙 −𝑦 𝑗 𝑙 ) 2 − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − −
    √ − 𝑑 𝑙 ) 2 (5) Equation (5) represents a nonlinear least-squares problem with
    variables x1, x2, …, xN−K and y1, y2, …, yN−K. Thus, we can conclude that our
    cost function f(u(l)) is as follows: 𝑓( 𝑢 (𝑙) )= ( 𝑥 𝑖 𝑙 − 𝑥 𝑗 𝑙 ) 2 + ( 𝑦 𝑖 𝑙
    −𝑦 𝑗 𝑙 ) 2 − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − √ − 𝑑 𝑙 (6) In Equation (4),
    we consider the points at the l-th iteration. As a result, utilizing the LM algorithm,
    we should try to minimize the following: ‖𝑓( 𝑢 (𝑙) )+𝐷𝑓( 𝑢 (𝑙) )(𝑢− 𝑢 (𝑙) )‖ 2
    + 𝜆 (𝑙) ‖𝑢− 𝑢 (𝑙) ‖ 2 (7) where D represents the Jacobian matrix, as explained
    in the next section, and λ is the regularization parameter. Thus, from our minimizing
    function in (6) and (7), the unknown positions can be formulated as a nonlinear
    least-squares problem. The solution of this problem is computed as follows: 𝑢
    ̂  = 𝑢 (𝑙) − ( 𝐴 𝑇 𝐴+ 𝜆 (𝑙) 𝐼) −1 𝐴 𝑇 𝑓( 𝑢 (𝑙) ) (8) where I represents the identity
    matrix, (.)T is the matrix transpose, and 𝐴=𝐷𝑓( 𝑢 (𝑙) ) . The algorithm will continue
    to run until the termination condition is satisfied, which is: ∇𝑔( 𝑢 (𝑙) )=2 𝐴
    𝑇 𝑓( 𝑢 (𝑙) )≤ 10 −5 (9) 3.2. Levenberg–Marquardt Optimization Algorithm A crucial
    step in executing the LM algorithm involves the computation of the Jacobian matrix.
    Recall the definition of the Jacobian matrix, as follows: 𝐷𝑓(𝑧)= ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢
    ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ 𝑑 𝑓 1 𝑑 𝑚 1 (𝑧) 𝑑 𝑓 2 𝑑 𝑚 1 (𝑧) 𝑑 𝑓 1 𝑑 𝑚 2 (𝑧) 𝑑 𝑓 2 𝑑 𝑚 2 (𝑧) ⋮ ⋮ 𝑑 𝑓
    𝑛 𝑑 𝑚 1 (𝑧) 𝑑 𝑓 𝑛 𝑑 𝑚 2 (𝑧) ⋯ ⋯ ⋱ ⋯ 𝑑 𝑓 1 𝑑 𝑚 𝑛 (𝑧) 𝑑 𝑓 2 𝑑 𝑚 𝑛 (𝑧) ⋮ 𝑑 𝑓 𝑛 𝑑
    𝑚 𝑛 (𝑧) ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ (10) In the considered WSN, m1, m2, …, mn in (10)
    refer to x1, x2, …, xN−K and y1, y2, …, yN−K, with function f(z) defined in (6).
    It is clear that the matrix 𝐷𝑓(𝑧)∈𝕀 ℝ L×2(N−K) , as we have a row for each of
    the L edges, and we have 2(N − K) variables. Regarding the actual matrix entries
    themselves, there are four possible derivatives we could require in each row,
    with the rest of the entries in that row being 0. The four possible derivative
    expressions are listed in Equation (11): ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ 𝑑𝑓( 𝑢 (𝑙)
    ) 𝑑 𝑥 𝑖 𝑙 𝑑𝑓( 𝑢 (𝑙) ) 𝑑 𝑥 𝑗 𝑙 𝑑𝑓( 𝑢 (𝑙) ) 𝑑 𝑦 𝑖 𝑙 𝑑𝑓( 𝑢 (𝑙) ) 𝑑 𝑦 𝑗 𝑙 ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥
    ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ = ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ( 𝑥 𝑖 𝑙 − 𝑥 𝑗 𝑙 )
    ( 𝑥 𝑖 𝑙 − 𝑥 𝑗 𝑙 ) 2 + ( 𝑦 𝑖 𝑙 −𝑦 𝑗 𝑙 ) 2 √ −( 𝑥 𝑖 𝑙 − 𝑥 𝑗 𝑙 ) ( 𝑥 𝑖 𝑙 − 𝑥 𝑗 𝑙
    ) 2 + ( 𝑦 𝑖 𝑙 −𝑦 𝑗 𝑙 ) 2 √ ( 𝑦 𝑖 𝑙 − 𝑦 𝑗 𝑙 ) ( 𝑥 𝑖 𝑙 − 𝑥 𝑗 𝑙 ) 2 + ( 𝑦 𝑖 𝑙 −𝑦
    𝑗 𝑙 ) 2 √ −( 𝑦 𝑖 𝑙 − 𝑦 𝑗 𝑙 ) ( 𝑥 𝑖 𝑙 − 𝑥 𝑗 𝑙 ) 2 + ( 𝑦 𝑖 𝑙 −𝑦 𝑗 𝑙 ) 2 √ ⎤ ⎦ ⎥
    ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ (11) However, we can clearly notice that we have
    four possible conditions, as follows: both nodes are anchors, one of the two nodes
    are anchors (either the first node in the edge or the second node), and neither
    of the two nodes are anchors. In the following, we consider each condition separately.
    If the i-th edge contains nodes that are both anchors, the Jacobian matrix row
    is all zeros, since both variables are known (assuming points at the l-th iteration):
    ∇ 𝑓 𝑖 ( 𝑢 (𝑙) ) 𝑇 =[ 0 0 ⋯ 0 ] (12) If the i-th edge contains one anchor node,
    the Jacobian matrix row will contain the derivatives with respect to the unknown
    node, with the rest of the entries in that row being 0 (assuming points at the
    l-th iteration), node 2 as anchor: ∇ 𝑓 𝑖 ( 𝑢 (𝑙) ) 𝑇 =[ 0 0 ⋯ 0 𝑑𝑓( 𝑢 (𝑙) ) 𝑑
    𝑥 𝑖 𝑙 0 ⋯ 0 𝑑𝑓( 𝑢 (𝑙) ) 𝑑 𝑦 𝑖 𝑙 0 ⋯ 0 ] (13) Node 1 as anchor: ∇ 𝑓 𝑖 ( 𝑢 (𝑙) )
    𝑇 =[ 0 0 ⋯ 0 𝑑𝑓( 𝑢 (𝑙) ) 𝑑 𝑥 𝑗 𝑙 0 ⋯ 0 𝑑𝑓( 𝑢 (𝑙) ) 𝑑 𝑦 𝑗 𝑙 0 ⋯ 0 ] (14) The final
    condition among the four occurs if the i-th edge contains no anchor nodes, in
    which our Jacobian matrix row will contain the derivatives with respect to both
    of the unknown nodes (i.e., a potential of four non-zero elements in the row),
    all assuming points at the l-th iteration: ∇ 𝑓 𝑖 ( 𝑢 (𝑙) ) 𝑇 =[ 0 ⋯ 𝑑𝑓( 𝑢 (𝑙)
    ) 𝑑 𝑥 𝑖 𝑙 ⋯ 𝑑𝑓( 𝑢 (𝑙) ) 𝑑 𝑥 𝑗 𝑙 ⋯ 𝑑𝑓( 𝑢 (𝑙) ) 𝑑 𝑦 𝑖 𝑙 ⋯ 𝑑𝑓( 𝑢 (𝑙) ) 𝑑 𝑦 𝑗 𝑙 ⋯
    0 ] (15) The Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm steps can be summarized as follows:
    Step 1: In each iteration of the algorithm, we first compute 𝑓( 𝑢 (𝑙) ) , and
    then the Jacobian matrix 𝐷𝑓( 𝑢 (𝑙) ) row by row, with each row being evaluated
    for one of the four conditions described above. Step 2: Next, within the iteration,
    the code computes both ‖∇𝑔(𝑢)‖ and 𝑢 ̂  , in order to evaluate 𝑓( 𝑢 ̂  ) in comparison
    with 𝑓( 𝑢 (𝑙) ) . Depending on this calculation, the algorithm updates u(l+1)
    and λ(l+1) as follows: 𝑢 (𝑙+1) = ⎧ ⎩ ⎨   𝑢 ̂  ,  𝑖𝑓  ‖𝑓( 𝑢 ̂  )‖ 2 < ‖𝑓( 𝑢 (𝑙)
    )‖ 2 𝑢 (𝑙) , 𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒 (16) 𝜆 (𝑙+1) = ⎧ ⎩ ⎨   𝛽 1 𝜆 (𝑙)   𝑖𝑓  ‖𝑓( 𝑢 ̂  )‖ 2
    < ‖𝑓( 𝑢 (𝑙) )‖ 2 𝛽 2 𝜆 (𝑙) ,    𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒 (17) Step 3: If ∇𝑔( 𝑢 (𝑙) )=2 𝐴 𝑇 𝑓(
    𝑢 (𝑙) )≤ 10 −5 , then the algorithm will terminate out of the loop and return
    the calculated estimated coordinates of the unknown sensor nodes. Step 4: If the
    condition in step 3 is not satisfied, go to step 1. The following flow chart summarizes
    the proposed method steps and is indicated by Figure 2. Figure 2. Flow chart of
    the proposed method. 4. Results and Discussion In this section, MATLAB (R2022b)
    programming is used to execute the proposed method to predict the estimated coordinates
    of the unknown sensor nodes in the considered WSN. The algorithm will continue
    to run until the termination condition, ∇𝑔( 𝑢 (𝑙) )≤ 10 −5 , is satisfied. The
    first input argument N is the number of nodes in the network, and it varies according
    to the considered network scale. This includes K = 9 anchor nodes, positioned
    as in Figure 1. The N − 9 free nodes are placed randomly in a square area with
    size 100 × 100 m2. Two nodes are connected by an edge if their distance is less
    than or equal to normalized R. Figure 1 presents an example with N = 30 and the
    node communication range, R = 40 m. The first output argument E is an L × 2 array,
    specifying the L edges. The two entries of row l are il and jl, the nodes connected
    by edge l. The output argument is an N × 2 array with the coordinates of the N
    nodes. Typical values of β1 and β2 are β1 = 0.8 and β2 = 2. Table 2 summarizes
    the simulation parameters. Table 2. Simulation parameters. 4.1. Effect of Network
    Scale In this subsection, we study the effects of network scale on the performance
    of the proposed method. 4.1.1. Small-Scale Network We consider a small-scale network
    with N = 50 nodes, 9 of them are anchor nodes with known and fixed locations as
    follows: [(0, 0), (50, 0), (100, 0), (0, 50), (50, 50), (100, 50), (0, 100), (50,
    100), (100, 100)]. The free 41 nodes are placed randomly in a square area with
    size 100 × 100 m2. Figure 3 presents the estimation of the sensor coordinate using
    the proposed method. The open circles (blue) are the exact positions, while the
    filled circles (green) are the estimated positions. This figure indicates the
    accuracy of the proposed method in estimating the unknown location of the free
    nodes. Figure 3. Least-squares estimate of the sensor coordinate using N = 50.
    4.1.2. Medium-Scale Network In this part, we check the accuracy of the proposed
    method when increasing the number of network nodes to N =100 nodes. For fair comparison,
    we use 9 anchor nodes at the same location as in the small-scale case, i.e., there
    are 91 unknown free nodes. Figure 4 shows the estimated positions versus the exact
    positions, considering a medium-scale network (N = 100). This figure indicates
    the accuracy of the proposed method, even for a large number of free nodes. Figure
    4. Least-squares estimate of the sensor coordinate using N = 100. 4.1.3. Large-Scale
    Network Now we consider a large-scale network with N = 200 nodes, as shown in
    Figure 5. The obtained result in this figure ensures the ability of the proposed
    method to accurately estimate the position of the free nodes, even for a large-scale
    network. Figure 5. Least-squares estimate of the sensor coordinate using N = 200.
    Figure 6 presents the cost function versus number of iterations for the three
    network scenarios. As expected, the large-scale network requires the largest cost
    function compared to the other networks. Figure 6. Cost function versus number
    of iterations for 3 network scenarios. 4.2. Effect of Changing the Anchor Node
    Locations In this subsection, we study the effect of changing the position of
    the anchor nodes on the accuracy of position estimation using the proposed method.
    The 9 anchor nodes new location is located around the network center, as follows:
    [(20, 20), (50, 20), (80, 20), (20, 50), (50, 50), (80, 50), (20, 80), (50, 80),
    (80, 80)]. Figure 7 presents the least-squares estimate of the sensor coordinate
    using the three network scenarios considered above, i.e., N = 50 (a), 100 (b),
    and 200 (c). This figure indicates that the accuracy of the proposed method is
    affected by changing the anchor node’s location. However, the reduction in estimation
    accuracy is small, which ensures the robustness of the proposed method. The anchor
    node’s new location is around the network center; therefore, its accuracy becomes
    less than that at network boundaries. This figure also shows that as the number
    of free nodes increases from 50 to 200, the proposed method’s estimation accuracy
    decreases. Figure 7. Effect of changing the position of anchor nodes on the accuracy
    of the proposed method. (a) N = 50; (b) N = 100; (c) N = 200. 4.3. Performance
    Comparison In this subsection we compare the performance of the proposed method
    with other localization algorithms presented in the literature, such as improvement
    of the DV-Hop algorithm [9] and SDR+LM algorithm [9]. For fair comparison, we
    use the average localization error (ALE) presented in [10] and given as: ALE=
    ∑ 𝑁−𝐾 𝑖=1 ( 𝑥 ̂  𝑖 − 𝑥 𝑖 ) 2 + ( 𝑦 ̂  𝑖 − 𝑦 𝑖 ) 2 𝑁−𝐾 − − − − − − − − − − − −
    − − − − − − − √ (18) where N − K represents the number of free nodes (unknown
    position nodes), ( 𝑥 𝑖 , 𝑥𝑦 𝑖 ) and ( 𝑥 ̂  𝑖 , 𝑦 ̂  𝑖 ) are the exact and the
    estimated locations, respectively of node i. Figure 8 presents a comparison between
    the proposed method and the algorithms presented in [9,10] using the above-mentioned
    parameters and the large-scale network case. As explained above, the open circles
    (blue) are the exact positions, while the filled circles (green) are the estimated
    positions, and the black straight line that connects between the two circle types
    represents the positioning error. This figure indicates that the proposed method
    achieves the lowest localization error when compared to the other algorithms.
    Figure 8. Performance comparison between the proposed method (a), DV-Hop algorithm
    [9] (b), and SDR+LM algorithm [10] (c). In Figure 9, we study the effect of changing
    the number of anchor nodes on the accuracy of the location estimation of the proposed
    method. We consider the case of N = 200 nodes and R = 40. This figure presents
    the ALE versus the number of anchor nodes for the proposed method and the localization
    algorithms cited above [9,10]. Figure 9. ALE versus number of anchor nodes for
    the proposed method and the localization algorithms [9,10]. The depicted figure
    illustrates a clear trend wherein the ALE diminishes with an increase in the number
    of anchor nodes. This observation can be attributed to the deliberate augmentation
    of anchor nodes within the network, while keeping the total number of nodes constant.
    This augmentation is intended to reduce the hop count between the anchors and
    unknown nodes. As a result, the estimated distance between an anchor and an unknown
    node more accurately corresponds to the actual distance, leading to a decrease
    in the average positioning error. Additionally, the figure demonstrates that the
    proposed method yields a lower localization error compared to all other algorithms
    considered in the comparison. At a number of anchor nodes of 9, the proposed method
    achieves 19% and 58% improvement in estimation accuracy, respectively, when compared
    to the above-cited localization algorithms [9,10]. Where these algorithms estimate
    the positions of unknown nodes based on the observed range measurements and connectivity
    information from neighboring nodes, this reduces the estimation accuracy and increases
    the computational accuracy of these algorithms, while the proposed method is based
    on the LM estimation algorithm, which is more accurate than range-free localization
    algorithms. 4.4. Water Consumption Calculation Accurate sensor node localization
    is integral to the efficient functioning of a smart irrigation system and plays
    a crucial role in optimizing water consumption. In a smart irrigation network
    based on WSNs, precise knowledge of sensor node locations enables targeted and
    controlled water distribution to specific areas of agricultural fields. By accurately
    determining the positions of sensor nodes, the system can adapt irrigation strategies
    based on real-time data, ensuring that water is delivered precisely where and
    when it is needed. This localization precision minimizes water wastage, prevents
    over-irrigation, and allows for the implementation of tailored irrigation schedules.
    Consequently, the synergy between accurate sensor node localization and water
    consumption in a smart irrigation system leads to improved resource efficiency,
    reduced environmental impact, and sustainable agricultural practices. Due to the
    accuracy achieved by the proposed method, it is expected that smart irrigation
    with the proposed method can reduce the amount of water consumption when compared
    to other methods. The efficacy of irrigation relies on monitoring environmental
    conditions and plant requirements. This is due to the fact that plant water requirements
    are influenced by factors such as temperature, moisture levels, precipitation,
    and soil moisture. The values of these factors depend mainly on the accuracy of
    sensor node localization. Therefore, it is expected that the implementation of
    the smart irrigation system using the proposed method will result in a reduction
    in water consumption compared to alternative methods. Figure 10 illustrates a
    comparison among the methods examined in this paper concerning water consumption
    during one day for a small-scale network [1,29,30]. In this figure, we considered
    a pump with a capacity of 50 liters per hour, and the conventional irrigation
    system requires one hour for irrigation; therefore, it consumes 50 liters. On
    the other hand, the smart irrigation methods function four times a day, according
    to Figure 6 presented in [30], with different irrigation times, according to the
    considered method, as presented in Table 3 [1,29,30]. The analysis of the data
    was conducted utilizing SAS software [1] which determined the irrigation time
    for each irrigation method. This time represents the time during which the irrigation
    valve was on, according to the sensor reading. Figure 10. Water consumption comparison
    between the proposed method and the localization algorithms [9,10,30]. Table 3.
    Irrigation time and consumed water for the considered irrigation methods. As depicted
    in Figure 10, it becomes evident that the smart irrigation system employing the
    proposed method can substantially diminish the volume of water consumed in comparison
    to alternative methods. Specifically, it attains an impressive 28% reduction in
    irrigation water consumption when compared with the conventional irrigation technique.
    The accurate estimation of the sensor node positions ensures the delivery of water
    precisely where and when it is needed. In contrast, smart irrigation systems utilizing
    the DV-Hop algorithm [9], the SDR+LM algorithm [10], and the smart irrigation
    system without using localization method in [30] achieve approximately 20%, 14%,
    and 12% reductions, respectively, in the amount of water consumed when compared
    to the conventional irrigation technique. 5. Conclusions This paper addressed
    the challenge of localizing unknown sensor nodes in WSN-based smart irrigation
    systems, underscoring the pivotal role of accurate node localization for efficient
    monitoring and control. The proposed method, leveraging range measurements and
    the Levenberg–Marquardt optimization algorithm, emerged as a robust solution,
    minimizing errors in estimating the unknown node locations. Quantitative analysis
    revealed compelling results, showcasing the proposed method’s superior performance.
    Specifically, it achieved an impressive 19% and 58% enhancement in estimation
    accuracy compared to DV-Hop and SDR+LM localization algorithms, respectively.
    Extensive simulations and experiments across various network scales demonstrated
    not only the accuracy but also the scalability of the method, affirming its effectiveness
    even in large-scale scenarios. The numerical results unequivocally establish that
    the proposed method significantly improves estimation accuracy, substantiating
    its superiority over existing localization methods. This research provides concrete
    evidence of the method’s potential, emphasizing its practical applicability and
    potential for achieving a substantial 28% reduction in water consumption in smart
    irrigation systems where the accurate estimation of sensor node positions ensures
    the delivery of water precisely where and when it is needed. Future research includes
    exploring the influence of environmental factors on localization accuracy, integrating
    additional sensing modalities for enhanced precision, investigating scalability
    for larger networks, and developing energy-efficient algorithms to prolong network
    lifespan. Author Contributions All authors contributed equally. All authors have

    of water. To address the problems associated with conventional irrigation systems,
    a drip irrigation system that is based on Internet of Things (IoT) technology
    for automation of irrigation scheduling was developed and tested for Egg Plant

    (12.05%) under a drip irrigation system utilizing IoT technology, which could
    be due to the optimum and timely application of water over ETc-based drip irrigation.
    Along with improved crop performance, water savings of 35.2% were observed as

    I. Introduction Crops and plants are prone to attack by various diseases and pests.
    These attacks are detrimental to the quality of crops produced and, subsequently,
    to the livelihood of the farmers. According to the literature, diseases, pests,
    and weeds contribute to 36% loss of crops [1]. The foremost cause of frequent
    plant diseases is a lack of supervision and monitoring. To overcome this challenge,
    advanced sensors based technology could be employed to install a supervision system
    in place. Internet of Things (IoT)-based sensor technology is one of the leading
    solutions to monitor and keep track of the plant growth environment. Sensor signals
    along with machine learning algorithms have been shown to create robust disease
    detection and prediction systems [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. To abate crop loss due
    to diseases, researchers have proposed various disease warning systems. A few
    essential parameters for these models are leaf wetness duration (LWD), ambient
    temperature, and relative humidity [7], [8], [9]. The presence of water molecules
    on the surface of the leaves, paired with suitable ambient temperature and relative
    humidity, enables the germination of fungal diseases on the leaf canopy [10].
    Therefore, consistent measurement of LWD plays a crucial role in developing a
    sound disease prediction model. Researchers have explored various types of leaf
    wetness sensors (LWSs) out of which electronic LWS is deemed suitable for in situ
    measurements [10]. A lack of standard measurement practices has affected the in
    situ estimation of LWD values. In this work, an in-house affordable, temperature-compensated
    LWS has been used, which has been reported in our earlier works [11]. It highlights
    the key features of the novel LWS. The IoT-based sensor system enables remote
    sensing of the field parameters; thus, the system would work autonomously. The
    source of leaf wetness could be a valuable insight for predicting diseases. It
    would help farmers identify the cause of leaf wetness and enable them to take
    instant preventive measures. In a remote setting, the output from LWS can be used
    to determine the cause of moisture on the surface of the leaves. As suggested
    in [44], dew, rainfall, or irrigation are the plausible sources of wetness on
    the leaf canopy. In this work, these three causes of leaf wetness have been accounted
    for dew, rainfall, and irrigation. The LWS used in this work generates a frequency
    output corresponding to the presence of water on the leaf surface [44]. If water
    is present on the surface, the frequency declines from the baseline level and
    ascends again once the surface is dry [11]. As mentioned, each event produces
    a different frequency output when subjected to dew, rainfall, and irrigation.
    Therefore, the pattern generated through the frequency output of the LWS provides
    critical insight for detecting the source of wetness on the surface of leaves.
    Pattern recognition is a famous classification and detection technique. It is
    a process wherein the machine tries to classify the data according to the information
    gained from the regu- varieties observed in different types of data. There are
    several applications of pattern recognition like speech recognition, object identification,
    and classification of medical and explosive signals [13], [14], [15], [16], [17],
    [18]. In this work, pattern recognition has been explored for LWS data wherein
    the data points correspond to either dew, rainfall, or irrigation. Syntactic,
    template matching, and statistical models are used for pattern recognition [19].
    The rising popularity of neural networks (NNs) for feature extraction has driven
    researchers to explore NNs for pattern recognition [20]. NN is capable of feature
    extraction from numerical, image, and text-based datasets. Multilayer perceptrons
    (MLPs) are fully connected NN used for pattern recognition [21], [22], [23]. A
    class of NN called convolutional NN (CNN) is widely used for image classification
    [24], [25], [26], [27]. Networks like VGGNet [28], AlexNet [29], and GoogLeNet
    [30] are famous CNN structures used for pattern recognition from image datasets.
    In this work, an ensemble model is proposed, which takes the numerical and image
    data for classifying the source of wetness (dew, rainfall, or irrigation) on the
    plant. Based on the sensor data, this article aims to classify the leaf wetness
    events in one of the three categories: dew, rainfall, or irrigation. LWS data
    plays a crucial role in determining the source of leaf wetness. While the sensor
    produces time-series data, significant information can be extracted from the patterns
    observed in the frequency domain. Therefore, the time-series data has been converted
    to image form using short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and spectrogram representation.
    In addition to LWS, the disease prediction system uses other sensors like ambient
    temperature and relative humidity sensors [11]. These sensors monitor the environmental
    conditions. Rainfall and dew are natural phenomena and are characterized by distinct
    environmental conditions. SECTION II. Materials and Methods A. Sensors System
    and Field Deployment In this work, the LWS and IoT-enabled system have been used,
    which is reported in [11]. Fabricated LWS produces frequency output when subjected
    to the water molecule on its sensing surface. Further, for the temperature and
    humidity measurements, commercial sensors MCP 9710 and HIH 5030 are used, respectively.
    Subsequently, these sensors are interfaced with the in-house developed signal
    conditioning and processing circuits. The data collected from these sensors are
    uploaded to the ThingspeakTM server every 30 min. For the field measurement, fabricated
    LWS was deployed on the Mango tree at 45° angles, as shown in Fig. 1. Further,
    the field measurements are carried out for four months where approximately 5000
    data points are collected. Fig. 1. Deployment of the sensor on the leaves. Show
    All SECTION III. Data Preprocessing The primary focus is to prepare the data for
    classifying the source of wetness on the leaf, which can arise mainly due to dew,
    rainfall, and irrigation. This involves feature extraction to identify leaf wetness
    events caused by dew, rainfall, and irrigation. Further, data labeling is done
    for both numerical and image data. Numerical attributes are standardized and fed
    into the MLP model and subsequently image data is transformed into spectrograms,
    which are fed into the CNN model. Data augmentation techniques are applied to
    enhance dataset size and diversity. These processes collectively aim to facilitate
    the accurate classification of leaf wetness events in a dataset comprising 392
    instances of dew, rainfall, and irrigation events, which helps reduce overfitting
    and improve model accuracy. A. Feature Extraction The main objective of this work
    is to determine the cause of leaf wetness by analyzing the patterns generated
    by an LWS. Three distinct events, namely dew, irrigation, and rainfall, can make
    leaves wet. To apply a classification algorithm effectively, it’s crucial to isolate
    and extract these individual wetness events and create training and testing datasets.
    This is achieved by identifying specific points at the start and end of each event
    using the find_peaks function from the sciPy library. This function detects the
    highest values in a 1-D signal within a specified height range. Fig. 2 represents
    the signal with starting and ending points marked using orange and green colors.
    The resulting signal is then divided into separate events, leading to the creation
    of a dataset comprising 98 leaf wetness events, each marked by distinct starting
    and ending points. Fig. 2. Leaf wetness events marked with points. Show All B.
    Data Labeling 1) Tabular Data: In this work, a hybrid model is trained using both
    numerical and image data. Numerical data comprise data from sensors like ambient
    temperature sensors, relative humidity sensors, and LWS. Each wetness event is
    numerically characterized by four features, namely, LWD value, average ambient
    temperature, average relative humidity, and maximum magnitude of frequency. Average
    temperature and humidity values are calculated for the duration of each event,
    and the maximum magnitude of frequency is obtained from the output of LWS. LWD
    values are extracted from the frequency response of LWS after smoothening the
    signal. The procedure followed for calculating LWD values has been reported in
    our previous work [11]. The numerical features corresponding to a single-leaf
    wetness event vary broadly in magnitude. To avoid bias due to differences in the
    range of magnitude during the training process, the features are normalized using
    Minmaxscaler function available in scikit-learn library [33]. After normalization,
    all features would lie within a range of 0–1, eliminating any bias due to their
    magnitude. 2) Image Data: The dataset comprise individual frequency output responses
    corresponding to a particular event. To make it suitable for training a machine
    learning model, it has to be classified appropriately with the cause of the wetness.
    Three possible events are responsible for wetness on the leaves’ surface: dew,
    rainfall, and irrigation. For ease of classification, the signal is inverted about
    the y-axis, such that a rise in the magnitude of frequency above baseline frequency
    marks the events. This is denoted by ( ΔF ) as shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3. Isolated
    events from the frequency response of leaf wetness sensor corresponding to (a)
    dew, (b) rainfall, and (c) irrigation. Show All In this work, the time-series
    numerical data from LWS is transformed into image format to leverage the 2-D CNN
    model. CNN is one of the most popular NNs for image classification due to its
    high accuracy [34]. The signal is converted into the frequency domain from the
    time domain using an STFT to convert the numerical data for LWS into image form.
    STFT captures the signal’s frequency components over a small window length of
    256, which is the function’s default size, and tracks them across the duration
    of the signal. STFT of the frequency output of LWS has been computed using the
    scipy library [32]. In doing so, an attempt is made to capture the salient features
    of the patterns observed in the sensor output. These patterns are observed when
    the sensor detects the presence of water on the surface. Fig. 4 represents the
    spectrograms of STFT of the LWS sensor signals. It is evident from the spectrograms,
    as depicted in Fig. 4 that the intensity of frequency components differs for the
    different categories of events viz., dew, rainfall, and irrigation. Therefore,
    these spectrograms could be used for training a CNN-based classification model.
    The images are resized and converted to binary to assist the edge-detection capacity
    of CNN. Fig. 4. STFT spectrograms of leaf wetness sensor data for (a) dew, (b)
    rainfall, and (c) irrigation. Show All The frequency magnitude is the first indicator
    of the possible event that could have caused leaf wetness [44]. Leaf wetness due
    to dew is characterized by a frequency output response with a maximum magnitude
    less than or equal to 4 kHz. Therefore, all events for which the rise in frequency
    ( ΔF ) is less than or equal to 4 kHz are labeled “Dew.” Out of 98 leaf wetness
    events and 13 events for Dew have been obtained. Apart from considering the magnitude
    of the frequency output of LWS, to differentiate between the events due to irrigation
    and rain, a second parameter, LWD has been used. The events with a maximum magnitude
    of frequency greater than 10 kHz or LWD more than 19 h have been labeled as “Rain.”
    Subsequently, the rest of the events were labeled as “Irrigation.” From the given
    signal, 48 events due to rain and 37 events due to irrigation has been observed.
    Fig. 3 shows five signals, each corresponding to the three natural phenomena discussed
    above. The magnitude on the y -axis is under the criteria used to classify the
    events in the appropriate categories. C. Data Augmentation Data augmentation is
    a crucial strategy to prevent overfitting in NNs due to limited data. This study
    is critical because leaf wetness events are uncontrollable. Techniques like horizontal
    flipping and adding random Gaussian noise are applied to image data while preserving
    original patterns. Numerical data are also augmented with Gaussian noise. After
    using these techniques, the dataset grows from 98 to 392 leaf wetness events,
    enhancing the dataset’s size and robustness for machine learning purposes. SECTION
    IV. Proposed Model for Classification In this work, artificial neural network
    (ANN) is an attractive choice because it ensembles NNs that can be built to deal
    with different types of data at the same time. In this work, NN is devolved that
    is capable of learning both numerical data and image data simultaneously. The
    sub-model trained to learn numerical data is an MLP and that trained using the
    image data is a CNN. The model proposed in this work, has been implemented using
    the tensorflow library [36]. A. Multilayer Perceptron MLP is a class of feed-forward
    NNs with fully connected layers. It comprises input and output layers connected
    between multiple hidden layers. In this work, the MLP is supplied by four input
    features—LWD values, average ambient temperature, average relative humidity, and
    maximum magnitude of frequency observed for the event. As mentioned, the three
    types of layers in MLP have neurons responsible for propagating the information
    to the following layer. Fig. 5 shows a descriptive diagram of an MLP (sub-model
    1). The input features are supplied to the input layer. In this work, four features
    are used namely, LWD value, average ambient temperature, average relative humidity,
    and maximum magnitude of frequency. Let the input vector be represented by X i
    for i∈[1,4] . The input is passed on to the hidden layer. The output of the ith
    neuron in the lth hidden layer of MLP, y m [l]i , is the weighted summation of
    its input provided from the preceding hidden layer. The process is called forward
    propagation, accomplished by the following equation [23]: y m [l])i =F( ∑ i=1
    n−1 w m [l]i . a m [l−1]i + b m [l]i ) (1) View Source where w m (l)i and b m
    (l)i are the weight and bias of the neuron, respectively, and a m (l−1)i is the
    activated neuron from the previous layer. The function F(x) is the activation
    function assigned to each layer. For the hidden layers, it is a linear function
    called rectified linear unit (ReLu). This function maximizes the speed of training
    due to less computation and avoids the vanishing gradient problem [37]. In case
    of the input layer a m [l−1]i is replaced with X i . The output vector of MLP
    (sub-model 1) is denoted by Y m . Fig. 5. Proposed model for leaf wetness events
    classification. Show All B. Convolutional Neural Network A CNN was implemented
    for training the image data due to its superior image classification performance.
    CNN models learn by identifying the edges of the images during the training process.
    The convolutional layer is composed of 2-D filters, i.e., kernels, traverse over
    the entire image depending on the size of the kernel. The kernel is a 2-D weight
    matrix. The layer performs convolution of the filter and overlapping input and
    extracts the features of the given image. CNN follows the same process of forward
    propagation, as described in MLP, to transfer the information through the network
    layers. However, in this case, the input images of spectrograms are convolved
    with the filters. It is a multiplication operation on the 2-D input matrices,
    i.e., image and kernel. The following equation defines the convolutional process
    [45]: y c [l]u,v =F( ∑ i=0 p−1 ∑ j=0 q−1 w c [l]i,j . a c (l−1)(u+i),(v+j) + b
    c [l]u,v ). (2) View Source y c (l)u,v is the output of the lth convolutional
    layer at the (u,v) position. The variables w c [l]i,j and a c [l−1](u+i),(v+j)
    are the kernel and input image, respectively. Here, the dimension of the kernel
    is (p×q) . The activation function, F(x) , for intermediate layers is ReLu [37].
    Furthermore, a max-pooling layer is used to prevent over-fitting. The data is
    down-sampled by replacing the output of the convolutional layer with the maximum
    value observed in a particular neighborhood. The MaxPooling2D layer from tensorflow
    implements the max-pooling function [36]. A window of size 3×3 with a stride of
    2 is employed. This operation reduces the dimensions of the data and makes the
    computation much more efficient. An additional layer was added to ensure an effective
    learning process called batchnormalization. The principal objective of this method
    is to normalize the input to the following layer. The batch normalization layer
    from the tensorflow library is added to the model to ensure that the inputs are
    normalized and smooth and that the learning does not suffer due to bias toward
    a specific input owing to nonuniform distribution. Y c denotes the output vector
    of CNN (sub-model 2). C. Training the Hybrid Model The main advantage of the dataset
    collected in this work is data availability from various sensors. While the pattern
    observed in the frequency output of LWS directly corresponds to identifying the
    event that caused wetness on the leaves, the other sensors measuring ambient temperature
    and relative humidity offer critical insights into the environmental conditions
    when the leaf wetness event occurred. These environmental factors could assist
    the model in making a decision. As discussed in Section III-A, the sensor data
    is preprocessed and organized in tabular format. The patterns observed in the
    LWS data are converted to images, as discussed in Section III-B. Fig. 5 illustrates
    the model used to predict the leaf wetness event. The tabular and image data are
    processed parallelly using the first two sub-models. Sub-model 1 is a multilayer
    perceptron described in Section IV-A. It has three hidden layers, each activated
    using a ReLu function. Sub-model 2 is a CNN, as Section IV-B describes, with two
    convolutional and max-pooling layers and a final batch-normalization layer. The
    convolutional layers are activated using the ReLu activation function. The output
    of the two sub-models is concatenated and provided as to the standard NN. The
    connected outcomes can be represented as C=[ Y m , Y c ] T . (3) View Source The
    input passes through the model via forward propagation as described in (1) and
    (2), depending on the sub-model. The two sub-models are responsible for feature
    extraction from the original data received from the sensors. The NNs are adept
    at feature extraction because of their densely connected structure [22]. The sub-model
    outputs are concatenated into a single vector and used further for training. The
    final sub-model denoted in Fig. 5 is responsible for the predictions. The outcome
    of the NN ensemble is obtained from the last layer of the final sub-model. It
    has three neurons corresponding to each leaf wetness event—dew, rainfall, and
    irrigation. The output is the probability of occurrence of the event based on
    the input features. This output is achieved by applying “softmax” as the activation
    function to the output layer [38]. The process finds the normalized exponential
    value for each class σ( c o )= e c o ∑ N j=1 e c j . (4) View Source In the above
    equation, c o is the output value of a neuron for a particular class. The exponential
    divided by the exponential of every neuron in the output layer. Thus, (4) calculates
    the probability of occurrence of one of the events. The model is trained by back-propagation.
    The method aims to minimize the cost function of the prediction by reassigning
    weights. The cost function chosen for training this model is “categorical cross-entropy”
    which is suitable for multiclass classification [38]. In the multiclass category,
    the events belong to only one of the possible classes. The following equation
    represents the loss function: Loss=− ∑ o=1 3 t o log( y o ) (5) View Source where
    t o is the class’s true value, and y o is the predicted probability from the output
    layer, which uses the softmax function. The model has been trained for 200 epochs
    with a batch size of 32 because of the small size of the dataset. This combination
    would converge to a loss value faster. The optimizer used is Adam because of its
    superior performance [39]. Fig. 5 shows the complete ensemble model used in this
    work. SECTION V. Result and Discussion A. Exploratory Data Analysis This section
    uses exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize data trends. A pie chart in
    Fig. 6 illustrates the distribution of leaf wetness causes, showing that rainfall
    is the most common (about half of the events), followed by irrigation (37.8%)
    and dew (13.3%). The June to October 2021 study aligns with the monsoon season,
    explaining the prevalence of rain-induced leaf wetness. Fig. 6. Pie chart distribution
    of leaf wetness events. Show All B. Model Performance The experiments are conducted
    for various hidden layers and neurons, and it has been found that the best accuracy
    achieved is around 96.13% for the ensemble model. Both model sub-model 1 (MLP)
    and sub-model 2 (CNN) were combined with another NN (final sub-model). As a result,
    the hidden layers are changed and neurons in sub-model 1, sub-model 2, and the
    final sub-model. It has been found that the best layers and neurons are three
    layers and 30-24-16 neurons for sub-model 1, four layers, and 128-64-24-12 neurons
    for sub-model 2 and four layers and 30-24-16 neurons for the final sub-model.
    Table I displays a comparison of many models. The recommended model outperformed
    several techniques in Table I, with an accuracy of 96.13%. TABLE I Comparison
    of Different Models As mentioned in Section IV-C, the ensemble model is trained
    for 200 epochs with a batch size of 32. Fig. 7(a) and (b) shows the training and
    validation accuracy and loss for the proposed model. In this work, the proposed
    model architecture learns from a combination of numerical data and image data.
    The MLP is responsible for learning the numerical tabular data, while the CNN
    learns the image data, as described in Section IV. Fig. 7(b) demonstrates the
    characteristic decline of the loss curve, which validates the learning process.
    The steady decline of the loss curve for validation data indicates learning and
    the absence of overfitting by the model. From Fig. 7(b), it can be observed that
    the ensemble model converges the fastest to the lowest loss value. Fig. 7. (a)
    Model accuracy, (b) cross-entropy loss, and (c) ROCs for dew, rainfall, and irrigation.
    Show All Fig. 7(c) shows the receiver operating characteristics (ROCs). This curve
    gives information about the classification capability of the trained model. The
    45° reference line shown in Fig. 7(c) denotes a model incapable of differentiating
    between positive and negative outputs. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) graph
    is a point where the true positive rate (TPR) is 1 and the false positive rate
    (FPR) is 0. A good ROC curve is closer to the top left corner and away from the
    45° line. Fig. 7(c) shows three ROC curves, one for each of the classes- dew,
    rainfall, and irrigation. The AUC is an insightful indicator of the model performance.
    AUC measures the model’s capability to differentiate between the classes. In this
    work, the AUC for dew, rainfall, and irrigation is 0.99, 0.95, and 0.97, respectively.
    The output layer of the NN ensemble described in Section IV uses softmax activation
    function which produces a probability of each possible outcome. These probabilities
    are converted to absolute values of 0 or 1, where 0 indicates negative output
    and 1 indicates a positive output. Further, the precision and recall have been
    calculated as tabulated in Table II. Precision is the fraction of predicted positive
    values, which are actually positive the following equation. On the other hand,
    recall is the fraction of actually positive values that have been correctly predicted
    the following equation [43]: Precision Recall = (True Positive) (True Positive+False
    Positive) = (True Positive) (True Positive+False Negative) . (6) (7) View Source
    TABLE II Evaluation Metrics for Classification of Dew, Rainfall, and Irrigation
    Table II gives the precision and recall values for all the events, along with
    the F1 score. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It measures
    the model’s performance, accounting for the trade-off between precision and recall.
    From Table III, it can be observed that the version of the model is suitable for
    all the events. Slightly less memory is observed for dew. However, it is due to
    the limited number of samples. The average value of the F1 score is 0.8396, which
    signifies a good balance between precision and recall. The significance of a high
    F1 score is that the model can correctly identify the positive data samples. Table
    III presents a comparison of various ensemble models across different applications.
    Researchers have employed the CNN-LSTM model for applications in medical, robotics,
    pedestrian navigation, and e-commerce, while the Darknet19-CNN-LSTM model has
    been utilized for computer vision tasks. In this work, the MLP-CNN model has been
    adopted for agricultural applications and achieved an accuracy of 96.13%. TABLE
    III Comparison of Different Ensemble Models for Different Applications SECTION
    VI. Conclusion Agriculture plays a pivotal role in a country’s economy and methods
    to make it more efficient should be devised. In this work, with the motivation
    of reducing the cost of early plant disease prediction systems, the leaf wetness
    sensor is used to detect the LWS and also the source of wetness on the leaf canopy.
    For this purpose, the data is collected from LWS, ambient temperature sensor,
    and relative humidity sensor. The initial preprocessing and data engineering helped
    us create a dataset that could be used to train a machine-learning model capable
    of predicting the natural event responsible for leaf wetness. The sensors produced
    numerical time series data indicative of the three leaf wetness events- dew, rainfall,
    and irrigation. STFT is applied to the LWS data to obtain an image since the patterns
    obtained in the sensor output for different events are different. Further, an
    MLP-CNN model is built, which is capable of learning from tabular data as well
    as image data simultaneously. The MLP with numerical data produced a satisfactory
    accuracy of 92.86% while the CNN model with image data produced an accuracy of
    62.93% and the ensemble NN (MLP-CNN) classifier produced an accuracy of 96.13%.
    It has been observed that the final model classified the leaf wetness events with
    an average precision and recall of 0.84 and 0.85, respectively. Authors Figures

    data recording; environmental footprint 1. Introduction The agrifood sector, a
    cornerstone of the global economy, sustains billions by providing food and livelihoods.
    Yet, it grapples with multifaceted challenges, from climate change and environmental
    degradation to population growth, food security, and consumer trust. Addressing
    these requires sustainable, efficient agricultural practices that optimize resource
    use, curtail waste, and elevate productivity and quality. The Internet of Things
    (IoT) is emerging at the forefront of solutions. This network of interconnected
    devices, equipped with sensors, actuators, and communication protocols, offers
    real-time monitoring and control over parameters like crop growth, soil health,
    water consumption, pest management, and greenhouse gas emissions. Beyond monitoring,
    IoT enhances traceability and transparency throughout the food supply chain, bolstering
    food safety and consumer trust. However, the integration of IoT in agriculture
    is not without challenges, especially concerning data management: Data Security:
    Ensuring data integrity and safeguarding against malicious tampering is paramount.
    Data Privacy: Stakeholders’ rights and preferences necessitate stringent measures
    against unauthorized data access or disclosure. Data Scalability: As farms grow
    and technology adoption surges, systems must accommodate an increasing influx
    of data from sensors and devices. Data Interoperability: Seamless data exchange
    is crucial, especially when devices and systems employ diverse formats and standards.
    Data Cost: Efficient data transmission and storage are vital, particularly for
    frequent or low-value transactions. Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) and
    the IoT can address these challenges by offering a decentralized, immutable, and
    transparent platform for data management. However, while the blockchain, i.e.,
    the most widely used form of DLT, has revolutionized data storage through cryptographically
    linked blocks, it is necessary to address scalability, transaction fees, energy
    consumption, and more limitations in the data-intensive IoT universe. IOTA offers
    a fresh perspective on DLT with its Tangle, a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure.
    Unlike blockchains, the Tangle permits feeless transactions, validated by nodes
    as they initiate new transactions [1,2]. This structure provides enhanced scalability,
    reduced energy consumption, quantum resistance, and the capability for offline
    transactions and microtransactions. Rather than replacing traditional blockchain
    systems, IOTA complements them, especially for the high-frequency data transactions
    inherent to the IoT. With projections indicating that, by 2030, approximately
    125 billion IoT devices will be interconnected [3], the sheer volume of data generated
    necessitates robust management, distribution, and storage solutions. While DLT
    offers a promising avenue, our study narrows its focus on IOTA’s Tangle, a DLT
    uniquely equipped to handle the vast data streams from IoT devices, given its
    scalable, fast, and feeless micro-data transaction capabilities. With this backdrop,
    our central research inquiry is both theoretical and pragmatic: Is it possible
    to devise a web application that seamlessly integrates Tangle IOTA with IoT-enabled
    sensors? These sensors, designed for monitoring sustainability metrics in agriculture,
    would empower operators in the agrifood sector with real-time insights, enabling
    timely interventions. To explore this, we have embarked on a Proof-of-Concept
    test focusing on data from rice cultivation. Our Proof-of-Concept focuses on rice
    cultivation, chosen due to its significant freshwater usage, which is the highest
    among all crops. Additionally, rice’s global prevalence and status as the world’s
    primary food crop make it a pertinent subject for our study [4]. We developed
    an analytical dashboard to demonstrate that using technologies such as IoT and
    IOTA optimizes product quality, product processing efficiency, cost, and production
    time. In summary, when we fully control production with devices and sensors (IoT),
    receiving data even from remote locations with the support of IOTA, it is possible
    to reduce the release of CO 2 by having control over irrigation and the right
    portion of water (more water equals more CO 2 and more waste). In addition, it
    is possible to track the product 24 h a day, receiving recorded data on IOTA almost
    through streaming. Finally, the process is very green, reducing electricity consumption.
    2. Background and Related Works In this section, we first provide a general background
    on distributed ledger technology (DLT), including both blockchains and tangles
    like IOTA. Then, we discuss related work on (i) traditional monitoring systems
    in agriculture, (ii) the use of the blockchain applied to agriculture, and (iii)
    the use of IOTA Tangle technology applied to agriculture. 2.1. Background DLT
    has become a transformative force in information technology, reshaping organizational
    collaboration and operation [5,6]. It employs a ledger system where multiple nodes
    can read and write data, maintaining a state based on consensus, which varies
    with the network’s decentralization level. DLTs are characterized mainly by their
    ledger structure: chain-based systems like blockchain and DAG-based systems like
    IOTA’s Tangle. Chain-based DLTs utilize a linear series of blocks, securing records
    through cryptographic hashing and consensus mechanisms like proof of work or stake.
    These blockchains differ in their access protocols and validator addition methods,
    affecting interaction levels with network components. In contrast, DAG-based DLTs
    allow parallel transaction processing, offering potentially higher scalability
    than chain-based systems. With independent transaction confirmation and no need
    for a single global consensus, DAG structures provide a more dynamic and scalable
    consensus approach. This contrasts with chain-based systems, where all transactions
    require network-wide confirmation, leading to potential bottlenecks in transaction
    processing and scalability. 2.2. Related Work 2.2.1. Traditional Monitoring Systems
    in Agriculture Historically, agricultural monitoring has evolved through various
    traditional systems. Key studies in this field have explored different approaches:
    Wang et al. developed a low-cost, real-time remote environmental monitoring system
    combining wireless equipment and mobile phones that was powered by solar energy.
    This system was effective in collecting real-time information and fulfilling online
    acquisition needs [7]. Dan et al. implemented a Greenhouse Environment Monitoring
    System using ZigBee technology, wireless sensors, and control nodes. This system
    focused on controlling environmental data for enhanced greenhouse management [8].
    Hashim et al. reviewed using an Arduino device for temperature and soil moisture
    control, managed via an Android smartphone. This study contributed to designing
    smart monitoring systems using an embedded micro-web server and IP connectivity,
    aiming to aid the agriculture sector in achieving quality production [9]. Karim
    et al. developed an application for precision farming based on a wireless sensor
    network and IoT cloud. This application focused on optimizing irrigation and monitoring
    microclimatic conditions to improve water usage efficiency in farming [10]. 2.2.2.
    Blockchain Technology and Sustainable Agriculture Blockchain technology has significantly
    impacted the concepts of trust and efficiency in sustainable agricultural development.
    This change became prominent as agrifood companies accessed knowledge banks and
    digital resources [11]. Blockchain, alongside the Internet of Things (IoT), is
    pivotal in advancing sustainable and precision agriculture, which leverages technology
    to enhance agricultural efficiency [12]. Lin et al. proposed an ICT e-agriculture
    system model based on the blockchain for local and regional use. They also developed
    a validation tool for the technical and social requirements of these systems [11].
    Patil et al. focused on using IoT for remote monitoring and automation in agriculture.
    They provided an architecture integrating blockchain technology for smart greenhouse
    farms, offering a security framework that combines blockchain with IoT devices
    for enhanced security and communication in smart farming [13]. Munir et al. implemented
    an intelligent Smart Watering System (SWS) based on an Android application for
    smart water consumption in crops. The system, equipped with affordable sensors,
    uses blockchain and Fuzzy Logic approaches for data security and intelligent decision-making,
    enabling real-time monitoring and periodic irrigation [14]. Baralla et al. developed
    a blockchain-oriented platform to authenticate food origin data. This platform
    aims to enhance supply chain transparency, promote local smart food tourism, and
    boost local economies, emphasizing the importance of food as a “business card”
    for tourist sites [15]. Iqbal and Butt proposed an IoT-based system for crop protection
    at all stages, focusing on deterring animal attacks using sensors and a Repelling
    and Notifying System (RNS). The system records incidents in a centralized Farm
    Management System (FMS), integrated with an agricultural blockchain for shared
    ledger functionalities, enhancing meta-information sharing [12]. Cocco et al.
    implemented a system offering visibility to food processes and certifications,
    using Self Sovereign Identity, blockchain, and the InterPlanetary File System.
    This system aims to safeguard data storage and access, ensuring the eligibility,
    transparency, and traceability of certifications [16]. 2.2.3. IOTA Applied in
    Agriculture IOTA’s integration into agriculture showcases innovative projects
    combining IoT, AI, and DLT: Flores et al. developed the Interplanetary Precision
    Agriculture (IPA) project, which harnesses IoT, AI, and DLT. The project utilizes
    various technologies, including an autonomous rover (Magrito) for crop performance
    data, Precision Habitat PRO for environmental control, a bluetooth scale for weight
    data, and a farm management system for data aggregation. The collected data are
    sent to the IOTA Tangle network to ensure immutability and interoperability. This
    aims to enhance cultivation processes both on Earth and in extraterrestrial environments,
    addressing issues of centralization and data silos in supply chains. The overarching
    goal is to establish a sustainable food supply and minimize the environmental
    footprint of agricultural practices [17]. Lamtzidis et al. introduced a distributed
    ledger-based system focused on securing IoT data integrity. They utilized IOTA’s
    Tangle ledger for the secure processing and storage of aggregated field data,
    transitioning from a cloud-centric to a node-centric architecture. In this setup,
    each Super node maintains its data in a distributed and decentralized database,
    with the backend functioning as both a data consumer and resource provider. This
    modular approach has made significant contributions to open-source communities
    in blockchain and IoT, presenting a more secure and decentralized method for managing
    IoT data [18]. 3. Design of the Study The primary objective of this paper is to
    demonstrate how integrating IoT and IOTA technologies can optimize product quality,
    processing efficiency, cost, and production time in agriculture. By utilizing
    IoT devices and sensors, and leveraging IOTA for data management, we aim to achieve
    significant reductions in CO 2 emissions through precise irrigation control and
    water management. This approach also allows for continuous product tracking and
    reduces electricity consumption, contributing to a more sustainable agricultural
    process. Our methodology involves creating a prototype that simulates a rice production
    process. This setup includes seedlings equipped with sensors to monitor and regulate
    water levels within a specified range. This prototype demonstrates efficient data
    transmission, production control, and system functionality. The study heavily
    focuses on the impact of IoT in agriculture. IoT technology, encompassing remote
    sensors, cloud and edge computing, unmanned vehicles, and data analytics [19],
    is revolutionizing agricultural practices. It allows for effective monitoring
    of crucial factors like humidity, air temperature, and soil quality, thus enhancing
    crop yields, irrigation efficiency, and accurate harvest forecasting (https://www.appsforagri.com/en/news/impact-of-iot-in-the-agriculture/,
    accessed on 7 October 2023). Moreover, the IoT’s integration into agriculture
    significantly reduces environmental impacts by lowering water and energy usage,
    greenhouse gas emissions, and fertilizer runoff. Financially, it increases farmers’
    profitability and competitiveness by opening up new markets and services [20].
    This study extends the IoT’s capabilities in agriculture by incorporating IOTA’s
    DLT, which is particularly suited for high-frequency IoT scenarios. IOTA offers
    benefits such as feeless transactions, data integrity, scalability, and interoperability,
    making it ideal for a secure and transparent network of IoT devices in the agricultural
    sector. Our methodology places a strong emphasis on optimizing resource utilization,
    with a particular focus on water efficiency. By integrating IOTA’s advanced DLT
    capabilities with intelligent irrigation systems, we aim to significantly enhance
    the precision and effectiveness of water usage in agriculture. Drawing insights
    from Mboyerwa et al.’s [21] research, this integration is expected to drastically
    reduce resource consumption. Notably, it can lead to halving water usage, decreasing
    nitrogen consumption by 25%, and reducing methane emissions by 50% to 70%. These
    substantial reductions are primarily achieved through the optimized control of
    field flooding durations, which effectively slows down the activity of methane-producing
    microorganisms. The integration of IOTA plays a critical role in this process.
    Its technology enables a secure, transparent, and highly efficient network of
    IoT devices. This network facilitates the real-time collection, processing, and
    analysis of vast amounts of agricultural data. Consequently, it allows for more
    precise irrigation decisions, ensuring water is used more effectively and sustainably.
    The real-time data processing and feeless transactions offered by IOTA enhance
    the system’s responsiveness and accuracy, leading to a more intelligent and environmentally
    friendly approach to irrigation. This not only optimizes resource usage but also
    contributes to the broader goals of sustainable and precision agriculture. The
    study employs a multi-faceted technological approach, simulating a data-intensive
    paddy farm environment. By integrating IOTA, we enhance data management, introduce
    robust authorization systems, and streamline data transmission. The design covers
    three domains: Local: Involves structuring, programming, and assembling a Raspberry
    Pi and its sensors. Remote: Facilitates internet connectivity and links to an
    online platform. Cloud-based server: Serves as the primary project hub. Technologically,
    the study utilizes Raspberry Pi devices and sensors, EMQX (MQTT), VPN and Ubuntu,
    Docker, IOTA, and MongoDB (ATLAS). The programming spans across Python, NodeJs,
    Javascript, HTML, and CSS. 3.1. IOTA IOTA stands out as a pioneering DLT tailored
    for the IoT landscape. Distinct from conventional blockchain systems, IOTA employs
    the Tangle, a unique architecture that addresses the scalability and transaction
    cost challenges inherent to blockchains. It positions IOTA as an optimal choice
    for the real-time processing of vast data streams from IoT sensors in sustainable
    agriculture. The IOTA network is underpinned by nodes’ individual instances of
    the IOTA software. These nodes validate and record transactions, and in the context
    of sustainable agriculture, they could process data received from IoT sensors,
    monitoring parameters like soil moisture, temperature, and pH levels. To ensure
    efficient operation, nodes had to use a robust but affordable environment with
    at least a 4-core processor, 8GB RAM, SSD storage, and a public IP address. Each
    node offers different features across multiple ports, facilitating peer-to-peer
    communication with HTTP and MQTT protocol, allowing for resilient data communication
    in every agricultural scenario. IOTA nodes can manifest as Mainnet, Testnet, or
    Devnet nodes. While Mainnet nodes handle real-world IOTA transactions, including
    actual sensor data, Testnet and Devnet nodes serve developmental and testing purposes,
    enabling developers to refine applications before Mainnet deployment. There are
    two primary IOTA node software options: Hornet and Bee. Hornet, crafted in Go,
    is resource-efficient, aligning with IoT applications where resources might be
    limited. Conversely, Bee, developed in Rust, emphasizes modularity and performance.
    Given its resource efficiency, Hornet is preferred for most agricultural IoT scenarios.
    Hornet’s implementation can leverage various avenues, including APT Repository,
    Docker image, binary files, or source construction. The Docker image, renowned
    for its portability, is particularly favored. The ability of Docker to effortlessly
    deploy and scale applications aligns with agricultural contexts, where the number
    of IoT sensors can fluctuate based on farm dimensions and requirements. Node security
    is paramount, necessitating measures like safeguarding login accounts, sealing
    unused ports, disabling remote consensus algorithm execution, and deploying a
    reverse proxy for augmented security. The Docker image gohornet/hornet (https://hub.docker.com/r/iotaledger/hornet,
    accessed on 7 October 2023) is utilized for Hornet implementation, with the repository
    cloned locally. Configuration files (i.e., config.json and peering.json) facilitate
    settings customization and node synchronization storage. The database of IOTA
    mandates a mainnetdb folder creation, with the use of authentication hashes ensuring
    data access exclusivity. The Docker image also initiates a server, loading a dashboard
    for node and data monitoring essential for overseeing and troubleshooting the
    IoT sensor network in agriculture. 3.2. Raspberry Pi 4 In this rice production
    study, we use the Raspberry Pi 4, a capable computer equipped with an ARMv8 quad-core
    1.5 GHz 64-bit CPU, dual-band wireless LAN, Bluetooth 5.0, and 1-2-4 GB RAM. It
    offers a GPIO port with 40 pins, 26 being GPIO pins, and various ports like USB,
    micro-HDMI, Ethernet, and more, including support for 4K video. The GPIO socket
    includes 40 pins, bridging the Raspberry Pi and external devices, where 26 of
    these are GPIO pins; the rest are power or ground pins. They are labeled in both
    physical and BCM numbering for convenience. Raspbian, a version of Linux designed
    for Raspberry Pi, serves as the operating system. It is installed via NOOBS, with
    a browser, email program, LibreOffice, Minecraft, and a command-line tool (raspi-config)
    for configuration management. Sensors Various sensors monitor and control environmental
    conditions, including humidity, temperature, flame detection, rain, pressure,
    and soil moisture: The DHT11 is a temperature and humidity sensor with a digital
    output, allowing communication with a Raspberry Pi up to 20 m away. It provides
    stable measurements with a maximum temperature accuracy variation of 2 °C and
    humidity accuracy variation of 1 percent. The flame detection sensor can detect
    infrared emissions from a flame and convert them into an electrical signal readable
    by any microcontroller. It has a reading angle 60° and features both an analog
    and a digital output. The rain sensor detects the presence and concentration of
    water. An LED indicates its operation and features with an analog output to calculate
    the amount of water present. The pressure sensor measures atmospheric pressure,
    temperature, and altitude. It can measure an atmospheric pressure level ranging
    from 300 to 1100 hPa and a temperature range from −40 °C to +85 °C. The soil moisture
    sensor detects soil moisture and the presence or absence of water. It has a digital
    output that indicates the level of humidity. This study uses two such sensors
    to monitor the optimal water levels for rice field irrigation. The first sensor
    measures the minimum water level needed for healthy rice growth, while the second
    sensor identifies the maximum water level to prevent wastage and crop damage.
    3.3. Sensor–Raspberry Pi communication The communication between sensors and computers
    is ensured by a Python script, which sets the sensors with the correct configuration
    for reading. It cyclically checks each sensor, recalling its state or value and
    storing the results in temporary variables. These variables are part of a JSON-like
    object that requires further conversion to become a standard JSON object. The
    script establishes a remote connection on the EMQX API, an MQTT web tool, and
    proceeds with publishing through the publish function. Since Python lacks the
    module allowing Raspberry Pi to communicate with the web tool, it must be installed
    and imported. To avoid saturating the Raspberry Pi’s resources, time intervals
    are established between the data acquisition of one sensor and the next. A pause
    of 2 s has been set before another sensor is analyzed to minimize data and information
    loss. The dialogue between the two technologies is summarized in Figure 1. Figure
    1. Sensor–Raspberry Pi communication. 3.4. MQTT and EMQX This project uses EMQX,
    a web socket implementation of MQTT, to facilitate remote IoT data collection.
    EMQX is an open-source MQTT IoT message broker built on the Erlang/OTP platform,
    renowned for its soft real-time capabilities, low latency, and distributed development
    features. MQTT is a lightweight message exchange protocol centered around a publication–subscription
    model. EMQX is accessible via browser and is designed for mass client access,
    providing fast and low-latency message routing between large physical network
    devices. It can host large-scale MQTT client connections, with a single server
    node supporting 2 million connections. It is also extensible, supporting custom
    plug-ins for authentication and other features. It fully supports IoT protocols,
    including MQTT, MQTT-SN, soap, LwM2M, and other proprietary TCP/UDP-based protocols.
    The connection configuration is used to set up links through any API that will
    serve as a bridge to dialogue your code with the MQTT platform. Required fields
    for EMQX connection configuration encompass “Name”, “Client ID”, “Host”, and the
    listening port. EMQX Broker provides many configuration elements and supports
    global and local configurations, allowing multi-protocol and port utilization.
    Auto Reconnect and Clean session functions are used to perform automatic reconnection
    when the broker goes offline and to start a session after a disconnection. The
    project creates various “topics” or subjects by creating a new subscription. The
    Topic must have a title and a subtitle, which are necessary if there is a need
    to filter the data. They are used to categorize the topic according to the path
    to which it belongs. This logic is useful when you want to retrieve information
    to access it; you need to know and refer to the precise path, otherwise, you cannot
    link to the topic. Data simulation within the project is accomplished with data
    input in JSON or TXT format allowing for textual data and key-value schema object
    notation. JSON data were sent via the Raspberry device at 2-s intervals, and it
    is possible to say that no visible latency or message loss was encountered. Figure
    2 displays the most important functionalities of this tool. Through the functionality
    called “New Connection”, it is possible to create a new mandatory initial connection
    or it can be used to create additional parallel connections, leading to Step 2,
    i.e., the connection configuration. This part will also serve as a setting for
    the links through any API that will serve as a bridge to dialogue your code with
    the MQTT platform. Figure 2. EMQX: MQTT Websocket Toolkit. In detail, Table 1
    shows the port numbers devoted to exposing services, dealing with sockets, the
    default WS (web socket) or WSS (web socket secured with SSL). The latter is a
    security protocol based on modern public key cryptographic algorithms, i.e., TLS/SSL.
    It can ensure transmission security in the computer communication network, providing
    the benefits of strong certification, thus ensuring confidentiality and completeness.
    Table 1. Protocol port. 3.5. IOTA Dashboard The IOTA environment provides a dashboard
    designed as a user interface that supplies real-time insights and control over
    the IOTA Tangle. In sustainable rice cultivation, IoT devices can be deployed
    across rice fields to monitor various parameters such as soil moisture, temperature,
    pH level, and more. These devices can transmit data to the IOTA Tangle, which
    can be accessed and analyzed in real-time through the IOTA dashboard. The IOTA
    dashboard enables one to view the IOTA DLT state. In detail, it provides an Analytics
    tab, which makes available parameters about the node, network, and resources,
    including information about the Tangle network, node details, memory usage, and
    cache data. Moreover, users can search for messages sent to the node, for instance,
    measurement from the IoT devices deployed in the rice fields monitoring by using
    the Explorer tab. In addition, the IOTA dashboard comes with a Visualizer tab
    responsible for providing a visual representation of the live evolution of the
    Tangle network, offering a real-time view of data transmission. Network management
    is eased by noting the information displayed in the Peers tab, and finally, plugin
    add-ons are allowed in the Plugins tab. Through the IOTA dashboard, farmers, researchers,
    and decision-makers can gain valuable insights into the conditions of the rice
    fields, enabling them to make informed decisions that promote sustainable cultivation
    practices. This case study will explore how the IOTA dashboard can be used in
    promoting sustainability in rice cultivation. The analytics tab is composed of
    four sub-tabs, namely Tangle, Node, Memory, and Caches. As depicted in Figure
    3, the Tangle subsection supplies several valuable metrics, such as known messages,
    new messages, received messages, messages sent, message requests received, sent
    message requests, heartbeats received, heartbeats sent, milestone request received,
    sent milestone request, and deleted packets. Figure 3. IOTA dashboard: analytics.
    Between these analytics, it is possible to note a heartbeat signal. Heartbeat
    is a periodic signal that hardware or software produces, and it is used both to
    show proper operation and synchronize nodes. It is one of the mission-critical
    systems’ most widely used techniques to provide high availability and fault tolerance
    of network services by detecting network or node system failures. Other sections
    provide information regarding memory usage and cache state. The Node section is
    in charge of providing insights on messages sent per milestone, which define a
    temporal interval defining the time needed to pass until the network coordinator
    executes the message validation. The state and the throughput of the network are
    viewable in the network graph, as depicted in Figure 4, which represents the construction
    of a Tangle or a DAG graph, i.e., the distributed registry in which are stored
    all transitions. In the sidebar of Figure 4, there are the following Tangle properties:
    (i) messages that indicates the number of messages sent; (ii) MPS, i.e., the number
    of messages sent to the network per second; (iii) TIPS, i.e., the number of unapproved
    transactions; (iv) referenced, i.e., the percentage of transactions referenced
    by other transactions; (v) conflicting, i.e., the percentage of transactions with
    conflicts; and (vi) solid, i.e., transactions with their history. Figure 4. Tangle
    graph. In Figure 5, it is possible to see one of the requirements for interacting
    with the IOTA network. The choices depend on the technologies one chooses to use,
    but also on whether one wants to use one’s own node (direct access) or rely on
    third-party nodes. Figure 5. Dependencies and requirements of IOTA. Constructing
    a personal node for network access is the optimal choice. The entire infrastructure
    can be raised using an editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code) or any other editor or
    IDE. Once Docker is configured and operational, the installation of either Hornet
    or Bee is enabled allowing for crafting nodes. Upon completion, the node may be
    launched via Docker. After configuring the network settings, the dashboard is
    accessible, enabling the owned node viewing as well as interaction with other
    nodes and also providing insights regarding the IOTA network. MongoDB Atlas Atlas
    uses MongoDB as a database, taking advantage of its scalability and flexibility
    and of its useful indexes and queries for data processing. Data originating from
    the Raspberry Pi are sent through EMQX and are written into the Atlas database.
    To establish a database on MongoDB Atlas for agricultural monitoring, follow these
    steps: register on the Atlas website, choose a cluster, create the database, and
    configure the connection string. MongoDB stores data records as BSON documents
    in collections, similar to tables in relational databases. The document model
    based on MongoDB is clear, easy to use, and supports various languages through
    its included drivers. The Atlas interface provides an overview of the data flow
    and allows the transformation of agricultural data into charts, as shown in Figure
    6, which displays two charts, one tracking the temperature and humidity data over
    time based on the hour, the other counting the amount of data each sensor has
    sent compared to the other sensors. Figure 6. Atlas data charts. By selecting
    the desired database, it is possible to choose the chart and then select the data
    of interest to be represented in the graph, setting a title and some properties.
    This chart is saved in the dashboard, and every time new data are received, they
    are written into the database, automatically updating the various charts based
    on the corresponding fields. There are approximately nine chart options, with
    an average of two subcategories for each. In Figure 7, it is possible to see the
    number of times a certain temperature is detected. For example, 23 degrees has
    been detected 25 times, while 24 degrees has been detected only 5 times. The chart
    on the right displays the total count of temperature data. In this case, both
    the humidity and barometer sensors detect the temperature. By adding the two values
    shown in the second chart in Figure 3, which are 26 and 27, a percentage of 53%
    is obtained. Figure 7. Temperature. These visualizations can be made visible to
    specific users, such as farmers or sustainability experts, or even made public
    through an off-site link. This feature enhances the accessibility of critical
    sustainability information, even outside of Atlas, promoting transparency and
    informed decision-making in agricultural practice. Hence, integrating MongoDB
    and Atlas in an IOTA-based deployment offers a robust solution for monitoring
    and analyzing sustainability parameters in agriculture. The flexibility in storage
    options, ease of setup, and data visualization capabilities make it a valuable
    tool in modern agricultural practices. Figure 8 depicts the architecture of the
    proposed model and the logical flows running through the system components. Briefly,
    data gathered by the IoT Sensors flow through EMQX to the Raspberry Pi, which
    acts as a gateway to send data to the HTTP Application Server. The node Application
    Server manages such data communicating with the IOTA network passing through the
    deployed node, as well as with the Atlas interfaces, thus enabling data monitoring
    via the analytical dashboard. Figure 8. Architecture of the system. 4. Results
    To monitor sustainability parameters in agriculture, MongoDB Atlas has been integrated
    into the IOTA-based deployment. The setup process has involved registering on
    the Atlas website, selecting a cluster, creating the database, and configuring
    the connection string. The Atlas interface allows the transformation of data into
    charts, which are automatically updated with new data. To this aim, data from
    devices like Raspberry Pis are sent through EMQX to a Node.Js script by leveraging
    APIs, and received data are stored in the MongoDB Cloud of Atlas. Moreover, we
    implemented a connection established with the local IOTA node (Hornet Mainnet)
    to propagate the data in the IOTA Tangle. The created Node.js server takes care
    of receiving, processing, and translating the data into services for the graphical
    interface. A lightweight Node.js server is created to receive, process, and translate
    the data into services for the graphical interface. The server listens on a customizable
    port, providing services to those who connect to that port. Aiming to achieve
    real-time insights, we developed an analytical dashboard, which is responsible
    for making viewable the received data. These are divided into several sections,
    each describing a different analysis aspect, as depicted in Figure 9. The sections
    include notifications, derived data, graphs, a table, alerts, and a map. The data
    in the table include count, id, date, time, message, temperature, humidity, pressure,
    altitude, latitude, longitude, status, and sensor name. Two soil sensors have
    been installed, one for notifying when the soil’s water level is insufficient
    and the other for alerting when there is excess water. Figure 9. Analytical dashboard.
    Hereafter, we illustrate the various sections of the analytical dashboard displayed
    in Figure 9. Section 1 showcases a menu that remains visible while scrolling the
    page. It counts both incoming data and highlights any data that requires attention.
    These particular data points are also tallied in the alerts. Section 2 illustrates
    data derived from analytical operations performed on raw sensor data. Starting
    from the left, we have the average humidity, obtained by summing up the humidity
    data points and dividing them by the number of humidity data points. Next, the
    minimum and maximum humidity values are reported by comparing the previously stored
    data with the subsequent data. Depending on the result, the old data may be overwritten.
    As in the case of humidity, it is possible that there are no fluctuations in either
    an upward or downward trend, resulting in the “Min” and “Max” values being equal.
    “Average Temperature”, “Min”, and “Max” values are calculated in the same manner.
    In Section 3, the “HUMIDITY” box displays the humidity data received from the
    temperature sensor. Specifically, the x-axis represents the time the data are
    received, and the y-axis represents the temperature data, which remain constant
    at 65% in this case. Regarding the “TEMPERATURE” box, the same procedure described
    in the previous case is followed, with the difference being that the temperature
    data are considered. As observed, the temperature data vary between 22 and 21
    degrees within the selected time interval. The “traces” are the lines used to
    construct the graph; in the “TEMPERATURE” box, there are eight traces. Both boxes
    feature a scroll bar that appears when the graph requires more space to display
    the newly received data while allowing the visualization of previous data by scrolling
    through the bar. Section 4 shows a dynamically populated table with JSON data
    sent by Raspberry sensors. There is a data model for the data types that each
    sensor sends, and the table can be fully viewed by scrolling horizontally. The
    same applies to the quantity of data, which requires scrolling vertically to view
    it. In detail, the data in the table include: Count indicates the number of times
    a specific sensor sends data; Id uniquely identifies each sensor; Date indicates
    the date the data was sent by Raspberry; Time indicates the time corresponding
    to the data sent by Raspberry; Message indicates additional information regarding
    the data; Temperature indicates the detected temperature; Humidity indicates the
    recorded humidity; Pressure indicates the identified pressure; Altitude indicates
    the measured altitude; Latitude and Longitude indicate the geographic coordinates
    of the sensor’s location; Status takes a value of 0 or 1 depending on the sensor;
    Sensor Name indicates the sensor’s name, which is useful for identifying the specific
    sensor being considered. The value “undefined” indicates that the specific sensor
    being considered does not produce that type of data detected by another specific
    sensor for that purpose. In Section 5 of Figure 9, the sensors with values requiring
    greater attention are displayed on the left, as seen in the table. Each alert
    notification is accompanied by the date, time, critical message, and an icon indicating
    its significance. At the top, the total number of alert messages received is shown.
    On the right, a real map is displayed, showing simulated geo-localization coordinates
    of the sensors. These data can either be pre-set or dynamically passed and plotted.
    Similarly, Figure 10 demonstrates the functioning of the two soil sensors, one
    alerting when the soil’s water level is insufficient, the other signaling when
    there is excess water. Figure 10. Functioning of the soil sensors. According to
    the works of Mboyerwa et al. [21] and Prem Kumar et al. [19], IoT and IOTA have
    emerged as disrupting technologies in the agrifood supply chain and sustainability
    optimization; we deem that our Proof-of-Concept will be a further advancement
    in monitoring and improving the sustainability of agrifood production processes.
    Moreover, IoT devices relying on centralized communications present a number of
    security threats related to privacy and security. IOTA addresses these flaws,
    also removing the blockchains’s limitations; indeed, IoT devices lack the computational
    power and storage needed to run consensus algorithms to be an involved part of
    the blockchain [22]. Taken together, our results answered the question that guided
    our research by creating a web application capable of integrating IOTA with IoT
    sensors devoted to real-time monitoring of agrifood supply chains. 5. Discussion
    In this section, we discuss the obtained results. 5.1. DLTs in Agriculture—IOTA
    and Traditional Blockchains We summarize here the main results of the Proof-of-Concept
    illustrated in the previous section to then put them into perspective in the trend
    of adoption of DLT and blockchain technologies in the agricultural sector and
    the role that IOTA can specifically play in this context: Efficiency in Resource
    Utilization: This study shows that integrating IoT and IOTA can significantly
    reduce resource consumption. Thus, this integration effectively implements the
    sustainable agricultural practices illustrated in [21]. Technological Infrastructure:
    This study employs various technologies, including Raspberry Pi 4, various sensors,
    and IOTA, a distributed ledger technology tailored for IoT. These technologies
    monitor various environmental conditions like soil moisture, temperature, and
    pH. Data Management and Security: This study uses IOTA to bolster data management
    and introduce a robust authorization system. It also employs MQTT and EMQX for
    remote IoT data collection, supporting up to 2 million connections on a single
    server node. Environmental Impact: IoT has the potential to mitigate the environmental
    footprint of agriculture by reducing water and energy consumption, greenhouse
    gas emissions, and fertilizer runoff. Financial Benefits: IoT can elevate the
    profitability and competitiveness of farmers by granting access to new markets,
    services, and performance-based incentives. Real-Time Monitoring: The IOTA dashboard
    provides real-time insights into various parameters like soil moisture, temperature,
    and pH levels, enabling informed decision-making for sustainable agriculture.
    Technological Toolkit: This study uses a diverse set of technologies, including
    Raspberry and its sensors, EMQX (MQTT), VPN and Ubuntu, Docker, IOTA, and MongoDB,
    and is programmed in Python, NodeJs, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Sustainability:
    This study concludes that the IoT stands as a pivotal force in enhancing agricultural
    productivity and sustainability, especially as the demand for food rises amidst
    limited resources. Transitioning from these findings, we delve into the broader
    implications and applications of DLTs in agriculture. Agriculture is a critical
    sector facing numerous challenges, including climate change, environmental degradation,
    and the need for sustainable practices. These challenges necessitate innovative
    solutions, and one such promising technology is the IoT. However, the vast amounts
    of data generated by IoT devices must be managed securely and efficiently. Moreover,
    agrifood businesses are increasingly pressured by governmental and consumer organizations
    to validate the safety and quality of their production processes. To meet these
    demands, DLTs offer a robust solution. They provide a decentralized system for
    storing and updating data across a network of nodes, eliminating the need for
    a central authority. DLTs employ cryptography and consensus mechanisms to ensure
    data integrity and validity. While DLTs offer numerous benefits like traceability,
    transparency, and operational efficiency, it is important to note that they are
    not a one-size-fits-all solution. Different DLTs have their own strengths and
    weaknesses, which we will explore by comparing three prominent DLTs in agriculture:
    Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, and IOTA. Of course, this is not a random choice;
    all three platforms stand out for their agricultural achievements and potential
    compared to other DLTs and blockchains. We will focus on two main use cases: traceability
    in the agrifood supply chain and real-time monitoring of cultivation practices.
    The latter case became more recently of interest and focus, and this article contributes
    to its strengthening and development. At the same time, the former has an older
    record, being one of the first use cases of non-financial blockchain/DLT applications.
    To compare these three DLTs strictly from a technological standpoint, see the
    study of Garriga et al. [6] instead, and the study of Dalla Palma et al. [23].
    5.1.1. Traceability in the Agrifood Supply Chain The agrifood supply chain is
    a complex network of multiple stakeholders: farmers, processors, distributors,
    retailers, and consumers. Each stakeholder has its record-keeping system, which
    may not be compatible or transparent to others. This creates challenges in ensuring
    food products’ origin, quality, and safety and meeting local and international
    regulations. DLTs can help overcome these challenges by providing a shared and
    immutable ledger of transactions and data throughout the production process. Ethereum
    and Hyperledger Fabric, the most popular blockchain platform from the Hyperledger
    software ecosystem, are traditional blockchains supporting traceability in the
    agrifood supply chain. Ethereum is a public blockchain that allows anyone to join
    and participate in the network. It supports smart contracts, i.e., self-executing
    agreements written in code that can automate supply chain processes and ensure
    traceability. Fabric is a private blockchain that allows only authorized participants
    to join and transact on the network. It supports private transactions and complex
    supply chain permissions that can handle sensitive data and comply with regulations.
    Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric have been used for various traceability projects
    in the agrifood sector. For instance, IBM Food Trust (https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/solutions/food-trust,
    accessed on 7 October 2023) is a platform built on Fabric that connects farmers,
    processors, distributors, and retailers to share data and track food products
    from farm to fork. Similarly, OriginTrail (https://origintrail.io/, accessed on
    7 October 2023) is a protocol built on Ethereum that enables interoperable data
    exchange and verification across different supply chain actors. The articles by
    Cocco et al. [24] and Marchesi et al. [25] discuss case studies and software development
    methodologies specifically in the context of blockchain-based food traceability
    systems. 5.1.2. Blockchains vs. IOTA DLT in the Agrifood Supply Chain Among DLTs,
    the blockchain is a technology that can enhance the privacy and security of IoT-interconnected
    smart devices, as several papers have demonstrated [26,27]. The blockchain offers
    features such as transparency, immutability, resilience, and cryptography that
    can address some of the challenges of IoT network architecture. However, the blockchain
    also has a cost in terms of transaction fees and architectural complexity, requiring
    expertise from various disciplines. Therefore, the blockchain should manage valuable
    assets, such as business data and financial assets [28]. On the other hand, the
    IOTA Tangle is a DLT that can improve sustainability and agrifood monitoring without
    such costs, allowing agrifood supply chains to adopt it without affecting their
    business [29]. 5.1.3. Real-Time Monitoring of Cultivation Practices The other
    use case for DLTs in agriculture, treated explicitly in the previous section of
    this article, is real-time monitoring of cultivation practices. This involves
    using IoT sensors to collect various data from the field, such as soil moisture,
    temperature, humidity, pest infestation, and so on. These data can help farmers
    optimize their inputs, reduce their environmental impact, and improve their yields.
    However, IoT sensors generate huge amounts of data that must be transmitted and
    stored securely and efficiently. As we have seen, IOTA is a DLT that is designed
    for high-frequency IoT scenarios. Unlike traditional blockchains that use a linear
    chain of blocks to store data, IOTA uses a DAG called Tangle. The Tangle is composed
    of individual transactions that are interlinked to each other and stored across
    a network of nodes. To issue a transaction on the Tangle, a node has to validate
    two previous transactions. This allows IOTA to overcome the cost and scalability
    limitations of blockchains. As highlighted in the description of our study, IOTA
    has several advantages for real-time monitoring of cultivation practices. First,
    it enables zero-fee transactions, meaning nodes can send and receive data without
    paying fees. This is ideal for frequent, low-value data transmissions from IoT
    sensors. Second, it enables high scalability, meaning the network can handle many
    transactions per second without compromising performance or security. This is
    ideal for accommodating varying numbers of sensors and devices on the network.
    Third, it enables data integrity, which means that the data stored on the Tangle
    are tamper-proof and verifiable by anyone on the network. This is ideal for accurate
    decision-making based on real-time data. Our study offers a comprehensive guide
    for building an IOTA-based real-time monitoring system tailored for sustainable
    agriculture. In this context, it complements Future Farm (https://future-farm.iota.org/#/,
    accessed on 7 October 2023), an initiative by the IOTA Foundation that also leverages
    IOTA for data collection and analysis through IoT sensors in greenhouses. While
    Future Farm focuses on process optimization—emphasizing the sharing of IoT data
    among various stakeholders in agriculture—our approach is more user-centric. Specifically,
    we demonstrate how a farm operator can effectively utilize the IOTA Tangle for
    real-time monitoring. 5.1.4. Complementarity: Technology and Business Perspective
    Technology: The strengths and weaknesses of Ethereum, Fabric, and IOTA are summarized
    in Table 2 from a sustainable agriculture perspective standpoint. While Ethereum
    and Fabric cater to supply chain transparency and notarization of product origin
    and quality, IOTA is tailored for high-frequency IoT data transactions. However,
    these DLTs are not mutually exclusive. They can be integrated and interoperable,
    offering a comprehensive view of the agrifood sector. For example, IOTA’s real-time
    data can be linked to Ethereum or Hyperledger Fabric’s smart contracts, triggering
    actions or payments based on predefined conditions. Alternatively, IOTA’s data
    streams can be hashed and anchored to Ethereum or Hyperledger Fabric’s blockchains,
    creating a secure and verifiable record of the data history. These integrations
    can leverage the best features of each DLT, creating a synergistic effect. Table
    2. Comparison of DLTs in agriculture: Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, and IOTA.
    Business: DLTs offer different value propositions for the agrifood sector depending
    on their use cases and applications. While traceability emphasizes transparency,
    notarization, and compliance, real-time monitoring targets operational efficiency
    and sustainability. These value propositions can have various implications for
    market differentiation and consumer engagement. For instance, traceability can
    bolster branding and product authenticity, creating a competitive edge in the
    market. Traceability can also assure consumers about product origin and quality,
    increasing their trust and loyalty. On the other hand, real-time monitoring can
    lead to sustainable practices and cost savings, improving the business’s bottom
    line. Real-time monitoring can also offer insights into sustainable cultivation
    practices, educating consumers and raising awareness. Enriched Business Value:
    Integrating DLTs in the agrifood sector can also create new opportunities for
    funding acquisition and carbon credit trading. These opportunities can provide
    financial incentives for adopting DLTs and promoting sustainable agriculture.
    For example, traceability and real-time monitoring can serve as evidence for quality
    manufacturing and sustainable cultivation practices. This can be pivotal for acquiring
    funding from government agencies or private investors that incentivize such practices.
    Moreover, integrating DLTs can facilitate the generation of carbon credits by
    validating sustainable practices. These credits can be traded as securities on
    DLT-based platforms, offering a new revenue stream for farmers and businesses.
    On the other hand, Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric can leverage the capability
    of inter-enterprise transactions of their smart contracts to go beyond traceability
    to boost supply chain efficiency and profitability, as shown in [30,31]. Summing
    up, Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, and IOTA are three prominent DLTs that can revolutionize
    the agrifood sector. While they cater to different agrifood needs, their combined
    strengths can create a holistic solution that addresses the challenges and opportunities
    of the sector. By integrating them into suitable ecosystems as characterized in
    Salzano et al. [32], innovators can ignite a global business transformation that
    benefits farmers, businesses, consumers, and the environment. 5.2. Reapplicability
    of Our Model Our research demonstrates a flexible and adaptable model, where the
    specific components we used can be substituted with equivalent alternatives to
    suit different requirements. Database Management System Flexibility: While our
    study leverages the capabilities of MongoDB, the architecture of our model is
    not limited to this particular DBMS. The design is compatible with various other
    database management systems, enhancing the model’s applicability across diverse
    data management scenarios. Hardware Versatility: In terms of hardware, our choice
    of the Raspberry Pi 4 is illustrative rather than prescriptive. The model can
    be adapted to work with a range of single board computers or similar devices,
    provided they possess comparable technical capabilities. This flexibility ensures
    that our model can be deployed in a variety of hardware environments. Sensor Selection
    and Adaptability: We chose specific sensors for monitoring key parameters in the
    rice supply chain. However, this selection is not rigid. Different sensors can
    be employed based on the requirements of other agrifood products or supply chains.
    The adaptability of our model to various sensor types and data inputs underscores
    its potential for broader application in agriculture. Cross-Product and Supply
    Chain Applicability: While our Proof-of-Concept is centered on rice cultivation,
    the underlying model is designed to be transferable to other agrifood supply chains.
    This transferability is facilitated by the selection of appropriate sensors and
    the integration of various communication protocols. System and OS Compatibility
    through Containerization: Our model’s use of containerization technology ensures
    its portability and compatibility across different systems and operating systems.
    This aspect of the design significantly enhances the model’s utility and ease
    of deployment in diverse IT environments. In summary, the design of our study
    reflects a commitment to versatility and adaptability, allowing for the application
    of our model in a variety of agricultural contexts beyond its initial implementation.
    6. Conclusions This research project has been centered around exploring the transformative
    impact of IOTA, in synergy with IoT technologies, on enhancing sustainable agricultural
    practices. Our study specifically targeted the optimization of water-resource
    consumption in rice field irrigation, which is a critical aspect of sustainable
    agriculture. The core objective of our study was to meticulously monitor and improve
    resource utilization, with a particular emphasis on water efficiency. The results
    demonstrate that an intelligent irrigation system, powered by advanced sensor
    technology, can be instrumental in achieving sustainable cultivation practices.
    This system enables real-time data acquisition and analysis, which are pivotal
    in guiding empirical practices for resource optimization. Specifically, we observed
    the potential of this system to significantly reduce water usage by up to 50%,
    lower nitrogen consumption by 25%, and decrease methane emissions by 50% to 70%.
    A key aspect of our system is its ability to compile historical data on water
    usage, providing a rich dataset for strategizing future resource management approaches.
    The integration of IoT devices, particularly those managed through IOTA’s technology,
    has proven exceptionally effective in handling and analyzing large volumes of
    data, thereby boosting the overall efficiency and precision of agricultural processes.
    A notable accomplishment of this project was the seamless and rapid data transmission
    from the field (via Raspberry Pi) to the cloud. This was achieved with minimal
    latency, demonstrating the effectiveness of MQTT in data routing and the capacity
    of IOTA to provide near-real-time recording and optimal storage for extensive
    datasets. Despite some latency challenges encountered with MongoDB, it played
    a crucial role as an intermediary, facilitating effective communication and data
    management between IOTA and other integrated technologies. This integration was
    pivotal in enhancing data organization and processing speed. Looking ahead, future
    research could explore optimizing sensor sampling rates to make them more dynamic
    and responsive to environmental and inventory conditions. Additionally, adjusting
    the number of active sensors based on these parameters could enhance efficiency,
    allowing some IoT devices to enter a sleep mode when not needed, thus conserving
    energy. In conclusion, this research highlights the integral role of IOTA, particularly
    in tandem with the IoT, in the future of sustainable agriculture. IOTA emerges
    not just as one of many options, but as a particularly compelling choice for real-time
    monitoring and implementation of sustainable agricultural practices. Its application
    extends beyond mere data tracking to actively influencing and optimizing on-ground
    practices, aligning closely with the global goals of environmental conservation
    and food security. This study affirms that the synergy of IOTA and IoT is not
    just a computational marvel but a practical tool for empirical advancements in
    agriculture. Author Contributions Conceptualization, R.P. and R.C.; methodology,

    Learning Introduction Sub-Saharan Africa is a region whose agriculture is heavily
    reliant on unpredictable rainfall. According to the FAO, the total area of land
    under irrigation in sub-Saharan Africa was estimated at 7 million hectares in
    2020, representing only 5 % of the region''s arable land [1], [2], [3]. Globally
    freshwater resources are limited and unevenly distributed, with many regions experiencing
    physical and economic water scarcity (UN [4]). Despite the ongoing challenges
    related to water scarcity, there are global developments in irrigation that hold
    promise for enhancing agricultural productivity and building resilience against
    the impacts of climate change [[5], [6], [7], [8],4]. The world is currently witnessing
    the fourth industrial revolution, characterized by the integration of emerging
    technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain, the Internet of
    Things (IoT), Big Data Technology, Drones, Robots and 3D printing [9,10]. The
    use of these modern intelligent technologies in irrigation is emerging in sub-Saharan
    Africa and is set to transform farming by allowing smart and precise irrigation
    [11,12]. For instance, IoT sensors can be used to monitor soil moisture levels
    and automatically adjust irrigation to optimize water use efficiency, whereas
    AI applications can predict weather patterns and optimize irrigation scheduling.
    To enhance water-use efficiency and contribute to Sustainable Development Goals
    (SDGs), particularly Goal 6 and Target 6.4, it is essential to implement innovation
    in irrigation systems. As such, there is a need for increased investment in irrigation
    infrastructure and adoption of modern intelligent technologies to ensure sustainable
    irrigation practices in sub-Saharan Africa. The importance of smart irrigation
    cannot be overstated in today''s world, where climate change is affecting global
    freshwater resources and increasing water scarcity. Manual irrigation of crops
    is not only time-consuming but also inefficient, while irrigation based on fixed
    timers does not account for changes in weather or soil conditions that affect
    moisture levels [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]. Smart irrigation systems take into
    account weather and soil conditions to optimize irrigation, resulting in significant
    water savings of up to 30 percent [18], [19], [20], [21]. As a result, smart irrigation
    has emerged as a more effective and sustainable approach in irrigated agriculture.
    The essence of smart irrigation lies in its conceptual framework, which amalgamates
    technology and agricultural practices to optimize water use efficiency. This framework
    revolves around several key components. Sensors and monitoring systems, ranging
    from soil moisture sensors to weather instruments, gather real-time data on variables
    critical to irrigation decisions. This data is then subjected to analysis using
    cutting-edge approaches like artificial intelligence and machine learning models,
    providing insights that inform irrigation scheduling, water allocation, and crop
    management. The actual irrigation is optimized through precision delivery mechanisms
    like drip irrigation, which directs water directly to plant root zones, minimizing
    losses through evaporation and runoff [22]. Automation and control mechanisms
    enable real-time adjustments based on collected data, enhancing the efficiency
    of irrigation practices. The integration of these components is facilitated by
    the connectivity and communication capabilities of the IoT, enabling seamless
    data exchange, remote monitoring, and control of irrigation systems [13]. Central
    to the smart irrigation discourse is the concept of Water Use Efficiency (WUE)
    in agriculture. WUE measures the ratio of agricultural output to the amount of
    water used for productively by the plant [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28]. Smart
    irrigation systems have the potential to enhance WUE significantly by tailoring
    irrigation schedules to crop water requirements [29,30,23,31,[24], [25], [26],
    [27], [28]]. Leveraging real-time data on factors like soil moisture, weather
    conditions, and plant stress, these systems enable precise irrigation, optimizing
    both water use and crop growth. The incorporation of 4IR technologies further
    enhances WUE by enabling accurate predictions of water demand. AI algorithms analyze
    historical data and environmental factors to forecast crop water needs, ensuring
    timely irrigation application. This predictive ability, combined with real-time
    weather monitoring, empowers farmers to adapt irrigation schedules proactively,
    thus optimizing water use efficiency. Despite various studies investigating irrigation
    technologies and practices, a significant research gap persists regarding the
    effective integration of 4IR technologies into smart irrigation systems. Recent
    systematic literature reviews have focused on the applications of 4IR in other
    domains like manufacturing, health, transport, fashion, labor force among others
    [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43]. Therefore,
    the primary objective of this systematic review paper was to examine the role
    of 4IR technologies in smart irrigation and their potential applications in the
    context of sub-Saharan Africa. Specifically, the review aimed to: a) explore the
    utilization of AI in irrigation systems for precision irrigation, water demand
    prediction, crop yield estimation, and soil moisture management; b) investigate
    the role of IoT and Drone Technology in generating and managing data for improved
    irrigation management practices; c) examine the potential applications of Blockchain
    and Machine Learning in irrigation, particularly in data management and decision-making
    processes; and d) identify the constraints, challenges, and opportunities associated
    with leveraging 4IR technologies in smart irrigation within the context of sub-Saharan
    Africa. This paper provides insights for researchers, decision-makers, and practitioners
    interested in enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of irrigation practices
    in sub-Saharan Africa. Research methodology A systematic review approach was used

    regarding industrial revolution The Industrial Revolution marked a significant
    turning point in human history, propelling societies into an era of unprecedented
    technological advancements. Throughout the various stages of the Industrial Revolution,
    irrigation technology played a crucial role in enhancing agricultural productivity
    and sustaining growing populations. In this section, we explored the evolution
    of irrigation technology from the Industrial Revolution 1.0 to 4.0 and the timelines,
    showcasing the remarkable advancements that revolutionized the way water was harnessed
    and distributed for agricultural purposes. The first Industrial Revolution, starting
    in the late 18th century, witnessed the emergence of steam power as a primary
    driving force [47]. This technological breakthrough led to advancements in irrigation
    systems. Steam-powered pumps and engines were introduced [48], enabling the lifting
    of water from rivers and reservoirs to higher elevations. Canal systems were developed
    to transport water efficiently across vast distances, promoting agricultural expansion
    and increasing crop yields [49]. The second Industrial Revolution, characterized
    by the widespread adoption of electricity and mass production techniques [50],
    had a profound impact on irrigation technology. Electrical pumps and motors replaced
    steam-powered machinery, providing more reliable and efficient water delivery.
    Farmers gained greater control over irrigation schedules, leading to improved
    water management, and increased agricultural output [51]. Electric-powered sprinkler
    systems and drip irrigation methods were introduced, optimizing water distribution,
    and minimizing waste. With the advent of the third Industrial Revolution, automation
    and computerization revolutionized irrigation technology [52]. The integration
    of sensors, data analytics, and computer systems into irrigation infrastructure
    enabled precise monitoring and control of water usage. Automated irrigation systems
    adjusted water flow based on soil moisture levels, weather conditions, and plant
    requirements, ensuring optimal irrigation while conserving water resources. This
    era witnessed the emergence of smart irrigation technologies, empowering farmers
    with real-time data and insights for efficient decision-making [53]. The ongoing
    fourth Industrial Revolution, characterized by digitalization and the IoT [54],
    is transforming irrigation technology in unprecedented ways. Advanced sensor networks,
    drones, and satellite imagery are utilized to monitor soil conditions, water availability,
    and plant health with exceptional precision. Machine learning algorithms analyze
    vast amounts of data, providing predictive insights to optimize irrigation strategies
    and maximize crop productivity. Smart irrigation systems, integrated with AI-driven
    controllers, remotely manage water distribution, reducing water waste and enabling
    sustainable agricultural practices. Fig. 5 summarizes the remarkable industrial
    revolution with the different technologies. Download : Download high-res image

    [54]. Fourth industrial revolution technologies for smart irrigation In 2011,
    the German government unveiled a novel concept known as \"Industry 4.0″ during
    a trade fair. This initiative primarily aims to enhance collaboration among individuals,
    machinery, and resources [55]. At its core, Industry 4.0 revolves around the idea
    of bridging the gap between the physical and virtual realms [56]. It establishes
    connections among machines, functions, and systems through intelligent networks
    that span the entire value chain, allowing them to operate autonomously and interact
    with one another [57]. The term \"Industry 4.0″ refers to both partially and fully
    automated advanced manufacturing processes driven by technology, where equipment
    can communicate independently throughout the value chain [56]. This innovative
    concept encompasses various technologies such as digital manufacturing, network
    communication, computing, and automation, all integrated within the adaptable
    and intricate systems of Industry 4.0. The application of Fourth Industrial Revolution
    technologies in irrigation (Fig. 6) represents a significant leap forward in modern
    agriculture. This transformative era is marked by the convergence of digital,
    physical, and biological systems, and it brings with it a multitude of innovative
    tools and techniques that enhance irrigation practices. One of the key pillars
    of this revolution is the IoT, which involves embedding sensors and devices in
    irrigation systems to collect real-time data on soil moisture levels, weather
    conditions, and crop health. AI and machine learning algorithms then process this
    data to make precise and timely decisions regarding irrigation scheduling, optimizing
    water usage, and minimizing waste. Furthermore, drones equipped with advanced
    imaging technology are employed for aerial monitoring of fields, providing farmers
    with a comprehensive view of their crops and irrigation needs. Additionally, blockchain
    technology is being utilized to create transparent and secure systems for water
    resource management and supply chain tracking, ensuring the efficient distribution
    of water resources. These 4IR technologies collectively empower farmers with unprecedented
    control and insights into their irrigation practices, ultimately contributing
    to increased crop yields, resource conservation, and sustainable agricultural
    practices in an era of global environmental challenges. Download : Download high-res

    for smart irrigation. Artificial intelligence in smart irrigation AI refers to
    the ability of machines to learn and make decisions based on data [58]. AI plays
    a pivotal role in smart irrigation systems, enabling advanced analytics and decision-making
    capabilities [59]. AI algorithms can be used to analyze data on weather, soil
    moisture, and crop water requirements and to make automated decisions on irrigation
    scheduling [60]. This can improve the accuracy and efficiency of irrigation management
    and reduce the risk of over- or under-irrigation. AI enables farmers to collect,
    analyze, and interpret data on a large scale, allowing for more precise and accurate
    irrigation decisions [61]. AI can analyze large amounts of data and provide insights
    that can be used to optimize irrigation. For example, AI can analyze data on soil
    moisture levels, temperature, humidity, and crop growth patterns to identify the
    most efficient irrigation strategies for specific crops and soil types. Fig. 7

    image Fig. 7. Integration of AI in Smart Irrigation. Predictive modelling for
    water demand and crop yield AI-based predictive models for example neural networks,
    ensemble, regression, classification, and time series forecasting models are utilized
    to forecast water demand and crop yield based on historical data and environmental
    factors (Kuradusenge et al., 2023; [45]). Such models use historical data, weather
    patterns, and crop-specific information to estimate the irrigation requirements,
    facilitating efficient water allocation. Kuradusenge et al. (2023) used rainfall
    and temperature data analyzed through Random Forest, Polynomial Regression, and
    Support Vector Regressor to predict crop yield of Irish potato and maize. Random
    forest was recommended for early crop yield prediction of potatoes and maize (Kuradusenge
    et al., 2023). AI algorithms are employed to analyze real-time data from soil
    moisture sensors and determine the optimal irrigation timing and volume [62].
    By continuously monitoring soil moisture levels, smart irrigation systems can
    ensure that crops receive adequate water while avoiding waterlogging and excessive
    runoff [63]. One example of the application of soil moisture monitoring and management
    in sub-Saharan Africa is a study done by (Wanyama et al., 2023). The authors have
    developed a cost-effective green technology intelligent irrigation control system
    kit that improves precise irrigation water application. This kit is a photovoltaic
    system that powers a water pump, a soil moisture sensor, and an Arduino microcontroller
    unit mounted on a moving frame. The soil moisture sensors were placed in the field
    and sent real-time soil moisture values to the microcontroller via a wired Universal
    Serial Bus (USB) communication channel. The microcontroller connected the water
    pump, the tank water level sensor, the soil moisture sensors, and the water tank
    outlet solenoid valve. Therefore, the system could schedule irrigation thus improving
    the traditional irrigation technology. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are employed
    in smart irrigation systems to analyze data patterns, make predictions, and optimize
    irrigation [64], [65], [66], [67]. ML algorithms learn from historical and real-time
    data, enabling adaptive decision-making and improving irrigation efficiency [68].
    Machine Learning algorithms can analyze historical data on weather, soil conditions,
    and crop performance to predict future irrigation requirements [62]. By providing
    accurate forecasts, ML-based predictive analytics support farmers in making informed
    decisions regarding irrigation scheduling, water allocation, and crop management.
    ML algorithms can be utilized to develop adaptive irrigation control systems that
    adjust irrigation parameters based on real-time data inputs [69,70]. These systems
    continuously monitor soil moisture levels, weather conditions, and plant water
    stress, allowing for dynamic irrigation control to optimize water use efficiency
    and crop productivity. The synergy between AI and smart irrigation is transformative,
    offering data-driven insights and automation for efficient water management. AI
    processes copious data from sensors, weather forecasts, and soil conditions to
    optimize irrigation schedules. ML models are trained on historical data and environmental
    cues to predict crop water requirements. Table 3 summarizes other applications
    using AI in irrigation operations. In another study, Ikudayisi et al. [71] conducted
    research focused on managing crop water requirements at the Winterton irrigation
    scheme in South Africa, aiming to address the challenges posed by water scarcity
    and its impact on agricultural efficiency. To achieve their objectives, the researchers
    employed a combined approach involving artificial intelligence, namely an artificial
    neural network (ANN), and a crop growth simulation model. The study aimed to estimate
    various aspects of crop irrigation water requirements, including the crop-water
    demand from planting to harvest, the timing of irrigation, the optimal stage in
    the drying cycle for water application, and the volume of irrigation water to
    be applied. Five feed-forward backward propagation ANN predictive models with
    varying configurations were developed and assessed. The optimal ANN model, characterized
    by 5 inputs, 5 neurons, 1 hidden layer, and 1 output, was employed to predict
    monthly reference evapotranspiration (ETo) in the Winterton region. This optimal
    ANN model demonstrated a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.67, a Pearson correlation
    coefficient (r) of 0.97, and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.94. The
    validation of the model revealed a correlation (r) value of 0.9048 between the
    measured and predicted ETo values. Table 3 summarizes other applications using
    AI in irrigation operations. Table 2 Table 2. Artificial intelligence applications

    Things in smart irrigation IoT refers to the network of devices, sensors, and
    machines that are connected to the internet and can exchange data with each other
    [77]. In smart irrigation systems, IoT devices such as sensors and controllers
    can be used to collect and transmit data on weather, soil moisture, and crop water
    requirements. This data can be processed and analyzed in real-time to adjust irrigation
    schedules and optimize water use. IoT plays a crucial role in collecting and transmitting
    data in smart irrigation systems [78,79]. IoT sensors and devices are deployed
    throughout the irrigation infrastructure to monitor various parameters and facilitate
    data-driven decision-making. connectivity. In IoT applications, connectivity between
    gateways, remote clouds, and users is typically over broadband communication networks.
    However, in most of sub-Saharan Africa''s rural countries, broadband connectivity
    is either very expensive or non-existent. Affordable broadband technologies like
    TVWS have been tested in South Africa and around the world and can provide both
    backhaul and last-mile wireless connectivity for remotely deployed agricultural
    IoT-based systems in various locations [80] Data generation and collection through
    IoT sensors IoT sensors, such as soil moisture sensors, weather stations, and
    flow meters, collect real-time data on soil moisture, temperature, humidity, rainfall,
    and water flow [81,82]. These sensors provide a continuous stream of information,
    enabling farmers to make informed decisions regarding irrigation management. Nigussie
    et al. (2020) proposed an IoT-based irrigation management system for smallholder
    farmers in South Africa, Kenya, and Ethiopia`s rural areas. Sensors in the system
    detect soil conditions (moisture, temperature, nutrients, and pH) and provide
    data on the water level in the storage as well as microclimate conditions. The
    actuators in this system direct the flow of water to the farm via sprinklers,
    pumps, valves, and water gates. The IoT network connectivity technology used in
    this system was Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN). This is because LoRaWAN
    is a fully open standard solution with no subscription fee, making it less expensive
    for IoT connectivity devices, and it is well-suited for long-distance. Cloud computing
    for data management and analysis Cloud computing has emerged as a revolutionary
    technology that can transform the way we manage and optimize irrigation systems.
    Cloud computing platforms are utilized to store and process the vast amount of
    data generated by IoT sensors in smart irrigation systems [83]. Cloud-based solutions
    provide scalable storage, computational power, and data analytics capabilities,
    allowing for efficient data management and analysis, [84]. One of the key benefits
    of cloud computing in smart irrigation is the ability to store and process large
    amounts of data in a centralized location. This allows farmers to easily access
    and analyze data on things like soil moisture levels, weather patterns, and crop
    health, which can help them make more informed decisions about irrigation. With
    data driven irrigation optimization, farmers can reduce water waste and ensure
    that water is used only when and where it is needed, leading to improved water
    use efficiency. In sub-Saharan Africa, cloud services create additional running
    costs for irrigation management systems. To address these issues, the most commonly
    proposed IoT architectures typically provide local processing and storage in gateways
    created for data processing, network management, irrigation decisions, and communication
    with farmers. This avoids the need for broadband networks and cloud services (backend
    servers) [80]. Maitethia et al. [85] executed a groundbreaking IoT smart irrigation
    system in Kenya, setting a remarkable precedent for precision agriculture in Africa.
    By integrating a network of sensors, weather stations, and cloud-based analytics,
    their pioneering initiative ushered in a new era of data-driven irrigation management.
    The remarkable outcomes encompassed substantial crop yield improvements, significant
    water conservation, substantial cost reductions, and enhanced climate resilience,
    ultimately bolstering food security and elevating the socioeconomic status of
    local farmers. Although initial investments and the need for comprehensive technical
    training posed initial challenges, the unparalleled potential of IoT-driven smart
    irrigation holds the promise of fostering a sustainable and prosperous future
    for African agriculture. Table 4 presents other applications of IoT in irrigation.
    Big data technology in smart irrigation Big Data Technology plays a significant
    role in unlocking the potential of data in smart irrigation systems [94]. By harnessing
    large volumes of data, valuable insights can be gained to optimize irrigation
    management practices. Big data analytics involves the use of advanced analytical
    techniques to extract insights from large and complex datasets. In smart irrigation
    systems, big data analytics can be used to analyze data on weather, soil moisture,
    and crop water requirements and to identify patterns and trends that can inform
    irrigation management. Big data refers to large and complex data sets that cannot
    be processed using traditional data processing techniques. In the context of precision
    irrigation, big data can be used to analyze large volumes of data on weather patterns,
    soil moisture levels, crop water requirements, and other factors that affect irrigation
    needs. Big Data analytics techniques are applied to historical and real-time data
    to identify patterns, trends, and correlations related to irrigation and crop
    performance [95]. This enables farmers to make data-driven decisions regarding
    irrigation scheduling, water allocation, and crop management. Rabhi et al. [96]
    explored the application of big data analytics in the context of smart irrigation,
    with a specific focus on digital agriculture in Morocco. Their research aimed
    to leverage big data analytics to enhance predictive irrigation techniques. They
    noted the growing importance of intelligent agriculture, characterized by widespread
    adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) analysis solutions, which has led to more
    precise irrigation scheduling. The research took place utilizing an irrigation
    dataset that considered moisture and temperature factors. To analyze this dataset,
    the authors employed neural network (NN) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms.
    The computational aspect of their study was conducted using the big data platform
    \"databricks,\" which implements the Spark framework for processing large datasets.
    The results from their models were promising, with SVM achieving an accuracy of
    97.00 % and NN reaching an accuracy of 98.50 %. In their future work, the authors
    intend to expand upon the 19,440 enterprise metamodel, introducing additional
    constructs related to advanced technologies such as big data analytics tools,
    IoT, AI, cloud computing, and machine learning. This extended metamodel is envisioned
    to be applied in the context of a smart farm, aligning with the principles of
    Agriculture 4.0. The use of Big Data in smart irrigation systems raises concerns
    about data privacy and security [97]. Safeguarding sensitive information and ensuring
    secure data transmission and storage are essential to maintain trust and protect
    the integrity of smart irrigation systems. Blockchain technology for managing
    big data in irrigation Blockchain technology offers a decentralized and transparent
    framework for managing and securing data in smart irrigation systems [95]. It
    provides an immutable ledger that records and verifies data transactions, ensuring
    data integrity and enabling trusted collaborations. Blockchain technology offers
    a decentralized and transparent framework for managing and securing data in smart
    irrigation systems [98]. By leveraging Blockchain, data can be stored and managed
    in a distributed manner across multiple nodes, eliminating the need for a central
    authority [99]. In smart irrigation, Blockchain can provide an immutable ledger
    that records and verifies data transactions related to water usage, irrigation
    practices, and resource management. Each data transaction is cryptographically
    linked to the previous transaction, creating a chain of blocks that ensures data
    integrity and transparency. By utilizing Blockchain for data management, smart
    irrigation systems can enhance trust and accountability in water governance [100].
    All stakeholders, including farmers, water authorities, and researchers, can access
    and verify the data recorded on the Blockchain, enabling transparent and auditable
    irrigation practices. The decentralized nature of Blockchain also mitigates the
    risks of data tampering and unauthorized modifications. Since data is stored across
    multiple nodes in the network, any attempt to alter the data would require consensus
    from a majority of nodes, making it highly secure and resistant to fraud or manipulation
    [101,102]. Moreover, Blockchain can facilitate trusted collaborations and data
    sharing among stakeholders in the irrigation ecosystem. Smart contracts, which
    are self-executing agreements coded on the Blockchain, can automate and enforce
    rules and conditions related to water allocation, usage rights, and payment systems
    [103]. These smart contracts enhance transparency and efficiency in irrigation
    governance, reducing the reliance on intermediaries and streamlining administrative
    processes. However, the adoption of Blockchain in smart irrigation systems comes
    with challenges. The scalability and energy consumption of Blockchain networks,
    especially in resource-constrained environments, need to be addressed. Additionally,
    ensuring data privacy while maintaining transparency is crucial, as sensitive
    information may be recorded on the Blockchain. Despite these challenges, Blockchain
    technology shows promising potential in revolutionizing data management and governance
    in smart irrigation systems. Further research and pilot projects are needed to
    explore the practical implementation and scalability of Blockchain solutions in
    the context of sub-Saharan Africa. Blockchain''s smart contract functionality
    can be leveraged to automate and enforce irrigation governance rules [104]. Smart
    contracts enable the execution of predefined rules and conditions related to water
    allocation, usage rights, and payment systems. This enhances transparency, reduces
    disputes, and ensures fair and accountable irrigation practices. Drone technology
    in smart irrigation Drone technology has emerged as a promising tool for enhancing
    smart irrigation practices in various agricultural contexts. Drones, also known
    as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), offer unique capabilities for remote sensing,
    high-resolution data collection, and precision irrigation management. Drones equipped
    with advanced sensors and imaging systems enable remote sensing and high-resolution
    data collection in agricultural landscapes [105,103,106]. These sensors capture
    data on various parameters, including soil moisture, vegetation indices, temperature,
    and crop health. The collected data provides valuable insights into the spatial
    variability of soil and crop conditions, allowing for targeted irrigation interventions.
    In Kenya, certain farmers have embraced innovative approaches such as employing
    near-infrared cameras affixed to drones for pest and disease identification, among
    other applications. Additionally, within the Kenyan context, there exists a beta-stage
    AI tool named Nuru, accessible on Android devices with or without internet connectivity
    [107]. This advanced technology specializes in the diagnosis of crop diseases,
    with a particular focus on identifying mite and viral infections in cassava and
    detecting armyworm infestations in maize. KDHI Agriculture reports that a substantial
    number of cassava farmers, approximately 28,000, have already reaped the benefits
    of this tool''s implementation. One of the key applications of drone technology
    in smart irrigation is the monitoring of soil moisture levels [108]. Drones equipped
    with specialized sensors can capture near infrared and thermal imagery to assess
    soil moisture content across fields. This information helps farmers understand
    the spatial distribution of moisture and make informed decisions on irrigation
    scheduling and water allocation. In addition to monitoring soil moisture, drones
    can assess crop health and water use efficiency through multispectral and thermal
    imaging [109,108]. By analyzing vegetation indices and thermal patterns, drones
    can identify areas of stress, disease outbreaks, or water stress in crops. This
    data aids in targeted irrigation interventions, optimizing water use, and maximizing
    crop productivity. Drone technology enables precision irrigation by providing
    real-time and site-specific information for irrigation management [110]. With
    the collected data on soil moisture, crop health, and water use efficiency, farmers
    can determine the optimal irrigation needs of different areas within a field.
    This enables precise water application, minimizing water wastage and ensuring
    efficient water use. Constraints in leveraging 4IR technologies for smart irrigation
    in sub-saharan africa Infrastructure limitations and access to technology One
    of the significant constraints in leveraging Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies
    for smart irrigation in Sub-Saharan Africa is the limited infrastructure and lack
    of access to technology [111,112]. Many rural areas in the region lack reliable

    to enhance the understanding, operation, and maintenance of these technologies
    [119,120]. Training programs and awareness campaigns are essential to equip farmers
    and relevant personnel with the necessary skills in data management, analytics,
    interpretation, and system operation. Additionally, fostering collaboration between
    academia, research institutions, and extension services can facilitate knowledge
    transfer and skill development, addressing the capacity gaps and promoting the
    effective use of 4IR technologies in smart irrigation practices. Integration with
    existing agricultural practices Integrating drone technology into existing agricultural
    practices requires farmers to adapt their workflows and decision-making processes
    [119,97]. Farmers need to understand how to interpret drone-generated data and
    incorporate it into their irrigation management strategies. Extension services
    and farmer-to-farmer knowledge sharing platforms play a crucial role in facilitating
    this integration. Opportunities for leveraging 4IR technologies in smart irrigation
    Enhanced water use efficiency and crop yield optimization Leveraging 4IR technologies
    in smart irrigation presents significant opportunities for enhancing water use
    efficiency and optimizing crop yields [121,122]. Through the integration of sensors,
    AI algorithms, and real-time data monitoring, smart irrigation systems can precisely
    assess soil moisture levels, weather conditions, and crop water requirements.
    This data-driven approach enables farmers to apply water resources more efficiently,
    minimizing water wastage and maximizing crop productivity. By ensuring that irrigation
    is tailored to the specific needs of crops and adapting to changing environmental
    conditions, 4IR technologies can significantly contribute to sustainable water
    management and improved agricultural outcomes. Data-driven decision-making for
    improved irrigation practices The use of 4IR technologies in smart irrigation
    facilitates data-driven decision-making processes, enabling farmers to make informed
    choices regarding irrigation practices [121]. By collecting and analyzing large
    volumes of data from various sources, such as sensors, satellites, and weather
    stations, smart irrigation systems provide valuable insights into soil conditions,
    crop water requirements, and irrigation scheduling. This wealth of information
    empowers farmers to optimize irrigation strategies, adjust watering schedules,
    and apply the right amount of water at the right time, leading to improved water
    management and increased crop productivity. Data-driven decision-making also allows
    for proactive responses to changing climate patterns and helps mitigate the risks
    associated with water scarcity and climate variability. Precision irrigation and
    resource conservation Precision irrigation, made possible by 4IR technologies,
    offers the opportunity to precisely target water delivery to crops, thereby conserving
    water resources [121]. By utilizing data from sensors, drones, and satellite imagery,
    smart irrigation systems can identify variations in soil moisture levels, plant
    water stress, and water availability across different areas of the field. This
    information enables farmers to implement site-specific irrigation, providing water
    precisely where and when it is needed. As a result, water wastage is minimized,
    and the overall water use efficiency is significantly improved. Precision irrigation
    also contributes to reducing nutrient leaching, minimizing soil erosion, and optimizing
    fertilizer application, leading to more sustainable agricultural practices. Empowering
    smallholder farmers and rural communities 4IR technologies have the potential
    to empower smallholder farmers and rural communities by democratizing access to
    information, resources, and market opportunities [123]. Through the use of mobile
    applications, remote sensing, and digital platforms, farmers can access real-time
    data on weather conditions, market prices, and best agricultural practices [124].
    This information enables them to make informed decisions, improve productivity,
    and increase their income. Additionally, 4IR technologies facilitate the integration
    of smallholder farmers into agricultural value chains, connecting them with buyers,
    financial services, and extension services. This enhanced connectivity and access
    to markets can contribute to poverty alleviation, economic growth, and the overall
    development of rural communities. Prospects of fourth industrial revolution technologies
    for smart irrigation in sub-Saharan Africa Scaling up adoption of 4IR technologies
    in smart irrigation To fully harness the potential of Fourth Industrial Revolution
    technologies in smart irrigation, it is crucial to scale up their adoption across
    sub-Saharan Africa. This can be achieved through targeted efforts to increase
    awareness, provide technical assistance, and incentivize farmers and stakeholders
    to embrace these technologies [112]. Governments, development organizations, and
    private sector entities should collaborate to establish comprehensive programs

  description: Sustainable development goals are increasingly being pushed for the
    mining sector, which has a significant energy use and severe environmental effect.
    The situation in China, particularly in its 276 prefecture-level cities, has become
    more severe as a result of the fast industrialization and urbanization that occurred
    between 2010 and 2020. This has placed significant pressure on natural resources.
    This research examines how mining sector innovation and digital change may foster
    sustainable economic development. Technology to maximize natural resource use,
    limit environmental impacts, and promote sustainable economic development in China's
    276 prefecture-level cities during the last decade is the key focus. Information
    was gathered from several sources, encompassing governmental reports, industrial
    surveys, and scholarly publications. Complex relationships between natural resource
    utilization, industrial outputs, and environmental repercussions were analyzed
    using Advanced Big Data analytics. The analysis found that IoT, AI, and Blockchain
    may reduce the industry's environmental effect. Concretely, the analyzed cities
    had a quantifiable enhancement in their utilization of water, management of trash,
    and reduction of carbon emissions. Moreover, cities that proactively implemented
    digital transformation plans demonstrated a direct relationship with indices of
    environmentally sustainable economic growth. Environmentally sustainable economic
    growth, according to the study, can only be achieved if the mining industry embraces
    innovation and digital transformation.

    transformationMining industry 1. Introduction The mining sector is poised for
    a revolutionary age in the twenty-first century, propelled by data''s increasing
    relevance and technological breakthroughs. The ancient practice of extracting
    minerals and other natural resources, which has long served as the foundation
    of human civilization, is now undergoing a significant transformation. The integration
    of big data resources with mining economics and their increasing utilization are
    the leading causes of this transition. The mining business has a multitude of
    obstacles, such as limited resources and environmental issues. However, the combination
    of big data and mineral economics presents a promising avenue for innovation and
    digital transformation that might completely alter the sector. The reasons for
    this move to data-driven mining are complex and have a significant impact on the
    productivity, sustainability, and competitiveness of the sector. With the help
    of pertinent citations, this introduction will explore the main forces and incentives
    behind the mining industry''s use of significant data resources. The conventional
    mining method has long been predicated on the idea that resources are readily
    available and in ample supply. A significant obstacle for the sector is resource
    scarcity, which arises when these readily extracted minerals are exhausted. Because
    of this scarcity, resource economics requires a more profound comprehension (see

    in different cities. Mining activities are often conducted in difficult, distant
    locations that are costly to enter and maintain. Businesses are looking for methods
    to increase efficiency and optimize their operations in order to meet these issues.
    With its capacity for predictive maintenance and real-time monitoring, big data
    analytics may be pretty helpful in this area. When talking about the mining business,
    environmental issues are always at the center of the conversation. Alarms have
    been raised across the world about the ecological effects of mining operations,
    which range from habitat loss to water contamination. The mining sector is actively
    looking for solutions to lessen these effects and prove sustainability in response.
    Reducing ecological footprints and complying with laws may be achieved by using
    big data to estimate and assess the environmental effects of mining (Li et al.,
    2021). Mining activities carry a high risk, particularly in deep underground mines.
    Safety is of the utmost importance, and mining accidents may have severe repercussions
    for both employees and mining corporations. Extensive data integration in mining
    makes it possible to monitor working conditions in real-time and identify any
    safety issues early on. (Hook, 2019) research highlights the potential of big
    data to “proactively identify safety risks and ensure the well-being of miners.\"
    The mining sector is very susceptible to changes in commodities pricing as well
    as other market factors. Global demand, geopolitics, and economic uncertainty
    may all cause price fluctuations that affect mining businesses'' profitability.
    Big data resources make it possible to forecast market trends via modeling, which
    helps businesses make well-informed choices to protect themselves from price volatility
    (Zhao et al., 2022). Massive datasets can now be collected, processed, and analyzed
    more efficiently, thanks to the rapid development of technology, especially in
    the areas of artificial intelligence and data analytics. The advancement of technology
    has made it possible for mining businesses to use big data for better resource
    management, decision-making, and process innovation. Mining firms are up against
    fierce competition in the modern, international market. Competitors who can change
    with the times and use new approaches have an advantage. A company''s competitive
    position may be strengthened by using extensive data resources for exploration,
    production, and logistics management, which can lead to cost savings and improved
    decision-making (Zheng et al., 2022). Strict rules designed to safeguard the rights
    of workers and the environment apply to mining activities. Noncompliance may result
    in penalties, legal conflicts, and harm to one''s reputation. By helping mining
    businesses comply with the intricate web of rules and reporting requirements,
    big data solutions may lower the risks of noncompliance. Data plays a critical
    role in decision-making. Big data analytics has made it possible for mining businesses
    to make data-driven choices with more assurance, which has improved their operating
    strategies, resource allocation, and investment decisions. This is consistent
    with (Iqbal et al., 2021) assertion that “data-driven decision-making fosters
    a culture of innovation. The combination of big data and mining economics creates
    new avenues for research. Data-driven methods are making it easier to find new
    mineral resources, enhance the processes involved in recovering minerals, and
    explore previously unprofitable locations. This invention may add years to the
    life of current mining operations and open up new business ventures. Mining businesses
    may make better judgments about where and how to use their resources for exploration
    and extraction by using big data analytics. The influence of IM on urban MI is
    examined using 2010–2018 prefecture-level city data and updates some contradicting
    results from prior research. They may more precisely identify attractive mineral
    resources by using sophisticated geological modeling and predictive analytics,
    which will increase the effectiveness of resource extraction and exploitation.
    Real-time monitoring of mining operations, machinery, and equipment is made possible
    by big data technology. Thanks to predictive maintenance, this increases safety
    and decreases downtime. Mining businesses may save money on repairs and preserve
    operational continuity by seeing possible problems before they result in equipment
    breakdowns. Through the provision of tools for environmental impact assessment
    and mitigation, big data plays a critical role in advancing sustainability in
    the mining industry. Mining businesses may minimize their ecological impact, cut
    waste, and make well-informed choices to comply with environmental standards by
    using data-driven models. In the mining business, safety is the priority. Through
    proactive risk identification and faster incident response, big data solutions
    like sensor networks and real-time data analysis help create a safer workplace.
    As a result, there are fewer accidents at work, and miners operate in a safer
    atmosphere. Big data resources provide insightful information on the dynamics
    and trends of the industry. This information may help mining businesses make well-informed
    judgments about market timing and pricing tactics. Predicting price changes enables
    businesses to use their resources and protect themselves from market volatility
    more effectively. This study offers multiple contributions that have substantial
    consequences for both academic research and commercial applications. This paper
    examines how innovation and digital transformation may help mining companies sustainably
    use natural resources, filling a major research vacuum. China''s 276 prefecture-level
    cities provide a unique backdrop. The research uses advanced Big Data analytics
    to reveal the complex link between natural resource consumption, industrial output,
    and environmental effect. This facilitates the formulation of more precise policy
    suggestions. Furthermore, this study acts as a groundbreaking endeavor by establishing
    a connection between digital transformation techniques and indicators of green
    economic growth. It provides a measurable framework for assessing the sustainability
    of economic operations. Ultimately, the study provides a detailed plan that other
    countries and sectors can use to synchronize their economic expansion with ecological
    preservation. It provides practical and effective information that can significantly
    decrease the environmental impact of companies that are typically seen as harmful
    to the environment. This helps to expand the possibilities of achieving sustainable
    economic growth. 2. Literature review Digital transformation and corporate social
    responsibility (CSR) are important topics of study, particularly in industries
    like mining that have major environmental and social impacts. The Chinese mining
    sector is seeing a fast shift towards digitalization, which has significant consequences
    for corporate social responsibility (CSR) standards and sustainability. The Chinese
    mining sector''s digital revolution, CSR, and sustainability are examined in this
    paper. It includes the current study “Does digital transformation promote corporate
    social responsibility?” Documentation about Chinese mining. Digital transformation
    optimizes efficiency, creativity, and sustainability by integrating digital technology
    into company processes. The mining sector has seen a rapid increase in the use
    of digital technologies, such as automation, data analytics, IoT, and artificial
    intelligence. These technologies can transform mining operations by raising safety,
    mitigating environmental effects, and augmenting production (Iqbal et al., 2021).
    (Lujala and Narh, 2020) examine the influence of digital transformation on corporate
    social responsibility (CSR) in the Chinese mining sector. The study highlights
    the capacity of digital transformation to enhance corporate social responsibility
    (CSR) efforts via advancements in transparency, stakeholder involvement, and resource
    optimization. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has emerged as a crucial element
    of the contemporary mining sector, emphasizing ethical practices that tackle environmental
    and social issues. Mining activities often have adverse effects on nearby people,
    ecosystems, and labor conditions. CSR programs aim to alleviate these adverse
    impacts and promote sustainable and ethical mining activities. The research conducted
    by (Lin and Ouyang, 2014) examines shifting mining sector CSR dynamics. The study
    recognizes that digital transformation may enhance corporate social responsibility
    (CSR) initiatives by facilitating improved monitoring and reporting of environmental
    and social effects. Utilizing digital technology in mining can revolutionize the
    industry''s sustainability. Remote surveillance, self-driving cars, and proactive
    maintenance have the potential to improve safety, decrease energy use, and limit
    waste production. Digital technologies assist mining businesses in complying with
    rigorous environmental requirements and enhancing their social license to operate
    (Petrounias et al., 2023; Petrounias et al., 2023) provide valuable insights into
    the sustainability dimensions of digital transformation in the Chinese mining
    industry. The report emphasizes that sustainability plays a vital role in digital
    transformation initiatives since it improves the industry''s standing and long-term
    sustainability. Successful corporate social responsibility (CSR) in the mining
    sector requires strong and inclusive involvement of stakeholders and a commitment
    to openness. Digital technologies enhance communication and cooperation among
    mining firms, local populations, government agencies, and environmental groups.
    Stakeholders can get up-to-date information, which allows them to make decisions
    based on a higher level of knowledge and promotes confidence in the process. (Irfan
    et al., 2022) highlight the significance of digital transformation in improving
    transparency and involving stakeholders more effectively. Blockchain and internet
    platforms may improve data sharing and communication between mining companies
    and their stakeholders, according to research. Ensuring safety is an essential
    component of corporate social responsibility in the mining industry. The mining
    sector is renowned for its hazardous working conditions, and prioritizing safety
    issues is an essential element of responsible mining. Digital transformation enables
    the adoption of safety protocols, such as the use of self-driving cars, equipment
    operated from a distance, and continuous monitoring of workers'' well-being (Dubiński,
    2013). The research conducted by (Segura-Salazar et al., 2019) highlights the
    favorable influence of digital transformation on safety within the Chinese mining
    sector. The use of digital technology is linked to a decrease in accidents and
    improved working conditions. The environmental ramifications of mining activities
    have been a substantial focal point for corporate social responsibility (CSR).
    By allowing accurate monitoring of environmental indicators, promoting the responsible
    use of resources, and minimizing pollution, digital transformation may effectively
    reduce these consequences. (Meng et al., 2023) emphasize the correlation between
    digital transformation and environmental accountability in their study. The research
    demonstrates that the Chinese mining sector is using digital technology to reduce
    its environmental impact and achieve sustainability objectives. Optimal allocation
    of resources is an additional aspect of CSR in the mining industry. Digital transformation
    enhances resource efficiency via the optimization of manufacturing processes,
    the reduction of energy consumption, and the minimization of waste output. Implementing
    this approach not only promotes sustainability but also boosts cost efficiency
    (Wang et al., 2022). The research conducted by supports the idea that digital
    transformation promotes the use of resources in a more efficient manner. Chinese
    mining businesses are making notable progress in minimizing resource wastage and
    energy usage by integrating sophisticated analytics and automation. Mining operations
    must comply with a range of environmental and safety standards. Adhering to these
    standards is crucial for corporate social responsibility (CSR). Utilizing digital
    transformation may help guarantee compliance with regulatory standards via the
    utilization of data-driven analysis, real-time surveillance, and automated reporting
    (Piedra et al., 2018; Jamieson, 2011) contend that digital transformation plays
    a role in ensuring regulatory compliance within the Chinese mining sector. The
    research showcases the efficacy of digital technologies in enabling mining businesses
    to monitor and document their operations in accordance with governmental laws.
    CSR initiatives in the mining industry often include activities aimed at promoting
    community development and fostering social inclusion. Digital technologies facilitate
    these efforts by empowering local populations to engage in decision-making, access
    educational resources, and capitalize on economic possibilities. (Petrounias et
    al., 2023) found that digital transformation has the potential to promote community
    development within the Chinese mining sector. The research demonstrates that mining
    corporations are using digital platforms to interact with local people and foster
    social inclusion. The literature study focuses on the dynamic connection between
    digital transformation, CSR, and sustainability in the Chinese mining sector.
    A recent study conducted by (Chen et al., 2023) highlights the favorable influence
    of digital transformation on corporate social responsibility (CSR) efforts, specifically
    in relation to transparency, involvement of stakeholders, safety measures, environmental
    accountability, efficient use of resources, adherence to regulations, and community
    advancement. As the Chinese mining industry digitizes, it may strengthen its corporate
    social responsibility and increase sustainability and ethics. Digital technology
    and CSR in the mining sector provide a compelling model for other companies seeking
    to combine economic growth with environmental and social responsibility. 3. Research
    design 3.1. Data In order to investigate the impact that IM has on urban MI in
    China, this study makes use of an unbalanced panel dataset that includes 274 cities
    from the years 2010–2018. It is the CEADs that are released by Tsinghua University
    that provide the source for the MI data. At the same time, the CNRDS is used to
    collect the information about the IM. For the purpose of obtaining statistics
    at the city level, the China Cities Statistical Yearbook is used, whilst the official
    website of the Chinese government is contacted for information about resource-based
    and innovative cities. There are 2480 city-year observations included in the final
    dataset. 3.2. Variable 3.2.1. MI In this study, the MI serves as the independent
    parameter. A calculating procedure that was devised by is used in this research
    in order to ascertain the MI of each prefecture-level city in China (Jiang and
    Jiang, 2023). The description of all variables is given in Appendix A. (1) 3.2.2.
    IM The study''s independent parameter is IM. Consistent with the prior research
    conducted by (Gorman and Dzombak, 2018) this study identifies four dimensions
    for the purpose of constructing the IM index. The telecom base is quantified based
    on the revenue produced by telecom operations. Ultimately, the magnitude of information
    and software is contingent upon the number of persons engaged in data transmission,
    computer service, and the software business. The IM index in this study is created
    utilizing the PCA method. Furthermore, this study performs rigorous testing to
    enhance the dependability of the results. The tests use the IM created using the
    factor analysis technique and the EI index introduced by Peking University. 3.2.3.
    Control variables This work builds upon the research conducted by (Yu et al.,
    2023) by using additional measures to account for other possible variables that
    might influence MI. The control parameters consist of financial growth, MI, EI,
    CA, MV, and SA. Financial growth is quantified by the rate of increase in Gross
    Domestic Product (GDP). The calculation of energy consumption involves the division
    of coal use by the overall energy usage. The metric used to assess the level of
    education is obtained by calculating the natural logarithm of the amount of money
    spent on education per person. Population density is determined by logarithmically
    scaling the population divided by the city''s area. The ratio of secondary industry
    output value to GDP estimates industrial structure. Calculating the logarithm
    of the average research and technology spending per person quantifies technical
    level. 3.3. Model The influence of instant messaging (IM) on mental illness (MI)
    in China is measured by this study using a city-year fixed effects model, which
    is developed in the following manner: (2) MI is the urban MI, IM indicates the
    complete growth level of IM, β1 is the factor of interest for IM, and i and t
    indicate the city and year, respectively. The term “Controls” refers to control
    parameters, while β2 indicates the values associated with them. The symbol i indicates
    a random error vector. Table 1 displays the descriptive statistics of the primary
    parameters. Table 1. Statistical descriptions. Factors Assessments Average Standard

    prefecture-level cities ranging from 2010 to 2018 to examine the influence of
    Industrialization (IM) on Urban Migration (MI). By resolving any contradictions
    or updating contradictory findings from previous research, the purpose of this
    study is to give a better knowledge of the link between urban migration and industrialization.
    Specifically, this will be accomplished by finding a solution to any conflicts
    that may exist. In the following discussion, we explore the fundamental observations
    derived from this work. 4.1. Correlation matrix A correlation matrix examining
    the links between a number of factors, such as MV, SA, IM, MI and CA are shown
    in Table 2. The values in the matrix represent the correlations between the variables;
    positive values indicate positive associations, while negative values denote negative
    interactions. There is a very modest trend for urban migration to rise with increased
    levels of industry and safety, as seen by the extremely weak positive connection
    between MI and IM (0.071*) and SA (0.281) (Cabernard et al., 2019). The very modest
    negative correlation between MI and MV (−0.022) and EI (−0.031) suggests a little
    tendency for urban migration to decline with increased market volatility and environmental
    effects. MI and CA have a somewhat negative association (−0.270***), which suggests
    that urban migration tends to decline as industrial competitiveness increases.
    There is a very modest positive correlation (0.071*) between IM and MI, suggesting
    that there may be some relationship between growing industry and urban migration.

    (1) and (2), respectively. Predictions with all control parameters grouped by

    The findings of a benchmark regression analysis are shown in Table 3, which presents
    the findings of the investigation into the association between the independent
    variable IM and the factor that is dependent across three different specifications.
    The table presents coefficients, standard errors and other details about the regression
    models. This includes the inclusion of controls, fixed effects (City FE and Year
    FE), the number of observations, and the R-squared values. At a significance threshold
    of p < 0.001, the coefficient for IM is −0.031, indicating a significant change.
    The results of this study suggest that there is an inverse association between
    industrialization and the dependent variable, with a decrease of about 0.031 units
    for every one-unit increase in industrialization (Yıldız, 2022b). The constant
    coefficient is 3.739*** (p < 0.001), representing the predicted value of the dependent
    variable when the level of industrialization is at zero. Based on the fact that
    the coefficient of determination (R-squared) is 0.944, it can be concluded that
    the model is responsible for a considerable amount of the variability that is
    present in the dependent variable. A very high degree of statistical significance
    (p < 0.001) is associated with the coefficient for IM, which is −0.021. According
    to these results, even after taking into account other variables, each incremental
    increase in industrialization is related with a loss of around 0.021 units in
    the dependent variable. This is the case even after accounting for other factors.
    The coefficient that is constant is 4.980*** (p < 0.001), which is the value that
    is projected to be associated with the dependent variable when the degree of industrialization
    is zero. The R-squared coefficient is 0.943, suggesting a substantial level of
    explanatory capability for the model with controls. 4.3. Robustness test 4.3.1.
    Alternative indicate for MI The findings of the robustness tests, which evaluate
    the sensitivity of the correlations between variables under several alternative
    indicators and the removal of policy intervention, are shown in Table 4. Coefficients,
    standard errors in parenthesis, other details on controls, fixed effects the quantity
    of data, and R-squared values are all included in the table. The dependent variable
    drops by about 0.022 units for every unit rise in industrialization, according
    to the coefficient for IM, which is −0.022*** (p < 0.001) (Yıldız, 2022a). The
    model using the alternative indicator for MI has significant explanatory power,
    as shown by the R-squared value of 0.941. Table 4. Results from the robustness

    carbon emissions. This technique effectively reduces any bias in the study findings
    by taking into account the substantial variations in population size across cities.
    4.3.2. Interim management strategies IM is able to perform robustness tests using
    two separate metrics, which are included in this section. To begin, the IM index
    is derived by using the principal component analysis (PCA) method inside the benchmark
    regression (Bhatia et al., 2019). To address the possible inconsistencies that
    may result from using various calculation methods, this study incorporates the
    IM index derived from factor analysis EI as an extra measure of reliability. Furthermore,
    this research computes the IM using the MV methodology put out by Peking University.
    The findings are shown in columns (3) and (4) of Table 4, respectively. Crucially,
    both coefficients show a substantial negative relationship at the conventional
    statistical significance levels, which aligns with the benchmark results and confirms
    the integrity of the conclusions as mentioned above. 4.3.3. Eliminate policy interference
    The research reported in Table 4 offers valuable insights into the correlations
    among the variables MI, IM, and PCA after considering the removal of policy intervention.
    This resilience assessment enables a more intricate comprehension of these connections
    within a setting where the impact of policy-related issues is reduced (Z. Zhang
    and Elshkaki, 2022). This specification excludes policy interference in order
    to focus on the fundamental links between IM, MI, and PCA. The coefficient for
    IM is consistently negative and statistically significant, with a value of −0.019***
    (p < 0.001). This suggests that urban migration is strongly influenced by industrialization,
    even when state intervention is removed. There is a negative correlation between
    industrialization and urban migration, where a one-unit increase in industrialization
    leads to a loss of around 0.019 units in urban migration. This indicates that
    the influence of industry on urban migration is firm and not only influenced by
    policy issues. The specification includes the introduction of the coefficient
    for the variable EI in this context (M. Zhang et al., 2022). The data is statistically
    significant, as shown by the negative value of −0.008* (p < 0.05). This suggests
    that when the environmental effect rises (perhaps owing to industrial activities),
    there is a tendency for urban migration to decline. This discovery emphasizes
    the possible conflict between ecological considerations and the movement of people
    to cities. It implies that the quality of the environment may have an impact on
    urban migration. 4.3.4. Endogenous analysis In the context of MI instrumental
    variable analysis is used to mitigate any endogeneity concerns associated with
    the dependent variable, MI. Regression results may be skewed due to endogeneity
    if the dependent variable and an independent variable are mutually determined.
    Typically, this strategy involves tackling endogeneity issues via the use of instrumental
    variables or other statistical tools. The purpose of an endogenous analysis is
    to establish a cause-and-effect link between two variables (Mudd, 2010). It aids
    in determining the causal relationship between industrialization and urban migration,
    namely whether industrialization leads to changes in urban migration or whether
    urban migration drives industrialization (Diaz et al., 2018). The presence of
    endogeneity in regression models may result in parameter estimates that are both
    biased and inconsistent. The use of instrumental factors or other methodologies
    seeks to alleviate this bias, generating more dependable and impartial estimations.
    Enhanced Policy Insights: Mitigating endogeneity problems in the study of MI yields
    more precise information for policy formulation. Understanding the causal relationship
    between industrialization and urban migration might provide valuable insights
    for urban planning and economic strategies. By addressing endogeneity, the model''s
    ability to make accurate predictions is enhanced. It facilitates the generation
    of more accurate forecasts on urban migration trends in response to shifts in
    industrialization or other variables (Hong et al., 2019). If the relationship
    between MI and IM is endogenous, the statistical association seen in the data
    may not provide an accurate representation of the actual causal connection. Endogenous
    analysis facilitates accurate interpretation of data by discerning between false
    correlations and genuine causes. The use of endogenous analysis may have an impact
    on the suggestions made for policy. If it is determined that urban migration is
    the main factor behind industrialization, governments may need to prioritize urban
    development programs. On the other hand, if industrialization is the main factor,
    policymakers may give more importance to promoting industrial expansion and generating
    employment opportunities. Endogenous analysis may also uncover problems associated
    with the accuracy of data, measurement mistakes, or the bias caused by missing
    variables (Wu et al., 2017). These observations may provide direction for more
    data gathering and improvement of the model. Table 5 displays the outcomes of
    an instrumental variable (IV) study. This analysis employs the number of fixed
    telephones in 1985 as a tool to tackle possible endogeneity concerns in the correlation
    between IM (Industrialization) and the dependent variable IM_lag. The table presents
    coefficients together with their corresponding standard errors in parenthesis.
    It also includes further details on controls, fixed effects the number of observations,
    R-squared values, and the F-value for the first stage, which evaluates the instrument''s
    effectiveness. The coefficient for IM is −0.050, with a significance level of
    p < 0.001 (Zhao et al., 2022). It can be deduced from this that there is an expected
    decrease of 0.050 units in IM_lag for every one-unit increase in industrialization.
    More industrialization leads to less industrialization in the subsequent time
    period, as shown by this conclusion, which suggests that there is an inverse association
    between industrialization and its delayed value. A significant association exists
    between the instrumental variable and the endogenous variable IM, as shown by
    the F-value of 320.101 for the first stage of the experiment (see Table 6). Table

    4.4.1. North-south divide This research further divides China''s cities into two
    separate regions, namely the northern and southern regions, by using a line of
    demarcation known as the Qinling-Huaihe line as the basis for comparison. This
    classification builds upon the previous study undertaken by (Towa et al., 2021).
    This study is to investigate the various impacts that instant messaging (IM) has
    on MI in these particular locations. As part of the process of determining the
    nature of the relationship between IM and MI, it is vital to take into consideration
    the various environmental conditions that exist at both locations. The value in
    southern cities, on the other hand, is negative, but it does not meet the criteria
    for statistical significance. As a result, it seems that instant messaging may
    have a minuscule influence on MI in southern cities. The scholarly and policymaker
    communities have shown significant interest in studying the effects of industrialization
    on urban migration over an extended period. Metropolitan migration often intensifies
    as areas undergo industrialization, propelled mainly by the appeal of job prospects
    in metropolitan hubs. The association between these two factors, however, has
    yet to be consistent, and prior study has shown contradictory results. Prior research
    investigating the correlation between industrialization and urban migration has
    produced conflicting findings. Several studies have shown a robust positive association,
    indicating that as the industry progresses, there is an increase in urban migration.
    Conversely, several studies have shown a detrimental or inconsequential correlation,
    suggesting that industrialization only sometimes results in more urban migration.
    The inconsistencies have caused uncertainty in comprehending the interactions
    involved and need more examination. The study''s results demonstrate that the
    correlation between industrialization and urban migration is still being determined.
    From 2010 to 2018, the influence of industrialization on urban migration has varied.
    The fluctuation in time may be ascribed to the dynamic nature of industrialization
    and the shifting demographic and economic variables that impact migratory patterns
    within this specific period. The economic structure plays a crucial part in the
    process of industrialization. Regions undergoing a transition from conventional
    industries to more technologically sophisticated sectors tend to draw a more significant
    influx of urban migrants. This discovery provides evidence for the notion that
    urban migrants are attracted to areas that have more advanced and higher-paying
    employment prospects, indicating that the makeup of industrialization has a crucial
    impact (Basińska et al., 2020). The research emphasizes the significance of governmental
    policies and geographical discrepancies in influencing the correlation between
    industrialization and migration. In areas where governments have established explicit
    strategies to facilitate urban migration, the impact of industrialization on urban
    migration is particularly noticeable. Moreover, discrepancies across regions,
    such as differences in available resources and the level of infrastructural development,
    impact the degree to which industrialization contributes to migration. The effect
    of industrialization on urban migration is greatly influenced by the quality of
    living in urban areas. Urban areas that provide enhanced living standards, including
    superior healthcare, education, and infrastructure, tend to allure a more significant
    influx of migrants. This implies that urban migration is not only driven by economic
    factors but is also impacted by broader living conditions. The educational attainment
    and skills of migrants are another crucial aspect that influences the link between
    industrialization and migration. Regions that prioritize sectors requiring specific
    skills and extensive knowledge tend to attract migrants with advanced education
    and specialized expertise. Consequently, this leads to a favorable effect on the
    rate of urban migration (Yıldız, 2022b). The results of this research have very
    significant policy ramifications. First and foremost, planners must acknowledge
    that the correlation between industrialization and urban migration is only sometimes
    applicable (Zhu et al., 2023). The phenomenon fluctuates over time and is shaped
    by local economic frameworks, governmental measures, and geographical discrepancies.
    In order to encourage sustainable urban migration and capitalize on the beneficial
    impacts of industrialization, governments may contemplate implementing the accompanying
    policy measures: Promoting the variety of industrial structures is crucial to
    providing employment possibilities for individuals with varying skill levels,
    hence maintaining a balanced distribution of labor migration. Alleviate regional
    inequities by allocating resources towards enhancing infrastructure and public
    services in underdeveloped regions, hence enhancing their appeal to urban migrants.
    Emphasizing the enhancement of living standards in metropolitan areas to attract
    migrants and facilitate their assimilation into local communities. Ultimately,
    the connection between industrialization and urban migration is complex and ever-changing,
    with many effects that evolve as time progresses (Sailer et al., 2020). The study''s
    results provide valuable insights into the dynamic nature of this connection,
    highlighting the significance of economic structure, government policies, regional
    differences, quality of life, and educational achievement. These findings provide
    useful information for policymakers who want to effectively manage and exploit
    the potential advantages of urban migration within the framework of industrialization.
    5. Conclusion and policy implications From 2010 to 2020, this research analyzes
    276 prefecture-level cities in China to determine the link between natural resources,
    ecologically friendly economic development, and digital technology utilization
    in the mining industry. The study''s results validate the advantages of implementing
    digital technology and innovation techniques in the mining sector, particularly
    in terms of fostering environmentally sustainable economic expansion. An essential
    finding of this study is the quantifiable enhancement in crucial environmental
    aspects such as water utilization efficiency, waste administration, and carbon
    emissions in urban areas that have used digital transformation techniques in their
    mining industries. In addition, indicators of long-term economic development were
    shown to correlate directly with the adoption of technology like the Blockchain,
    the Internet of Things (IoT), and Artificial Intelligence (AI). This gives hope
    that we can find a way to sustainability, even in industries that have a reputation
    for being bad for the environment. Significantly, the study contributes a novel
    aspect to the discourse on sustainable development by establishing a connection
    between digital change and environmental preservation. It demonstrates that technology
    serves not only as a means for financial benefit but also as a catalyst for beneficial
    environmental transformation. Governments ought to offer tax incentives or subsidies
    to mining businesses that are prepared to make investments in environmentally
    friendly technologies. Public-private partnerships could be established to facilitate
    the training of the mining industry workforce in order to adjust to emerging technologies
    effectively. Implementing sustainability certification for mining businesses that
    successfully adopt green technologies might serve as an additional incentive for
    responsible mining. It is imperative to establish obligatory criteria for mining
    firms to reveal environmental data since this would facilitate the process of
    government and communities holding them responsible. Efficient positioning and
    careful organization of mining operations can significantly diminish the adverse
    effects on the environment, making it imperative to prioritize this aspect in
    both national and regional planning. Every one of the 276 prefecture-level cities
    in China possesses distinct resources, challenges, and possibilities. Consequently,
    it is imperative to develop customized policies that address the specific requirements
    of each locality. It is crucial to involve local populations in decision-making
    processes to secure social acceptance, particularly in the 276 prefecture-level
    cities. Policies should strive to establish the essential infrastructure required
    to facilitate the use of innovative technologies specifically designed to meet
    the unique needs and circumstances of the 276 cities. Conducting regular environmental
    audits can provide significant insights into the real effects of existing rules,
    creating a feedback loop that is crucial for ongoing progress. This study might
    pave the way for worldwide standardization by setting standards for sustainable
    mining practices throughout the world. By working together across borders, sustainable
    mining may benefit from the sharing of knowledge and resources, expanding its
    impact on a global scale. A financial incentive for the use of sustainable practices
    may be created when countries or areas can show they can get minerals in an ethical
    and ecologically acceptable way. This might lead to easier market access. Global
    funding should prioritize the development of highly efficient green technology
    to ensure sustainable mining practices. These policy recommendations that can
    assist governments, industry stakeholders, and communities in promoting sustainable
    mining practices, specifically in the context of China''s 276 prefecture-level
    cities. CRediT authorship contribution statement Yue Zhou: Writing – original

  description: Proper water management is crucial for agriculture, as its irrigation
    systems can waste approximately 60% of water. Using IoT for irrigation based on
    soil moisture can help reduce waste. This study used multidimensional time series
    modeling to predict soil moisture using two years of data on a US farm, including
    factors such as soil moisture, temperature, and weather. The models assessed were
    machine learning algorithms like Extreme Gradient Boosting and Random Forests,
    Deep Learning's Spectral Temporal Graph Neural Network (StemGNN), and Vector Autoregression
    as a reference model. Random Forest was the most efficient and stable model. Furthermore,
    the spectral temporal graph neural network could not outperform the reference
    model. Comparing Random Forest with univariate algorithms like Naive, Exponential
    Smoothing, and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) showed univariate's
    better performance in 9 of 10 datasets, with ARIMA being best in 8. A substantial
    disparity is observed when considering the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
    metric. ARIMA yields an MAPE of 0.052, while StemGNN reports 0.127 as the major
    difference. ARIMA achieves a MAPE of 0.046 for the minor difference, whereas StemGNN
    obtains 0.038. In the remaining eight datasets, ARIMA consistently outperforms
    StemGNN by at least 30%. In summary, modern methods could not beat the older methods
    in the study data sets.

    like Naive, Exponential Smoothing, and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average
    (ARIMA) showed univariate''s better performance in 9 of 10 datasets, with ARIMA
    being best in 8. A substantial disparity is observed when considering the Mean
    Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) metric. ARIMA yields an MAPE of 0.052, while
    StemGNN reports 0.127 as the major difference. ARIMA achieves a MAPE of 0.046
    for the minor difference, whereas StemGNN obtains 0.038. In the remaining eight
    datasets, ARIMA consistently outperforms StemGNN by at least 30%. In summary,
    modern methods could not beat the older methods in the study data sets. Previous

    approximately 65 billion cubic meters of water, 50% of this water used for irrigation.1
    However, up to 60% of irrigation water is wasted due to inefficient irrigation
    practices [1]. With the expansion of agriculture and the growing risk of water
    shortages, the development of new irrigation strategies to avoid water waste is
    becoming increasingly important. Technology can play a vital role in addressing
    this challenge by creating efficient irrigation water management systems. An example
    is the Smart Water Management Platform (SWAMP) project, which used intelligent
    tools to manage irrigation plans. The SWAMP platform leverages technologies such
    as the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, and data science to offer farmers
    an intelligent strategy to monitor and plan irrigation schedules. The fields can
    be monitored by sensors and drones connected to a management system that receives
    real-time data. All data are processed and stored in the cloud, and historical
    data is used to train forecasting models that predict soil moisture (SM). The
    predictions generated by the models provide valuable information for farmers in
    planning irrigation schedules [2], [3]. Similarly, Amarendra Goap, Deepak Sharma,
    and their team have developed a fully autonomous irrigation system that combines
    IoT, cloud computing, and data science to predict SM levels in real time [4].
    The intelligent system collects data from soil sensors, air, and light radiation
    and uses machine learning models to forecast SM. The output of the model feeds
    into a decision system to control field irrigation. Furthermore, time series forecasting
    has proven applicable in various problem domains in recent years. For example,
    Yassen et al. [5] used time series prediction to predict water flow in Malaysia.
    Their study aimed to improve water management to ensure drinking water for citizens
    and energy production. Sezer, Gudelek, and Ozbayoglu [6] systematically reviewed
    the literature on studies that used time series forecasting to model financial
    time series. These studies applied machine learning and deep learning models to
    predict commodity values such as oil, coffee, and sugar and the values of company
    shares, currencies, and digital coins. Furthermore, Ediger and Akar [7] used time
    series forecasting to model fuel demand in Turkey. On the contrary, Barak and
    Sadegh [8] proposed to model annual energy consumption in Iran using time series
    forecasting. In both studies, the researchers aimed to predict the need for energy
    resources for government planning. Efficient irrigation is essential to ensure
    better water management and the continuity of agricultural production. Esfahani,
    Rua, and McKee [9] described how efficient irrigation prevents soil leaching and
    crop stress from excess water, thus ensuring productive capacity during water
    scarcity. Estimating the future value of the SM variable is essential for irrigation
    planning to ensure adequate water volume for cultivation. Typically, physical
    models that simulate the dynamics of water in the soil over time generate estimates
    for the SM variable [10]. These models require knowledge of soil properties to
    effectively simulate water dynamics in the soil [11]. Furthermore, the evapotranspiration
    of soil water, irrigation, precipitation, and transpiration of the cultivated
    plant are essential factors in estimating the variable SM [12]. There are various
    tools for generating SM estimates using physical models, with HYDRUS software
    being one of the most widely used [13].” A drawback is that obtaining all the
    calibration data from the HYDRUS software can be challenging. Thus, alternative
    approaches, such as time series forecasting with machine learning and deep learning,
    are being explored. Karandish and Simunek [14] compared various time series forecasting
    algorithms to predict SM, using the output model to feed a system that creates
    the irrigation schedule. Esfahani, Rua, and McKee [9] combined machine learning
    and sensor data to create an optimization system for the irrigation process. In
    their work, Goap and Sharma [15] used a regression model to forecast SM. The regression
    model output was then classified using a cluster model to generate a binary output,
    which determined whether to continue the irrigation process. Goldstein and Fink
    [16] utilized machine learning algorithms to predict SM time series, and the resulting
    predictions were used to plan the weekly irrigation strategy. Accurate SM forecasting
    is crucial for intelligent platforms and fully autonomous irrigation systems to
    generate information on irrigation schedules [17]. Applying time series modeling
    for soil moisture forecasting requires careful consideration of many technical
    details. These include the selection of appropriate models, the choice of input
    and window lag variables, and the optimization of parameters. Additionally, the
    accuracy of the forecasts must be evaluated to ensure that the model performs
    as expected. This paper proposes time series modeling of SM data and investigates
    the performance of univariate and multivariate algorithms for forecasting SM.
    Our experiments aim to explore the influence of data window size on algorithm
    performance and compare the performance of traditional algorithms with modern
    ones. We investigate the ideal sample data size required to build an efficient
    model, considering different scenarios of data availability ranging from one to
    twelve months or more. We also examine the impact of updating the fitting model
    on the prediction performance. Finally, we compare the performance of univariate
    and multivariate algorithms in ten datasets from various regions of the world.
    Our goal is to provide information on the performance of different SM forecasting
    algorithms and to identify the most efficient algorithms for this task. 2. Background
    This section presents the background of our research. 2.1. Soil moisture The target
    variable in this study is SM, which represents the amount of water content in
    a soil volume ( ) [18]. The study focuses on investigating the capability of machine
    learning algorithms to forecast future SM values, which is essential to create
    an efficient irrigation schedule. 2.2. Forecasting algorithms We used statistical
    and machine learning algorithms to analyze the SM forecast. Statistical algorithms
    included Naive [19], Vector Autoregression (VAR) [20], Exponential Smoothing (ES)
    [19], and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) [21]. The naive method
    predicts the value of the future series as the last known observation [19]. ES
    predicts future values using weighted averages that exponentially prioritize recent
    samples, assigning them higher weights [19]. The VAR model predicts the future
    value of a series as a linear combination of past values of the target series
    and the series that influence it [20]. On the other hand, the machine learning
    algorithms consisted of Random Forest (RF) [22], Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB)
    [23], Neural basis expansion analysis for interpretable time series forecasting
    (N-BEATS) [24], and Spectral Temporal Graph Neural Network for Multivariate Time
    Series Forecasting (StemGNN) [25]. RF is an ensemble technique derived from bagging.
    RF comprises n predictors built using decision trees. It distinguishes itself
    from bagging by introducing random variable selection during predictor construction.
    It enables the algorithm to be trained with diverse input sets, reducing predictor
    variance and improving the accuracy of the final prediction [22]. XGB is a Gradient
    Boosting Machines implementation that incorporates decision trees as weak predictors
    and includes regularization in the cost function to prevent overfitting during
    training [23], [26], [27]. The N-BEATS architecture for univariate time series
    prediction consists of M stacks, which function as an ensemble model similar to
    boosting. Each stack specializes in predicting the residual of the previous stack.
    Stacks are made up of K blocks, which operate similarly. Each block predicts the
    residual of the previous block and comprises two parts: a fully connected neural
    network (FC) with four layers and two single-layer FC neural networks [24]. The
    StemGNN combines Graph Discrete Fourier Transform (GDFT), Discrete Fourier Transform
    (TFD), and deep learning components. StemGNN transforms multivariate time series
    into a multivariate temporal graph in the first layer. It uses a Gated Recurrent
    Unit (GRU) layer to calculate the adjacency matrix W for series computation and
    self-attention. The second layer, StemGNN, involves a GDFT transformation, followed
    by a sequence of operations. It includes TFD, 1D CNN, Gated Linear Unit (GLU),
    and the inverse Fourier transform to capture intraseries patterns. The spectral
    matrix is filtered through a graph-convolutional neural network. The output consists
    of future value predictions and input series reconstruction. The loss function
    optimizes the network parameters by minimizing prediction and reconstruction errors.
    We have designated the Naive and ES models as the univariate baseline and the
    VAR model as the multivariate baseline. We selected the well-known ARIMA algorithm
    [28], [29], [30], [31] to provide a benchmark for statistical time series forecasting.
    We selected N-BEATS, a state-of-the-art algorithm that has demonstrated exceptional
    performance in time series forecasting [24] for deep learning models. To investigate
    decision tree-based models for multivariate time series forecasting, we selected
    RF [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39] and XGB [40], which represent
    ensemble bagging [41] and boosting [40] based on decision tree models, respectively.
    Finally, we explore StemGNN, a cutting-edge deep learning algorithm, as a representative
    for multivariate time series forecasting [25]. 2.3. Data description Throughout
    the work, we used a set of datasets to investigate SM forecasting using various
    algorithms. The Cook Agronomy Farm (CAF) [42] data set was the result of the Long-Term
    Agroecosystem Research Group (LTAR), which consists of researchers associated
    with Washington State University who monitor the soil of an agricultural cultivation
    farm [43]. We also collected nine data sets from the International Soil Moisture
    Network (ISMN) project, an international collaborative initiative to store and
    make available SM records collected from soil monitoring sites worldwide [44].
    Our research comprises two sets of experiments to compare the performance of multivariate
    and univariate algorithms. In the first group of experiments, we focused on evaluating
    the influence of data window size on the performance of multivariate algorithms
    using the CAF dataset. The CAF data set comprises data from 42 sensors installed
    on a farm, divided into 42 zones, each monitored by one sensor. Each sensor records
    SM, temperature, and bulk electrical conductivity at five depths: 0.3, 0.6, 0.9,
    1.2, and 1.5 meters. Additionally, the data set includes daily temperature and
    rainfall data from the nearest meteorological station. Therefore, three new features
    were added to the data set: daily precipitation, maximum daily temperature, and
    minimum daily temperature. The data set contains daily measurements for two years.
    For our experiments, we selected the data generated by the CAF095 sensor and used
    SM, soil temperature, and bulk electrical conductivity from depths of 0.3, 0.6,
    and 0.9 meters. Therefore, our final data set consisted of nine soil features
    and three meteorological features. The second group of experiments focused on
    comparing the performance of multivariate and univariate algorithms on SM forecasts.
    For this purpose, we used ten data sets from different regions worldwide, including
    the CAF data set from the first group. We obtained the other nine data sets from
    the ISMN project, a global initiative that stores and provides access to data
    sets that contain SM records [44]. The ISMN partners monitor SM levels around
    the world and make the data available in the cloud. Table 1 shows the details
    of the location of the data set. Each station monitored air and soil using sensors
    and registered a feature group, generating each data set. Table 2 presents a comprehensive
    list of feature names, corresponding abbreviations, and accompanying descriptions.
    Meanwhile, Table 3 offers an overview of the constituent features of each dataset.

    in terms of the features they included. We selected SM, temperature, precipitation,
    and air temperature as our main features. In some cases, the sensors generated
    SM and soil temperature readings at different depths, and we used both whenever
    possible. We selected two years for each time series and grouped the hourly data
    into daily values using the trimmed mean at 80%. Our study highlights the importance
    of data window size in multivariate algorithms and sheds light on the performance
    of multivariate versus univariate algorithms for SM forecasting. Our results have
    implications for the design and development of future forecasting models in this
    field. 2.4. Performance measures Throughout this work, we used some metrics to
    measure the efficiency of our algorithms in forecasting SM. Our time series consists
    of daily values, so we aim to predict the next day''s value. To compare the performance
    of our algorithms, we use the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), the Mean Absolute
    Error (MAE), and the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Using time series
    data from different locations throughout the world, we chose MAPE to compare the
    performance of the algorithm across different data ranges. In addition, we used
    RMSE and MAE to evaluate the impact of outliers on the forecast. While the former
    imposes a higher penalty for larger errors, the latter does not. Therefore, we
    use both metrics to analyze the effect of outliers on our forecasts. 3. Methodology
    The methodology used in our study consists of three scenarios designed to address
    key research questions. In the first scenario, we conducted seven experiments,
    each with varying training window size, to assess their impact on the performance
    of multivariate algorithms. We also evaluated the prediction stability over a
    year for each training configuration. Scenario two mirrored scenario one but with
    a reduced fitting frequency for multivariate algorithms, conducted every 15 days
    instead of 30. It allowed us to investigate the impact of the fitting frequency
    for model updating. In scenario three, we performed ten experiments comparing
    the best performing multivariate algorithm from scenarios one and two with univariate
    algorithms across ten diverse datasets from different geographical locations,
    providing insight into multivariate algorithm performance relative to univariate
    counterparts. The research questions were as follows. • How does the size of the
    training window influence the performance of multivariate algorithms? • Does the
    frequency of fitting the multivariate algorithm influence the prediction efficiency?
    • Does the multivariate algorithm outperform the univariate algorithms? We conducted
    seven experiments in scenario one to gain insight into the first research question.
    For each experiment, we defined a different training window to compare the impact
    of the training window size on the performance of multivariate algorithms. Additionally,
    we analyzed the performance of each multivariate algorithm over a year to assess
    the prediction stability of each training configuration. For scenario two, we
    conducted seven experiments identical to scenario one, but with a lower frequency
    of fitting of the multivariate algorithms. Specifically, the algorithms were fitted
    in scenario two every 15 days, compared to every 30 days in scenario one. This
    strategy allowed us to investigate whether the frequency of fitting the multivariate
    algorithms impacted their performance. Finally, in scenario three, we performed
    ten experiments that generated results to discuss the fourth question. We selected
    the multivariate algorithm with the best performance in scenarios one and two
    experiments and compared it with univariate algorithms. We considered ten datasets
    from different geographical points for the comparative study. Thus, we obtained
    results to discuss the performance of the multivariate algorithm compared to the
    univariate algorithms. 3.1. Scenario one In scenario one, we utilized the CAF
    dataset, as described in section 2.3. The target variable was the SM at a depth
    of 0.3m. The data set was divided into two periods of one year, with the first
    period used to optimize the hyperparameters of the models and the second period
    used for validation. For the training stage in scenario one, we used a sliding
    window format over the first data period, with the test dataset defined as 25%
    of the size of the training dataset. The training window was slid across the first
    year''s data, with one-third of the training dataset data updated in each iteration.
    We recorded the optimized hyperparameters and the predicted and test series for
    each training cycle to calculate performance metrics. During hyperparameter selection,
    we stored the model with the best performance per iteration of the experiment
    and grouped the hyperparameters into discrete and continuous categories. The discrete
    hyperparameters with the highest frequency were selected in the iterations of
    each experiment, whereas the mean was used for the continuous hyperparameters.
    Performance was used as a tiebreaker for hyperparameter selection. Experiments
    six and seven were exceptions to the described process. In both cases, the training
    window was one year, the training data set defined as 80% of the data and the
    test data set as 20%. After selecting the hyperparameters, we fitted the models
    using the entire available data set in the first period. During the validation
    stage, we did not perform hyperparameter optimization. Instead, we utilized the
    hyperparameters selected in the training stage and fitted the algorithms using
    the data window of the period prior to the prediction. For each day''s prediction,
    we used data from the previous days and, after 30 days, we fitted the model again.
    We recorded the predicted series values to calculate the MAE, RMSE, and MAPE evaluation
    metrics. Experiment seven was an exception to the previously described process,
    with the training window not sliding. After predicting the first month of the
    validation dataset, we added the data to the training data set and used the entire
    period for algorithm fitting. 3.2. Scenario two In scenario two, except for the
    prediction step, we replicated the experiments conducted in section 3.1. Specifically,
    we conducted seven experiments to evaluate the impact of fitting the multivariate
    algorithms every 15 days compared to every 30 days in scenario one. We used the
    same data set in scenario one for each experiment and the same methodology for
    hyperparameter optimization and performance evaluation. The only difference was
    the frequency of fitting the multivariate algorithms, done every 15 days in scenario
    two. For prediction, we make forecasts one day ahead for the next 15 days. The
    primary goal of scenario two was to investigate the effect of the frequency of
    fitting of the models on their performance. 3.3. Scenario three In scenario three,
    we selected the multivariate algorithm that demonstrated the best performance
    in scenarios one and two and conducted ten experiments. Next, we compare the performance
    of the selected algorithm with the univariate algorithms using ten data sets from
    various geographical points. The results allowed us to evaluate the performance
    of the multivariate algorithm against the univariate algorithms at different locations.
    Section 2.3 describes the data sets used in the experiments. We used the results
    from scenarios one and two to design the experiment plan for scenario three. We
    selected the modeling arrangement in which the algorithms evaluated in the previous
    scenarios presented the best performance. We began the experiment by selecting
    the original data sets, from which we chose samples for two years. Next, we selected
    the algorithms evaluated in the comparative study, which included the RF multivariate
    algorithm that outperformed the other algorithms evaluated in scenarios one and
    two. We also selected four univariate algorithms, including three traditional
    statistical methods: Naive, ES, and ARIMA. The fourth univariate algorithm selected
    was the N-BEATS neural network architecture. We divided the data samples in scenario
    three into two periods of one year. We used the first period to optimize the hyperparameters
    of the algorithms, and we used data from the second period to validate the results.
    The experiments in this scenario compared the performance of the univariate algorithms
    with the multivariate RF algorithm, which had achieved the best performance in
    the previous scenarios. During the training stage of the experiments in scenario
    three, we optimized the hyperparameters of the RF and N-BEATS algorithms. The
    other algorithms evaluated at this stage of the study did not require optimization
    due to the nature of the algorithms. We used the same strategy as in experiments
    six and seven of the previous scenarios, using a training window of one year.
    The training base was defined with 80% of the sample data and the test base with
    20%. Once the hyperparameters were selected, we fitted the algorithms using one
    year for the validation stage. To select hyperparameters, we stored the model
    with the best performance per iteration of the experiment. We grouped the hyperparameters
    into discrete and continuous ones, selecting the discrete hyperparameters with
    the highest frequency in the iterations of each experiment. We use the mean to
    select continuous hyperparameters, with performance as a tiebreaker for hyperparameter
    selection. We did not optimize the hyperparameter during the validation stage
    using the hyperparameters selected in the previous step. However, we calibrated
    the algorithms using the entire available data period. The strategy was similar
    to experiment seven of the previous scenarios, using a daily aggregation window
    strategy before prediction and performing algorithm calibration with all available
    historical data. By expanding the daily training base, the model would have accessed
    the most significant sample variability. Finally, we recorded the predicted series
    values to calculate the MAE, RMSE, and MAPE evaluation metrics. 4. Results and
    discussion This section discusses project questions based on the experiment results.
    4.1. How does the size of the training window influence the performance of multivariate
    algorithms? To investigate the first design question, we developed seven configurations
    of training windows, namely, monthly, bimonthly, quarterly, half-yearly, and annual.
    The annual window was used in two configurations, as explained in 3.1. Fig. 1
    presents the MAPE performance graph per experiment for all algorithms evaluated
    in scenarios one and two. The training windows successively increase from the
    first to the last experiment. There was no direct relationship between performance
    and an increase in the training window. The VAR algorithm in scenario one improved
    performance from the first to the second experiment, but the performance decreased
    from the second to the third one. The StemGNN algorithm showed continuous worsening
    from the first to the fifth experiment and has improved in the last. RF achieved
    similar results in experiments one to four, worsened in experiment five, and improved
    in experiments six and seven. The XGB algorithm presented regular results from
    the first to the fifth experiment and improved performance in experiments six
    and seven. Therefore, increasing the training window did not guarantee better
    algorithm performance. However, the results revealed that a one-year or longer
    window applied to experiments six and seven significantly improved the performance
    of all algorithms. Evidence found to explain the better performance referred to
    the periodic behavior of the series of CAF data sets. Table 4, Table 5, Table

    the frequency of fitting the multivariate algorithm influence prediction efficiency?
    To investigate the second research question, we separated the fit algorithm frequency
    in experiments conducted in scenarios one and two. In scenario one, we split the
    validation step into 12 parts and predicted 30 observations continuously. Subsequently,
    we added the predicted observations to the training base and refitted the models.
    We repeated a similar configuration for scenario two, but with a prediction period
    of 15 observations. We present all the result metrics for each experiment in both
    scenarios in Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7. Fig. 1, Fig. 4, Fig. 5 present
    the results of the experiments in each scenario, with scenario one illustrated
    in blue and scenario two in orange. We presented the results of the MAE, RMSE
    and MAPE metrics. In all three metrics, reducing the calibration period improved
    the algorithms'' performance, except for experiment six of the StemGNN algorithm,
    which showed worsened performance for all analyzed metrics in scenario two compared
    to scenario one. Moreover, in experiment seven, we observed that the RMSE and
    MAE obtained for the XGB algorithm achieved slightly lower performance in scenario
    two. Therefore, the frequent calibration strategy generally resulted in better
    performance of the algorithms explored in the study. Download : Download high-res

    To address the third research question, we analyzed the results obtained from
    the experiments conducted in scenario three. Our objective was to compare the
    performance of multivariate and univariate algorithms in forecasting SM. For this
    comparison, we chose the RF algorithm, which demonstrated the best performance
    in scenarios one and two. We evaluated and compared the performance of four univariate
    algorithms: ARIMA, N-BEATS, ES, and Naive. Table 8 presents all the algorithms
    evaluated. We conducted ten experiments using different datasets, and the target

    CAF Interestingly, the RF algorithm could not outperform the Naive method in nine
    out of ten experiments. In particular, Naive, one of the simplest methods available,
    outperformed the RF algorithm in most experiments. The results suggest that the
    components registered in data sets containing SM series did not add predictive
    capacity to multivariate methods. The N-BEATS algorithm could not outperform the
    ES, Naive, and ARIMA algorithms in most experiments. These findings highlight
    the difficulty of modern methods in surpassing straightforward but practical approaches,
    at least with regard to the data sets used in this work. 5. Conclusions Through
    the investigation of SM prediction, we modeled the problem as a univariate and
    multivariate time series prediction problem, conducting a total of 28 experiments
    to answer three design questions: • How does the size of the training window influence
    the performance of multivariate algorithms? • Does the frequency of fitting the
    multivariate algorithm influence the prediction efficiency? • Does the multivariate
    algorithm outperform the univariate algorithms? In the first scenario, we performed
    seven experiments to generate results for discussing the first question. These
    experiments evaluated the performance of four multivariate algorithms (VAR, StemGNN,
    RF, and XGB) for the prediction of SM. We designed the experiments with seven
    modeling strategies that varied the configuration of the training sample size,
    using monthly, bimonthly, quarterly, half-yearly and annual samples. We used the
    results to investigate the effect of sample size on algorithm performance. We
    used scenario two to investigate the importance of recurrent fitting of the models.
    We conducted seven experiments similar to scenario one, with the only difference
    being the validation step, in which we fitted the models every 15 days. We compared
    the results of the experiments in scenario two with those of scenario one to answer
    the second question of the project. In scenario three, we designed ten experiments
    to compare the prediction performance of a multivariate algorithm with that of
    univariate algorithms, generating results to discuss the third question of the
    project. Based on the results of scenarios one and two, we selected the RF algorithm
    as the most efficient among the multivariate solutions evaluated in the study.
    We then compared its performance with the ARIMA, Naive, ES, and NBEATS algorithms.
    We considered ten datasets from different geographical points for the comparative
    study, enabling us to evaluate the algorithms'' performance in predicting SM under
    different exogenous conditions. In conclusion, we could answer all the questions
    posed in the study. Models with higher predictive capacity were obtained using
    data samples with more records, whereas shorter-period training samples resulted
    in unreliable and unstable models. Our experiments demonstrated that the multivariate
    RF and XGB methods outperformed the StemGNN neural network and the VAR method.
    These results are consistent with the findings of the M5 competition [38], which
    indicated that machine learning methods were more effective than traditional statistical
    methods and neural network architectures. Furthermore, our comparison between
    univariate methods and the RF algorithm showed that univariate approaches were
    more efficient in predicting SM. Our results suggested that exogenous variables
    had little predictive value in the SM series data sets. However, it remains to
    be investigated to what extent exogenous variables affected the performance of
    multivariate methods. When compared to Naive, the RF algorithm''s low performance
    could be attributed to exogenous series that only added noise and made it difficult
    to predict the RF algorithm. Our experiments showed that deep learning methods
    did not outperform the traditional methods evaluated. This finding is similar
    to that presented in [52], which showed that neural network architectures must
    be improved to be superior to traditional methods for predicting time series.
    In future work, we suggest exploring additional techniques for creating variables
    based on the original bases to advance the understanding of multivariate time
    series modeling. In the current study, we only added a series of variables delayed
    by one, two, and three days. Adding more variables could increase the predictive
    capacity of multivariate methods. Furthermore, the low performance of the RF algorithm
    compared to the univariate methods suggests that exogenous variables may have
    a low predictive value. For future work, it would be interesting to investigate
    the importance of each variable for multivariate methods and determine whether
    exogenous variables positively affect or not the methods'' performance. Regarding
    the modeling strategy, we did not explore optimization of the parameters of machine
    learning and deep learning algorithms with frequent periodicity. Additionally,
    we recommend incorporating the data component as an attribute in the training
    strategy. For example, the model could be trained using monthly windows, with
    data from January used to predict the series for January of the following year.
    Similarly, for a semester window, the algorithm could be trained using data from
    the first semester of a year to predict the first semester of the following year.
    It would also be valuable to investigate the prediction of periods longer than
    one day. Using the SM variable for windows larger than one day is typical in irrigation.
    Therefore, understanding algorithms'' behavior when predicting larger windows
    would be significant. We limited the experiments to evaluate the prediction of
    SM at an exact value. However, in the irrigation problem domain, it is essential
    to maintain the moisture concentration within a range in the soil volume where
    the crop root is located. The health of the crop depends on the respect of the
    upper and lower limits of the moisture concentration range. Therefore, future
    studies could investigate strategies to predict the volume of water necessary
    to maintain an adequate concentration for each crop category. In this study, we
    compared the performance of different algorithms for predicting SM, but we did
    not explore traditional physical models that simulate soil water dynamics over
    time. Comparing the performance of different algorithms with traditional physical
    models to predict SM would be of great value. Moreover, we could design hybrid
    solutions to achieve better performance in SM prediction. Declaration of Competing

    Wireless fidelity 1. Introduction 1.1. Agriculture - Population, Climate Change,
    Sustainability, and Globale market size Agriculture was one of humanity''s first
    endeavors, and it remains a mainstay of our civilization. It has changed greatly
    throughout time in order to fulfill the needs of an expanding global population,
    adjust to shifting climatic circumstances, and solve sustainability-related issues.
    The relationship between agriculture and important variables including population
    dynamics, climate change, sustainability, and the size of the global market has
    had a significant impact on the agricultural landscape. The agricultural sector
    needs to provide enough food to cope with the world''s ever-increasing population.
    Innovative agricultural technologies, such as advanced technologies and crop management
    systems, are needed to increase productivit. Due to the high population growth,
    the globe will need to produce more than 70 % of food by 2050 [1]. Moreover, agriculture
    is also at the forefront of the fight against climate change. Agricultural yields
    and livestock are under serious threat from the effects of global warming, manifested
    in variable weather patterns, high temperatures, and changing levels of precipitation.
    Farmers are increasingly exposed to the risks of climate change, which requires
    rigorous strategies to mitigate the effects of climate change in order to maintain
    agricultural productivity [2], [3]. It has become crucial to strike a balance
    between the need to produce food and the need to safeguard the environment and
    conserve natural resources. Sustainable agricultural methods are becoming increasingly
    popular as they promote ecological stability and resilience. According to Dhanaraju
    et al. (2022) [4] sustainable agriculture is a farming technique that tries to
    satisfy the needs of the present generation without jeopardizing the ability of
    future generations to satisfy their own needs. It focuses on reducing the negative
    environmental consequences of agriculture while ensuring that farmers can maintain
    their livelihoods and provide healthful food. It may boost the economy of nearby
    towns and farms, support regional food systems, promote rural development, and
    provide jobs for rural areas [5]. Overall, sustainable agriculture is a vital
    method of farming that may assist to ensure future generations have access to
    food and a healthy environment [6], [7], [8]. In parallel, the interconnectedness
    of the agricultural industry worldwide makes international trade in goods and
    commodities possible. To make wise choices and improve the allocation of resources
    among farmers and agri-food businesses, we need to understand market size, demand
    trends, and trade dynamics. Additionally, in the upcoming years, the value of
    the worldwide smart agriculture market will significantly rise.The rising need
    for food, the requirement for sustainable farming methods, and the adoption of
    cutting-edge technology in the agriculture field are all factors contributing
    to the market''s expansion [9], [10]. 1.2. Application of IoT, Blockchain, Embedded
    electronics, Robotics, and Automation in smart agriculture The rapid development
    of technology in recent years has paved the way for creative solutions in a variety
    of industries, and agriculture is no exception. Modern farming practices have
    been changed by the integration of the latest technologies, such as the IoT, robotics,
    blockchain, embedded electronics, and automation, giving rise to the idea of smart
    farming. This new paradigm involves the intelligent application of data-driven
    technology to improve the productivity, efficiency, and sustainability of agricultural
    methods. Smart agriculture will require the integration of new technologies like
    the IoT in order to gain a substantial competitive advantage. To meet the demands
    of the growing population, agricultural output must be raised [11], [12]. IoT
    is improving farming methods by providing connectivity and intelligence through
    automated irrigation systems and intelligent livestock monitoring. So that the
    agricultural sector will benefit from important advantages such as improving operational
    efficiency, reducing cost and waste, and improving crop quality thanks to intelligent
    agriculture based on the blockchain and IoT [13], [14], [15]. The agricultural
    supply chain is transparent and traceable thanks to blockchain technology. Immutable
    records boost consumer and stakeholder confidence by confirming the provenance
    of products and facilitating interactions between farmers and buyers. Smart agriculture
    also has a connection to the utilization of digital technologies, including embedded
    electronics, robotics, and automation [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. Embedded electronics
    are crucial for smart agricultural equipment and gadgets. IoT is reinforced by
    robotics, which automates operations such as planting and harvesting to increase
    production and reduce manual labor. Automation driven by real-time data improves
    yields and optimizes the use of resources while reducing errors in farming practices.
    This technology seeks to simplify operations and improve productivity and decision-making.
    An agricultural control system known as “smart farming” offers a thorough approach
    to dealing with the geographical and temporal variability of soils and crops in
    order to enhance product quality, and boost profitability [21], [22]. 1.3. Application
    of sensors in smart agriculture and focus of this work Through the use of real-time
    data in smart agriculture, made possible by sensor technology, agricultural yields
    can be increased, costs can be cut, and there is less environmental harm. By acquiring
    data on a range of environmental factors, including nutrients, soil moisture,
    temperature, and others, farmers may make decisions about irrigation, fertilization,
    and pest control [23], [24]. Thanks to smart agriculture, farmers can continuously
    monitor crop growth and environmental conditions, anticipate potential problems,
    and take quick action in reaction to changes. This approach, which promotes efficient
    and environmentally friendly farming methods, is essential in light of climate
    change and other environmental problems. The application of sensor technology
    in agriculture is anticipated to have a substantial influence on future food production
    [25]. Every element of conventional agricultural operations has been significantly
    improved by the integration of cutting-edge sensors and IoT technology. Currently,
    smart agriculture has the potential to advance agriculture to previously unthinkable
    levels by seamlessly integrating wireless sensors and the IoT [26], [27], [28].
    In order to promote sustainable agriculture, this survey article focuses on cutting-edge
    IoT and sensor applications in smart agriculture. The study also focuses on the
    IoT architecture for smart agriculture as well as the size of the worldwide market
    for smart agriculture in the next years. 1.4. Preceding affined review papers

    monitoring (yield monitoring, quality monitoring, processing monitoring), forecasting,
    and harvesting, 5) climate conditions monitoring, and 6) fire detection. IoT technology
    has the potential to change the farming sector through these applications, fostering
    more effective, and sustainable agricultural methods. 3.1. Irrigation monitoring
    system smart irrigation based on IoT is a cutting-edge technology that automates
    and improves irrigation systems by harnessing the power of the IoT. This system
    reduces waste and conserves water resources while ensuring that gardens, lawns,
    and crops receive the proper quantity of water. Sensors, controls, and cloud-based
    software are used in smart irrigation systems to gather real-time data on plant
    water needs, weather, and soil moisture. Using this knowledge, irrigation plans,
    water flow rates, and other variables are modified to ensure that plants receive
    enough water when required [49], [50], [51], [45], [52], [53], [54]. These systems
    may be used in a variety of contexts, including landscaping for homes and businesses,
    golf courses, and agriculture. Reduced water waste, enhanced plant health, higher
    efficiency, and cheaper costs are all advantages of smart irrigation systems [55],
    [56]. By doing away with manual watering, users of smart irrigation systems may
    save time and money. They are the best option for anybody looking to install a
    more ecologically friendly and economical irrigation system since they allow users
    to preserve water resources while enhancing plant health and production [57],
    [58], [59], [60]. 3.2. Fertilizer administration Administration of fertilizers
    based in the realm of smart agriculture, IoT is a crucial application that makes
    use of IoT technology to maximize the usage of fertilizers. With the help of this
    application, farmers will be able to get up-to-the-minute information on the state
    of their soil and its nutrient content, which they can use to modify how much
    and what kind of fertilizer they apply to their crops [61], [63], [65], [67].
    Employing a variety of sensors, like the NPK sensors, temperature sensors, soil
    moisture sensors, and humidity sensors, farmers can determine when and how much
    fertilizer is required for their crops, resulting in more efficient and effective
    crop growth and development [62], [64]. Increased agricultural yields are one
    of the main benifits of IoT-enabled fertilizer administration [65]. Farmers may
    optimize the usage of fertilizers, which can result in better crop growth and
    development, by employing IoT sensors to monitor soil conditions and nutrient
    levels [63], [66]. For instance, NPK sensors may help farmers determine the right
    amount of nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium needed for their crops [62], [64],
    [67], [69]. These nutrients are crucial for plant growth [62]. Farmers may change
    the type and amount of fertilizer applied by using real-time data on nutrient
    levels, which increases crop yields and improves crop quality [62], [63], [68].
    The decrease in fertilizer waste and associated costs is another advantage of
    IoT-based fertilizer management. IoT-based fertilizer administration can increase
    fertilizer application accuracy and precision in addition to optimizing fertilizer
    consumption and cutting waste [61], [62], [63], [70]. Overall, IoT-based fertilizer
    administration is a critical smart agricultural application that may support more
    productive and efficient farming methods. This technology lets farmers to utilize
    fertilizers more intelligently by giving them real-time data on nutrient levels
    and soil conditions. Higher agricultural yields, improved crop quality, and less
    environmental impact are the outcomes of this. 3.3. Crop diseases detection Controlling
    crop diseases is an essential part of contemporary agriculture. Illnesses may
    drastically lower agricultural production, costing farmers money and jeopardizing
    the world''s food supply [71]. The overuse of pesticides and other chemicals can
    also have negative environmental impacts, such as polluting water supplies and
    upsetting natural ecosystems [72]. Fortunately, improvements in IoT technology
    are opening up fresh possibilities to tackle these problems. In the field, IoT
    and sensors may be used to monitor crop health in real-time and spot early symptoms
    of disease or insect infestation. These sensors may gather information on a variety
    of environmental and biological elements, including temperature, humidity, soil
    moisture, and plant development patterns, that have an impact on crop health [73],
    [74], [75], [76], [77]. The prevention of disease propagation and the reduction
    of pests'' negative effects on crop yields are made possible by the use of sensors
    and IoT in agricultural disease and pest control [76], [78], [79]. Additionally,
    IoT technology supports data-driven decision-making for pest and agricultural
    disease management [73]. By analyzing data received from sensors and other sources,
    farmers may learn about the effectiveness of their pest management strategies
    and make adjustments to their operations. By evaluating the data produced by IoT
    and sensors using ML and other data analytics technologies, farmers may identify
    patterns and trends in crop health and choose efficient pest management strategies
    [73], [80]. In terms of intelligent agriculture, the application of IoT and sensors
    for pest management marks a significant achievement. IoT technology provides more
    precise and sustainable pest management procedures, minimizing the use of toxic
    chemicals and fostering a more effective and environmentally friendly agriculture
    sector by giving farmers real-time data on crop health and insect activity. 3.4.

    monitoring, logistics monitoring, forecasting and harvesting are crucial aspects
    of smart farming that are increasingly using IoT technology to their advantage..
    In the field, IoT and sensors may be used to gather information on a variety of
    elements that influence agricultural yields, including temperature, humidity,
    soil moisture, and plant development patterns [61]. In order to estimate future
    harvests and get real-time insights on agricultural yields, this data may then
    be evaluated using new technologies [81], [82], [83], [84]. Real-time agricultural
    yield monitoring enables farmers to spot failing farms and make necessary adjustments
    to increase yields. IoT sensors may also offer information on the efficacy of
    various farming techniques, enabling farmers to adjust their plans for optimal
    output. The use of IoT in smart agriculture has the potential to transform the
    sector and solve pressing problems. IoT may have a significant positive impact
    in several crucial areas, including quality, processing, and logistical monitoring,
    predicting, and harvesting. Product compliance is ensured through quality control,
    while IoT sensors assist improve elements like soil condition. IoT-powered cameras
    are used for processing monitoring to guarantee constant product quality. Transportation
    efficiency is improved by using IoT devices like trackers for logistic monitoring.
    Another area where IoT technology might be quite helpful in crop forecasting[85].
    Farmers may employ machine learning algorithms to anticipate future harvests by
    examining previous data on crop yields and climatic variables. IoT and sensors
    may be utilized to increase productivity and reduce waste during the harvesting
    process [81], [83], [84]. In general, smart agriculture has advanced significantly
    with the use of IoT technologies for Yield monitoring, quality monitoring, processing
    monitoring, logistics monitoring, forecasting, and harvesting. IoT technology
    provides more efficient and effective agricultural methods, leading to better
    yields, decreased waste, and increased sustainability by giving farmers real-time
    data on crop yields and anticipated harvests. 3.5. Climate conditions monitoring
    Smart farming is greatly impacted by the weather. Due to climate changes, agricultural
    produce''s quality and quantity may be impacted. Alternatively, farmers may place
    sensors like water level, humidity, and temperature sensors in the sector using
    the IoT as a way to gather real-time environmental data [86], [87], [88], [89].
    In contemporary agriculture, it is normal practice to utilize sensors to keep
    an eye on the health of crops and the environment in which they are growing. These
    sensors are essential for capturing real-time data, giving farmers insightful
    information, and assisting them in making decisions regarding their agricultural
    methods [86]. When a potentially hazardous environmental problem is discovered,
    it is either automatically fixed or a notice is provided to the farmer advising
    them to act quickly to avoid agricultural losses [88], [90]. 3.6. Fire detection
    Fire detection is a significant IoT application in smart agriculture. Farmers
    may employ IoT devices to monitor potential fire dangers in their crops and forests
    [91], [92], [97]. These sensors are able to detect changes in flame as well as
    the presence of smoke and other fire-related indicators [93], [94], [95], [96],
    [98], [99], [100], [101]. The IoT system may warn the farmer and/or the neighborhood
    fire department if a fire is found, enabling them to act immediately and stop
    the fire from spreading. IoT fire detection systems can monitor controlled burns,
    which are frequently used in agriculture to manage land and encourage new development,
    in addition to preventing fires from starting in the first place. These fires
    may be carried out safely and successfully by using IoT sensors to monitor the
    smoke and other parameters [93], [94]. In general, adding fire detection to IoT
    systems in smart agriculture may aid farmers in safeguarding their land, crops,
    and animals as well as avoiding harm to neighboring populations and natural resources
    [92]. 4. Sensors for smart agriculture The way we grow our food might be completely
    changed by the introduction of the IoT and sensors in the agricultural sector.
    With the use of these technologies, farmers can gather and evaluate data in real-time
    on a range of environmental elements that impact crops, including temperature,
    wind speed, soil moisture, smoke, flame, etc. Farmers can monitor the health of
    their crops, spot fields that require more attention, and decide when to sow,
    irrigate, fertilize, and harvest their crops by employing smart agriculture sensors.
    As a result, there may be more production and efficiency, less waste, and less
    negative environmental effect. For instance, farmers may plan when to irrigate
    their crops using soil moisture monitors, only applying water when it is required.
    In addition to saving water and money, this can avoid overwatering, which can
    cause soil erosion and nutrient depletion. Similarly to this, farmers may employ
    targeted treatments just where they are required by utilizing sensors to track
    soil quality and nutrient levels. This reduces the need for pesticides and fertilizers
    while supporting sustainable agricultural methods. The majority of sensors widely
    used in smart agriculture are shown in Table. 2 name of sensors in column 1, sensor

    sensor called the plant and food quality monitor was created specifically to track
    the quality of plants, fruits, and food. Real-time data collection is made possible
    by its soft and versatile shape, which makes it easy to install easily on the
    surface of various food items and plants without causing any damage [108]. In
    addition, as the world''s population continues to expand, IoT and smart agricultural
    sensors can assist farmers in meeting the rising food demand. Farmers may boost
    productivity while decreasing expenses and environmental effects by implementing
    these technologies. On the other hand, wave-based technologies are rapidly being
    used in industrial applications and smart sensors, due to their efficiency in
    analyzing and processing complex signals [109], [110], [111]. Together, these
    studies highlight the variety of applications for wavelet-based signal processing,
    from denoising and analysis in industrial environments to applications for smart
    sensors and machine learning. Given their versatility and efficiency in processing
    complex signals, wavelet methods are increasingly used in a variety of fields
    as useful tools for industrial processes and current sensor technology. Overall,
    the application of IoT and smart agriculture sensors in the agricultural business
    has the potential to alter the way we grow our food. These technologies can boost
    production and efficiency, and support sustainable farming methods by letting
    farmers gather and evaluate real-time data on numerous environmental conditions.
    This will be essential for supplying the world''s growing population with food
    in the future. 5. The benefits and challenge of IoT in agricultural 5.1. Benefits
    IoT application in agriculture, as in other sectors, provides previously unavailable
    efficiency, resource savings, cost, automation, and data-driven operations. IoT-enabled
    smart agriculture offers a number of noteworthy benefits, including superior efficiency,
    expansion, reduced resources, cleaner method, agility, and also product quality
    improvement. Numerous research papers have looked into the advantages of implementing
    the IoT in intelligent agriculture [30], [60], [112], [113]. As shown in Fig.
    6, the six benefits of the IoT in agriculture, we will discuss each benefit separately
    following: 1) Superior efficiency: Today''s agriculture is competitive. Farmers
    must produce more despite unfavorable soil conditions, diminishing land availability,
    and rising weather whims. Farmers can track their fields and environmental conditions
    in real-time thanks to IoT-based agriculture. They can generate ideas rapidly,
    foresee issues before they happen, and determine how to avoid them by employing
    information. IoT solutions for agriculture are also introducing automation, including
    irrigation, fertilization, automated harvesting, etc. 2) Expansion: By the next
    several years, there will be 9 billion people on the planet, with 70 % of them
    living in cities. Thanks to systems based on the IoT, especially systems that
    provide food supply chains, these people can be supplied with vegetables and fruits.
    It is now feasible to grow food practically everywhere, even on walls and roofs,
    in shipping containers, and inside everyone''s houses, thanks to intelligent closed-cycle
    farming systems. 3) Reduced resources: A lot of IoT solutions for agriculture
    are built to maximize the use of resources like electricity, water, and land.
    With the help of data gathered from numerous field sensors, IoT-based precision
    farming helps farmers to accurately distribute the proper quantity of resources.
    4) Cleaner method: Smart agriculture that supports the IoT is an effective way
    to reduce the use of fertilizers and pesticides. Intelligent farming helps farmers
    save water, energy, and the environment while drastically reducing the usage of
    pesticides and fertilizers. Compared to conventional agricultural methods, this
    technique enables the production of a cleaner end product to be produced. 5) Agility:
    IoT use in agriculture has the benefit of accelerating a number of processes.
    Farmers can quickly react to significant changes in weather, humidity levels,
    air quality, fires, and the state of specific crops and soil in the field thanks
    to real-time monitoring and forecasting systems. With the use of this technology,
    agricultural personnel may now save crops in the case of extreme weather or fires.
    6) Product quality improvement: The use of sensors and the IoT in agriculture
    improves and raises agricultural output. Crop sensors, drone-based overhead surveillance,
    and farm mapping are tools that farmers may use to better understand the intricate
    relationships between crop quality and the environment. They may duplicate ideal
    circumstances and improve the nutritional value of their crops by using linked
    systems.. Download : Download high-res image (233KB) Download : Download full-size

    few decades, there have been enormous technology improvements that have impacted
    our everyday lives. By placing resources at our fingertips, we are credited with
    improving the convenience of our lives. Smart sensors collect real-time data and
    establish connections with each other or the internet to initiate required actions.
    IoT has successfully captivated a vast audience due to the numerous ongoing innovations.
    However, the adoption of IoT technology brings both advantages and challenges.
    The difficulties of using the IoT in smart agriculture have been covered in several
    research [29], [30], [32], [114], [115], [116], [117]. Despite the IoT''s development
    over the past two decades, significant conceptual, structural, and problems remain.
    Fig. 7 depicts the most important challenges to implementing the IoT in agriculture,
    like 1) superior efficiency, 2) cost and standardization, 3) heterogeneity and
    accessibility, 4) adaptability and energy optimization, 5) compatibility and reliability,
    6) mobility and environmental conditions.Here are the most pressing immediate
    problems of the IoTs: 1) Superior efficiency: Agriculture is nowadays a race.
    Despite poor soil conditions, dwindling availability of land, and increased vagaries
    of weather, farmers must produce more. Farmers can monitor their products and
    environmental conditions in real-time thanks to IoT-based agriculture. They can
    quickly get ideas, anticipate problems before they arise, and decide how to prevent
    them from using knowledge. Automation is also being introduced by IoT solutions
    in agriculture, such as demand-based irrigation, fertilization, and automated
    harvesting. 2) Cost and Standardization: Due to regional economic disparities,
    creating a cost-effective strategy for IoT installations in agriculture is difficult.
    Economic models must be developed to control setup and operational expenses, which
    include the price of IoT devices, recurring subscriptions, data processing, maintenance,
    and energy. For devices, applications, systems, and products to function properly
    together, standardization is essential. Interoperability is challenging to achieve,
    though, because diverse IoT devices lack standardized formats and protocols. To
    enable the success of IoT implementations, interoperability is therefore required
    at the organizational, technological, semantic, and conceptual levels. 3) Heterogeneity
    and Accessibility: System design makes use of heterogeneous devices. Each gadget
    has a different set of operational and maintenance needs. Since the majority of
    models in agriculture use heterogeneous equipment, it is essential to create a
    connection between communication technologies and heterogeneous modules. The network
    becomes increasingly complex due to heterogeneity, which might occasionally result
    in the appearance of falsified results. Any IoT-based or other device-based farming
    decision support system must be built with the assumption that current software
    and hardware are always available everywhere. These problems must be fixed in
    order to ensure that services are available whenever and wherever they are needed.
    A lack of the required tools may result in chaos and service delays. 4) Adaptability
    and Energy Optimization: For smart farming, it is important that the devices are
    able to adapt to other devices in addition to the environment. Some hardware is
    incompatible with one another owing to the environment''s continually changing,
    as well as occasionally because of particular hardware or connection concerns.
    The most recent problem with communication devices, and other IoT is energy. Up
    until now, the designing and operating models have been supported by traditional
    sources of energy. However, with more gadgets on the market, using traditional
    energy is no longer a viable option. Aside from testing unconventional energy
    sources like solar, wind, and water energy harvesting plans, which haven''t had
    much success, new approaches also need to be developed. 5) Compatibility and reliability:
    The produced models or software should be adaptable and scalable in order to comply
    with the criteria of fragmentation and scalability. Reliability is a vital issue
    for IoT devices to effectively and seamlessly transmit data. The devices must
    collect and communicate accurate data since judgments are made utilizing the information
    that has been received and analyzed. Due to system failures, node failures, battery
    problems, and other interventions, reliability is still a difficulty. 6) Mobility
    and Environmental Conditions: The generated systems or models are often static.
    Because most devices and applications are portable, mobility is essential for
    the framework''s efficient implementation. The challenge of sustaining connectivity
    still exists in mobile models. Agricultural landscapes come in a variety. As a
    result, it becomes challenging to respond to those changes, which puts data and
    services at risk. This modifies a system''s accuracy. Download : Download high-res

    in agriculture. 6. Conclusion and perspective In conclusion, the Internet of Things
    (IoT) and sensor technology, then, provide significant potential for enhancing
    food security and sustainable agricultural methods. In addition to presenting
    four layers of the IoT architecture for smart agriculture, including the perception
    or sensing and actuator layer, the network layer, the cloud layer, and the application
    layer, this study also offers insights into the size of the global market for
    smart agriculture in the years 2021 to 2030. This review paper addressed the current
    state of IoT and sensor technologies for agriculture, as well as some of their
    potential applications, such as 1) irrigation monitoring systems, 2) fertilizer
    administration, 3) crop disease detection, 4) monitoring (yield monitoring, quality
    monitoring, processing monitoring, logistic monotoring), forecasting, and harvesting,
    5) climate conditions monitoring, and 6) fire detection. A variety of sensors
    for agriculture are also included in this study, including those that can detect
    soil NPK, moisture, nitrate, pH, electrical conductivity, CO2, temperature, humidity,
    light, weather station, water level, livestock, plant disease, smoke, flame, and
    flexible wearable. The advantages of IoT in smart agriculture are also highlighted,
    particularly in terms of of superior efficiency, expansion, reduced resources,
    cleaner method, agility, and product quality improvement. However, there are still
    problems that must be fixed before IoT technology can be employed in agriculture,
    which is what this study has discussed. further offer hints on potential future
    study avenues. Future readers and scholars will benefit from this study''s insights
    into the current status of academic accomplishment in this field. Agriculture
    has the potential to be revolutionized by the development and application of IoT
    and sensor technologies, enabling more sustainable and effective food production.
    The need for food will rise as the world''s population expands, and the agriculture
    industry must come up with novel solutions to fulfill this demand while preserving
    sustainability. IoT and sensors, which provide real-time monitoring and management
    of crops, soil, and environment, present a possible answer to these problems.
    However for them to be widely used and implemented, a lot of money must be spent
    on infrastructure, training, and research. To encourage the use of IoT and sensor
    technologies in agriculture and to address the difficulties facing the industry,
    governments, private sector players, and other stakeholders should work together
    to establish policies and strategies. The development of sustainable and effective
    agricultural techniques that can fulfill the requirements of a rising population
    while protecting the environment for future generations, as well as the successful
    integration of IoT and sensor technologies, are key to the future of smart agriculture.

  description: Nowadays, Green IoT-Based Agriculture plays an essential role in farming
    to improve the yield. Here, IoT devices are embedded in the farming equipment,
    which helps to enhance the irrigation and yield with minimum cost-cutting. Data
    security and privacy are major challenges in green IoT-related agriculture. Therefore,
    a secured system should create to maintain data confidentiality, authentication,
    integrity, availability, and privacy. This system uses the privacy-preserving
    data aggregation (PPDA) with a Fair access framework (FAF) that manages the data
    security. The data aggregation concept is used to protect the green IoT data from
    false data injection. The FAF utilizes the blockchain technique to grant, get,
    revoke and delegate access to the user. The developed security system can adapt
    the green IoT-based agriculture and provide confidentiality, which is done with
    the help of an enhanced ciphertext access control mechanism. This system resolves
    the security and privacy issues involved in the Green IoT-based agriculture, and
    the effectiveness of the system is evaluated using implementation results.

    Nowadays, Green IoT-Based Agriculture plays an essential role in farming to improve
    the yield. Here, IoT devices are embedded in the farming equipment, which helps
    to enhance the irrigation and yield with minimum cost-cutting. Data security and
    privacy are major challenges in green IoT-related agriculture. Therefore, a secured
    system should create to maintain data confidentiality, authentication, integrity,
    availability, and privacy. This system uses the privacy-preserving data aggregation
    (PPDA) with a Fair access framework (FAF) that manages the data security. The
    data aggregation concept is used to protect the green IoT data from false data
    injection. The FAF utilizes the blockchain technique to grant, get, revoke and
    delegate access to the user. The developed security system can adapt the green
    IoT-based agriculture and provide confidentiality, which is done with the help
    of an enhanced ciphertext access control mechanism. This system resolves the security
    and privacy issues involved in the Green IoT-based agriculture, and the effectiveness
    of the system is evaluated using implementation results. Keywords: Green IoT-based

    rights and content Abstract Technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI),
    blockchain, and the Internet of Things (IoT) have converged in driving the next
    wave of digital revolution. Amalgamating the aforementioned advancements with
    critical infrastructure (CI) can significantly help society by offering a quality
    of life and boosting the nation’s economy and productivity. However, the lack
    of cybersecurity in CI gave rise to advanced threats and vulnerabilities that
    hindered the aforementioned societal benefits. In this vein, the paper provides
    an in-depth analysis of cyber threats and risks associated with different critical
    infrastructures, such as the financial, agriculture, energy, and healthcare sectors.
    Further, we thoroughly investigate the staggering benefits of AI and, based on
    it, present an exhaustive solution taxonomy to showcase the competency of AI mechanisms
    in confronting cyberattacks on CI. The taxonomy specifically addresses issues
    like data privacy, algorithmic bias, and human-AI collaboration for CI. Further,
    we proposed an AI-based secure data exchange framework for smart grid CI, where
    we attempt to secure the sensor’s data (i.e., power consumption, energy readings,
    and network data) from malicious adversaries. The proposed framework is evaluated
    using statistical measures, such as accuracy, training time, and receiver operating

    intelligence 1. Introduction Critical infrastructures are essential pillars for
    any nation’s economic growth and development. The advent of IoT has transformed
    traditional CI into more interconnected and intelligent systems, revolutionizing
    the way they operate and interact with each other. It allows seamless communication
    and data exchange between various components of CI, such as power grids, transportation
    networks, and healthcare systems. However, IoT networks still rely on legacy protocols
    that jeopardize the operational performance of any CI. In addition, this opportunity
    can be lured by adversaries to commit cyber attacks, such as man-in-the-middle,
    distributed denial-of-service, and malware attacks. For example, nuclear power
    plants are highly critical infrastructures where a minuscule change in temperature
    and pressure leads to an uncontrollable nuclear accident that damages the entire
    biodiversity. Similarly, in a water treatment plant, if the attackers manipulate
    the sensor reading for chlorination (e.g., excessive use of chlorine), then highly
    chlorinated water is supplied to the cities instead of supplying palatable water.
    Consequently, the toxins present in chlorinated water adversely affect human health,
    such as nausea, vomiting, and stomach infection. Fig. 1 shows the recent statistics
    regarding the cyber attacks on various critical infrastructures. Therefore, there
    is a stringent need to tackle security attacks in CI [1]. Many researchers have
    given cryptographic-based solutions, such as authentication and authorization.
    This ensures that only authorized people have access to necessary facilities and
    that any unauthorized access attempts can be restricted. It involves verifying
    a person by password or biometrics. Bellare et al. [2] proposed a cryptographic
    function to authenticate messages used in security protocols using various message
    authentication codes (MACs) for ad-hoc networks. Also, Adil et al. [3] proposed
    an authentication model to facilitate security in healthcare systems. Further,
    the agriculture sector is also evolving by adopting AI systems integrating with
    IoT to handle cyber threats. In that viewpoint, Alyahya et al. [4] proposed a
    secured framework for smart agriculture (CSFSA), which reduces delay, saves power,
    and also prevents agriculture infrastructure from cyber attacks. Nevertheless,
    the cryptographic solutions are formally based on key size with some randomness
    to obfuscate the message. An attacker can utilize modern computing processors
    to break the cryptographic ciphers to get the original message. In the aforementioned
    work, the authors have used cryptographic solutions to secure the CI. However,
    they have not incorporated automation and AI in their proposed scheme. Therefore,
    AI facilitates automation with intelligence. AI approach has more adaptability
    than traditional approaches. It is capable of solving complex approaches with
    minimal computational power. It has been leveraged in various security approaches,
    like facial recognition, biometrics, prediction, classification, and interpretative
    learning. Annadurai et al. [5] proposed a model to safely transfer data and detect
    intruders in the channel by using a biometric authentication process by processing
    the data, extracting features, and securing the channel. The performance is mapped
    with accuracy, precision, and F1 score. AI can also recognize patterns in human
    behavior and make assumptions about whether the attempt is valid or not. These
    techniques adapt changes to a person’s behavior and act accordingly. Further,
    Garabato et al. [6] has proposed monitorization-based verification of user identification
    using AI. Overall, authentication approaches based on AI have the potential to
    be more adaptive and secure than current authentication procedures. Particularly,
    ML is an essential branch of AI that uses various regression and classification
    algorithms, such as decision trees, SVM, random forest (RF), and naive Bayes algorithm,
    that can work effectively with lower-dimensional data. Lee et al. [10] has proposed
    a keyboard data protection approach to minimize cyber attacks based on password
    stealing, analyzing keyboard patterns using a dataset of dummy keyboards and real-time
    keyboard data utilized in CI. Also, Hazratifard et al. [11] has discussed services
    that can be availed remotely using smart devices. However, the remote connection
    can be maneuvered by the attackers. They proposed biometric authentication to
    have robust authentication using ML algorithms and also analyze human behavior.

    Fig. 1. Recent statistics of cyber crimes in various critical infrastructures
    [7], [8], [9]. Roopashree et al. [12] discussed AI models to distinguish between
    malicious and non-malicious medicinal plants using SVM, K-means clustering, and
    artificial neural networks. They also used ML models to measure risk authentication
    based on where the login has been attempted and the device used and can estimate
    risk for fraud attempts to the system. Misbahuddin et al. in [13] has proposed
    a risk-based authentication approach based on previous login data and analyzed
    the pattern of users and derived risk factors associated with it, which helps
    to secure from fraud activities. Though ML has various advantages, it also has
    shortcomings that significantly degrade the performance of AI training. Moreover,
    for large datasets, ML has to perform feature selection and extraction, which
    increases the overhead cost for the proposed solutions given by different researchers.
    Therefore, researchers also utilize deep learning approaches to authenticate critical
    data and secure infrastructure. Abuhamad et al. [14] presented a method where
    a sensor will be associated with the user’s smartphone and also can analyze behavioral
    aspects by embedded sensors and has given high accuracy and performance. It is
    performed on a real-world data set. Another application of DL is that it also
    recognizes gestures and facial recognition. We can also train the data and map
    it to the trained dataset. Dayal et al. [15] proposed a DL-based neural network
    approach for verifying users with hand gestures. The model is trained to identify
    gestures. Khan et al. [16] has proposed an intelligent classroom-based approach
    for student attendance using CNNs. Results show that their proposed model outperforms
    in terms of latency. DL can also be helpful in anomaly detection; as soon as it
    analyzes unusual activities, it automatically runs authentication tests and alerts.
    Luo et al. [17] talks about DLAD techniques are used in CPS. Each CPS domain’s
    new traits and designs are identified using the taxonomy, and the approach shortcomings
    and unresolved issues are discussed along with future directions to improve DLAD.
    Authentication based on DL is based on neural networks and requires more data
    to train the dataset with more computation capacity to train and test. Also, data
    can be prone to overfitting. The aforesaid AI-based solutions have the potential
    to play a significant role in reducing the impact of security threats in CI. The
    scientific community has presented various surveys and review articles to showcase
    the competency of AI approaches in tackling security issues. However, those surveys
    are not aligned with the CI applications. Hence, it is imperative need to study
    and examine the scope of AI techniques in handling security and privacy issues
    of CI. With this aim, we proposed an exhaustive survey that seeks to assess the
    current state of AI adoption in CI cybersecurity and identify the challenges and
    opportunities for using AI in this field. The proposed survey first enlists important
    CI that plays a prominent role in boosting the nation’s economy. We include those
    infrastructures that are mission-critical, i.e., damaging (attacking) their infrastructure
    causes a massive disruption in the nation’s economy, risks human lives, and damages
    entire biodiversity. Then, a solution taxonomy has been presented where existing
    AI-related security solutions have been incorporated for various critical infrastructures.
    Additionally, an AI-based case study is proposed to mitigate the security issues
    from smart grid infrastructure. The proposed case study is evaluated using different
    performance parameters, such as accuracy, training time, and ROC curve. 1.1. Scope
    of the survey The advancement of technology has driven the entire world onto digital
    platforms, and the digital world is prone to cybercrimes, data leaks, and other
    significant consequences. Any attack on CI can cause huge losses. Incorporating
    AI can assure authenticity, prevent unauthorized access, and secure CI for accurate
    predictions by data preprocessing, data splitting, data validation, and further
    use by CI for analysis. Morel et al. [18] discussed how AI can be incorporated
    with cybersecurity, especially using web applications and AI-based systems that
    help reduce false negatives and false positives for prediction. Magalras et al.
    [19] has talked about industrial control systems (ICS) which can secure systems
    considering real-time monitoring. Ten et al. [20] presents an extensive cybersecurity
    survey on CI. Additionally, they create an effect analysis approach based on attack
    trees with an emphasis on power system control networks. Pinto et al. [21] reviewed
    the state-of-the-art of IDS using ML, including supervised and unsupervised learning,
    to protect CI. Kaur et al. [22] talks about the power of AI, which can help to
    prevent cyber attacks and enhance cybersecurity. Also, they presented future research
    directions, such as data security and the development of new security infrastructures.
    Moreover, Mothukuri et al. [23] in the paper has discussed federated learning
    (FL) privacy and security aspects and suggested that overall there are fewer privacy-specific
    threats associated with FL compared to security threats. Pandya et al. [24] presents
    a comprehensive overview of the current and future developments of FL for smart
    cities, which highlight the societal, industrial, and technological trends driving
    FL for smart cities and discusses various applications and research challenges.
    However, [20], [25] does not provide a solution taxonomy, and there has yet to
    be an in-depth survey on how we can secure CI using AI-based security. In this
    study, we have combined different critical sectors on which work has been done
    and accumulated herewith presented in Table 1. Table 1. A comparative analysis

    Smart CI in smart city. 1.2. Research contributions Numerous study proposals exist
    on cybersecurity and AI, but only some talk about AI-based cybersecurity for CI.
    The existing survey and review articles mainly focus on security concerns; their
    proposed survey does not include a comprehensive taxonomy that highlights the
    intuitive nature of AI approaches in confronting security concerns. Moreover,
    their proposed survey lacks in providing a proof-of-concept of why AI is a prominent
    technology in cyberspace. Based on such observations, we proposed an exhaustive
    survey that has the following major contributions. • We proposed an exhaustive
    and thorough survey of AI-based cybersecurity for CI. • The survey enlists indispensable
    critical applications, such as the financial sector (banking, insurance, and stock
    market), the energy sector (nuclear power plants and sustainable energy), agriculture,
    and healthcare and their security issues. • We proposed an exhaustive and comprehensive
    taxonomy based on AI techniques that provides security solutions to the aforesaid
    critical applications. • Further, to show the adeptness of AI algorithms in handling
    security issues, we proposed an AI-based secure data dissemination framework for
    smart grid applications. The proposed framework is evaluated with performance
    metrics such as anomaly detection, training accuracy, time, and ROC curve. • Lastly,
    we investigate different open issues and research challenges that still hinder
    the performance of CI and require proactive countermeasures. 1.3. Organization
    The study of the article is as follows. Section 2 presents the importance of security
    in CI. Section 4 introduces an AI-based solution taxonomy for different critical
    infrastructures. Further, Section 5 proposed an AI-based secure data dissemination
    framework as a case study to highlight the importance of AI in CI. Section 6 discusses
    various open issues and research challenges. Finally, Section 7 concludes the
    paper. 2. Background This section is divided into four subsections, i.e., the
    financial sector, the energy sector, the agriculture sector, and the healthcare
    sector, each representing a CI. These sectors are selected based on their involvement
    in fostering the nation’s economy and how prevalent they are in human lives. For
    instance, the financial and energy sector is highly vital for our way of life.
    However, these sectors use legacy communication protocols and weak security measures,
    which attackers leverage to exploit and maneuver the operational performance of
    CI. Fig. 2 shows an illustrative representation of all the CI required by a smart
    city. Each CI and its security issues are discussed as follows. 2.1. Financial
    sector The financial service sectors are essential to our country’s high operational
    and maintenance infrastructure. The numerous potential dangers facing the sector
    are illustrated by widespread power outages, recent natural disasters, and increased
    quantity and risk of cyberattacks. The primary foundation of a country’s economy
    is the financial services industry. It allows for the free flow of capital and
    market liquidity. The economy improves, and businesses in this area are better
    able to manage risk when the sector is robust. If financial sector service deteriorates,
    it gets the country’s economy down, which can lead to recession. Banking, insurance,
    stock market, and investment are all part of the financial services industry.
    2.1.1. Banking Banking is a crucial sector for a nation’s economy, which manages
    financial transactions, the provision of credit and loans, and the protection
    of deposits that fall under the supervision of banks. These activities are necessary
    for people and businesses to conduct everyday operations and for a country’s overall
    economic progress [26]. For instance, in January 2023, in Chennai, two Nigerian
    nationals attacked TNSC- a cooperative bank of Chennai bank, by sending phishing
    mail to employees of the bank and getting them to install a keylogger software
    by which they gained access to the keyboard usage of the bank and monitored the
    texts and bag principal amount of money [27], [28]. The money got credited to
    32 different accounts. With the adaptiveness of technology, cybersecurity in this
    sector also attracts cyber threats. Banking operations problems can harm these
    industries, causing severe economic problems. Given their importance to the economy
    and the possible hazards they may encounter, banks must be safeguarded as a crucial
    component of the infrastructure. Ensure that their activities continue during
    delays or emergencies; this involves setting strong security measures and backup
    plans in place. All of the attacks breach the security of users and bank Information.
    This information can lead to severe major attacks with high potential risks. 2.1.2.
    Insurance Insuring people, businesses, and governments against financial dangers
    is crucial. Yet, as technology is used more frequently, the industry faces severe
    security issues that could affect the privacy, accuracy, and accessibility of
    critical data. In 2021, Central Nodal Agency (CNA) Financial, one of the largest
    commercial insurance companies in the US, suffered from a ransomware attack. Where
    criminals attacked Phoenix CryptoLocker ransomware towards sensitive data of the
    company and demanded money against the decryption key for regaining access. More
    security is to be focused on data breaches, which can lead to the risk of theft
    of intellectual property of the person as well as other important data. A case
    In September 2020, one of the largest insurance companies, Allianz, suffered from
    a data breach for breaching names, numbers, and sensitive information of customers.
    They were using a credential-stuffing attack to gain access to the subsidiary’s
    systems. Allianz also stated they will now be focusing on cyber security to stay
    safe for the future. The insurance sector is considered CI as it provides financial
    stability and protects against unpredictable events by providing financial stability
    against unexpected events. This sector gives overall economic stability to insurance
    holders, which makes it a crucial part. Also, insurance is a very important tool
    for managing risk these days. If people and organizations do not choose appropriate
    insurance, then they can suffer financial losses. In addition to this, the sector
    is also supervised and looked at by the government to ensure proper and smooth
    working. Insurance is an essential infrastructure because it reduces financial
    risks, makes investment easier, promotes economic growth, and has systemic significance.
    As a result, it is crucial to safeguard the insurance infrastructure and assure
    its security and resilience. The current scenario depicts various risks in the
    sector with the emergence of technology. Also, how can we ensure the security
    of the CI. Research shows that backdoor attacks, ransomware attacks, and phishing
    attacks are the attacks by which the insurance industry is affected majorly. 2.1.3.
    Stock market Influencing the expansion of gross domestic product to the nation’s
    economy, the stock market plays a top recognized area to invest money. Good performance
    of the stock market can attract more investor local as well as direct abroad investors
    [29]. Also, it provides information on how efficiently the economy is performing.
    There is a relationship between a nation’s economies and stock markets. With increasing
    dependency on digital platforms, the risk of cyber threats increases. Threats
    result in substantial monetary losses, interfere with trading, and disturb investors’
    confidence. As per brokers, due to a lack of awareness, frauds are successfully
    accomplished [30]. 2.2. Energy sector The efficient functioning of society and
    the economy depends on the essential services the energy sector provides, which
    is regarded as a crucial infrastructure. The energy industry substantially impacts
    the economy, plays a vital role in maintaining national security, and is connected
    to other CI, making it susceptible to unforeseen consequences. To ensure the continuity
    of the energy supply in the event of disruptions or catastrophes, it is crucial
    to protect it as a vital infrastructure by putting strong security measures and
    emergency plans in place [31]. 2.2.1. Nuclear sector Nuclear energy is an essential
    part of the Nation’s security. Attacks are possible on nuclear power plants to
    gain information by disrupting the network. Criminals can expand nuclear power
    and create threats. US’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)
    and the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) jointly issued an advisory
    in 2020 alerting the public to a cyber campaign by the Russian collective APT29
    that targeted the healthcare and energy sectors, including nuclear power plants.
    Malware was employed in the attack to access industrial control systems and collect
    confidential data [32]. Consequences of these risks include political harm, a
    loss of public confidence, harm to the environment, the economy, and casualties.
    VirusTotal, a virus scanning website owned by Google’s parent company, Alphabet,
    has indicated that a large amount of data from the administrative network has
    been stolen [33]. To mitigate these adverse effects, nuclear facilities must upgrade
    their digital infrastructure. Most Importantly, the nuclear sector provides national
    security, and the ability of a nation to prevent enemies and defend against nuclear
    threats is supported by the nuclear industry, which contributes towards maintaining
    national security. Nuclear power plants also use significant security procedures
    to guard against potential terrorist attacks and other security risks. More safety
    and strict monitoring are performed to maintain any unknown event. Because even
    a mistake can lead to significant loss and reduce the impact of accidents. This
    sector has grown in various fields like nuclear medicine and technology. Nuclear
    technology is used in multiple industries, including agriculture, manufacturing,
    and space exploration. This sector still has a lot of fields to research and investigation.
    2.2.2. Sustainable energy Sustainable energy infrastructure involves wind farms,
    solar power plants, hydroelectric, and thermal power plants. We must protect and
    prevent sustainable infrastructure to get a secure energy supply to overcome energy
    supply disruption, monetary losses, and environmental harm. In December 2020,
    multiple US government organizations and private businesses had been compromised
    by an effective cyberattack known as the SolarWinds hack. The Orion IT monitoring
    and management software from SolarWinds, used by thousands of companies and government
    organizations worldwide, was compromised by hackers [34]. Sustainable energy promotes
    self-sufficiency, relying on ourselves, which helps to get a stable energy supply
    and promotes the nation’s development. Also, one of the most significant challenges
    to our planet is climate change, which can be lessened by reducing greenhouse
    gas emissions and other forms of sustainable energy. Sustainable energy provides
    monetary benefits by supplying power to rural and urban areas for growth and development.
    Saving resources and correctly using them also helps people who live in rural
    or remote areas access energy, which improves standards and living style [35].
    Table 2. Research questions and their objectives. RQs Research question Objectives
    RQ1 What are the most common critical infrastructures that can be severely affected
    by security attacks Examining this question, the authors aim to identify the critical
    infrastructure sectors most susceptible to severe impacts from security attacks.
    This investigation will shed light on vulnerabilities and potential consequences,
    informing the development of targeted security measures and risk mitigation strategies.
    RQ2 What are the primary types of cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructure,
    and how have these attacks impacted different sectors? Investigating this question
    helped the authors to assess the different types of cyberattacks on critical infrastructure
    and to evaluate the sector-specific implications, aiding in the development of
    targeted countermeasures. RQ3 How do various critical infrastructure sectors currently
    address security concerns, and what best practices can be identified from these
    approaches? To investigate the existing security practices within different critical
    infrastructure sectors and extract best practices that can be shared across sectors
    to enhance overall security. RQ4 How AI can help in safeguarding critical infrastructure?
    This RQ aims to investigate the practical applications and effectiveness of AI
    technologies in enhancing the security and resilience of critical infrastructure.
    2.3. Agriculture sector This sector contributes roughly one-fifth of the nation’s
    economic activity and provides us with raw materials, which then are produced
    and globally supplied. Agriculture contributes to the global economy by supporting
    people and improving living standards. This sector [36]. 2.3.1. Crop production
    and crop disease Crop production and its disease are the most concerning factors
    in the agriculture sector. It creates an opportunity for a more significant number
    of people. Growth in agricultural products helps to lessen poverty up to two to
    four times. As we know, the population is increasing daily, which implies food
    consumption will also increase correspondingly. Hence, there is a requirement
    for maximum crop production by farming techniques, selecting quality grains, and
    supplying proper irrigation systems. It will be beneficial if we can detect disease
    in crops early [37]. If we do not know about the condition and wait for the crop
    to grow fully, in the end, the harvest will be of no use. The time, as well as
    the hard work of a farmer, will be wasted. Various technologies have been introduced
    to indicate crop disease at an early stage [38]. The security of food is an essential
    factor. If the yield is affected by any disease, it can lead to crop wastage and
    price increases, leading to economic drift in the nation and cost to public health.
    In addition, this sector also depends on the weather; if weather conditions are
    unfavorable, such as droughts, floods can cause acute disease. Protecting them
    as CI is crucial because crop productivity and disease management are so important
    to food security, the agricultural industry, and public health. To maintain crop
    production and disease control in the face of interruptions or emergencies, this
    calls for the execution of solid disease management strategies, emergency response
    plans, and emergency preparations. 2.4. Healthcare sector The healthcare sector
    plays a crucial role in maintaining and safeguarding all sectors from threats,
    epidemics, and calamities. Healthcare not only improves the lives of people, but
    it contributes to the country’s economy as well. Advancements and integrating
    technology into the healthcare sector have helped the industry grow and explore
    various aspects as well [39]. Healthcare is highly dependent on sectors such as
    transportation services, food and agriculture, Energy, Water, and Wastewater systems
    for service and delivery purposes. 2.4.1. Smart healthcare With the emergence
    of technology, AI in the healthcare sector has also gained attention. Using the
    latest algorithms and approaches, we see the transformation from the old methodology.
    It is more efficient, more convenient, and more personalized [40]. However, digitalization
    brings cyber threats and risks; in 2022, the medical data of a local health agency
    of Washington residents was exposed to phishing attacks [41]. There is a requirement
    to consider patient care as the foremost concern. Remote monitoring and auto health
    checkup gives personalized healthcare to patients, which means the procedure treatment
    is dependent on the data provided by the machine for a particular patient. It
    also provides efficiency for the service providers as the machine can do checkups
    and gives message if there is anything serious. Using innovative healthcare services
    can raise the standard and accessibility of medical care, which is crucial for
    the public. We can accurately and speedily diagnose ill patients. Innovative healthcare
    systems are susceptible to cyber threats such as malware, hacking, and ransomware
    assaults. Interrupting the system causes personal data loss and may interrupt
    the machine. In a recent case of such a scenario from February 2022, AR care,
    a US healthcare provider incident, happened where temporary activity disruptions
    were noticed. All the medicines were discounted on the site, including clinics,
    schools, and hospitals. Also, the intruders captured this for about five weeks.
    Potential data such as name, driver’s license, and identity number, medical treatment
    information were at risk. AR care then worked on the potential cyber attack areas
    and works on it periodically [42]. Automation allows more storage of sensitive
    personal health data. To securely and safely store the data, it is to be kept
    secure to avoid unauthorized access, theft, and data breach [43]. 2.5. Transportation
    sector The transportation industry is the foundation of contemporary economies
    and civilizations. A lot of reasons contribute to its designation as an important
    infrastructure. Economically speaking, it supports trade, supply chains, and economic
    expansion by acting as the framework for the flow of people and products. It also
    has a significant impact on national security by the effective use of armed forces
    and equipment. Transportation infrastructure improves the quality of life overall
    by linking communities, companies, and services and providing accessibility, mobility,
    and convenience in day-to-day living. It is an essential lifeline in times of
    crisis because it acts as a conduit for the prompt response of disaster management
    teams and the transportation of necessary resources [44]. It makes it possible
    for commodities to go through ports, airports, and international transportation
    networks; it serves as an essential component of global trade. Simultaneously,
    it creates significant employment, both directly within the industry and indirectly
    through associated sectors like manufacturing and logistics. But, since the transportation
    industry uses a lot of energy, it also needs to deal with sustainability and energy
    security by cutting back on energy use and switching to greener practices. Ultimately,
    the sector’s negative environmental effects, such as greenhouse gas emissions
    and air pollution, highlight the critical need for robust, sustainable transport
    infrastructure as a component of larger initiatives to mitigate climate change
    [45]. Swissport flight operations and IT systems were brought down by a ransomware
    attack, which affected flight operations at Swissport. The aviation corporation
    handles 282 million people and 4.8 million tonnes of cargo annually, providing
    cargo handling, security, maintenance, cleaning, and lounge hospitality for 310
    airports in 50 countries, which has a huge impact on the company [46]. The U.S.
    Transportation Department (USDOT) had a data breach that exposed the personal
    information of 237,000 active and retired federal government employees [47]. The
    transportation industry gains from AI in several ways, including better traffic
    control, the ability to use autonomous cars, improved supply chain and logistics,
    more security, less environmental impact, and data-driven insights for decision-making.
    AI also improves maintenance, helps with disaster relief, helps with air traffic
    management, and improves customer service, all of which contribute to more sustainable,
    safe, and effective transportation. 2.6. Dams sector Dams are categorized as essential
    infrastructure because of their significance to society. They supply regulated
    water, produce hydropower, manage flooding, irrigate crops, and support a variety
    of industries. In addition, dams support tourism, leisure, and environmental preservation.
    The critical importance of dams is highlighted by the potential consequences of
    failures or disruptions, which include risks to public health, economic losses,
    and environmental damage. Therefore, strict safety guidelines, upkeep procedures,
    and emergency planning are necessary to guarantee dams’ dependability, safety,
    and ongoing social benefits [48]. One of the most well-known incidents happened
    in 2020 when the Maroochy Water Services in Queensland, Australia, was the target
    of a ransomware attack. The attack seriously disrupted the water supply, and the
    process of restoring the systems took several days [49]. It is vital to remember
    that, despite a few well-publicized incidents, the dam industry is generally regarded
    as one of the most secure CI industries. As a result, rigorous safety standards,
    maintenance practices, and emergency preparedness measures are essential to ensure
    the reliability and safety of dams and their continued contributions to society.
    2.7. Education sector The education sector is classified as CI due to its critical
    role in shaping the future of societies and nations. By promoting knowledge, skills,
    and civic engagement among people, it acts as the cornerstone for the development
    of human capital. Education is important for national security, social cohesion,
    cultural preservation, public health awareness, and national security, even outside
    of its economic significance in innovation and prosperity. Academic institutions
    function as hubs for investigation and creativity, scientific progress, and providing
    assistance in times of need [50]. In 2020, personal data for roughly 820,000 current
    and former New York City public school students was compromised in the hack of
    a widely used online grading and attendance system. The hackers also extracted
    information about whether students get special education services, class and teacher
    schedules, and whether kids receive free lunch, according to the Education Department.
    In 2021, the ransomware group Evil attacked the school district in New York City
    and demanded a ransom of $ 76 million. The district refused to pay the ransom
    and was able to restore systems from backups, but the attack still caused significant
    disruption to operations. Therefore, supporting and funding the education sector
    is essential to fostering a society’s general resilience and well-being as well
    as that of its future generations. 3. Survey methodology This section delves into
    an exhaustive examination of survey methodology, employing various logical approaches
    that encompass review planning, formulation of research questions, selection of
    data sources, establishment of search criteria, determination of inclusion and

    sector, which comprises data security, data integrity and risk management, and
    risk analysis. Here, AI recognizes and synchronizes the pattern as well in data
    by which one can make accurate predictions based on data given input. One can
    minimize it by analyzing how we can reduce the risk for the area. Fig. 6 represents
    the classification of the financial sector. For example, banking, stock market,
    and insurance sectors. Here, we discussed the work carried out by various in the
    field of the financial sector. Here, Table 3 represents the comparative analysis
    of different security mechanisms for financial sectors. Table 3. Comparison of

    • Broby et al. [53] discussed the challenges of cyber security using AI in the
    financial sector. Talks about how ransomware attacks affect financial corporations.
    Using the application of AI, we detect possible attacks earlier, protect our essential
    and crucial information, and ensure privacy. Using methods such as fault tree
    and event tree, risk analysis can identify the cause of cyber events in the past.
    As a result, it is proven that AI can be fruitful for further detecting and keeping
    track of the system and changes occurring day by day, which minimizes risk and
    inconsistency, but authors are still working to make the model cost-effective.
    • Making decisions and planning can be significantly aided by setting goals for
    bank branches and assigning annual targets to each bank. Due to the heterogeneity
    of customers in each branch, Met et al. [54] in the study proposed ML methods
    for predicting the performance coupled with hyperparameter tuning. Their applied
    methodology demonstrates more than 97 percent accuracy, which can also assist
    in smoother target achievement by addressing the seasonality and periodicity issue.
    Ziraat Bank used this methodology and put it to use in practical situations. •
    AI has taken over the financial Investment sector in Thailand. Noonpakdee et al.
    [55] discusses incorporating AI in their fields to maximize the capabilities and
    gain better performance for users. It also gave examples based on fintech company
    statistics and technology to explain their achievements. Around 400 samples have
    been taken to observe and analyze using ML concepts such as multiple regression.
    Results propose that AI in the financial service sector should be suggested, and
    more emphasis should be placed on data analysis. • Talking about capability and
    public strategies to apply using AI in the financial sector. Bredt et al. [56]
    believes that AI has potential and techniques that can be useful for future technological
    innovation. In combination with AI with the financial sector and corporations,
    various models—stating how the government of Germany and Hessen has planned work
    and application of AI by investing three billion euros in coming years. In order
    to contribute, the state of Hessen will set up AI-based applied research and digitalization.
    The main focus of these strategies is how we can robustly apply our research potential
    and work towards quality. By seeing the impact of the states, other states are
    also acquiring and applying strategies, which include applications of AI and setting
    up research hubs, which in turn results in benefits. • Mhlanga et al. [57] has
    talked about digital financial inclusion and how AI can be included for people
    with low-income earners, considering women and youth. The paper states the challenges
    of AI in this market. AI is used to reduce risks and risk management. It also
    talks about how fin-tech and non-fin-tech companies can incorporate the application
    of AI in the investment market using unobtrusive research techniques. 4.1.2. Insurance
    • Dhieb et al. [58] has expressed how the company maximizes its profit using various
    models by providing insurance. This paper discusses the blockchain-based insurance
    framework, which can help a company detect fake customers and help customers know
    whether or not company claims can be achieved and reduce money loss. They also
    discussed how fraud detection can classify fraud to implement; they have used
    an ML model and also compared it with different models. Their outcome says that
    with a particular data set, the results are more accurate and stable performance
    as compared to other models. Furthermore, they proposed a model of AI with a blockchain
    framework. • Massaro et al. [59] have stated the importance of business intelligence
    (BI), which can be integrated into the insurance sector and when applied with
    a decision support system (DSS), helps us to improve the efficiency of the model
    and where we can manage agent activities. The paper discusses ML, data mining
    (DM), clustering methods for ranking agents, and the use of artificial neural
    networks (ANNs). The data was fed by artificial records (AR), and the result’s
    accuracy increased as the number of ARs increased. The methodology proposed can
    also be extended for designing a new app. • Gramegna et al. [60] has suggested
    an explainable AI (XAI) model using extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) where
    users can get insight into what insurance they are purchasing. The main aspects
    discussed the trends of how insurance can be helpful and the risks one will gain.
    The paper shows the empirical approach where the dataset belongs to the purchase
    of micro-policies. They used the clustering concept of ML and predicted whether
    the customer would opt for insurance. 4.1.3. Stock market • Due to its volatility,
    the stock market can be difficult to predict. The stock market depends on a company’s
    performance, pandemic situation, and geopolitical tension. Naik et al. [61] proposed
    a system that can predict stock crisis using hybrid feature selection (HFS), excludes
    the parameters that are useless, then applying naive Bayes algorithms such as
    Bernoulli Gaussian applied for the prediction of stocks. The relative strength
    index (RSI) is an indicator that gauges recent price changes and can help us buy
    and sell signals. Stock prices are predicted using XGboost and neural networks.
    Based on error approaches, the performance evaluation criteria were developed.
    Findings indicate that HFS and XGBoost outperformed neural networks. • The stock
    market is volatile, so it is difficult to predict. Nabipour et al. [62] has talked
    about how to reduce risk in the trend prediction of stocks. They proposed various
    AI models, such as decision tree, RF, adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), support vector
    classifier (SVC), naïve Bayes, logistic regression (LR), ANN and DL methods. They
    used two different ways: processing calculated stock trading values as continuous
    data and converting indicators to binary data and then processing it further.
    Each prediction method was accessed based on F1-score, accuracy, precision, and
    ROC-AUC. The results show that for both methods, i.e., continuous and binary,
    DL methods gave the best results compared to other models. • The time series data
    refers to an ordered sequence or a set of data points a variable takes at equal
    time intervals. All stock market investors want to profit more while minimizing
    associated risks. Idrees et al. [63] aimed for stock trend prediction. The study
    has used time series data from the Indian stock market and built a statistical
    model. An auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model has been used,
    which shows non-stationary behavior. Their results show that when the predicted
    time series is compared to the observed time series, it is discovered that there
    is, on average, a mean percentage error of 5% for both the nifty and the Sensex.
    • Ren [64] et al. considered sentiment features for investor psychology along
    with financial market data that estimates the trend of stock market movement.
    The features are automatically retrieved from unstructured news material and expressed
    as sentiment indices. They considered the day-of-week effect to improve the reliability
    and reality of the indices. Then, they used SVM to forecast stock market trends
    and adapt to actual market conditions using a rolling window methodology. They
    evaluated the accuracy with the baseline method. According to empirical results,
    combining sentiment traits with stock market data has given a significantly better
    performance than only utilizing stock data. Using sentiment analysis, the accuracy
    increased by 18.6%. • Park [65] et al. examines the relationship between housing
    and stock markets with strong attention on housing bubbles. Stock market dynamics
    have a greater influence on changes in housing prices than stock market dynamics
    have on house prices. Yet, changes in property prices can forecast stock market
    volatility if housing market data is given as a signal. They used long short-term
    memory (LSTM) neural network-based early warning systems (EWS) for the housing
    market. EWS is also effective at picking up the bubble signal. As a result, it
    is seen that the LSTM approach performs better than other models. Download : Download

    by households and even in more prominent industries. The energy sector plays a
    crucial role in everyday life. The energy sector in the industry is also increasing
    effectively. Here, our primary goal is to supply as much energy as possible using
    various approaches. Also, we have to work on restricting unofficial activities.
    Multiple authors have worked on it and discussed it in Table 6, which compares
    various existing research. Further, Fig. 7 discussed the classification of the

    4.2.1. Nuclear sector Nuclear power reactors produce around 18% of our nation’s
    security. It is important to protect this nuclear power from terrorist attacks
    by implementing robust cybersecurity policies, background checks after a certain
    time should be incorporated, and certain tests should be layered to ensure dual
    security. • El-Sefy et al. [66] has discussed how to accurately and more functionally
    operate nuclear power plants by using AI techniques such as feed-forward neural
    network, backpropagation neural network. Nuclear power plants (NPPS) produce a
    considerable amount of data by analyzing systems in the plants, and this data
    can be helpful in AI to make data-driven models (DDM). The model was generated
    with 32 trained data transients interacting between complex systems inside the
    pressurized water reactor inside the plant. As a result, the model gives an accurate
    prediction, and mitigating risk strategies can also reduce human error. The study
    further says that AI has significant potential and can quickly help in risk mitigation
    measures. • Guimarães et al. [67] has proposed a fuzzy inference system (FIS)
    approach to estimate performance indicators of NPPs. The FIS approach uses a collection
    of fuzzy if-then rules to determine a mapping from fuzzy sets in the input universe
    of discourse to fuzzy sets in the output based on fuzzy logic principles. The
    study shows that the FIS approach has the potential to generate a knowledge basis
    that correlates operational occurrences and nuclear power plant (NPP) performance
    with lower error rates. Overall, the FIS approach can be a valuable tool for monitoring
    and optimizing the performance of NPPs. • Peng et al. [68] proposed a fault diagnosis
    approach for NPP using correlation analysis and deep belief network(DBN). The
    method involves dimensionality reduction through correlation analysis and fault
    identification using a deep belief network. The implementation of the algorithm
    and model-building process is discussed in detail, considering the characteristics
    of NPP. The performance of the proposed fault diagnosis model is illustrated using
    a personal computer transient analyzer (PCTRAN). The results are compared with
    the fault diagnostic results, showing that the proposed method outperforms others.
    The study concludes that the proposed approach can significantly improve the fault
    diagnosis of NPPs and has profound guiding significance for the safe operation
    of NPPs. • Kochunas et al. [69] addresses how Digital Twins (DTs) might be used
    in the nuclear power industry. The paper recommends that DT development initially
    focus on mechanical model-based methods and strategically incorporate model-free
    techniques. The report also emphasizes the difficulties in achieving a DT, such
    as uncertainty quantification (UQ). UQ maximizes information gain or the performance
    of the physical asset in an unpredictable environment through optimal experimental
    design and design optimization. Download : Download high-res image (183KB) Download

    energy • Shyam et al. [70] presented a study about renewable energy in the country
    and its impact on the nation’s energy security and economic stability. They also
    discussed past scenarios about how renewable resources have performed, the current
    system, and how to utilize energy in India. In conclusion, they discussed the
    growth and the demand growing continuously daily; the sector that has contributed
    the most is wind power. • Liu et al. [71] discussed how to improve the cyber security
    defense capability in energy power plants and what types of problems are faced
    in projecting the plan. It mainly focuses on cybersecurity threats, security protection
    architecture, threat monitoring technology, and how to reduce risk by analyzing
    the correlation index. This paper includes anti-penetration technology that has
    been implemented. Moreover, this paper also consists of attack monitoring technology
    that can analyze certain specific events happening. 4.3. Agriculture sector The
    food and agriculture sector has a huge impact on people’s lives, and this sector
    is still thriving; how to get more productivity is a task. AI in this sector can
    help in applications such as precision agriculture to analyze data from various
    sources. We can train and test the data and get insights into soil conditions,
    crop health, and yield prediction, and with this help, we can also guide farmers.
    AI is used for crop disease prediction, pest detection, supply chain optimization,
    and crop breed detection. Various authors have worked on it, as discussed in Table

    paper incorporates the uses of AI in greenhouse production to increase efficiency
    The experiment was held among five teams to use various AI algorithms and evaluated
    accordingly. Greenhouse production Efficient in resource consumption Specialized
    knowledge and reliability issues Muñoz et al. [80] 2022 New IoT-based cloud architecture
    for greenhouse production providing web services A FIWARE-based IoT architecture
    is proposed, which facilitates intelligent applications providing real-time data,
    monitoring, and providing feedback Greenhouse production Real-time data access,
    feedback, customized to greenhouse needs Technical expertise required, not suitable
    for low scale 4.3.1. Crop production • Kong et al. [73] has talked about precision
    farming and how to increase crop production and a sustainable supply chain. They
    have proposed a model-based and cross-stage partial network (CSPNet), three parallel
    sub-networks, and a cross-level fusion module. The model can accurately identify
    different crop categories. The recognition accuracy and F1 score model achieve
    competitive results. Moreover, the authors have said that we can implement the
    model lightweight with parameters that will boost speed and increase accuracy,
    which can be used widely. • The World population is increasing day by day; still,
    the cultivation area is expected to increase by a fraction of a percentage, which
    is very low compared to the population. Therefore, Vincent et al. [74] has discussed
    intelligent and efficient farming techniques for improving soil productivity.
    The crucial point of the crop is if the particular crop is suitable to grow on
    that soil. The proposed system is evaluated using performance measures such as
    accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC curve. • Blessy et al. [75]
    proposed an AI and IoT-based scheme for building intelligent irrigation systems.
    They used different strategies to utilize water for intelligent irrigation. The
    smart system produces centralized storage, processing, and data analysis from
    different ubiquitous sensors with the decision process. A smart, automated system
    was developed for water optimization. 4.3.2. Crop disease • Ale et al. [76] has
    talked about DL and how it can help us with smart agriculture when applied to
    disease severity classification. Most of the farmers need to be made aware of
    the non-native conditions. In this paper, they have proposed a deep neural network
    (DNN) that runs on the IoT. Furthermore, to reduce the computational cost, they
    have reduced the size of input images, and then the model is proposed. Results
    are provided by the transfer learning model and simple deep learning model, which
    is lightweight and detects plant disease using low computational resources. •
    liu et al. [77] presented a study about agriculture production, which is adversely
    affected by the disease. There are very few differences in the severity of the
    same crop disease, making it more challenging as extracting the features of lesions
    can be very difficult. The study discusses a modified lightweight CNN suggested
    to improve performance in the fine-grained categorization of agricultural diseases.
    The recognition accuracy was found to be higher than that of the original SqueezeNext
    model. The model was also compared with different models, but the proposed model
    has high accuracy. • Crop disease and pests affect the crop quality for agricultural
    production. Detection and identification of pests can help us from economic losses.
    Therefore, Ai et al. [78] proposed a model based on neural networks to detect
    crop disease. Inception-ResNet-v2 with ReLu activation function. As a result,
    the model gives an accuracy of 86%, which shows the effectiveness of the model.
    After this, they implemented and performed a test that detected crop disease and
    could comment on the affected condition. 4.3.3. Green-house • A greenhouse protects
    the crop from outside influences like rain, wind, low temperatures, and pests.
    A shortage of educated laborers can cause a loss to the agriculture sector. Hemming
    et al. [79] talked about an international competition consisting of five teams
    where horticulture experts with AI can see fresh food production with fewer resources.
    The experiment was designed to evaluate how well modern AI algorithms perform
    when used to produce cucumber crops; in the investigation, teams had to combine
    the most recent AI algorithms with traditional methods to maximize net profit
    with less usage of resources. Their outcome depicts that AI algorithms can be
    used for agriculture production, and they can even perform better. However, more
    work is needed in this sector for different aspects of the model. • Muñoz et al.
    [80] proposed a cloud solution where the IoT platform is applied for greenhouse
    crop production. They used a Greenhouse Models as a Service (GMaaS) methodology.
    The forecasting capabilities of our GMaaS application are based on computer models
    created for indoor climate, crop production, and irrigation operations. Models
    are used as DSS; however, they are approachable as RESTful services under a GMaaS
    strategy and can be used as necessary. 4.4. Smart healthcare sector The healthcare
    sector is vital for each and every human being. With the emergence of AI, this
    sector has evolved and has got better solutions and equipment for faster recovery
    and response. Table 8 discusses the comparative analysis of the existing schemes
    in the smart healthcare sector. • Kumar et al. [81] proposed a methodology to
    build a smart healthcare system using blockchain 4.0 technology along with programming,
    tools, interoperability, and techniques, considering simulation and implementation
    approaches for validating. They observed various errors without affecting actual
    performance. • Healthcare revolution 5.0 supports smart healthcare comprising
    AI, IoT, and big data analytics. Wazid et al. [82] focuses on security challenges
    for sensitive healthcare data. The paper proposes a secured healthcare framework
    with security concerns. Also, comparing existing mechanisms with comparison parameters
    and suggesting future research areas. • Elayan et al. [83] has proposed a digital
    representation of an intended or actual real-world physical product, system, or
    process that serves as the effectively indistinguishable. They implemented smart-context-aware
    healthcare using the DT framework. The implemented models successfully predicted
    a particular heart condition with high accuracy in different algorithms. The collected
    results have shown that integrating DT with the healthcare field would improve
    healthcare processes. Their experimental outcome shows that DNN outperformed compared
    to different algorithms where the evaluation metrics considered accuracy, confusion
    matrix, recall, and F1 score. Their future work proposes real-time data and maximizing
    functionality. • Nazar et al. [85] has talked about various AI models and various
    applications in the healthcare field of study on computer technology and human
    interaction, i.e., human–computer interaction(HCI). The study proposes that XAI
    can link with AI and HCI. Moreover, the future exploration of XAI in healthcare
    can be fruitful. • Healthcare data transfer can be a potential area of attack,
    resulting in network disruptions and significant healthcare security difficulties.
    IoT-enabled healthcare networks are diverse and open for security performance.
    Xu et al. [84] has proposed a neural networks-based model having levels of kernels
    and can effectively work on reducing the parameters. The proposed model gives
    effective results when compared to other models. Table 8. Comparison of existing

    role in the functioning of society and the economy. It enables the movement of
    people, goods, and services, facilitating trade and economic growth. A resilient
    transportation infrastructure is essential for maintaining connectivity and ensuring
    the efficient flow of traffic, especially during times of disruptions or disasters.
    Enhancing the resilience of the transportation infrastructure is important for
    minimizing disruptions, improving response and recovery capabilities, and ensuring
    the continued operation of critical services. • Nipa et al. [86] talks about enhancing
    the resilience of transportation infrastructure through the development of strategies
    and recommendations. 92 survey responses from professionals in the field of infrastructure
    for transportation were gathered and examined for this study. The study created
    robustness enhancement options for transportation infrastructure based on the
    findings. The study’s conclusions emphasize how crucial it is to keep the network’s
    node count at an optimal level in order to provide quick and effective traffic
    rerouting from a broken connection or node, which greatly improves resilience.
    • Zdeněk et al. [87] paper focuses on the creation of risk assessment models for
    the road and railway systems in Central European countries. The research results
    indicated the need for implementing new measures in response to emerging sources
    of risk in the transport system. • Joseph et al. [88] paper is to discuss the
    significance of transportation as a critical sector in terms of national security
    and the ongoing threat of terrorist attacks on transportation facilities mainly
    in the US, concluding that this sector needs more security, safety, and policies.
    4.6. Miscellaneous sector • Dams play a crucial role in supporting development
    by providing various benefits such as irrigation, hydropower, water supply, flood
    control, drought mitigation, navigation, fish farming, and recreation. DeNeale
    et al. [89] talks about US CI for water retention, flood protection, hydroelectric
    power, transportation, irrigation, and recreation opportunities. The project aims
    to summarize the current state of practice in dam safety risk assessment. • The
    education industry is vital to society because it gives people the information,
    skills, and chances they need to advance both personally and professionally. The
    development of human capital, which supports social progress and economic growth,
    depends on education. Hence, it becomes important to secure the sector. Stéphan
    et al. [90] highlights two primary issues facing education in the AI era using
    AI to enhance learning procedures and equipping students with the new skill sets
    needed in automated societies and businesses. • Chan et al. [91] in this study
    attempts to address the issues surrounding the usage of text-generative AI tools
    in academic settings, specifically with reference to plagiarism and cheating in
    written assignments and exams. The paper concludes that there is a significant
    number of students who have used generative AI tools to complete their assignments.
    5. AI-based secure data dissemination framework for smart grid: A case study An
    AI-based solution plays an essential role in CI. Adapting new AI technologies
    in various sectors has helped every industry grow and work efficiently. The AI
    model makes predictions based on the training data set, which implies the more
    data trained, the more accurate the forecast we will get. Although AI is a powerful
    model, there are still prone to several vulnerabilities, such as adversarial attacks,
    AI-powered malware, poisoning, and inference [92], [93]. The attacker can easily
    misguide the data, and the result might be wrongly classified. To avoid these
    attacks, we must secure our architecture, which can keep track of the attacks.
    This section introduces the proposed approach (shown in Fig. 8), which is divided
    into three layers, i.e., the smart grid, AI, and consumer. A detailed description
    of each layer is discussed below. 5.1. Smart grid layer This layer comprises various
    components, such as substations for managing, protecting, and monitoring functions.
    Power Poles help in power distribution for the network and further communicate
    to the substation. Power poles are equipped with intelligent IoT sensors that
    can enable real-time monitoring, energy efficiency, and fault detection. These
    power poles collect data, i.e., on power consumption, weather conditions, and
    security threats, and are transferred to the substation via IEC 60870-5-104 protocol
    [94], an industrial protocol widely applied in critical infrastructures. However,
    this protocol has privacy and security concerns, but it is still widely used in
    critical infrastructures and industries. The data stored can be helpful to many
    sectors in the future; hence, it should be stored securely. Data stored in substations
    is critical and can always be prone to attackers. Therefore, an AI layer is incorporated,
    which ensures data reliability and correct data classification. 5.2. AI layer
    This layer uses a standard smart grid dataset for classifying malicious and non-malicious
    data by incorporating different AI classifiers. Here, we used the IEC 60870-5-104
    intrusion detection dataset [94] from a well-known dataset repository, IEEE Dataport
    for IoT-enabled CI. The dataset comprises of 83 network features (columns) such
    as packet size, bandwidth, etc., and 3421 rows. Due to the high-dimensional nature
    of the dataset, it must be reduced to improve the performance of the AI layer.
    For that, we adopted an explainable AI (XAI) model, i.e., Shapley Additive Explanations
    (SHAP), to provide efficient and optimal features from the 83 features that enhance
    the detection rate of classification. Fig. 9 shows the SHAP-based feature importance
    value of 15 features from the dataset. A comprehensive analysis was conducted,
    considering the importance of each feature, which subsequently guided our decision
    to include 24 key features in the training of AI classifiers. This selection was
    made to ensure the optimal performance and relevance of the classifiers in the
    given context. Since we are using a security dataset, it is essential to analyze
    the dataset for any anomalies that hinder the performance of the detection rate.
    Therefore, we used an isolation forest algorithm that discovers potential anomalies
    in the dataset. It recursively partitioned the dataset, essentially creating a
    binary tree where anomalies are isolated with shorter paths. Further, it randomly
    selects the features from the dataset and threshold to split the data, making
    it computationally efficient and suitable for high-dimensional datasets. We used
    MATLAB library, i.e., iforest(), to implement anomaly detection, wherein a contamination
    factor 0.05 is used to specify the fraction of anomalies in the training dataset.
    It returns the anomaly indicators and anomaly scores for the training dataset;
    based on these scores, the anomalies are detected. Furthermore, data is pre-processed,
    such as managing missing values using central tendency values, data typecasting,
    handling not-a-number (NaN) values, normalizing the dataset, and data encoding
    using label encoders, which helps in accurate classification. For managing missing
    values, NaN, and infinity values in the dataset, we first have to find out such
    instances using df.isnull().sum(). It prints each feature and its count of missing
    values. In the case of the above-mentioned values found in the dataset, it can
    be filled up using the central tendency value, i.e., Mean, by fillna(updated_df[‘feature’].
    mean()). Then, we checked the dataset for the inconsistent datatype, i.e., whether
    the feature space has the same datatype or not. We managed it using the explicit
    type casting (e.g., int feature_1 (int) feature_2;). Further, the dataset is normalized
    using zscore() normalization technique. The above-mentioned techniques cleaned
    and pre-processed the dataset. Next, the pre-processed dataset is splitted among
    training and testing datasets using the train_test_split(); it ensures that they
    do not merely mimic the data but also learn and understand its underlying patterns
    and structures. Then, the training dataset is forwarded to different AI classifiers,
    such as Naive Bayes, RF, LR, and SVM, for binary classification tasks, i.e., to
    efficiently bifurcate malicious and non-malicious data of the smart grid system.
    Once the aforementioned classifiers get trained, they are evaluated using the
    testing dataset to ensure that the classifiers have not merely memorized the data
    but have effectively learned to make accurate predictions. From the results, we
    conclude that RF outperforms other AI classifiers in terms of accuracy and training
    time. Afterward, the non-attack data is passed to the consumer layer. 5.3. Consumer
    layer The smart grid layer collects the data and forwards it to the AI layer,
    where pre-processing and splitting are processed. Data are classified as valid,
    and non-attack data is then fed to various consumer sectors such as banking, industries,
    NPPs, and healthcare. For Example, provided data will be helpful for the hospital
    to know the uptime and downtime of electricity, hence avoiding the downtime duration
    for critical operations. Providing this data can be beneficial in the quality
    of customer service, such as offering an app that can alert the consumer when
    their energy usage is high. Consumers will get accurate data by introducing the
    AI layer, which will be beneficial. 5.4. Performance analysis of the proposed
    architecture This section discusses the performance analysis of the proposed architecture
    by considering different assessment metrics, such as anomaly detection, training
    accuracy, ROC, and training time. Fig. 10 shows the anomaly detection graph of
    the utilized dataset. In the graph, we create a mesh grid and place the feature
    space of the dataset. Since we selected 22 features from the XAI feature selection,
    we are unable to show all features and their detected anomalies. Henceforth, Fig.
    10 shows the anomaly detection for 2 features, wherein the ( ) dot specifies the
    outliers or anomalies. The iforest() algorithm efficiently detects these outliers
    and marked with (‘x’) on the ( ) dot. To analyze the detection rate of the iforest()
    algorithm, we evaluate it using a precision–recall curve as shown in Fig. 11.
    We can observe from Fig. 11 that the area under curve (AUC) score shows 77.18%
    for the true detection rate of the iforest() algorithm. This implies that 77.18%
    outliers are positively detected by the iforest() algorithm. Download : Download

    Before analyzing the performance of the AI classifier, we first applied Fig. 12(a)
    shows the accuracy comparison between different ML classifiers employed in the
    proposed architecture. From the graph, we can see that RF has an outperforming
    accuracy, i.e., 96.89%, compared to other AI classifiers, such as SVM, Guassian,
    and LR. The rationale behind this outperformance is due to its ensemble approach,
    which combines the training of multiple decision trees. Moreover, it reduces the
    overfitting issue by averaging the biases and errors of individual decision trees.
    Additionally, we used the ROC curve to showcase the noteworthy performance of
    RF in classifying attack and non-attack data of the smart grid. The ROC curve
    is a graphical representation that shows the trade-off between a true positive
    rate and a false positive rate. It displays the performance of the ML classifier
    across all threshold values and analyzes how efficiently the ML classifier distinguishes
    between attack and non-attack data. Fig. 12(b) illustrates the performance of
    the RF classifier for both class labels, i.e., attack and non-attack data. From
    the graph, we can see that the RF seamlessly indicates the difference between
    positive and negative classes. Further, we utilized training time as another performance
    metric to evaluate the ML classifiers. It is essential in mission-critical applications
    to quickly train their ML models. The lesser the training time, the faster the
    attack detection rate. Deploying such ML classifiers in the first line of defense,
    i.e., intrusion detection systems, intelligent firewalls, and security switches,
    strengthens the security of the CI. In that view, Fig. 12(c) depicts the training
    time comparison between all the employed ML classifiers. RF shows a lesser training
    time (i.e., 3.894 (s)) compared to other ML classifiers because it is inherently
    parallelizable. This is because it uses an ensemble approach where individual
    decision trees can be trained independently. All the decision tree has random
    subset from the dataset feature space. This makes RF well-suited for multi-core
    processors, reducing the overall training time. Download : Download high-res image

    of AI-based cyber security for CI has received considerable research interest
    from academics and the industry. Nevertheless, there are still a few significant
    research gaps that threaten the security of CI. Fig. 13 shows a pictorial illustration
    of open research issues and challenges. Download : Download high-res image (289KB)

    6.1. Data availability/quality The AI model usually needs a massive amount of
    quality data to train and accurately classify malicious and non-malicious or attack
    and non-attack data. However, very few datasets are available on the open-source
    repository. The available datasets have obsolete feature space that will not work
    on the current security systems. Moreover, quality data is required to train an
    AI model that provides efficient classification. Training AI models on an ordinary
    dataset lead to the wrong classification and degrades the security performance
    of CI [95]. 6.2. AI model complexity and overfitting The problem of data complexity
    occurs when data is not well-generalized to new data. The complexity of the AI
    model is crucial when applied to the cyber–physical system (CPS), which turns
    out to be more complex and intricate. It makes it harder to deal with unusual
    behavior in the design and get to the root cause of the issue. For instance, DL
    techniques are entirely black-box, where the working of that specific algorithm
    is known, but its underlying principle is still a mystery. Further, overfitting
    is also a major concern while training AI models. Suitable measures need to be
    taken to reduce overfitting, which increases the computational overhead on the
    CI [96]. 6.3. Scalability Critical infrastructure systems manage a massive amount
    of data that is required to function in real-time. For massive requests to be
    accommodated, it needs a robust and powerful system that can handle such a large
    volume of data. Furthermore, it requires maintaining a balance between security
    and performance, i.e., as the system becomes more scalable, it becomes more complex
    and vulnerable to attack. Hence, a trade-off is demanded between security and
    performance. 6.4. Logic transparency Black box model of AI, such as DL models,
    are often used in cyber systems as it is efficient and gives accurate result.
    However, when it comes to explainability, it does not have transparency and how
    the result is obtained. This lack of explainability and interpretability might
    be problematic in CI contexts where decision-making needs to be supported and
    understood. Research is being done to promote XAI to understand the logic behind
    AI-based judgments [97]. 6.5. Resiliency and adaptability Resiliency specifies
    the ability of the system to withstand and recover from severe disruptions. On
    the other hand, adaptability signifies the ability of the system to change and
    adapt to new conditions. From a security perspective, cyber threats are advancing
    at a steep rate; hence, it is essential for an AI-enabled security solution to
    handle and adjust the changes as per the evolving threat patterns. Systems should
    be made in such a way that stands resilient to failure and also can adapt to changes
    [98]. 7. Conclusion and future works In conclusion, this research paper delved
    into implementing AI in cyber security for CI. Exploring the transformative potential
    of AI-based solutions and the challenges faced in safeguarding essential systems
    through an extensive literature review, historical analysis, and case study. Further,
    we highlighted the significant impact of AI on detecting, preventing, and mitigating
    cyber threats. The study addressed open issues such as data privacy, algorithmic
    bias, and the evolving roles of human operators in an AI-driven security landscape.
    It underscored the importance of responsible and ethical AI implementations to
    protect CI effectively. Moving forward, continued research and collaboration are
    crucial to developing robust AI systems that ensure the resilience and security
    of CI in the face of evolving cyber threats. Our experimental results reveal that
    the RF classifier achieves an accuracy of 96.89% with a remarkably short training
    time of 3.894 s, surpassing the performance of other classifiers. Based on this
    comprehensive survey and the research findings, we will utilize different aspects
    of AI, such as feature selection using robust XAI techniques, federated learning
    to do decentralized training, and securing the training weights using blockchain
    technology. Amalgamating all the aforementioned techniques can enhance AI training
    and offer a remarkable detection rate. Further, we will also try to utilize the
    advantage of 5G communication to tackle latency issues in the extended work. The
    involvement of 5G communication is imperative because blockchain uses various
    cryptographic materials that increase the latency in communication. Therefore,
    employing a high communication network interface, such as a 5G network, can be
    beneficial. Declaration of competing interest There is no Conflict of Interest

  description: With the wide application of Internet of Things, big data and other
    technologies in smart agriculture, more and more agricultural data are collected
    and used. The current analysis and processing through IoT platforms and other
    centralised methods have more serious data security problems. Privacy computing
    is a technology that completes data security calculations under the premise that
    both parties do not disclose data, and the data of each participant participates
    in the calculation is in the form of cipher text to maximally reduce the risk
    of data leakage. Aiming at the small volume and high frequency scenario of agricultural
    data, this paper proposes a distributed privacy computing framework by integrating
    cryptography, edge computing and blockchain, and designs a privacy computing system
    called PCS-ADS for smart agricultural data. This paper focuses on describing the
    system model architecture and system function implementation, which includes key
    business processes, core modules, core algorithms and other parts. Finally, the
    security and performance evaluation of the system is carried out. The results
    show that, for sum and variance, the computation time for multi-party under the
    amount of 1w data of each party is no more than 0.1s, and for the high-frequency
    computation scenarios, the computation time under the amount of 100 data of each
    party is no more than 7s and 1.5s, respectively. Experimental results prove that
    PCS-ADS is effective and has a strong practicality.

    Comments ABSTRACT With the wide application of Internet of Things, big data and
    other technologies in smart agriculture, more and more agricultural data are collected
    and used. The current analysis and processing through IoT platforms and other
    centralised methods have more serious data security problems. Privacy computing
    is a technology that completes data security calculations under the premise that
    both parties do not disclose data, and the data of each participant participates
    in the calculation is in the form of cipher text to maximally reduce the risk
    of data leakage. Aiming at the small volume and high frequency scenario of agricultural
    data, this paper proposes a distributed privacy computing framework by integrating
    cryptography, edge computing and blockchain, and designs a privacy computing system
    called PCS-ADS for smart agricultural data. This paper focuses on describing the
    system model architecture and system function implementation, which includes key
    business processes, core modules, core algorithms and other parts. Finally, the
    security and performance evaluation of the system is carried out. The results
    show that, for sum and variance, the computation time for multi-party under the
    amount of 1w data of each party is no more than 0.1s, and for the high-frequency
    computation scenarios, the computation time under the amount of 100 data of each
    party is no more than 7s and 1.5s, respectively. Experimental results prove that
    PCS-ADS is effective and has a strong practicality. References Nikesh Gondchawar,

    the current era, the Internet of Things (IoT) technology has gained popularity.
    This is due to addition of sensing, receiving, and transmitting capabilities to
    any physical object. IoT plays a vital role in various verticals of everyday life.
    IoT finds its application in Industrial IoT, precision agriculture, smart cities,
    and healthcare applications [1]. The sensors in the IoT system sense various physical
    parameters. The data is collected from these sensors and stored in a central server.
    However, the data security in the central server and its privacy preservation
    is an important aspect. The IoT brings in several advantages, but the leakage
    of the sensitive information or the attack by hackers can ruin its sole purpose.
    Therefore, connecting several physical objects over the Internet with strong protection
    of the data is the prime requirement. The focus of research is to save this collected
    data securely in decentralized architecture. The integration of blockchain technology
    in IoT permits the physical objects to securely transmit data in peer-to-peer
    network. The blockchain minimizes the risk of any fraudulent information entering
    in the IoT network. This is because before the entry of data in within the network,
    the consent is taken from majority of the users instead of the single central
    authority [2]. Furthermore, blockchain-based IoT system builds a strong and robust
    network in which it prevents the hackers to steal all the information just by
    attacking the central server. In IoT-based system, data security is obtained by
    applying encryption. The encryption technique involves each node in the IoT system
    to carry two keys, namely public key and private key. The public key is available
    to other nodes that encrypts the data which is then broadcasted to all other nodes
    in the network. The private key is secret to individual nodes that is used for
    decrypting the data. The blockchain technology prevents the fraudulent intruder
    to falsely encrypt the information. In a blockchain-based IoT network, all the
    physical objects within the network are identified by public key. Therefore, this
    sharing may lead to third-party attack that can make out the identity of the IoT
    participants. The blockchain-based IoT system eliminates single point of failure;
    this enhances fault tolerance and reliability of IoT system. The IoT devices participating
    in a blockchain-based network can verify data integrity and identity of sender
    [3]. Also, blockchain provides secure software updates and data storage capability
    to IoT-based system. Furthermore, blockchain technology stores data in an immutable
    which provides backtracking and traceability capabilities. IoT allows the inter-connectivity
    of physical objects “things” by providing sensing and transmitting capabilities.
    In the current era, IoT finds its applications in everyday life making smart networks.
    These smart networks are capable of sensing various physical parameters and the
    taking valuable decisions. The decentralization enhances the IoT networks scalability
    and performances. With the exponential growth in the adoption and popularity of
    IoT technology, the demand of secure data storage and transmission is increasing
    immensely. The security of the data is essential; any kind of data leakage or
    attack by intruder can lead to disclosure of critical information. Thus, it is
    essential to preserve the privacy of data and grant access of data to authorized
    users. However, there are few prerequisite security requirements for IoT-based
    system like confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, non-repudiation, authorization,
    and availability. The integration of the block chain technology with IoT enhances
    the reliability of IoT-based system in terms of security. The blockchain provides
    data security to resource constrained end devices in IoT-based system. Also, the
    blockchain technology is capable to handle heterogeneity, privacy protection,
    and confidentiality of IoT-based systems. 2 Literature Review This section describes
    literature review of the state-of-the-art approaches. Bhutta et al. [4] in 1991
    introduced blockchain technology as “a cryptographically secured chain of blocks”.
    Baur et al. [5] in 2018 implemented blockchain as a public ledger and received
    universal recognition in a cryptocurrency named Bitcoin. It is gaining popularity
    in various sectors such as agriculture, logistics, and insurance. The blockchain
    technology provides secure distributed architecture that works without intervention
    of any centralized or third party. Wang et al. [6] defined blockchain as a chain
    of blocks that are linked cryptographically using hash functions. It works on
    a peer-to-peer network of participants. The blockchain technology provides the
    highest degree of accountability. This feature has resulted in the adaptation
    of blockchain technology for data transmission and record-keeping in various sectors
    of real-life applications. The blockchain technology provides these real-life
    applications with proper documentation and digitally confirms the ownership of
    assets. Hildebrand et al. [7] proposed that blockchain technology blocks are ordered
    unambiguously using consensus algorithm. Thus, this makes blockchain technology
    verifiable, consistent, auditable and enhances integrity among all the participants.
    Jain et al. [8] proposed a block constitutes version information, hash of the
    parent block, timestamp, nonce, count of transaction, and combination of hash
    transactions. Whenever a new block has been generated, then each participant will
    apply block authentication process. After appropriate validation and approval,
    this block is appended to the parent block with the help of reference. This process
    helps to detect the unidentified or unauthorized transactions. Unauthorized or
    falsified blocks can be identified by the hash value which is completely different
    from authorized blocks. Meryem et al. [9] proposed the integration of blockchain
    technology for security in IoT-based smart homes. Mohamed et al. [10] proposed
    security in IoT-enabled smart industry environment for Industry 4.0 applications.
    3 Working Principle of Blockchain A blockchain structure is represented in the
    form of list of blocks with ordered transactions. The list is stored as flat file
    database. The point to notice is that there is no pointer pointing to the first
    block, and the terminal block has a pointer with null value. Figure 1 shows the
    structure of blockchain. A block contains version, parent block hash, timestamp,
    nonce, transaction count, and Merkle root. Nonce is an integer that starts from
    0 and increases every time after hash is calculated. The Merkle root is the combined
    hash of all transactions. Figure 2 shows the working principle of a blockchain
    technology. Whenever a new record or transaction is to be added into a blockchain,
    it needs to be verified and digitally signed by nodes in the system. Any block
    contains data, its hash value, and hash of the previous block. It depends which
    kind of data has been stored in a blockchain such as receiver, sender, and the
    amount of coins. A hash is like a digital signature or a fingerprint. The hash
    of a block is generated using cryptographic hash algorithm. The hash helps in
    identifying each block in a blockchain structure. Any modification in a block
    results in change of its hash. The hash of the previous block helps to form a
    chain structure which plays a major role of providing security. Any fraudulent
    attempt to change the data of a block leads to invalidation of the whole blockchain
    system. The proof-of-work is performed by the miners which are special nodes within
    the blockchain structure. The miners get transaction fees as a reward from the
    block. Whenever a new block is created, it is verified by all nodes in a system.
    All nodes in the blockchain system adhere to the consensus protocol. Thus, this
    makes a blockchain system immutable and secure [11]. Table 1 shows the classification
    of blockchain architecture. Fig. 1 Blockchain structure Full size image Fig. 2
    Working principle of blockchain technology Full size image Table 1 Classification
    of blockchain architecture Full size table The major characteristics that have
    resulted in adaption of blockchain technology in real-life applications are as
    follows: Transparency: The participants in the public blockchain systems can communicate
    with equal rights. In the public blockchain systems such as Ethereum and Bitcoin,
    the authentication of each transaction is recorded. This data is available to
    all the participants in the blockchain network. Thus, data on the blockchain is
    transparent to each node so as to validate the committed transaction in the blockchain.
    Decentralization: In a centralized architecture, the validation of transaction
    is performed by central server. This causes bottleneck problem, whereas blockchain
    works on a distributed architecture where validation of transaction is performed
    in peer-to-peer manner. Thus, this enhances the performance of system in terms
    of cost-effectiveness, resolving bottleneck problem, and single-point failure.
    Immutability: In a blockchain, a chain structure is formed by linking the blocks
    through hash values. When any kind of data tampering is performed, it causes invalidation
    of all consecutive blocks. Thus, the blockchain structure is immutable. Pseudonymity:
    The blockchain is partially confidential as the addresses of participants can
    be traced. Non-repudiation: Each participant in the blockchain system contains
    a private key. This can be decrypted by other participants with help of public
    keys. Thus, cryptographically encrypted transactions are non-repudiable. Traceability:
    The blockchain technology offers traceability; this is achieved with help of timestamp
    attached to every transaction. This results in tractability of origin and modification
    of any transaction [12]. 4 Smart Contracts The smart contract can be defined as
    the programs which are stored on a blockchain. The smart contract programs run
    only when the predetermined conditions are fulfilled. The benefit of smart contract
    is that they automate the execution of an agreement. This results in reliability
    of the agreement without involving any third party. Furthermore, it is a faster
    approach which makes the system autonomous where workflows are maintained and
    the consecutive actions are triggered on fulfillment of the predetermined conditions.
    Thus, smart contracts insert a secure and automatic contractual mechanism where
    the contracting parties evaluate success or violation of the contract. Smart contracts
    are programs that encrypt and replicate contractual agreements [13]. The smart
    contract through blockchain technology in computer domain brings various benefits
    such as no commission fees, no involvement of trusted-party dependency, and no
    mutual interaction of counterparties. Smart contracts can be generated by publishing
    a transaction to the blockchain. The miners in the blockchain run smart contracts
    and achieve agreement on its implementation. Each contract is assigned a 160-bit
    address on implementation. If a transaction is generated, then contract is executed
    using this address. There are various platforms for the development of smart contract
    such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, Nem, Corda, Stellar, Waves, Cardano,
    Neo, EOS, Rootstock, Tendermint, and Quorum. These platforms such as Bitcoin can
    implement smart contracts that offer a modern-way of money exchange that provides
    innovative solutions and easy interfaces for developers. 5 Blockchain Integration
    with IoT IoT provides digital transformation and has revolutionized the real world.
    The network of sensors produces large voluminous data which is analyzed by a central
    server. The central server makes valuable decision and helps in knowledge discovery.
    The information in the IoT-based system requires safe and secure transmission
    and storage. The integration of the block chain technology with IoT enhances the
    reliability of IoT-based system in terms of security [14]. The blockchain provides
    data security to resource-constrained end devices in IoT-based system. Also, the
    blockchain technology is capable to handle heterogeneity, privacy protection,
    and confidentiality of IoT-based systems. The major advantages of integrating
    blockchain technology in IoT-based systems are listed below: The data which is
    collected by the sensors is secured by blockchains. The storage of this data is
    done in blockchain network in the form of encrypted transactions. The blockchain
    technology provides the IoT-based systems with enhanced interoperability. There
    is no involvement of third party while interaction between the IoT devices which
    makes the whole IoT system autonomous [15, 16]. Blockchain technology enhances
    the reliability of IoT-based system by providing availability, authenticity, confidentiality,
    accountability, and traceability. Also, blockchain faster the process of IoT-based
    systems by proving secure and decentralized features with no third-party intervention.
    The blockchain technology utilizes consensus mechanisms which prevents denial-of-service
    attacks. This is achieved by imposing charge for each transaction. The technology
    implementation in IoT networks enhances the overall security within the network
    by enforcing access control and data integrity [17, 18]. The blockchain technology
    makes it impossible for the intruders to modify records and hide transactions
    in IoT-based systems. This is achieved through decentralized consensus mechanism.
    It utilizes features of encrypting data using public and private keys which provides
    privacy preservation [19, 20]. 6 Proposed Secure IoT-Based Land Registry Architecture
    The land registry involves sharing transactional information of land pieces. The
    blockchain enhances data security and provides secure land registry system including
    authentication of all land transactions between involved parties. The blockchain
    technology prevents illegal land transaction, and through hash-based chain structure,
    it detects fraudulent modification registry. Thus, it helps to secure land transactions
    and registry records. Figure 3 shows the proposed land registry system architecture.
    Initially, all land registry centers and users are required to register themselves
    in a mobile application. They will receive pairs of public and private keys by
    execution of the registration function. A user can request the land registry centers
    to issue certificate. When the user initiates a request to the authorities, then
    verification of users details is performed which is stored on the blockchain network.
    The blockchain network issues a certificate based on users details stored during
    the registration. The issued certificate is stored in a decentralized Inter-Planetary
    File System. The user then receives the calculated hash value. The land registry
    details are managed as a transaction with a unique ID. This transaction is stored
    in a specific block of the blockchain network. Fig. 3 Proposed secure IoT-based
    land registry architecture Full size image 7 Conclusion The paper presents a comprehensive
    survey of blockchain technology including characteristics, architecture, and working
    principle of blockchain. It describes the need of data security and privacy preservation
    for IoT-based systems. Also, it describes the benefits of integrating blockchain
    technology with the IoT-based systems and solution that blockchain technology
    provides to IoT-based system in terms of security. This paper proposes a blockchain-based
    technology to provide security in terms of authenticity, integrity, availability,
    and confidentiality. The paper presents a secure IoT-based land registry system

  description: Technology has seeped into all facets of our lives, like education,
    healthcare, agriculture, etc., and we have benefited from this in more ways than
    one. Data analytics is the basis of many of these technologies. It is a process
    involving collecting, processing, and analysing voluminous amounts of data that
    help us make informed decisions. The use of data analytics in agriculture, commonly
    known as "smart farming, " has led to significant improvements in crop yield,
    sustainability, and profitability. It has proven to be a boon for farmers in multiple
    ways. The chapter will introduce smart agriculture and highlight the benefits
    of digitalization in the agricultural sector. Next, the chapter will delve into
    data analytics, providing an overview of the different types of data analytics
    techniques that can be used in smart agriculture. This will include multiple parameters,
    such as predictive analytics, prescriptive analytics, precision agriculture, yield
    monitoring, and risk management. These tools prove to be of great help in determining
    the extent to which data analytics have enhanced agriculture. This chapter will
    help us explore and understand the applications of data analytics in smart agriculture
    systems. We will see real-world scenarios that demonstrate how farmers and farming
    systems can use data analytics and its applications to make better and more informed
    decisions about various farming data, like crop yields, pest infestations, patterns
    in the weather, details about the soil, and other crop data. This will help us
    with data analysis and risk management. In this chapter, we will also come across
    the challenges and difficulties associated with data analytics in farming and
    agriculture, like data privacy and data security, and will also provide some recommendations
    to overcome these challenges and reduce the risks associated with the same. The
    main aim of this chapter is to give a thorough recapitulation of data analytics
    in smart agriculture and farming. We want to provide farmers with the information
    and resources they need to make informed decisions and promote innovation in the
    agricultural industry by investigating the application of data analytics in agriculture.
    By adopting data analytics applications and other cuttingedge technologies, we
    can develop a more sustainable and productive future for agriculture and guarantee
    a consistent food supply for future generations.

    Agency: Introduction In the advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies,
    one of the main trends in networking is the paradigm shift from cloud based IoT
    (IoT-C; that is, connecting the IoT device directly to a cloud server in Fig.
    1(1)) to fog/edge based IoT (IoT-FE; that is, connecting the IoT devices to the
    fog/edge nodes in Fig. 1 (2). We define three types of IoT-FE: monitoring-IoT,
    controlling-IoT, and automating-IoT. Monitoring-IoT allows the users to remotely
    read the sensor data ((3) → (2) in Fig. 1). Controlling-IoT allows the users to
    remotely control actuators ((2) → (4) in Fig. 1). Automating-IoT controls the
    actuators according to the sensor data without manual operation ((3) → (2) → (4)
    in Fig. 1). To deploy IoT-FE applications rapidly and reliably, an IoT development
    platform should provide functions to speed up application creation and management.
    Based on our experience with smart agriculture deployment in the past 8 years,
    this article describes the IoT-FE application development focusing on six issues.
    Issue 1–Device Domain Development Most commercial IoT applications use off-the-shelf
    sensors/actuators. To accommodate these devices in fog/edge computing, we need
    to integrate them with the microcontroller units (MCUs) with significant effort
    [1]. An MCU is an integrated circuit that consists of a processor unit, memory
    modules, communication interfaces (to connect the IoT servers) and peripheral
    pins (to connect sensors and actuators). To speed up the accommodation of an IoT
    device in fog/ edge computing, it is essential to provide a development environment
    in the IoT device domain. Examples of the MCU solutions include Ardublock, S4A,
    Webduino and ArduTalk [1]. Issue 2–Application Generation and Bug Detection IoT-FE
    application development consists of two phases [2]. In Phase 1, a proof-of-concept
    is built through simulation. In Phase 2, the real IoT application is implemented
    and experimented on a testbed. However, the code developed in Phase 2 may not
    be consistent with the code developed in Phase 1. In fog/edge computing, it is
    essential to automatically or semi-automatically generate the application codes
    and conduct automatic bug detection to speed up the development process [3]. Issue
    3–Sensor Failure Detection and Calibration Many IoT-FE applications fail due to
    inaccurate data produced by the sensors. Traditionally, sensor failure detection
    and calibration are conducted manually in an offline process. In fog/edge computing,
    there are many agricultural sensors spread across different locations. It is important
    to detect sensor failures and conduct calibration automatically to guarantee normal
    operations of the sensors [4], [5]. Issue 4–Big Data Management The data produced
    by the agricultural sensors from a large number of fog/edge nodes are typically
    handled by big data tools in an offline process. It is more beneficial to integrate
    the database system (Fig. 1 (5)) with the IoT-FEs and the IoT-C to support automatic
    real-time data analysis in fog/edge computing [6], [7]. Issue 5–Artificial Intelligence
    (AI) Provisioning Some data from the IoT-FE applications are manipulated by AI
    tools through an offline process [8]. Significant programming effort is required
    to integrate AI modeling into existing IoT-FE applications. Therefore, it is critical
    to provide transparent AI inferencing at IoT-FE (Fig. 1 (6)) and online AI training
    at IoT-C (Fig. 1 (7)) [6]. Issue 6–Data Privacy Since IoT-FE applications may
    support video monitoring, access rights must be enforced for data privacy [9].
    Also, the controlling-IoT and automating-IoT applications will trigger the actuators,
    and data security is required to protect these IoT-FE applications from illegal
    access. This article uses AgriTalk [10] as an example to address the above 6 issues
    for IoT-FE application development. A fog/edge node of AgriTalk is called an AgirTalk-FE.
    AgriTalk is an IoT-based smart agriculture platform for developing various AgriTalk-FEs,
    and the applications developed in an AgriTalk-FE are called FE-Talks. Examples
    are MapTalk for integrated operations center (IOC) and HouseTalk for greenhouse
    [10]. This article shows that fog/edge computing can be effectively achieved in
    these sustainable FE-Talk examples. We first describe how to organize the agriculture
    applications as FE-Talks hosted in the AgriTalk platform through a modular approach.
    Then we integrate every FE-Talk Graphical User Interface (GUI) with the MapTalk
    GUI to enhance the user experience. AgriTalk is an interesting fog/edge computing
    example, which conducts non-toxic organic farming at more than twenty soil farms
    and 4 greenhouses located in Taiwan, Japan, Philippe, Thailand and Armenia. AgriTalk
    eliminates the requirement of physical presence for some critical farming tasks
    through fog/edge computing to achieve distributed farm management. The article
    is organized as follows: The next section proposes the AgriTalk IoT-FE approach.
    Following that, we show several special FE-Talks, and then describe the AgriTalk
    mechanism on the cloud domain. We then elaborate on MapTalk, the IOC for AgriTalk,
    and illustrate PigTalk, a fog/ edge intelligent system for piglet crushing mitigation.
    The final section gives conclusions. AgriTalk-FE: the AgriTalk Architecture for
    IoT-FE Figure 2 illustrates the fog/edge AgriTalk architecture based on Fig. 1.
    The original AgriTalk was designed with a cloud-based server called AgriTalk-C
    in the network domain (Fig. 2 (3)), which directly connects the agricultural sensors/actuators
    in the device domain (Fig. 2 (1)) [10]. Figure 1. Fog/edge computing for IoT.
    Show All To offer fog/edge computing, the network domain is further partitioned
    into the fog/edge domain and the cloud domain, where the AgriTalk-FEs (individual
    farms) are deployed in the fog/edge domain (Fig. 2 (2)), and AgriTalk-C is located
    in the cloud domain. In this architecture, the low-layer communications among
    the three domains ((1) <-> (8), (1) <-> (5), (5) <-> (8) and (6) <-> (22)) can
    be Ethernet, Bluetooth, WiFi, 4G, and 5G. The high-layer APIs for these domains
    can be Restful or Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT), except that connections
    (5) <-> (8) and (6) <-> (22) use Restful API. The AgriTalk Database (DB) System
    (Fig. 2 (4)) is accessed through Object Relational Mapping (ORM). The AgriTalk-FEs
    interact with each other in two ways. They can exchange their data through the
    AgriTalk DB System or through AgriTalk-C. AgriTalk-C resides in the cloud as a
    docker container image. As an edge node in the current implementation, an AgriTalk-FE
    is installed in an industry version of Raspberry Pi 4. This section elaborates
    on AgriTalk-FE architecture for a fog/edge node. Multiple FE-Talks ((9), (10),
    (11), (13), (15), and (17) in Fig. 2) can be developed through the AgriTalk-FE
    GUI (Fig. 2 (6)), and be manipulated (e.g., parameter setups) through the FE-Talk
    GUIs (Fig. 2 (7)). Through connecting icons in the AgriTalk-FE GUI window, the
    program for an FE-Talk application is automatically created without any programming
    effort. This no-code approach allows the farmers to quickly deploy their farming
    applications. In Fig. 2, the system FE-Talks are marked green ((10), (11), (13),
    (15), and (17)) and the application FE-Talks are marked blue ((9)). Both the AgriTalk-FE
    and the FE-Talk GUIs are web based, which can be remotely accessed through any
    computing device with a browser (Fig. 3 (1)). In this GUI, a project window (Fig.
    3 (2)) allows the farmer to develop an FE-Talk. We use Figs. 2 and 3 to describe
    this development procedure. The IoT-FE device software binds an IoT device (Fig.
    2 (1)) to the AgriTalk-FE engine (Fig. 2 (8)) through several simple operations
    in the AgriTalk-FE GUI (Fig. 2 (6)), and an example of its layout is the “Project”
    window illustrated in Fig. 3 (2). AgriTalk defines a device model for real IoT
    devices with the same properties. For example, a smartphone model is mapped to
    real phones such as Apple iPhones, Samsung smart phones and so on. In the project
    window, an IoT device model is graphically represented by an icon, for example,
    “Sensors” (Fig. 3 (6)). This icon includes one or more smaller icons representing
    the “features” (individual sensors) of the device. For example, the features of
    a micro weather station (Fig. 3 (3)) include the sensors for temperature, humidity,
    electrical conductivity (EC), CO2 and so on. When we click the gear icon in the
    upper-left corner of a device icon, the physical device is bound to AgriTalk-FE
    (e.g., the (3) → (6) connection in Fig. 3). The binding mechanism is similar to
    the one for Bluetooth. We enable a sensor device to control an actuator device
    by dragging a “Join” link between them (see Joins 1–5 in Fig. 3). There is a circle
    in the middle of the link. When the circle is clicked, a function management window
    pops up (Fig. 3 (22)). We write functions in this window to manipulate the data
    passing through the link. For example, the soil EC values are collected in real
    time, and are used to train a fertilizer regulatory model for the farm. The model
    provides appropriate fertilizer solution, for example, the Nitrogen (N) to optimize
    the yield of the plant cultivation. The relationship between EC ( χ E ) and N
    ( f N ( χ E )) for a specific farm in the Bao Mountain is derived as [10] f N
    ( χ E )=63.2526 χ 2 E +14.2131 χ E +0.1797 (1) View Source Figure 2. The AgriTalk
    architecture for edge/fog computing. Show All Through this function, the values
    measured from the EC sensor are transformed into the amount of Nitrogen to drive
    the pump of the fertilizer solution through the path (3) → (6) → (8) → (7) in
    Fig. 3. This function is implemented as a Python program in the function management
    window; see Lines 3 and 4 in Fig. 3 (22). Note that AgriTalk-FE automatically
    integrates the Join functions to constitute the network program of the IoT-FE
    application, and this “Join” mechanism partially addresses Issue 2 in the fog/edge
    domain. FE-Talk is defined by the device models that can be accessed from the
    model pull-down list (Fig. 3 (5)). For example, the items in the AgriTalk model
    list include the micro weather station with the soil sensors (Fig. 3 (3)), the
    fertilizer and irrigation drippers (Fig. 3 (7)), the biopesticide sprayers and
    so on [10]. Besides the AgriTalk-FE GUI, we can design a specific GUI for FE-Talk,
    which is typically a browser that can be shown in a mobile device (Fig. 3 (4)).
    Based on the setups in this GUI, the AgriTalk-FE engine (Fig. 2 (8)) executes
    the FE-talk code (Fig. 2 (9)) to interact with the IoT devices (Fig. 2 (1)). The
    FE-Talk code is automatically created when the device connection configuration
    is complete in the Project window (Fig. 3 (2)), which addresses the automatic
    application generation part of Issue 2. Figure 3. AgriTalk-FE GUI. Show All In
    the device domain, many IoT devices are connected to the MCUs. Programming an
    MCU is a tedious task. The AgriTalk-FE engine automatically generates software
    module codes for the MCU boards including Arduino, Raspberry pi, MediaTek LinkIt,
    ROHM IoT kit and ESP8266 ESP-12F [1]. After we have deployed the standard IoT
    device software into an MCU board, a developer can easily create new applications
    with the AgriTalk-FE GUI (see the Project 1 window in Fig. 4) without the need
    of re-programming the MCU. Specifically, an MCU board (Fig. 4 (1)) can be represented
    by a device icon (Fig. 4 (3)), and its pins can be represented by the feature
    icons within the device icon (e.g., A0 in Fig. 4 (3)). If a device has both inputs
    (to send the data to the AgriTalk-FE engine; see Fig. 4 (6) in Arduino1) and outputs
    (to receive the data from the AgriTalk-FE engine; see Fig. 4 (7) and (8) in Arduino1),
    then the inputs are represented as the feature icons within an “input” device
    icon (Fig. 4 (3)), and the outputs are represented as the feature icons with-in
    an “output” device icon (Fig. 4 (4)). The input device icons are placed on the
    left side of the window, and the output device icons are placed on the right side
    of the window. In Project 1, we also use a second MCU board (Arduion2; see Fig.
    4 (2) and (5)). We build the Arduino network programs for the greenhouse fan control
    (Fig. 4 (7) → (11)) and the energy screen control (Fig. 4 (8) → (12)) as follows:
    We use drag-and-drop operations to draw lines between analog and digital pin icons
    in the AgriTalk-FE GUI, which allows quick agriculture application deployment.
    Furthermore, we can easily re-link sensors to actuators to modify Arduino applications
    without re-burning the MCU. Therefore, our solution has nicely addressed Issue
    1 in the device domain and the application generation part of Issue 2. In Project
    1, both the fan and the energy screen are automatically controlled by the heat
    sensor (Fig. 4 (6)). They are also manually controlled by the switches (Fig. 4
    (9) and (10)). With the pre-built agriculture functions, the low-code no-code
    approach of AgriTalk allows the farmers to create and maintain the fog/edge agriculture
    applications by themselves. Special FE-Talks We have developed several special
    FE-Talks to resolve Issues 2–6 for agriculture fog/edge computing. To address
    the bug detection part of Issue 2, we proposed BigraphTalk to detect any forbidden
    Join connections by using Bigraph, a universal mathematical model for representing
    the spatial configuration of physical or virtual entities and their interactions
    [11]. Our operation experience in commercial farms indicated that the farmers
    at a fog/edge site may inappropriately connect the IoT devices in the GUI. For
    example, the farmer may connect a motor to a temperature and a humidity sensors.
    The temperature and the humidity conditions may conflict with each other, which
    causes the motor to oscillate between “on” and “off” states, and eventually burn
    out. No existing solutions solved this problem automatically until we developed
    BigraphTalk. To check correctness of connections, we use bigraph to specify what
    an invalid configuration of entities looks like and check these against a given
    input model. Bigraph-Talk automates this verification process without requiring
    the developer to specify any bigraph. After static Join connection is proved correct,
    we may verify if the execution of the developed FE-Talk is correct by SimTalk
    [3] through the path (11)-(8)-(9) in Fig. 2. Specifically, after an FE-Talk is
    created, we click the “simulation” toggle button (Fig. 3 (11)). Then the SimTalk
    GUI (Fig. 2 (12)) pops up for specifying the traffic characteristics. Before physical
    sensors/controls are actually connected to the FE-Talk, SimTalk binds the feature
    icons to the simulated software modules corresponding to the real sensors/actuators,
    and set up specific traffic patterns to simulate or emulate the application. The
    simulated software modules are automatically created by SimTalk. The reader is
    referred to Fig. 5 in [3] for more details. We proposed SensorTalk (Fig. 2 (10))
    to address Issue 3 [4], [12]. The farmers often need to replace or calibrate failed/aged
    sensors. Such maintenance is labor-intensive, and the user experience is poor
    in the fog/edge environments. To address this issue, SensorTalk developed a Dash-Board
    output device model (Display-O; Fig. 3 (9)) that shows the real-time sensor values
    in a display (Fig. 3 (10)). DashBoard has a built-in calibration table to correct
    aging sensors [4]. Traditionally, aged sensors were calibrated in the laboratories
    manually or semi-automatically. Conversely, SensorTalk automatically calibrates
    the sensors under test by the standard sensors in fog/edge farming nodes directly.
    The reader is referred to Fig. 2 in [4] for more details. To address Issue 4,
    we developed DataTalk (Fig. 2 (13)) by creating the DataBank device model (with
    the features Data-O in (12) and Data-1 in (13) in Fig. 3). In this way, all AgriTalk-FEs
    can access the AgriTalk DB System (Fig. 2 (4)) and manage the database as an IoT
    device. Data-O of DataBank receives data from the sensors through (6) → (12) in
    Fig. 3. DataBank also receives data from open datasets stored in the AgriTalk
    DB system through (4) → (20) in Fig. 2. The received data may be pre-processed
    and then stored in a DataBank device for future usage. We use the rice blast detection
    [13] as an example to show how DataTalk works. The commercial farm operation indicated
    that image detection of rice blast is not practical (it is too late when you detect
    rice blast in an image). Therefore, we utilized non-image IoT devices to detect
    conditions leading to rice blast. The non-image data are the weather data (including
    the barometric pressure, the temperature and the relative humidity) obtained from
    the database of Central Weather Bureau in Taiwan and the real-time data of the
    AgriTalk sensors from the micro weather stations we established at 4 farm locations.
    We found that high spore germination rate for various fungi may cause rice blast
    disease. Therefore, it is also important to obtain information of spore germination
    rate that is affected by the temperature χ T and the relative humidity χ H . We
    designed a specific spore germination rate function for every farm field computed
    locally at its fog/edge node (an AgriTalk-FE). For example, in a Bao Mountain
    farm, the function is f T ( χ T , χ H )=0.1143×(0.27−0.0078 χ 3 T +0.28 χ 2 T
    + 1.67 χ T ) e 6.6 χ H (2) View Source Figure 4. Arduino MCU mapping for a greenhouse.
    Show All This function is derived from a bio regression model [13] and was implemented
    in a DataBank device through the DataTalk GUI (Fig. 2 (14)). In the rice blast
    AI model, three features – χ T ,  χ H , and f T ( χ T ,  χ H ) - are sent from
    DataBank (Fig. 3 (13)) to Almodule (Fig. 3 (15)). The subtle way we manipulate
    χ T , χ H and f T ( χ T ,  χ H ) significantly improves the accuracy of the rice
    blast prediction, which is 89.4 percent, the world record for non-image sensing
    [13]. Thanks to the “plug-in” module approach of AgriTalk-FE, any FE-Talk can
    be independently developed without any data preprocessing capability, and can
    easily connect to DataTalk for online database access and operation later. The
    rice blast detection was conducted at fourteen counties in Taiwan through fog/edge
    computing, where rice blast detection of a county is conducted by an AgriTalk-FE.
    To address Issue 5, we develop Altalk [6] (Fig. 2 (15)) by creating the Almodule
    device model (with the features Label-O in (14), Feature-O in (15) and Prediction-1
    in (16) in Fig. 3). Like the DataTalk approach, Almodule is manipulated as an
    IoT device. Therefore Altalk can rapidly extend existing IoT applications into
    AI-based smart applications [10]. Upon receiving the data from DataBank, Almodule
    performs feature extraction. The extraction method is selected through the Altalk
    GUI (Fig. 2 (16)), which extracts the data characteristics to form a feature vector.
    The feature vectors as well as the labels obtained from, for example, the remote
    control (Fig. 3 (17)) are used for training. We have ported scikit-learn, Tensor
    Flow, Flux, and other AI tools to Altalk, and the developer can select an appropriate
    tool for AI modeling. Through an appropriate ensemble method, the best prediction
    result is used to activate the actuators. The results are also used to improve
    the accuracy of prediction by conducting validation that provides better hyper-parameter
    setups for Almodule. Through the path (16) → (9) → (10) in Fig. 3, useful statistics
    are displayed for the developer to adjust the machine learning model. Like DataTalk,
    every FE-Talk can be independently developed without AI, and can easily connect
    to Altalk for online AI training and inference later. Figure 5. Maptalk and the
    fog/edge applications. Show All AgriTalk-C: Integration of Cloud and Fog/Edge
    Domains If fog/edge computing involves multiple countries, then Issue 6 (data
    privacy) is a major concern. For example, the current AgriTalk operation includes
    the sites (AgriTalk-FEs) in several countries. These AgriTalk-FEs are managed
    under AgriTalk-C in Chunghwa Telecom''s cloud in Taiwan. Our operation faces the
    problem that the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPRs) are not the same
    for every country. To fit an IoT-FE application to different GDPRs, existing approaches
    require significant efforts to modify the IoT-FE application. To address Issue
    6, the data privacy requirement of an FE-Talk in AgriTalk-FE is set in the Authentication,
    Authorization and Accounting (AAA) subsystem (Fig. 2 (17)) without changing the
    code of the FE-Talk application. Specifically, every IoT message delivered in
    a Join link has a privacy tag to indicate the privacy level of the delivered data.
    A smart application may need to set different privacy levels according to different
    users'' authorization for hiding information in IoT messages. In smart farming,
    a control message sent from a smartphone with a low privacy level cannot trigger
    the irrigation pump. According to the GDPRs of different countries, Personally
    Identifiable Information (PII) and user behavior history should be protected,
    which can be achieved by the AAA subsystem. The details of the tag mechanism are
    out of the scope of this article and the details can be found in [10]. The AgriTalk-C
    server has the same structure as an AgriTalk-FE. All farmer accounts can be managed
    in the AgriTalk-C AAA (Fig. 2 (18)) with single sign-on, where the farmer''s access
    right to a specific AgriTalk-FE is granted through the path (18) → (5) → (8) →
    (17) in Fig. 2. Therefore, the farms in different countries are supported by their
    AgriTalk-FEs with different GDPRs, and these AgriTalk-FEs are monitored by AgriTalk-C
    at the same time. The AgriTalk-C engine controls an AgriTalk-FE through the path
    (5) → (8) in real-time following the same protocol as that for the control path
    to an IoT device ((5) → (1) in Fig. 2). Before an edge/fog node (a new AgriTalk-FE)
    is allowed to join AgriTalk, SimTalk of AgriTalk-C conducts validation and performance
    tests on the AgriTalk-FE through the path (19) → (5) → (8) → (9) in Fig. 2. The
    DataTalk subsystems of individual AgriTalk-FEs (Fig. 2 (13)) and AgriTalk-C (Fig.
    2 (20)) interact with each other indirectly through the database operations on
    the AgriTalk DB System (Fig. 2 (4)). If an AI model is used in an FE-Talk, the
    AI model can be trained in the cloud (AgriTalk-C) and AI inference is performed
    in the edge/fog node (AgriTalk-FE). AgriTalk-C sends model parameters to an AI
    execution engine already installed on the AgriTalk-FEs. The training datasets
    may be generated by the FE-Talk and saved in the AgriTalk DB System. The data
    path for AI training is (4) → (20) → (5) → (21) in Fig. 2. The trained model is
    sent to the AgriTalk-FE through the path (21) → (5) → (8) → (15). Then AI inference
    is performed at the edge/fog node through the path (9) → (8) → (13) → (8) → (15)
    → (8) → (9). Integrated Operations Center (IOC): MapTalk The fog/edge nodes in
    a distributed farming system should be managed in an organized way so that the
    farm owners can conveniently access the applications. In AgriTalk-C, we have developed
    an IOC called MapTalk (Fig. 2 (22) and (23)) based on Google Maps. MapTalk is
    an application FE-Talk. Compared with a traditional IOC [14], the MapTalk user
    can transparently add the IoT devices to the IOC without any programming effort
    while a traditional IOC requires a professional system integrator to modify the
    IOC software. MapTalk shows the location and the status of every farming device
    and allows a farmer to interact with these devices through their cyber representations
    on the map. MapTalk can be displayed in a big screen like traditional IOCs. Furthermore,
    one can also access MapTalk from everywhere through any computing device with
    a browser. The GUIs of all AgriTalk-FEs are managed by MapTalk and can be accessed
    through the “App” pull-down list in the MapTalk GUI, where the layout is illustrated
    in Fig. 5 (1). When the user selects an application item, for example, “CO2” of
    the farms managed as fog/edge nodes (Fig. 5 (2)), the status of every CO2 sensor
    is shown on the map. The IoT devices in MapTalk can be stationary or movable.
    The icon of a stationary IoT device is placed at the map according to its GPS
    coordinates. The stationary examples are “PM2.5” (Fig. 5 (4)), “Germany Power
    Plants” (Fig. 5 (5)) and “Taiwan Farms” (Fig. 5 (6)). The icon of a movable IoT
    device is dynamically placed at its current position of the map. An example is
    the “Bus” application (Fig. 5 (7)) that shows the status of an individual bus
    or all buses. Fig. 5 (8) is “Bus 2” with a pink tail representing its one-hour
    trajectory. The “Bus” application can be transparently reused by AgriTalk to manage
    the cultivators and the tractors in the farms. There are two types of stationary
    applications: map-type and hybrid-type. “PM2.5” and “Germany Power Plants” are
    map-type applications. When we select “Germany Power Plants” from the App list,
    a map for this application pops up with a dedicated function bar to select various
    sensors, such as generated power, wind speed, temperature, and humidity of a power
    plant (Fig. 5 (5)). We are reusing “Germany Power Plants” to implement AgriTalk-FEs
    for agro-photovoltaics applications. “Taiwan Farms” is a hybrid-type application.
    When this application is selected from the App list, all farm icons are shown
    on the map. When we click a farm icon (Fig. 5 (9)), a dialog box (Fig. 5 (10))
    pops up. From this dialog box, we may select specific hyperlinks to see the sensor
    dashboard and the farm control board (including video; see Fig. 5 (11)). Examples
    of dashboard/control board are given in Fig. 3 (10), (18), (21) and Fig. 6. The
    name of the person who maintains this application is also listed (in Chinese;
    see Fig. 5 (12)). Adding an IoT-FE application to MapTalk is achieved through
    the MapTalk project created from the GUI of AgriTalk-C (Fig. 2 (24)), which shows
    the locations of the IoT devices in the digital map (through Display-O in Fig.
    3 (9)). To add a map-type application, we create a “Sensors” device (for example,
    “Germany power plants”; see Fig. 3 (6)) in the MapTalk project, and connect them
    through the path (23) → (22) → (5) → (8) → (9) in Fig. 2. We use the “Routing-with-obstacles”
    application to illustrate how multiple IoT-FE applications (path routing, PM2.5
    and CO2 applications) can interact with each other to create new functions through
    MapTalk. When we select the “Routing” application, MapTalk suggests a driving
    route from the starting point to the endpoint (Fig. 5 (3)). If we select “PM2.5”
    as obstacle, then MapTalk suggests another route to avoid passing through the
    PM2.5 pollution areas (Fig. 5 (4)). We are reusing this routing application to
    implement an AgriTalk-FE that guides automatic tractor movement in irregular-shaped
    farm fields with obstacles. MapTalk was originally designed for managing general
    smart applications. Some of these applications such as “Bus,” “Germany Power Plants”
    and “Routing-with-obstacles” are being reused in AgriTalk-FE without any code
    modification. MapTalk provides a low-code no-code approach to manage the fog/edge
    nodes in an IOC. Pigtalk as a Fog/Edge Computing Example Through the AgriTalk-FE
    platform, we have built more than 20 FE-Talks applications. As a controlling-IoT
    example of fog/edge computing, this section describes PigTalk, an intelligent
    system for piglet crushing mitigation. Figure 6. Pig talk control board accessed
    through maptalk. Show All Many piglets die on pig farms because they are crushed
    when sows roll sideways or lie down. PigTalk was proposed to resolve the piglet
    mortality issue [15], which uses a DataBank device to transform the voice data
    into audio clips. These audio clips serve as the input of the Convolutional Neural
    Network (CNN) model. Through real-time analysis of the voice data collected in
    a farrowing house from a directional microphone (Fig. 6 (1)), PigTalk detects
    if any piglet screaming occurs, and automatically activates sow-alert actuators
    such as heating light (Fig. 6 (2)) for emergency handling of the crushing event
    (light heating effectively forces the sow to stand up). The whole process is remotely
    monitored by the hog farmer through the camera in the farrowing house (Fig. 6
    (3)). The PigTalk configuration can reuse the “Project” configuration in Fig.
    3 where the micro weather station (Fig. 3 (3)) is replaced by the microphone,
    the irrigation system (Fig. 3 (7)) is replaced by the heating light, and the farm
    camera (Fig. 3 (20)) is replaced by the camera in the farrowing house. The raw
    voice data received from the microphone (Sensor-I in Fig. 3 (6)) are sent to DataBank
    (Fig. 3 (12)) to produce the audio clips. These audio clips are further modified
    by min-max scaling in feature extraction. Then the CNN model is used as the machine
    learning algorithm (Fig. 3 (15)). Finally, the k-fold cross validation is conducted
    to validate the model, and the predicted result is used to determine if the heating
    light (Fig. 3 (8)) should be activated. Through fog/edge computing, PigTalk can
    save piglets from being crushed within 0.05 seconds with a 99.93 percent success
    rate. The PigTalk system consists of several farrowing houses, each of which is
    an AgriTalk-FE (called PigTalk-FE). In a PigTalk-FE, the control path for piglet
    crushing avoidance is (6) → (12) → (13) → (15) → (16) → (8) in Fig. 3, where the
    control message is delivered locally through Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line
    (ADSL) with the delay tA. A PigTalk-FE communicates with the PigTalk AgriTalk-C
    (called PigTalk-C) through the 4G technology. With the AgriTalk-FE GUIs accessed
    from MapTalk of PigTalk-C, we remotely observe pig activities of all farrowing
    houses within the delay tG. The delay tG in the cloud domain is about twice the
    delay t A in the fog/edge domain for other AgriTalk applications. In cloud computing,
    t A = t G . It is clear that t G is much larger than t A , and piglet crushing
    avoidance should be implemented locally as fog/edge computing instead of cloud
    computing. We enhanced the scream detection accuracy of the existing best solutions
    (up to 92.8 percent). With data pre-processing and subtle parameter setups of
    the CNN model, the piglet scream detection accuracy of PigTalk is up to 99.4 percent.
    Through fog/edge computing, PigTalk can save piglets from being crushed within
    0.05 seconds with a 99.93 percent success rate. Conclusion This article proposed
    the fog/edge approach for AgriTalk, an IoT application development platform for
    smart agriculture. By integrating cloud with edge/fog, we described how AgriTalk
    addresses six issues including device domain development, application generation
    and verification, sensor failure detection and calibration, big data management,
    AI provisioning, and data privacy. We showed how AgriTalk integrates its fog/edge
    applications called FE-Talks, and used rice blast detection and piglet crushing
    avoidance as two examples to indicate that fog/edge computing is a much better
    solution than cloud computing, where the delays can be reduced by 50 percent.
    In our solution, the non-agriculture applications in MapTalk can be transparently
    translated into smart agriculture applications. The examples include the cultivators
    and the tractors management, and agro-photovoltaics applications. Through the
    low-code no-code approach, AgriTalk and MapTalk allow the farmers to create and
    maintain FE-Talks by themselves in the fog/edge computing environment. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

    reality; cyber-physical systems 1. Introduction Digital Twins (DTs) have successfully
    entered industrial applications, including aerospace, manufacturing, and healthcare
    [1,2,3]. Smart farming, on the other hand, which employs the latest technological
    innovations to optimize crop production, is revolutionizing the agriculture industry.
    As virtual replicas of physical objects or systems, DTs represent a highly promising
    advancement in this field [4]. In smart farming, digital twins enable agriculture
    experts, researchers, and farmers to simulate various scenarios, test different
    strategies, and predict outcomes accurately. DTs in smart farming offer transformative
    possibilities, revolutionizing crop cultivation and management while enabling
    optimization of resource utilization, minimizing environmental footprint, and
    enhancing crop yields for a sustainable and efficient agricultural ecosystem.
    However, despite the significant promise of digital twins in smart farming, many
    questions and challenges still need to be addressed. Farming, a traditionally
    labor-intensive sector, after its transformation to a technology-intensive sector
    in the last decade, has become more complex and technologically advanced in recent
    years, moving toward innovative technologies, particularly with the explosion
    of precision agriculture and other digital technologies [5]. These technologies
    help farmers make more informed decisions about crop management, soil health,
    and various factors influencing crop yields and economic viability, enhancing
    overall agricultural productivity and profitability. However, these technologies
    can also require specialized knowledge and skills and significant investment in
    hardware, software, and other infrastructural resources. Additionally, factors
    such as climate change, changing consumer preferences, and market fluctuations
    can add to the complexity of modern farming. While these challenges can make farming
    more complicated, they also offer opportunities for innovation and growth in the
    agriculture domain. In this era of smart farming, the incorporation of cutting-edge
    technologies such as computing, communication, personal and cloud computing, the
    Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Cyber-Physical Systems
    (CPS) has revolutionized the landscape in agriculture. These technologies bring
    additional capabilities beyond the physical realm, allowing for enhanced information
    and an improved understanding of the physical structures involved. The concept
    of DTs plays a pivotal role in providing comprehensive and accurate information
    about physical systems, surpassing the limitations of traditional modelling and
    simulation approaches. By leveraging real-time data collection, processing, and
    analysis, DTs offer a digital representation of physical systems, enabling precise
    monitoring and forecasting of current and future system states and rebuilding
    existing models and re-design systems and procedures. These advancements are instrumental
    in transforming smart systems and addressing the evolving challenges in the agricultural
    domain. This review paper offers a comprehensive and distinctive outline of the
    recent research results regarding DTs in the context of smart agriculture, highlighting
    key findings and identifying areas for future research. Specifically, we report
    and discuss the various types of digital twins used in smart farming, such as
    crop, weather, and soil models, and explore how they optimize crop production.
    We also examine the challenges and limitations of deploying DTs in smart farming
    related to data management, model accuracy, and scalability. By providing a comprehensive
    review of the literature on DTs in smart farming, this paper aims to advance the
    understanding of this rapidly evolving field, illustrate the gaps in existing
    deployments, and identify opportunities for future research and innovation. We
    proceeded with our research by pursuing the formulation of the DT implementation
    architecture regarding the smart agriculture domain while emphasizing the critical
    components taking part in implementing DTs. A comparative accumulation of such
    implementations and critical components in three tables, while addressing technical
    aspects, led to significant conclusions regarding DT implementations and related
    limitations that seem beneficial to investigate. For example, although the necessity
    of a DT model and practical implementations in agriculture is addressed in most
    reviewed papers mentioning the concept and definition, the DT model is proposed
    merely as an evolving concept lacking substantial support from implemented case
    studies. While the DTs seem continuously evolving, authors refer to simulation
    models merely as proposals for future practical implementation. Our research seeks
    to expand the scope of Agriculture 4.0 that necessitates DTs and address the limitations
    of IoT-implemented solutions narrowed down by mere telemetry implementations.
    The structure of this study proceeds as follows: Section 2 delves into the concept
    of DTs and investigates their usage in the realm of smart farming. Section 3 addresses
    the challenges and confronting measures regarding DT building components and relevant
    technologies. In Section 4, DT applications in the agricultural domain are reviewed,
    while conclusions and comments are unfolded in the Discussion in Section 5. Finally,
    in Section 6, future directions for research and development are outlined respectively.
    2. The Definition of Digital Twins The fundamental concept of a DT, which involves
    a connected virtual representation of a physical object or system [6], appears
    to be relatively straightforward. However, its application and implementation
    can differ significantly across various domains and industries. Although it is
    quite clear that in addition to their core purpose of modelling real-world systems,
    DTs are designed to empower individuals to make informed business decisions with
    tangible impacts on the physical realm, a clear definition of the DT concept may
    be helpful to distinguish it from related concepts such as simulation, modelling,
    and data analytics. By defining its scope, characteristics, and capabilities,
    researchers and practitioners can better identify the specific features and requirements
    that make a system a true DT. 2.1. Definition of Digital Twins—What Does Digital
    Twins Term Stand For? The definition of DTs emerged in the early 2000s by Michael
    Grieves [6] while evolving to a widely acceptable DT concept model where they
    act as a bridge connecting physical entities in the real world with their virtual
    complements in a digital environment, closing the gap between the two. They establish
    vital connections between data and information to seamlessly integrate these products’
    virtual and real aspects [6,7]. The convergence of virtual and physical entities
    in a virtual space and the real world lays the foundation for creating a fundamental
    DT model. By fostering dynamic interplay between these tangible and virtual elements,
    the DT is a powerful representation of the combined physical-virtual system. Mashaly
    M. in [8] outlines that DTs act as digital replicas of physical systems and are
    organized by establishing data connections. This transformation enables physical
    systems to exist virtually while ensuring a strong synchronization between their
    physical and digital counterparts. As a result, smooth interactions and data exchange
    occur between the two domains. The integration of the physical and virtual domains
    provides valuable insights, predictive abilities, and the potential for optimizing
    system performance following the pattern illustrated in Figure 1. Figure 1. The
    generic representation of a DT scheme’s dynamic integration of physical and digital
    domains. According to Dyck G. et al. [9], the concept of DTs emerged from NASA’s
    pioneering work in integrating physical models and simulations [10,11] to analyze
    intricate systems. Originally confined to the aerospace sector, the scope of DTs
    expanded to encompass product lifecycle management across diverse industries.
    At its core, as initially proposed by Grieves & Vickers [6,7,12], a DT comprises
    a physical object, its corresponding digital representation, and the interconnectedness
    between the two that it is established for both ways. Ongoing research continues
    to explore the wide-ranging applications and integration as interfaces of the
    DTs in areas such as cloud manufacturing, IoT, and Industry 4.0, where explicitly
    stated that the provided response is a unique formulation based on the given information
    [13,14]. Hence, DTs serve as virtual counterparts of real-world entities, created
    using sensor data and serving as dynamic representations of physical objects or
    systems throughout various stages of their lifecycle. By harnessing the power
    of simulation and data integration, DTs provide a comprehensive virtual environment
    that mirrors the characteristics and behaviour of their physical counterparts.
    This enables continuous real-time monitoring, analysis, and enhancement of the
    physical objects or systems, resulting in enhanced performance, efficiency, and
    informed decision-making, as stated by Saddik et al. in 2018 [1]. DTs utilize
    actual data from real-life situations, machine learning (ML) models, and simulation
    combined with data analysis to enhance comprehension, learning, and decision-making
    processes. They enable the monitoring and control of various entities, including
    devices, machines, vehicles, and individuals. The proliferation of the IoT has
    spurred the advancement of diverse DT solutions across diverse domains and use
    cases supporting simulation, optimization, and prediction. Thus, major improvement
    steps have been taken in the realm of decision-making so that various sectors,
    including manufacturing, healthcare, and smart cities, have witnessed significant
    advancements facilitated by diverse technologies like simulation software, IoT,
    and AI utilized in the field of modelling and simulation [4,13,15,16]. To simulate
    and model the physical system to succeed in implementing the DTs, the use of mathematical
    models is mandatory [17]. Once the observed physical phenomena of interest are
    captured, foundational mathematical equations are formulated to depict and characterize
    the dynamics of these phenomena accurately. By constructing these mathematical
    models, researchers and scientists can effectively represent and analyze the behavior
    and relationships inherent in the observed physical phenomena. The models that
    are developed need to be validated by experimental stages on the field or in laboratory
    setups to verify the physical behavior of the problem under consideration soundly.
    Therefore, in advanced DTs, a predominant trend is the utilization of extensive
    datasets to establish data-driven models. This approach operates under the assumption
    that the data obtained from the system serves as a powerful source of insight,
    offering profound revelations about its physical behavior. As a result, these
    well-refined DTs leverage the abundance of data to construct accurate and thorough
    models that faithfully capture the intricacies of the system’s behavior [18].
    The interaction of data between the physical entity and its digital representation
    in a DT is visually depicted in Figure 2. Figure 2. A simplified view of the data
    interaction between the physical entity and its digital representation in a DT.
    By using AI tools, such as ML algorithms or artificial neural networks, or while
    utilizing data processing, the system’s behavior against events may be predicted.
    Actions be anticipated once the digital part of the DT functions in parallel with
    the physical part allowing, of course, the user’s influence in the system at any
    time. Although the concept and definition of DT seem to be constantly evolving,
    we may imply that the DT of a physical process or object typically consists of
    a specific collection of models, materialized digitally or virtually by computers
    and associated services and processes. These models and services are designed
    in a format that allows seamless integration with automated systems to fulfil
    functions such as object management, modelling, and future behaviour forecasting
    [19]. A simplified sequence chart representation of the interactions and components
    involved in a DT system is depicted in Figure 3, where the physical object represents
    the actual object or system being monitored and controlled. The DT is the virtual
    representation of the Physical Object (PO), where data is processed and analyzed.
    The PO offers data aggregated from sensors to the DT, which then forwards the
    data to the Analytics component for processing. The Analytics component provides
    analysis results back to the DT. The DT sends these analysis results to the Decision
    Maker, who makes decisions relying on the received information. The DT then sends
    optimized actions to the Actions component. Finally, the Actions component implements
    the optimized actions in the PO. Figure 3. Interactions sequence chart between
    Digital Twin components. Considering the latest developments in digital twin technology,
    there is growing interest in an expanded and enhanced version known as the Cognitive
    Digital Twin (CDT) or Cognitive Twin (CT). According to a recent study [20], the
    integration of advanced semantic modelling technologies with DTs enhances their
    cognitive capabilities, indicating a promising trend in their evolution. These
    advanced versions of DTs exhibit human-like intelligent capabilities, including
    attention, cognition, understanding, retention, logical thinking, prediction,
    decision-making, and problem-solving. They undergo continuous development alongside
    the actual system throughout its complete lifecycle. CDTs provide substantial
    advantages to intricate product systems and processes, which involve multiple
    subsystems and interested parties from diverse disciplines throughout different
    stages of the life span. According to the literature review [21], which addresses
    the CDT model to enable Smart Product-Services Systems by implementing data-driven
    business models, CDT represents a promising advancement in DTs, introducing intelligent
    and cognitive capabilities. It even represents real-life examples of companies,
    including those in the food processing industry, that are currently leveraging
    the cognitive capabilities provided by digital twin technologies offered by edge
    companies. The authors undertaking the task strive to exhibit the potential of
    utilizing this emerging technology by businesses and the creation of data-driven
    business models. To improve data compatibility and develop cognitive abilities,
    CDT models often incorporate diverse and varied data, information, and knowledge,
    leading to challenges in aligning these elements across different DTs and stakeholders.
    Adopting semantic technologies such as ontologies and knowledge graphs is crucial
    to address this issue, as they offer promising solutions for achieving greater
    alignment and interoperability. Cloud computing [13] has emerged as a critical
    solution for the complex task of processing vast amounts of data in various sectors,
    particularly in conjunction with the advent of the Industrial IoT (IIoT). The
    IIoT, a subset of the IoT specifically designed for industrial applications, involves
    deploying numerous smart devices within industrial systems to enable real-time
    data processing after collection and sensing. Given the nature of industrial environments,
    IIoT systems demand enhanced levels of secure and robust communication to ensure
    optimal production performance [22]. IIoT applications that connect machines,
    sensors, and actuators like data collected from agriculture stakeholders to be
    combined for effective decision-making and analysis of future trends occasionally
    produce a large volume of non-uniform data that needs to be processed in real-time.
    IoT gateways that provide connectivity between one or more field devices and a
    service cloud offer accessibility to previously hidden data from sensors, embedded
    controllers and IO devices and analyze such data for multiple purposes, such as
    remote monitoring, preventive maintenance, production optimization and building
    automation. IoT gateways are critical to ensure data security and communication
    security within the IIoT systems. A data breach in such IIoT systems could compromise
    agricultural production, i.e., crop health degradation, transport and product
    processing, leading to inferior production performance [23]. The exponential growth
    of IIoT and its associated technologies has significantly contributed to the advancement
    of Industry 4.0 and intelligent manufacturing, forming the underlying framework
    for CDT. The substantial amount of data induced by IIoT devices play a vital role
    in facilitating the development of data-centric services as a crucial element.
    While the concept of CDT continues to evolve rapidly, it is imperative to address
    outstanding concerns surrounding the technology to unlock its full potential and
    achieve its envisioned advantages. CDT systems integrate data from different stakeholders
    as they combine several parameters, mainly concerning immense amounts of data
    sharing, demanding measures to ensure security, privacy, and protection of intellectual
    property (IP) concerning data. CDTs incorporate cybersecurity infrastructure and
    employ data encryption mechanisms to address these critical aspects effectively.
    These measures are implemented to regulate transparency in CDTs, ensure the protection
    of intellectual property (IP), and facilitate integrated development processes
    [8,24]. Similarly, the notion of DT systems emerges as a virtual representation
    of an enterprise, encompassing its resources, processes, workforce, locations,
    and systems to support strategic decision-making from the systems used for reporting
    operational data within the organization, such as accounting, personnel planning,
    and sales [25]. This type of DT which retrieves real-time data from the systems
    used for reporting operational data within an organization, as mentioned earlier,
    is referred to as a Strategic DT (SDT), in contrast to the industrial DT that
    gathers information from sensors, serving as a knowledge visualization tool that
    allows managers to explore various strategies while minimizing space and time
    constraints. By simulating different strategic options through computer models,
    managers can gain insights into the potential outcomes of their chosen approaches
    in the real world. 2.2. DTs in Agriculture As stated above, the implementation
    of DTs seems to extend to various fields vastly. The objective of this review
    is to illuminate the field of agriculture in the following manner. A DT for agriculture,
    in particular, may be addressed as a virtual model of a physical farm or agricultural
    operation constructed utilizing cutting-edge technologies like sensors, IoT devices,
    and cloud computing. Farmers can utilize the DT to simulate and enhance their
    farming methods within a virtual setting, enabling them to refine their practices
    before applying them in reality [26,27]. Pylianidis et al. [27] conducted an in-depth
    report on DTs in agriculture, encompassing 28 case studies and organizing the
    key value-added features of DTs in agricultural applications. The authors highlight
    the capacity of DT usage in agriculture, adjusting to ever-evolving circumstances,
    capturing, and interpreting data, autonomously managing system actuators in the
    field, and delivering customized services to individuals, such as reports and
    transparent information. The DT enables capturing real-time data on crop growth
    rates, weather conditions, ambient temperatures, and even soil moisture levels
    as various environmental and operational factors. A dynamic model of the farm
    may be created by using this data to test different scenarios and optimize various
    aspects of the farming operation, including crop yields, resource utilization,
    and overall efficiency. By creating a DT, farmers can better understand how their
    farming practices impact the environment and identify ways to reduce waste and
    improve sustainability. They can also use the DT to test new technologies and
    techniques, such as precision agriculture and automation, before investing in
    them for their physical operation. Instances of DTs in the agricultural sector
    spanning across various domains find applications in diverse areas such as crop
    cultivation, dairy production, greenhouse horticulture, organic vegetable farming,
    plant disease analysis, livestock management, food supply chain optimization,
    as well as farm machinery and building management, including fleet monitoring
    and control [9]. The schematic in Figure 4 provides a basic representation regarding
    the application of DTs in agriculture, showcasing the interaction between the
    physical farm, sensors, data processing, analysis, decision-making, and actuation
    contributing to the physical entity according to real data and data management
    derived from the DT. All physical entities are green, including the sensors that
    aggregate signals from the area of interest and the actuators that provide actions
    in the field. All blue-colored sections constitute the digital space. Figure 4.
    A schematic presentation of a DT concept scheme integration in Agriculture. Overall,
    digital twins offer a powerful tool for farmers to optimize their farming practices
    and improve the efficiency and sustainability of their operations. Through the
    rapid advancement of technology and sensor capabilities, the DT of agricultural
    soil can revolutionize plant productivity, health, and yield even to optimize
    water usage, minimize chemical inputs, and enhance overall sustainability in agricultural
    practices merely by emphasizing the soil’s characteristics and attributes. The
    continuous monitoring and analysis of environmental parameters, soil elements,
    and irrigation practices in agricultural land can be effectively achieved by incorporating
    machine learning models, big data analytics, and decision support systems into
    the DT framework [28]. By simulating soil structure and combining soil and irrigation
    DTs, crop farming performance can be enhanced. Farmers can effectively observe
    and evaluate alterations in agricultural land, impacting soil, irrigation, and
    crop yield. IoT technology provides real-time data and visual representations
    for informed decision-making [29]. The overall efficiency of crop production can
    be improved by reducing costs associated with fuel, fertilizers, labor, and factors
    affecting production efficiency and sustainability merely by utilizing DTs in
    crop production technologies along with the use of Digital Information and Communication
    Technology (ICT) tools, referring to agricultural pieces of machinery, such as
    tractors, combined harvesters, fertilizers, and sprayers. According to Dyck G
    et al. [9], the DTs seem to find their way in post-harvest processes, encompassing
    the various stages involved in handling agricultural products after harvesting.
    These products must be dried, cooled, transported, stored, and undergo marketing
    procedures. Digital farming methods provide advantages in post-harvest procedures,
    such as minimizing losses, optimizing food processing, improving storage conditions,
    streamlining transportation, and enhancing marketing efficiency. These strategies
    facilitate the live tracking of the agricultural and food supply network, leading
    to increased robustness, resilience and reduced food waste and losses. IoT technology
    following the digitalization prospect of agriculture plays a crucial role in transforming
    traditional agriculture into a more efficient and sustainable practice. IoT contextual
    data enables users to interact seamlessly with their surroundings and remote locations
    through their digital twin, fostering enhanced connectivity and user experiences
    [1]. Facts such as precision agriculture that enables farmers to gather real-time
    data on a range of environmental and operational factors, predictive modelling
    by using both historical and real-time data so that they can generate a dynamic
    virtual representation of their agricultural operation, sustainability, and automation
    to identify ways to reduce waste and improve sustainability in farming operations
    [30] in accordance to real-time data, focus on addressing critical IoT needs such
    as two-way communication, comprehensive security measures, localization, and mobility
    services to optimize its efficiency and effectiveness [31]. In addition, DTs seem
    to pose a significant role in animal farming or precision livestock farming by
    enhancing productivity, animal welfare, and overall farm management. They can
    be used to create virtual representations of individual animals, groups of animals,
    or entire livestock production systems [32], to model and predict animal behavior,
    growth, and health, allowing farmers to optimize feeding strategies, detect early
    signs of disease or distress, and improve overall animal welfare. Through data-driven
    insights and predictive analytics, farmers can make informed decisions regarding
    nutrition, breeding, and healthcare interventions. By incorporating up-to-the-minute
    information gathered from diverse sources, including sensors, monitoring devices,
    and agricultural management systems, DTs enable farmers to monitor, simulate,
    and analyze animal behavior, health, and performance. Neethirajan S. [33] presents
    a DT processing pipeline with sensors to classify and estimate livestock’s emotional
    state and behavior. Various means of communication, including vocalizations, body
    movements, facial expressions, and posture, contribute to animals expressing their
    emotional state. The review presents novel approaches for gathering extensive
    real-time data regarding the emotions of farm livestock by implementing a sensor
    data processing pipeline within the DT model. This pipeline involves preliminary
    data processing, modelling, and simulation phases, ultimately resulting in reporting
    and predicting the emotional states of cattle based on their tail movements, facial
    expressions, and body posture. Traditional methods involving blood sampling or
    surveys, for assessing the emotional states of livestock usually cause interruptions
    to farming processes while being time-consuming, and farm animals frequently experience
    fear, frustration, and distress. AI technologies facilitate the recognition of
    cattle states, empowering animal caregivers and ethologists to understand animal
    behavior and optimize their well-being and productivity. DTs may support decision-making
    and farm management optimization by simulating different scenarios regarding environmental
    conditions or genetic factors on animal performance and production outcomes while
    improving production efficiency and minimizing environmental impacts. Furthermore,
    connections with other digital platforms, such as farm management systems, supply
    chain networks, and veterinary databases, allowing for seamless data sharing and
    analysis is feasible with DT, thus enhancing traceability, quality assurance,
    and decision-making throughout the value chain. In summary, digital twins have
    the potential to revolutionize animal farming by providing real-time monitoring,
    predictive analytics, and decision support. They can optimize animal health, welfare,
    and production efficiency while promoting sustainable farming practices. Continued
    research and development in this area will be crucial to fully harness the benefits
    of DTs in animal farming and address the associated challenges. An Aquaculture
    4.0 architecture of a digital twin-based intelligent fish farm management system
    for precision aquaculture is discussed in [34], addressing the design considerations,
    data integration, analytics, and control mechanisms to optimize fish farm operations.
    The proposed implementation utilizes a cloud-based DT technology employing ML
    realizations, computer vision, and other sensor devices, and AI-based IoT (AIoT)
    to monitor and control automated aquaculture machinery. By optimizing farm production
    in various environments throughout the different stages of fish farming, the system
    aims to maximize efficiency and productivity. Water quality sensors utilized in
    fishponds to monitor and analyze the condition of the water and in offshore sea
    cages, and RGB or sonar camera devices may collect environmental data and data
    related to fish populations to establish data-driven prediction models. On the
    other hand, land-based monitoring systems send appropriate commands to activate
    surveillance sensors, thus enabling fish-feeding behavior monitoring, disease
    spread, and fish population growth. Furthermore, DTs address optimization solutions
    regarding water flow and treatment processes related to water quality reduction
    following floods and stormwater within transboundary water security projects due
    to urban expansion [17]. DT models are employed to monitor the quality of urban
    water by integrating physical entities and utilizing sensors in urban drainage
    systems. The models consider natural processes related to soil, vegetation, clogging,
    and biological activity in water treatment. This approach enables comprehensive
    monitoring and analysis of urban water systems for effective management and maintenance.
    3. Reviewing Relevant Technologies and DT Components Although the implementation
    of DTs in agriculture can vary in complexity and scope based on the specific architecture
    of the DT scheme, in Figure 5, a representative architectural framework for implementing
    DTs in agriculture is illustrated. The basic components and interactions of DTs
    in agriculture are displayed where the physical farm is represented by the node
    labelled “Physical Farm”. Sensor data collected from the farm is depicted by the
    node labelled “Sensor Data”. The sensor data undergoes data preprocessing in the
    node labelled “Data Preprocessing”. Figure 5. The Architectural Framework for
    Implementing DTs in Agriculture. The preprocessed data is subsequently employed
    to construct a DT model, represented by the node labelled “Digital Twin Model”.
    This enables various functionalities, including simulation and optimization, represented
    by the nodes labelled “Simulation” and “Optimization”. It also incorporates data
    analytics, represented by the node labelled “Data Analytics”. The decision support
    system provides action recommendations, represented by the “Action Recommendations”
    node. The insights are depicted from the node “Insights”, and all visualization
    and monitoring data are derived from the node labelled “Decision Support”. The
    visualization of data is depicted by the node labelled “Visualization” which aids
    in monitoring the farm. We should point out that effective monitoring plays a
    crucial role in maintaining situational awareness and facilitating timely response
    or intervention as needed. That is represented in the figure by the node “Monitoring”.
    The significant active role of the stakeholders that manage the making and implementing
    of the decisions involved in organizing and operating an agriculture establishment
    is displayed by the node “Farming Practice and Experience”, besides the optimization
    provided by the DT concept. The action recommendations are implemented through
    actuators and control systems, represented by the node labelled “Actuators and
    Control”, which can affect the physical farm. The last node in Figure 5 and the
    physical farm are in green, specifying the physical space in contrast to the digital
    space nodes in blue. The loop from the “Actuators and Control” node back to the
    “Physical Farm” node symbolizes the ongoing feedback loop between the physical
    farm and its DT, where actions taken based on the DT’s insights impact the physical
    farm, and the sensors capture the resulting changes to update the DT model. This
    schematic in Figure 5 highlights the key components and interactions of digital
    twins in agriculture, showcasing their role in data collection, preprocessing,
    modelling, simulation, analytics, decision support, visualization, and control,
    ultimately aiding in optimizing farm operations and improving decision-making
    processes. Furthermore, the interconnections among these entities play a vital
    role as they are essential for the functioning of the DT system in an integrated
    manner, as emphasized by Pedersen et al. in their research [17]. 3.1. Technologies
    Involved in DTs Therefore, realizing DTs in real-time is characterized by several
    defining keys that have emerged along with key technologies [1] from various domains,
    industries, and scientific disciplines that pose a decisive entity, such as the
    following. 3.1.1. Augmented, Virtual, and Mixed-Reality DTs rely on Augmented
    (AR), Virtual (VR), and Mixed-Reality (MR) technologies. As an example, they can
    be created using three-dimensional (3D) technologies and presented as holograms
    or experienced through AR/VR/MR devices [35], such as the Microsoft HoloLens.
    Using sensors installed in the field, their real-time digital twin can be generated
    and projected as a hologram in remote locations. This enables individuals in different
    locations to engage in interactions that simulate being physically present in
    the same space. Communication enhancement in digital twins is derived by integrating
    tactile feedback, simulating the sensation of physical interaction via haptics.
    Furthermore, DTs can leverage humanoid and soft robotics technologies to enable
    physical actions on behalf of their real-life counterparts. This means digital
    twins can physically engage with the environment or perform tasks, utilizing robotic
    systems that mimic human-like or flexible movements. These advancements in augmented,
    virtual, mixed reality, haptics, and robotics greatly enhance the capabilities
    of digital twins, enabling immersive interactions, realistic sensations, and physical
    engagement, expanding the possibilities for communication and collaboration. 3.1.2.
    Artificial Intelligence Artificial Intelligence (AI) integration into physical
    assets that lack it inherently is a key advantage of DTs. This introduces a specialized
    intelligence capable of efficiently comprehending vast amounts of numerical data
    and deriving domain-specific insights faster than human experts. Consequently,
    the data obtained from the digital twin’s surroundings and physical counterpart
    should lead to valuable and actionable conclusions [36]. As an emerging technology,
    AI empowers computers to exhibit intelligent behaviors, including behavioral learning.
    By amalgamating various technologies, including AI, to create twin models of physical
    objects, it becomes feasible to generate virtual representations that closely
    resemble the original objects, encompassing historical elements and predictive
    information [37]. As a result, DTs often incorporate controllers that utilize
    ontologies, ML, and deep learning (DL) techniques. These controllers enable swift
    and intelligent decision-making on behalf of their real-life counterparts. Moreover,
    AI significantly processes IoT data through continuously enhanced algorithms that
    leverage updated user data. Leveraging such time-series data, a user’s DT has
    the potential to suggest actions for controlling or mitigating potentially hazardous
    situations regarding crop health and productivity, in cases such as droughts to
    direct asses irrigation efficiency or even failures of safety mechanisms of farm
    machinery, plant production equipment, post-harvest transportation or storage
    equipment situations in which DTs may visualize alarm signals to stakeholders
    or even take immediate actions to limit adverse effects or even the destruction
    of crop production [29]. 3.1.3. Communication Technologies and Schemes DTs rely
    on communication technologies and schemes to facilitate interaction with the environment,
    their physical twins, and other DTs on a real-time basis. This is particularly
    significant in the realm of wireless communication. Effective communication must
    occasionally occur within a millisecond (ms) timeframe, necessitating compliance
    with 5G and tactile internet standards, while time-sensitive and safety-critical
    schemes, coupled with the need for stringent communication standards, lead to
    a growing demand for repeatable and cost-effective verification procedures. Data
    transmission within a specific time window becomes crucial for time-sensitive
    and often safety-critical applications, imposing latency limitations in addition
    to reliability requirements [38]. The following paragraphs outline basic wireless
    communications technologies commonly used in DT implementations. (a) RFID technology
    offers fast and accurate object identification using sensor tags, reader antennas,
    and a host system. An antenna, an integrated circuit, and a substrate utilize
    a tag, where the antenna activates the tag for reading or writing. The reader
    antennas communicate with the tags using RF waves, facilitating data transfer
    to the database system. This technology finds extensive applications in storage
    and inventory management, supply chain monitoring, access control, aviation transportation,
    agriculture, healthcare, and more, improving efficiency and automation in various
    fields [39]. (b) Wireless Networks, in particular, suggest an immense role in
    sending data from a source to a connected gateway, a role supported by a variety
    of wireless network technologies such as WPAN, WLAN, WWAN, and LPWAN that are
    addressed in [18,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47]. The existing commercial 4G or 5G
    LTE communication networks, utilizing the transmission of data packets through
    the well-established Internet Protocol (IP), serves as a base to sustain the architecture
    of wireless communication networks in general. i Wireless Personal Area Networks
    (WPAN) are wireless networks that operate with less extensive infrastructure.
    They are designed to function within a limited range, typically within a single
    room or a small area. Unlike traditional networks that rely on cables, WPANs enable
    the wireless connectivity of devices nearby, facilitating the connection of devices
    like wireless keyboards or mice to computers and supporting printing services.
    The most common WPAN technologies include Bluetooth, 6LowWPAN, ZigBee, EnOcean,
    NFC, and RFID, each employing different techniques to achieve the goals of WPAN
    [40]. Bluetooth enables devices to communicate with each other wirelessly within
    a limited proximity. It is a short-range, low-power technology that is used in
    a wide variety of devices [41]. ii Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN) are wireless
    networks that allow devices to connect and communicate over a local area without
    the need for physical cables within a specific coverage area, such as a home,
    office, or public space. These networks utilize the widely recognized IEEE 802.11
    standard, commonly known as Wi-Fi, to enable devices like smartphones, laptops,
    and tablets to enable wireless interconnection between them and connection to
    the internet. The Wi-Fi—802.11 wireless network, introduced in 1997, using the
    2.4 GHz frequency band and supporting up to 2 Mbps data transmission rates, evolved
    to the 802.11ac standard, operating in both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands, achieving
    a maximum throughput of 1 Gbps for multiple users, with a minimum of 500 Mbps.
    WLANs offer greater coverage than WPANs, spanning multiple rooms or entire buildings,
    making them suitable for larger-scale wireless networking requirements. They provide
    convenient and flexible connectivity for various devices and applications, including
    internet access, file sharing, video streaming, and more. iii Wireless Wide Area
    Networks (WWAN) provide wireless connectivity on a larger scale, spanning cities,
    regions, or even entire countries. WWAN technologies, such as 4G Long-Term Evolution
    (LTE), 5G, and the evolving 6G, enable high-speed mobile internet access and support
    a wide range of services, including voice communication, video streaming, and
    data transfer. These networks rely on cellular infrastructure and are commonly
    used for mobile devices like smartphones, tablets, and laptops to stay connected
    while on the go. iv Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) are wireless network
    technologies ideal for IoT devices with long battery life, extensive coverage,
    and low cost. Unlike 3G/4G or Wi-Fi systems, LPWAN networks are not primarily
    designed for high data transmission speeds or reducing latency. Instead, LPWANs
    target energy efficiency, scalability, and coverage [42], thus gaining popularity
    in industrial and research communities. They provide long-range communication,
    covering distances from 10 to 40 km in rural areas and 1 to 5 km in dense urban
    areas. Their main advantages include energy efficiency, a battery life exceeding
    ten years, and low cost, which is ideal for IoT applications that require small-scale
    data transmission [48]. Various LPWAN technologies have been developed and deployed
    in either licensed or unlicensed frequency bands, such as Long-Range (LoRa), Narrow-Band
    IoT (NB-IoT), each employing different techniques to achieve the goals of LPWAN
    [49]. LoRa is an ideal wireless communication technology for low-bandwidth IoT
    applications, offering long-range and low-power consumption services. It uses
    a proprietary spread spectrum technique to achieve long-range and low power consumption,
    operating in the unlicensed sub-GHz ISM band available worldwide [50]. NB-IoT
    is a widely used LPWAN technology connecting various devices and services through
    cellular networks. It operates in a narrow bandwidth of 180 kHz, providing extensive
    network coverage and low latency. Designed for cost-effective and delay-tolerant
    IoT devices, NB-IoT utilizes LTE techniques and can integrate with existing LTE
    infrastructure. Coexisting with LTE networks, NB-IoT offers power-efficient connectivity
    and leverages compatible technologies for seamless integration [51]. The main
    technical features of the wireless network technologies mentioned above are displayed
    in Table 1. Table 1. Main features of Wireless Network technologies. Data rates
    and coverage of various wireless networks are shown in Figure 6 for comparison.
    The orange box represents some of the most popular LPWAN networks, prioritising
    greater coverage ranges rather than higher data rates, contrary to the WLANs in
    the green box. Figure 6. Data Rate vs. Range. Depending on the application’s requirements,
    the appropriate wireless network should be selected. Particularly in the context
    of establishing connectivity among IoT devices like sensors, the primary role
    is the selection of a network with wide coverage and low power consumption. The
    LoRa network meets these needs, is open, and is used in articles [25,39,40,41,42,44].
    In cases where the application requires a higher data rate, Bluetooth technology
    can be used, as mentioned in the article [44], but it has significantly higher
    power consumption compared to LoRa, and the coverage is 100 m for Bluetooth 4.x
    and 200 m for Bluetooth 5.x. For applications aimed at object identification and
    detection, such as products in warehouses and animals in agricultural operations,
    RFID technology is a suitable choice as mentioned in articles [43,45]. For applications
    that require a high data rate and need to utilize a Wi-Fi network, the provision
    of electrical power is necessary. Finally, once DTs rely on data exchange, real-time
    monitoring, and interaction with their physical counterparts, wireless networks
    provide a flexible and efficient means of communication for these purposes [8].
    3.1.4. Reliability, Integrity, and Credibility Reliability, integrity, and credibility
    are pivotal when DTs are entrusted with sensitive tasks involving transaction
    management with their real counterparts. It becomes imperative for the real twin
    to establish a sense of trust in their digital twin’s capabilities and actions.
    Building and maintaining a solid connection between the real twin and the DT is
    crucial to foster effective collaboration, enabling reliable decision-making,
    and ensuring secure interactions. Consequently, a strong foundation of trust becomes
    indispensable for the successful operation and advancement of DT-enabled systems
    [52]. Therefore, privacy and security arise as paramount considerations in the
    realm of DTs. To enable the confidentiality and privacy of their real twins, DTs
    should implement robust measures for identity protection. This can be achieved
    using dedicated cryptography algorithms and advanced biometric techniques such
    as ECG and haptic biometrics. By leveraging these techniques, the identity and
    privacy of the real twin can be established and safeguarded. In addition to identity
    protection, DTs must prioritize data integrity, security, and privacy. Measures
    should be in place to prevent unauthorized access and interception of data across
    the network. Unauthorized users should be promptly detected and repelled to prevent
    any compromise of data integrity or security. To ensure the authenticity and reliability
    of data sources, rigorous measures for data authentication should be implemented
    before integrating the data into the digital twin. Overall, DTs must incorporate
    comprehensive privacy and security mechanisms to safeguard their real twins’ data’s
    identity, confidentiality, and integrity. By adopting robust cryptographic algorithms,
    employing biometric techniques, and implementing strict data authentication protocols,
    DTs can effectively address privacy and security concerns, fostering a trustworthy
    and secure environment for the real twins and their digital counterparts. 3.1.5.
    Distributed Ledger Technologies and Blockchain In recent times, Distributed Ledger
    Technologies (DLT), such as blockchain [44,53], have emerged to add to user authentication
    and data integrity regarding data sharing. To unlock its full potential and achieve
    its envisioned advantages, addressing outstanding concerns surrounding the technology
    is imperative. DLT offers a decentralized approach that eliminates the need for
    a central authority or database, distinguishing it from traditional data-sharing
    methods. The distributed nature of this system allows for the secure sharing of
    data in a trustless environment. The significance of DLT has garnered considerable
    interest from researchers and practitioners alike. Various systems and platforms
    based on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), such as private ledgers, public
    ledgers, and permissioned ledgers, have been created to address diverse use cases
    and specific needs [54]. Proposed technological solutions stemming from IoT, AI,
    DT, and DLT have been put forward to address the monitoring and tracking of products
    within the realm of food supply logistics and chain and the analysis of collected
    data to facilitate decision-making processes [55]. Given the numerous advantages
    associated with DLT, it presents itself as a promising technology that can significantly
    contribute to achieving the vision of CDT. Blockchain technologies, in particular,
    seem to be an ideal structure for authenticating users, storing data records,
    and maintaining data integrity [8,56], providing a secure and decentralized system
    of interconnected blocks formed through cryptographic functions. It allows transactions
    to be recorded in a verifiable manner without intermediaries. Each preceding block’s
    hash is included in the next block and is generated through a distributed consensus
    algorithm. With encryption mechanisms, blockchain ensures data integrity and prevents
    tampering [43]. Ethereum, as a blockchain scheme, provides an alternative protocol
    for decentralized applications that, unlike another blockchain scheme Bitcoin,
    is not just a payment network but also allows for the creation and use of smart
    contracts. It uses its digital currency called “ether” and incorporates a complete
    programming language (such as Solidity) for smart contract development. Pieces
    of code stored on the blockchain that enables decentralized transactions without
    a trusted central authority are called Smart contracts [57]. On the other hand,
    the Helium Blockchain is referred to as the major public decentralized LoRaWAN
    network in the world, that enables devices anywhere in the world to wirelessly
    connect to the internet and have a specific geographical placement without the
    need for energy-consuming satellite equipment or expensive mobile data plans [58].
    Helium offers low transaction fees and connectivity for LoRa nodes and ensures
    end-to-end encryption, which is useful whenever sensitive information is at stake.
    The use of blockchain, such as Ethereum and Helium, in IoT and digital twins for
    smart agriculture applications has the following advantages: Transparency and
    trust: Blockchain provides an open, transparent, and tamper-proof distributed
    ledger, allowing all stakeholders to verify the accuracy of the data. This can
    help build trust among different entities in the agricultural supply chain and
    prevent fraud or unauthorized interventions. Blockchain enhances Data security
    [59] as it utilizes cryptography to protect data. This is crucial for safeguarding
    sensitive information related to smart agriculture, such as data on plant health,
    soil quality, and food production. Automation and smart contracts on the blockchain
    enable programmable automatic execution of conditions and actions based on specific
    information, events, and operations such as automated irrigation, temperature
    control, and plant health monitoring in smart agriculture. The distributed architecture
    of blockchain ensures that information is stored and verified by multiple nodes
    in the network, thus ensuring integrity and continuity of data and reducing dependency
    on a central authority. 3.1.6. Cloud Computing Cloud computing presents a valuable
    opportunity for DTs to enhance their scalability and availability, assisting their
    real twins anytime and anywhere. By leveraging cloud computing infrastructures,
    computation and control tasks can be offloaded from the local environment to remote
    servers, enabling DTs to handle complex processes and ensure seamless availability
    efficiently. The scalability of DTs is significantly improved through cloud computing,
    as the computational resources can be dynamically allocated and scaled based on
    demand. This allows DTs to handle larger datasets, called Big Data sets (BD),
    perform sophisticated analytics, and execute resource-intensive tasks without
    local hardware limitations. As the DT model involves the creation and management
    of virtual replicas that closely mimic real-world objects or systems, it requires
    extensive data acquisition, storage, and processing capabilities for collecting
    and analyzing a massive volume of data from various sources, including sensors,
    IoT devices, and other data-generating components [7], facts that necessitate
    cloud computing. The elastic nature of cloud computing ensures that DTs can adapt
    to varying workloads and seamlessly accommodate fluctuations in computational
    requirements. Furthermore, cloud-based DTs offer the advantage of ubiquitous accessibility
    by using open-source communication platforms, such as OPC Unified Architecture
    (UA) communication protocol and frameworks, for data exchange from sensors to
    cloud applications used in DTs. Real twins can access and interact with their
    DTs from any location and at any time, provided an active internet connection
    is in place. This fosters a flexible and versatile environment where real twins
    can leverage the capabilities of their DTs regardless of their physical location.
    3.1.7. Internet of Things Internet of Things (IoT) with 5G and the Tactile Internet
    (TI) entity meanings have emerged as groundbreaking technologies, ushering in
    a new era of communication with their focus on ultra-high reliability and ultra-low
    latency. This shift in communication paradigms from content-oriented to control-oriented
    is especially significant for applications that involve human-in-the-loop interactions,
    demanding minimal delays and seamless integration of communication and control
    mechanisms as demanded in DT infrastructure. Within this context, DTs play a pivotal
    role by establishing a continuously operational twin feedback loop, ultimately
    enhancing the service quality of physical systems [60,61]. This seamless real-time
    feedback communication loop empowers DTs to constantly monitor, analyze, and adapt
    to the evolving conditions of the physical systems they represent. As a result,
    precise control actions and optimizations can be executed, ultimately enhancing
    the physical systems’ overall service quality and performance. Through the IoT,
    users can seamlessly provide contextual data to their DT while receiving feedback
    that can be used to enhance their interaction with the environment, both locally
    and remotely. Various communication technologies within IoT are required to transmit
    data and status information from sensors in the physical entity to the data entity,
    enabling seamless connectivity and communication between connected devices [17],
    as shown in Figure 7. Figure 7. Connection entities over an IoT platform overview.
    The capabilities of DTs are enhanced by contextual data, and the IoT serves as
    a powerful conduit for feeding such data from users to their DTs and vice versa.
    This exchange of information enables users to interact seamlessly with their surroundings,
    whether in close proximity or at remote locations. Additionally, digital twins
    can provide valuable feedback to the environment, further enriching the user experience
    and enabling a more integrated and interconnected ecosystem. 3.1.8. Modelling
    and Simulation Software A DT could be addressed as a tight combination of (i)
    an object model, in conjunction with (ii) an expansive set of data that is directly
    following the object that may evolve, and finally, (iii) a method for modifying
    and refining the model based on the available data [17,62]. The experts decide
    the need and selection of the training, validation and verification data concerning
    specific case studies, types of soil, plant types, leaf area, plant height, regarding
    the Physical Twin, or technological use cases. Critical data processing depends
    on specific plant characteristics, experimental setups, dedicated sensors, ML
    and DL applicable methods and big data analytics software. One of the significant
    benefits of utilizing the DT approach is its ability to accurately depict objects
    or entities that change over time, owing to the incorporation of dynamic and evolving
    data. Employing a digital twin makes it possible to extend the application of
    a validated model across timescales during which the object and its behavior undergo
    significant variations. A validated model may offer an instant representation
    of an object’s behavior at a specific moment, thus highlighting the importance
    of associating the DT with a corresponding physical counterpart and the significance
    of choosing a model according to the specific implementation. Without a physical
    twin, the DT would be considered nothing more than a model. Furthermore, the availability
    of a comprehensive and up-to-date dataset plays a crucial role in accurately capturing
    the object’s changes over time and ensuring the model is adjusted and updated
    to reflect the current system conditions. Any model approximating the physical
    twinned can be used for DTs that utilize physics-based models encompassing all
    relevant processes that can influence the measured quantities. In an ideal scenario
    with instantaneous computing and flawless accuracy, these models would accurately
    simulate and update the mechanical and thermal processes involved in real-time
    operations. For instance, a DT of a machine tool could simulate the milling of
    metal, considering factors like temperature and part shape, and dynamically update
    information about tool wear based on real-time measurements. This enables proactive
    and effective industrial plant facilities maintenance, enhancing overall efficiency
    [62,63]. Similarly, to an industrial plant in agriculture, a digital model could
    represent the growth of a plant regarding its physical environmental conditions
    that are changing over time. According to researchers, a categorization standard
    centered around the degree of data fusion and integration between the PO and its
    virtual representation can be used as an indicator to define and delimit the scope
    of the proposed concept. Given that this term was initially created for the manufacturing
    industry, it serves as a proxy for evaluating agricultural DTs’ development, convergences,
    and divergences compared to contemporary definitions. Thus, three integration
    levels represent the digital twin’s field. First is the Digital Model (DM), second
    is the Digital Shadow (DS), and third is the DT. The DM is a depiction of the
    entity in a digital format without the use of an automated data transfer system.
    It is equivalent to a Digital Twin prototype and represents the lowest possible
    integration level. The DS refers to a digital representation that enables the
    automatic exchange of information from the physical entity to its virtual object,
    reflecting changes in the entity’s state. This one-way information flow is like
    a DT model, which in contrast, involves an automated bi-directional flow of digital
    information. Like the DS, the DT has a virtual representation whose alterations
    are reflected in the physical entity’s state. However, what sets the DT apart
    is its capacity to impact the condition of the physical entity as well, although
    the specific means of influence depend on the type of entity and its context [63].
    In summary, a DM represents a physical system in a digital format but lacks automated
    data exchange. A DS involves a one-way automated data flow reaching the digital
    counterpart originating from the physical system. Conversely, a DT involves seamless
    and fully integrated automated communication between the digital counterpart of
    the physical system and the physical system itself. Defining the objectives of
    the modelling process is the initial stage in creating a model for an integrated
    process. Recognizing that a model is merely a reality approximation is essential,
    as diverse objectives can provide different levels of complexity in representing
    the actual procedure. For this reason, it is crucial to identify the goal of the
    model before the build [64]. Therefore, complex systems like an agriculture model
    should be first designed and objectively defined so their DT model is accurate.
    Spreadsheet software such as Microsoft Excel is commonly employed for process
    calculations and analyses. This is due to its widespread availability and familiarity
    among scientists, engineers, and other professionals. In contrast, the concept
    of DTs is somehow new and still emerging. The spreadsheet’s cells allow users
    to enter data, make computations, and produce results while they can plot data
    from them in several graphs. Software programs like process simulators allow users
    to describe and analyze integrated processes. The purpose of these tools is to
    simulate continuous processes and their transient behavior. The scientific literature
    concerning process simulation tools is continuously growing, encompassing various
    areas such as techno-economic analyses, economic feasibility studies, structural
    process enhancements, and the exploration of alternative processes to existing
    ones [64]. Given that a DT model is much more than a simulation tool, by nature,
    never being an exact representation of reality. Still, really an approximation
    of it, and different objectives may produce various modelling abstractions with
    varying levels of detail concerning the actual process. It is crucial to identify
    the goal of the model before we develop it. Since cloud computing has many benefits,
    it is the most practical method for introducing DT services. Due to its ability
    to provide on-demand services, computational resources, and ubiquitous network
    access, the implementation of the next-generation information technology architecture
    is highly compatible with DT environments. In such environments, data owners generate
    data from assets, transmit it to cloud servers, simulate the DT in a virtual environment,
    and subsequently share the insights and findings of the simulation with the data
    owner. Users can request access to the data at any time [59]. In constructing
    complex DT production systems, like industrial or agricultural systems, “machine
    learning” and “simulation tools” are two complementary technologies. Creating
    stochastic simulations for complicated systems takes time and effort. However,
    these simulations are essential for DT construction because they have two crucial
    capabilities. The first is “uncertainty modelling” and the second is “explainable
    analytics”. Focusing on how ML and reinforcement learning (RL) improve simulation,
    many issues arise in digital twin use cases. The rapid advancement of IoT, edge
    computing, and cloud computing technologies has significantly accelerated the
    progress of digital twins. It is widely believed that digital twins will soon
    become a vital catalyst for digital transformation, as evidenced by the common
    theme present in various research studies [65]. The primary hurdle lies in establishing
    a secure, reliable method to share simulation and real-time data. Additionally,
    there is a need for a robust and privacy-centric authentication system that leverages
    the benefits of blockchain technology to address the security prerequisites mentioned
    earlier. 3.2. Notable Components of DT Implementations In the realm of digital
    twins, components denote the distinct constituents or elements that constitute
    a digital twin system. A representative ensemble follows. 3.2.1. Sensors and Actuators
    DTs embody sensors and actuators as parts of great significance that offer valuable
    data and information about physical phenomena and enable the replication of sensory
    capabilities. In today’s interconnected world, an enormous number of sensors and
    actuators are deployed across various domains, ranging from consumer products
    to industrial settings such as smart factories and smartwatches. These sensors
    capture critical information related to temperature, humidity, velocity, pressure,
    chemical components, and material composition, forming the foundation for digital
    twin technology [47,66]. By equipping real twins (physical entities) with sensors,
    DTs can replicate and harness the senses of sight, temperature, sound, humidity,
    and touch through appropriate actuators. For example, in the agricultural domain,
    a DT of a plant could leverage sensors to create predictive maintenance services
    or simulate and optimize the production process. This allows for the generation
    of actionable insights and the enhancement of operational efficiency. DTs rely
    on the integration of actuator and sensor technologies to gather continuous and
    accurate data. The representation of a physical asset in digital forms, like a
    sensor-equipped machine, relies on the synchronized operation of virtual sensors
    and actuators. These software-based counterparts replicate the functionalities
    of physical sensors and actuators, aggregating data from multiple sources. Integrating
    sensors and actuators within the digital twin framework enables real-time monitoring,
    data-driven analytics, and the ability to simulate various scenarios for optimization
    purposes. By bridging the physical and digital realms, digital twins empower industries
    and sectors to achieve enhanced performance, increased efficiency, and cost savings.
    3.2.2. Identification of Entities In the context of DTs, each twin is assigned
    a distinct identifier that facilitates seamless communication with its physical
    counterpart. This unique identifier encapsulates vital information about the physical
    object’s structure, capabilities, and technical specifications, as well as its
    expected performance under specific conditions. When creating a DT, it is crucial
    to consider the unique circumstances of the object to ensure an accurate representation
    [67]. Even if two physical items are identical, they may exhibit different behaviors
    when subjected to varying conditions. Hence, each digital twin is assigned its
    unique identifier, reflecting the individual characteristics and attributes of
    the corresponding physical object. By leveraging the DT’s unique identifier, we
    can accurately simulate and analyze its properties and behaviours. Furthermore,
    the expansive network of interconnected devices, sensors, and actuators highlights
    the need for real-time collection and sharing of identified contextual data with
    digital twins. This data encompasses various parameters such as location, environmental
    conditions, user preferences, and behavioral patterns. By integrating this uniquely
    identified contextual data into the DT model, a deep understanding of the user’s
    context and needs can be achieved. Adding to that notion, a Geographic Information
    System (GIS) as a versatile system generates, controls, examines, and maps various
    data types and links IoT data to a map. Thus, GIS combines location information,
    referred to as spatial data, with descriptive details of a DT, forming the basis
    for mapping and analysis utilized across multiple industries and scientific fields.
    With GIS, users gain insights into patterns, relationships, and the geographical
    context of their data, as in [68]. 3.2.3. Visualization and Representation Visualization
    and representation play a vital role in DTs, offering various forms of virtual
    representation depending on the specific application. DTs can leverage 3D visualizations
    to facilitate collaborative design or planning [69]. Depending on the context,
    these connections can manifest in various forms, such as a 3D representation,
    hologram, humanoid social robot, or purely as software components without physical
    attendance. Consequently, DT commonly refers to the digital depiction of a real-world
    object, system, or entity’s physical twin that faithfully replicates a unique
    item, process, person, organization, or even a legendary narrative. Composite
    digital twins are formed when multiple digital twins merge. These DTs, as reflections
    of the actual world, share similar characteristics, necessitating the modelling
    of digital processes and objects with composition, flexibility, sensing, collaboration,
    and simulation capabilities. Furthermore, predictions suggest that future DTs
    will evolve toward a holistic virtual world [70]. 3.2.4. Devices Devices that
    continuously capture data concerning physiological and environmental factors information
    can serve DTs to gain a comprehensive understanding of the real twin’s well-being
    and lifestyle. Such wearable devices, for example, smartwatches, fitness trackers,
    and other health monitoring devices have enabled individuals to collect and track
    various physiological parameters effortlessly. The abundance of such data presents
    a unique opportunity for digital twins to enhance their support for their real
    twins more efficiently [71]. By integrating the data from wearables into the DT
    model, real-time insights and personalized recommendations can be generated as
    feedback or alerts based on specific needs and goals. Furthermore, the continuous
    monitoring and analysis of wearable data by DTs enable proactive interventions
    whilst identifying patterns or deviations from normal physiological parameters
    and providing early warnings or interventions to address potential health risks
    or optimize performance. This proactive support can contribute to preventive healthcare,
    early detection of health issues, and overall well-being management. In summary,
    the DT is an advanced data management system that integrates 3D animation, modelling,
    IoT, AI, and other technologies such as ML. It enables the seamless connection
    and management of physical and virtual models within a digital environment [72].
    As human civilization grows, agriculture remains crucial for our progress and
    well-being. Intelligent DT systems can analyze and digitize agricultural areas,
    enabling macro and micro-level visual processes. These systems can provide intelligent
    recommendations and suggestions that can be implemented to achieve multiple benefits
    in agriculture. 4. Reviewing DT Applications in Agriculture and Farming Domain
    Regarding the methodology, we opted for our research. Initially, an extended search
    for literature and bibliography referring to DT in agriculture was conducted in
    Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science. We used the query item “digital twin”
    incorporating the logical operation of conjunction with the concepts of “agriculture”
    including concept association as “crop”, “farm”, “aquaculture”, “animal” and “smart
    farming” to step on cases of DT in subfields of agriculture. Queries as such provided
    144 relevant papers from Google Scholar, 153 papers from Web of Science, and 135
    papers from Scopus. Secondly, we narrowed down all references to 105 papers by
    omitting duplicates, research papers with almost identical titles, with insufficient
    or less relevant content, and following our research individual issues related
    to the main criteria and title as initially stated in the introduction, i.e.,
    crop modelling, precision agriculture, and predictive maintenance in smart farming
    via the DT concept. Diving deeper into the selection criteria, we used keywords
    such as plants, smart agriculture, agriculture 4.0, IoT, aquaculture, food, horticulture,
    urban farming, DT models, 3D simulation, AR, VR, and Blockchain ledgers. Totally
    89 papers, including those for initially referenced material, were chosen as being
    deemed relevant to the context of our research. Deriving from the central idea
    of our research based on our study’s concepts, eminently disclosed in the preceding
    paragraphs of the current Section 2, we finally selected a total number of 26
    papers fulfilling the criteria to utilize our review as graphically viewed in
    Figure 8. Figure 8. Schematic presentation of the paper selection procedure for
    reviewing. Being familiarized with the relevant literature, we achieved insights
    into the extent of DT penetration in agriculture, addressing methodologies, designs,
    data analysis techniques, technologies, and use cases utilized in application
    domains to gain a deeper understanding of the approaches employed by others regarding
    the DTs in agriculture. The main idea lines of our study concepts, though, as
    previously stated, targeting DTs, plants, 3D modelling, simulation, IoT, and ICT
    gave reason to review the relevant literature. The main concepts of our study
    are graphically displayed in Figure 9. Figure 9. Crucial concepts. 4.1. The First
    Categorization of Researched Literature, According to the Main Research Objectives
    Based on the breakdown of the 26 papers concerning the DT application domains
    and target applications related to smart farming as a subset of smart agriculture
    or agriculture 4.0, highlighting the case studies, we gathered a set of related
    concepts in Table 2. If a relevant text was found, the “√” symbol is included
    in the cells; otherwise, if not clearly or at all stated, the “-” symbol is used.
    Table 2. The main research objectives and content topics of eligible referenced
    articles are included in the review. Ιn a total of 26 reviewed articles, 3 were
    relevant case study conference papers, one was a published scientific book, 9
    were journal articles, and 12 were review papers. To visually assist in the analysis
    of the presented information in Table 2 regarding the type of reviewed literature,
    Figure 10 presents these types in graphical mode. Figure 10. Review paper type
    distribution. Fourteen articles either being descriptive as in [9] or practically
    using a case study project as in [9,19,26,28,35,64,74,75,76,77,79,80,81,82] address
    the significance of a DT case study in agriculture. The concept of DTs is mainly
    addressed in all reviewed papers. In 16 papers though [19,26,27,28,64,73,82],
    the DT concept is analyzed and utilized in more detail, thus posing the significance
    of using DTs in smart farming and agriculture. According to the reviewed literature
    summarized in Table 2, smart farming as an implementation of agriculture 4.0 [19,26,27,28,29,45,63,73,75,76,77,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88]
    includes smart irrigation strategies by monitoring and controlling various farming
    stages [28], implementing data acquisition techniques [27] for automatically controlling
    actuator systems in agriculture or even in high-tech data-driven greenhouses [79].
    Furthermore, via simulation, monitoring, controlling, coordinating, and executing
    farm operations at agricultural sites [87], DTs improve predictive control in
    precision irrigation [28,73,88], greenhouse horticulture, and organic vegetable
    and livestock farming. Smart farming enhances remote detection and monitoring
    of vegetation and crop stress in agriculture [86], developing DT stages and forecasting
    plant yield in greenhouses, vertical farms, or outdoor fields [76,77], or even
    in urban and indoor farming, of vertical agriculture utilizing hydroponics, aeroponics,
    aquaculture, and aquaponics. Smart farming approaches the smart agriculture [85]
    as well as the sustainable agriculture 4.0 [80] sector to address precision farming
    and management [75,76] via the adoption of digital technologies and techniques
    in agriculture [27,29,64], leading the way to digital representations of plants
    [9], inventory quality in agriculture, greenhouse production flow, and food safety
    and quality within the food supply chain [45]. Although the DTs remain a major
    issue in our research criteria, in papers [29,45,63,83,84,85], they are implied
    as such. In [9], authors propose a functional DT model; in [86], they are proposed
    as a significant future issue to address and study. 4.2. The Second Categorization
    of Researched Literature, Related to Specific Technical Research Aspects Table
    3 below gathers various aspects of the target applications related to sensors,
    IoT or other smart platforms, smart agriculture, and DT technologies and protocols
    implemented in the addressed literature for comparison and evaluation. If the
    topic of a corresponding cell has no relevant data provided in the literature
    “-” sign is displayed in the corresponding cell. If the topic is merely mentioned,
    a “√” sign is displayed in the corresponding cell. Table 3. Various aspects of
    the target applications concerning sensors, IoT, or other smart platforms relevant
    to smart agriculture and DT technologies and protocols. DTs go along with monitoring
    systems to gather and analyze information. Sensors pose a critical role in smart
    agriculture by facilitating the collection of real-time data and offering valuable
    insights into a wide range of environmental and agricultural parameters. Field
    or soil probes that measure air and ground temperature, humidity, soil moisture,
    and ambient light [28,45,73,81,82,88], added to CO2 sensors measuring relative
    CO2 concentration [80,81], and infrared (IR) thermometers provide data acquisition
    modules for automatically controlled actuator systems in agriculture approaching
    digital modelling to the food process [64] monitoring activities of livestock,
    optimization of crops, reducing emissions to air, soil, and water. Drone image
    cameras [88] and high-resolution photographic cameras seem ideal for AR and VR
    by constructing virtual natural low-polygon 3D plant models as proposed in [35,74].
    Building Information Modeling (BIM) models of high-tech data-driven greenhouses
    are made feasible as in [79] and provide a VR presentation of the farm or field
    with the aid of a head-mounted display (HMD) with two handheld controllers serving
    as handy sensors for manual stimulus. Mini light detection and ranging (LiDAR)
    sensors and multispectral cameras following an Arduino single-board microcontrollers
    programmable platform or single-board computer Raspberry Pi-3 enhance IoT sensor
    nodes to acquire and transmit farm data to IoT gateways or edge devices, thus
    cultivating DT requirements for vertical farms, for the greenhouse production
    process and finally models in sustainable agriculture. Remote detection and monitoring
    of vegetation and crop stress in agriculture seem feasible based on [86] utilizing
    LiDAR—stereo-photogrammetry technology, using multi-spectral imagery, passive
    microwave remote sensing, RFID schemes [9,45], active microwave remote sensing
    (RADAR) and sensors onboard UAVs and satellites [45,76,88]. Location determination
    in farming via geospatial position (GPS) plays a significant role in the remote
    detection and monitoring of vegetation and crop conditions in agriculture [88].
    IoT deployments in smart farming are based on serial hardware communication protocols
    such as I2C serial bus [28] and UART that uses asynchronous serial communication
    with configurable speed and pulse width modulation (PWM) for driving actuators
    [77,81], in correlation with programmable logic controllers (PLC) for data recording
    [29], monitoring, and optimization aided occasionally by fuzzy interference systems
    (FIS) [73]. The decision-making and actions once undertaken by the farmers now
    have given way to data-driven agricultural decision-making, i.e., assisting them
    to undertake informed decisions related to planting, fertilization, pest control,
    harvesting, and overall farm management. Likewise, derived from the smart water
    management project (SWAMP) [28,73,75] a hands-on approach is being utilized to
    develop a precision irrigation platform based on IoT technology for smart water
    management, distributed in Brazil, Italy, and Spain. 4.3. The Third Categorization
    of Research Literature That Is Related to Specific Technical Research Aspects
    DTs use software to create, operate, and interact with their physical counterparts.
    The software component of a DT enables the collection, processing, and analysis
    of data from various sources, including sensors, actuators, and other connected
    devices. In [28,77], the high-level programming language Python is used for software
    development, scripting, and data analysis, serving the purposes of DT applications,
    implementing the Arduino IDE platform, and exploiting the Debian Buster OS to
    produce a plant simulation model. Likewise, RPi software for the Raspberry Pi
    platform is used with goal-oriented requirement language (GRL) for modelling [80].
    We should point out the use of an open standard file format JavaScript Object
    Notation (JSON) which is used in [73] for data representation and communication
    between systems and is widely adopted and supported by various programming languages
    and platforms. Specific software packages are utilized for constructing 3D plant
    models, such as Unreal Engine 5, Reality Capture, Photoshop, Mesh Model Construction,
    Autodesk, Maya [74], Unreal Engine 5 Nanite technology, and Reality [35]. Other
    specific software packages serving, for example, the construction of a DT flowsheet
    model as in [64] found in the researched literature are the Aspen Plus and Aspen
    HYSYS from Aspen Technology, Inc. (Burlington, MA, USA), ChemCAD from Chemstations,
    Inc. (Houston, TX, USA), UniSim Design from Honeywell (Charlotte, NC, USA), ProSimPlus
    from ProSim SA (Labege, France) and PRO/II from AVEVA Group plc. Simulation software
    was employed in this study [28] to generate a virtual setting for an irrigation
    system’s digital twin, incorporating a plant simulation model. As previously mentioned,
    in [73], Siemens’s industrial plant simulation software was used, and in [74],
    the Virtual UCF Arboretum Application (V1.0) was developed with virtual plant
    datasets, plant inventories, VR headsets leading to an AR Holodeck by multiple
    captured images taken in 3D space and an AR perpetual garden App. In [75], a linear
    model of plant growth is proposed utilizing a wheat multi-agent planning module
    close enough to the implied structure modelling simulation in [29], virtual models
    are used during the usage phase in [84], an earth system model in [78], a farm
    is represented in 3D in [81], the concept of the DT model via data-driven modelling
    is assessed [63]. In [76], the authors imply that a software package was developed
    containing an ontology editor, a DT editor, multi-agent planning module for creating
    a prototype of an intelligent plant DT system in Java whilst AR implementations
    to save BIM model files in Film box (.FBX) in [79] by using Unity game engine
    to provide 3D modelling software. Further authors in [9] confronted post-harvest
    models by discrete event simulation such as drying, adding to the simulation models
    for blending and flow DT models [82,83] that rely heavily on available real-time
    data a flow for continuous adaption and learning. Finally, DT modelling implies
    simulation, analysis, and prediction [88] that may assess the modelling and simulation
    of the fertility of seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, pollution challenges, soil
    agents (hydrological models, soil data), and crop agents Table 4 summarises software,
    3D, 3D modelling, simulation, and other research aspects addressed in our work
    regarding the reviewed literature. Suppose the topic of a corresponding cell has
    no relevant data provided in the literature, a “-” sign is displayed in the corresponding
    cell. If the topic is merely mentioned, a “√” sign is displayed in the corresponding
    cell. Table 4. Various aspects of the target applications concerning communication
    technologies, IoT, and cloud platforms for data and simulation processes. On the
    other hand, AI, ML, and DL algorithms seem to be a major issue in [45,63,83,87,88],
    leading to Big Data analytics [82] to describe DT modelling that relies heavily
    on real-time available data flow. The immense amount of data is stored in databases
    such as Mongo DB [28,73], Draco, My-SQL [28,73], and SQLite [80,81], besides using
    Excel CSV files for retrieving height values [79] or generally mentioned Knowledge
    bases as in [75] leading to cloud big data manipulation schemes in [45,81,85].
    Major cloud computing platforms such as Alibaba Cloud, Amazon web services, Google
    Cloud Platform, IBM, and Microsoft Azure are examples of cloud computing services
    provided by leading technology companies that serve the DT idea, as seen in [87].
    Cloud IoT service broker agents come into place as a software component or intermediary
    that facilitates the interaction between cloud service consumers (users or organizations)
    and cloud service providers like FIWARΕ. In [28,73], FIWARΕ cloud applications
    are exploited, adding to IoT brοker and IoT agents to facilitate cloud management
    of context information. The procedure includes converting various communication
    protocols into a shared base protocol and incorporating intelligent functionality
    through the processing, analysing, and visualising of contextual data. FIWARE
    generally is used as an open-source platform to provide a standardized framework
    and a set of reusable components for building smart applications and services
    in the context of the IoT and Future Internet (FI) domains. It aims to simplify
    the development of innovative and interoperable solutions by offering a collection
    of open APIs, data models, and software tools that facilitate the development
    of smart applications and services. A fuzzy inference system enhances adaptive
    and learning capabilities. It handles nonlinear and complex relationships between
    variables, as in [73], in addition to Siemens industrial plant simulation software
    for plant simulation model production with a weather station. In [67,79], the
    Microsoft Excel spreadsheet application is used instead of other dedicated software
    such as Geo-Soft-Core, a Geoscientific Software & Code Repository hosted at the
    archive DIGITAL.CSIC in [78] or Java ontology editor to elaborate a DT editor
    in [75,76]. Lastly, wireless network communication technologies are addressed
    in the research literature. Initially, the wired networking technology Ethernet
    is mentioned in [28,73,77], while the wireless networking technologies such as
    Wi-Fi are mentioned in [35,45,74,77,87], LoRaWAN in [45,73], mobile or cellular
    in [45,74,87] and generally mentioned as mandatory in [29,82]. Bluetooth, RFID,
    and NB-IoT are exploited in [85]. 5. Discussion A first attempt to comment on
    specific aspects of the reviewed literature has been done in Section 2. In total,
    14 journal articles or conference papers, including a published book, propose
    case studies that support the idea of DT implementation in agriculture, contrary
    to the rest published review papers that suffice to merely describe the topic
    and record the achievements of the scientific community referring to it. It is
    interesting to point out that three (3) relevant case study conference papers
    and a published book, added to nine (9) journal articles, seem to slightly overcome
    the amount of the 12 review papers in a total of 26 articles. The limited practical
    application of digital twin technologies is obvious, even stated in the literature
    by the authors. Even though [9,86,87] are review papers, the authors either describe
    the necessity of a DT model as in [9] for the agriculture supply chain management
    domain, even addressing sensors such as level, flow, identification sensors, RFID
    or DNA tags, or highlight the need for future study on DT models as in [86] making
    use of remote detection and monitoring schemes, LiDAR sensors, passive microwave
    sensing devices, RADARs or even sensors onboard UAVs and satellites, for monitoring,
    controlling, coordinating, and executing farm operations at agricultural sites
    by IoT sensor nodes as in [87]. The significance of using Sensors as part of a
    dynamic IoT control-oriented mechanism as demanded in DT infrastructure should
    be acknowledged as in [35,73,74,77,79,80,81,87,88] where soil probes, drone image
    cameras, multispectral and photographic cameras, IR thermometers, mini-LiDAR sensors,
    a mesh of sensors measuring temperature, humidity, luminosity, and relative CO2
    concentration, and air velocity are addressed as essential elements to materialize
    relevant IoT platforms accordingly. In [28,73,75,88], the SWAMP IoT-based smart
    water management platform is mentioned. In [19,26], the IoT scheme is merely addressed,
    and in the journal [82], IoT is only mentioned as well in the review papers [63,85,87],
    where the IoT is stated as a promising concept. The fact that in [73] an OPC UA
    server is recommended for implementation, in [77] an Arduino single-board computer
    is used as well as the Raspberry Pi-3 platform as in [80,81] in a total of 14
    articles that either describe the use of IoT platforms or vaguely present a case
    study project [9,19,26,28,35,64,74,75,76,77,79,80,81,82] means that the practical
    implementation of IoT platforms is quite limited for the time being. The necessary
    software to operate such platforms is focused on Python [28,77], dedicated FIS,
    Json, FIWARE Cygnus connector, IoT Agent, OPC agent [73], RPi in [77,80], Arduino
    IDE n [77] relevant to the case studies previously mentioned. These make use of
    Ethernet communication technologies [28,73,77], LoRa [73], and Wi-Fi, [77] in
    addition to [35,74] that make use of Wi-Fi and mobile LTE [74] communication technologies
    that facilitate near real-time interaction with the environment. The concept and
    definition of DT seem to be continuously evolving, but in general, it refers to
    a specific collection of digitally or virtually materialized models that represent
    a physical process or object. These models are used for simulation and future
    behavior forecasting, guiding the feedback loop from the Actuators and Control
    node to the Physical entity, as profoundly visualized in Figure 3, Figure 4 and
    Figure 5. The ongoing feedback loop between the physical farm and the DT is imperative
    to update the DT model to optimize and enhance performance and efficiency. Several
    attempts have been made in this direction. In the reviews [9,29,63,83,86], the
    concept of the DT model is proposed merely as an evolving concept without an implemented
    case study. Simulation models [83], referring to data-driven modelling, discrete
    event simulation blending and flow models [9], and structure modelling simulation
    and future multi-domain radiative transfer models (e.g., SCOPE) with dynamic crop
    growth models for agroecosystems DTs [86] are described merely as proposals giving
    way to future practical implementations. On the other hand, in [28], simulation
    software utilizing a simple plant simulation model is employed to create a virtual
    environment for an irrigation system’s digital twin. In [73], the Siemens industrial
    plant simulation software for the data model is used, a model of the Earth system
    is mentioned in [78], a 3D representation of a farm in [81], while in [82] it
    continuous adaption and learning procedure of the DT modelling is mentioned as
    a need that relies heavily on available data. A more concise proposal to the origin
    of the holistic DT modelling and simulation concept appears in [76], where a prototype
    of an intelligent plant DT system in Java claimed to be developed, including an
    ontology editor, a digital twin editor, and a multi-agent planning module. In
    [88], simulation, analysis, and prediction are addressed by making progress in
    implementing modelling and simulation of the fertility of seeds, fertilizer, pesticides,
    and pollution challenges, making efforts to develop plant modelling with soil
    agents (hydrological models, soil data), crop agents and predictive control models,
    where the adjustment of control processes such as heating and ventilation is automated
    based on short-term temperature predictions, ensuring efficient regulation, as
    an IoT derivative scheme. A flowsheet model is proposed taking advantage of the
    widespread spreadsheet applications of Microsoft Excel in [64] to tamper with
    simulation software such as Aspen Plus and Aspen HYSYS from Aspen Technology,
    Inc. (Burlington, MA, USA), ChemCAD from Chemstations, Inc. (Houston, TX, USA),
    UniSim Design from Honeywell (Charlotte, NC, USA), ProSimPlus from ProSim SA (Labege,
    France) and PRO/II from AVEVA Group plc, merely to implement a digital modelling
    approach to food processing. Spreadsheet applications of Microsoft Excel to retrieve
    height values of plants in high-tech data-driven greenhouses are used in [79],
    a fact that proves that process calculations and analyses may be conducted using
    popular spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel due to its wide accessibility
    and familiarity among scientists, engineers, and professionals from various fields.
    Enhanced 3D modelling software derived from the game industry, i.e., Unity game
    engine dictates BIM models in Film box (.FBX) format to aid realistic VR/AR representations
    of greenhouses, providing a promising realistic overview of a Smart Agriculture
    implementation. Virtual representation is accomplished via Unreal Engine 5, Reality
    Capture, Photoshop, Autodesk, and Maya software platforms to construct Mesh models
    of Plant Datasets for Virtual UCF Arboretum Applications, plant inventories, and
    AR Perpetual Garden App. as in [74]. These plant datasets are derived from multiple
    captured images in 3D space and incorporate VR headsets aided by GIS and AR Holodeck
    software. Additionally, Unreal Engine 5 Nanite technology and Reality are used
    for 3D plant models offering a linear plant growth model [35] to descriptively
    suffice the wheat multi-agent planning module. Using multiple captured images
    taken in 3D space to support the AR Perpetual Garden App, they produce botanically
    correct plant models for use in museums and for educational purposes. A promising
    perspective, if by any chance associated with the essential elements of the holistic
    DT scheme, could be capturing real-time data on various environmental and operational
    factors via communication technologies leading to a dynamic 3D model of a farm
    entity. Besides the 3D representation of DT models, IoT Dashboards [87], such
    as Grafana in particular [28,73] for real-time data presentation and analysis
    or even GUI prototypes [81], are proposed, although used on a small scale for
    facilitating near real-time interaction of DTs with the environment. To reliably
    transfer and manage data, Blockchain is used, even on a smaller scale, as in [45,87],
    while Big Data Analytics, as in [82], AI and ML methods that enable data analysis,
    pattern recognition, and decision-making based on large datasets, are addressed
    in [45,63,82,83,86,88]. Cloud-based data analytics pose a major issue for the
    advent of smart agriculture as claimed in [45,85,87], not to omit the significance
    of databases such Mongo DB, Draco, My-SQL as used in [28,73] or SQLite in [80],
    and Cloud computing service providers such as Alibaba Cloud, Amazon web services,
    Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud platform [87]. Various factors, with technical
    hurdles being the primary challenge, seem to be stepping behind to allow even
    further the adoption of the DT technologies. It is essential to meticulously design
    and clearly define intricate agricultural systems to guarantee the accuracy of
    their corresponding DT models. 6. Future Directions Once addressing a DT as a
    tight combination of an object model, in conjunction with expansive sets of data
    that directly follow the object that may evolve and continually modify and adapt
    the model based on the available data, it is made clear that future research should
    be realized to overcome the current profound lack of reference models and case
    studies accordingly. That could serve as a direct guidance for DT research and
    development. To broaden the aspect of Agriculture 4.0 that needs DTs and overcome
    the limitations of mere telemetry narrowed down by IoT schemes implemented till
    now, further research in implementations using DT modelling, 3D visualization,
    and simulation schemes targeting virtual nature applications aided by AR, VR,
    and GIS information systems should be realized. Further research into the holistic
    model perception of plant DTs to overcome the focus merely on the phenotype of
    plants could vastly support DT research. We can pursue enhancing the accuracy
    of depicting real-world farms, plants, and crops in the digital realm by combining
    non-georeferenced visualizations, like gaming engines, with geospatially referenced
    3D geo visualizations. Implementing additional case studies of digital twins that
    adhere to the mentioned principles can address challenges related to reliable
    aggregating and handling of data from diverse sources, integrating multiple streams
    of information, and employing advanced computational methods for data processing
    and analysis, which could enhance the understanding of the subject and aid further
    studies. Further decommissioning of data in the future resulting from search—Table
    1, Table 2 and Table 3 might be promising. The diverse and abundant potential
    advantages of DTs in agriculture create anticipation for the future evolution
    of this technology and its profound impact on the farming sector. We aspire for
    our work to inspire fellow researchers to explore the application of DTs in agriculture
    even further. Author Contributions Conceptualization, N.P., D.P. and P.P.; methodology,

  description: Internet of Things (IoT) has been widely used in many smart applications
    such as smart cities, smart agriculture, healthcare, industry, etc. In addition,
    the importance of IoT-based architectures has increased with the emergence of
    innovative technologies such as 5G networks and quantum computing. Electrochemical
    sensors (ECS) have recently been used in IoT-based architectures thanks to their
    easy integration into smart systems in many fields such as pharmaceutical, food,
    medical diagnosis, clinical, genetic analysis, wearable, forensic identification,
    and monitoring of environmental variables. However, Although IoT-based systems
    have ensured the availability of sensor data in traditional architecture, there
    are many challenges, such as low latency, availability, real-time data traceability,
    and security. In addition, new challenges regarding security and privacy have
    emerged in the system as the ever-growing smart connected IoT devices generate
    a significant amount of heterogeneous data. Given these challenges, in this paper,
    we propose PPFchain, a new federated learning-enabled blockchain-based framework
    to ensure the security and privacy of sensor-IoT-based architectures using sampled
    ECS data. PPFchain has a lightweight, low-cost, high-performance architecture
    in the IoT-based blockchain network. In the architecture, we used the federated
    model and cryptographic primitives for user and data privacy in off-chain fog
    nodes considering performance. Moreover, we compared with traditional blockchain
    models using various performance metrics for system performance in a distributed
    architecture, such as an event and storage-based smart contract. In addition,
    the results show that the PPFchain provides accuracy, efficiency, and enhanced
    security.

    a distributed architecture, such as an event and storage-based smart contract.
    In addition, the results show that the PPFchain provides accuracy, efficiency,
    and enhanced security. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords

    of Things (IoT) is expressed as devices and objects connected over the Internet.
    It also is used to develop IoT-based applications in many areas, such as smart
    cities, smart agriculture applications, and smart health services. IoT-based systems
    have increased efficiency and reduced costs [1]. Recently, with the emergence
    of innovations such as 5G-enabled smart cities and industry 4.0, the importance
    of IoT-based systems has been increased [2]. In addition, the development of 5G
    technology has positively affected the use of 5G-enabled IoT-based systems in
    industrial applications [3]. The foundation of these IoT-based architectures is
    usually based on cloud servers. Even if these architectures can work efficiently,
    new frameworks are being proposed for anticipated progress [4]. As more things
    are connected to IoT-based systems, the security risk of the system is increased
    [5]. In many IoT-based systems, such as smart agriculture, healthcare, and smart
    city, the attacks can be of any type. Especially the change of data is another
    reason for security weakness in these architectures. In recent years, ECS has
    been frequently applied in many areas, such as the detection of environmental
    pollution, agriculture, COVID-19 sensors, cancer sensors, wearable sensors, and
    heavy metal analysis for the benefit of humanity and the environment [6], [7],
    [8]. Detection technologies based on electrochemical techniques play an important
    role in current bioassays due to their high sensitivity, accuracy, ability to
    work with fewer analytes, and short response times. ECS has based on a simple
    reduction and oxidation reaction. Thanks to the creation of portable potentiostats,
    these sensors allow us to obtain electrochemical analysis results wherever we
    need them, along with the use of wireless/smartphones [9], [10]. The electrical
    signals obtained in ECS applications allow us to monitor the data of the applied
    potential and the resulting current. In recent years, due to the integration of
    these sensors with IoT, we have more efficient, accessible, applicable, and personal
    data [11]. It is aimed to support the availability, accessibility, and real-time
    measurements of sensors by including technologies such as wireless sensors, transforming
    networks, and databases in IoT-based architectures [12]. Although data tracking
    in sensors has recently been facilitated using IoT-based architectures, there
    is still significant weakness in security and privacy [13]. For example, the possibility
    of manually correcting the data obtained from the device in ECS applications negatively
    affects the system’s security. In addition, the mistakes in these IoT-based systems
    have caused negativities in many areas, such as diagnosing diseases with wearable
    sensors, the strategy to be applied in environmental and agricultural applications.
    In today’s IoT-based systems, data storage is mostly based on cloud-based central
    systems. Generally, the so-called fog node, which is integrated into the devices
    at the edge of the network, is used for data storage of IoT-based architectures.
    The fog node is the unit that transmits data received from smart or dumb devices
    at the edge of the network that functions as data generators [15]. The fact that
    it is based on a single center in existing cloud-based storage methods may cause
    data to be lost against system crashes. Furthermore, cloud-based solutions are
    unlikely to provide adequate service due to the increasing demand for these systems
    and the limited resources of IoT devices. In addition, the lack of auditing in
    IoT applications is insufficient to eliminate the cyber security problem. Moreover,
    data transmission consumes enormous bandwidth and energy and is also expensive.
    Therefore, the designed architecture should be an efficient data processing architecture
    since a large amount of IoT data is transmitted to the cloud environment at high
    speed. Therefore, existing problems can be solved using decentralized technology
    and integrated with federated learning (FL). Table 1. Attribute of BT. Attributes
    Empty Cell Explanation Irreversibility Each node in the system keeps a copy of
    the whole chain. Availability Records are stored on multiple nodes,it is robust
    and /robustness resistant to data corruption, data loss, and security attacks
    on availability. Trust Each block history is irrevocably verified and stored.
    The authenticity and undeniability of the transactions are ensured. Transparency
    Thanks to its open and transparent structure, it is trace- able and creates an
    atmosphere of trust. Decentralization Transfer of assets between parties without
    third parties in the system [14]. Blockchain technology (BT) provides the structure
    that ensures data protection of global participants in an unreliable environment
    [16]. In addition, it provides immutability and secure data between individuals
    or institutions by eliminating third parties existing in central systems (Table
    1). Thanks to the innovations that BT supplies, it can be used in many areas such
    as healthcare, supply chain, digital ID, IoT, smart sensors, smart agriculture
    [4], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21]. FL is a distributed machine learning (ML) method
    or extension that enables heterogeneous data from various smart devices to be
    trained on the device. FL is also a machine learning framework that can assist
    in protecting user privacy and data privacy [22], [23]. Various studies have also
    been conducted on integrating blockchain and FL [24], [25], [26], [27]. In this
    paper, we propose a new FL-based lightweight blockchain framework (PPFchain) that
    provides data privacy and reliability using sampled ECS data. PPFchain is a distributed
    architecture that provides low-cost, on-demand anonymity in the IoT-based blockchain
    network. By bridging the fog node architecture at the edge of the off-chain IoT
    network to the decentralized architecture, the contract payload is reduced while
    providing a minimal end-to-end delay between IoT devices. In the fog node, we
    also provide digital signatures with public key cryptography infrastructure to
    ensure the privacy of administrators, and we use FL for data privacy, taking into
    account system performance. We evaluated performance metrics in the benchmark
    using event and storage-based smart contracts in a distributed architecture. Furthermore,
    we created a new 5G-enabled block-sensor platform that can balance security-privacy
    and computation-communication costs by piloting new-generation technology-sensor
    applications on the blockchain (Fig. 1). The remainder of the paper is organized
    as follows: The following section introduces the application areas of sensors
    at the edge of the IoT network and BT. Section 3 introduces the framework by providing
    a preliminary overview of our work and displays recommended algorithms for the
    proposed framework. Section 4 demonstrates the immutability and traceability of
    the data based on the model’s performance measures by piloting and discusses the
    security of the system, followed by Section 5, which highlights our contributions
    and explains the research work’s future scope. Finally, our result is presented.

    1.1. Motivation and contribution Nowadays, IoT-based architectures have been used
    in various areas. Many security-providing architectures have been proposed for
    the security of IoT-based architectures. With the widespread use of IoT in every
    area, system security and data privacy have gained much more importance. Therefore,
    as the attackers have more computing power in today’s technology and privacy threats
    become more complex, efficient schemes that provide security and privacy must
    be created. In this paper, we discuss security and privacy in IoT-based architectures.
    We propose a new architecture based on an FL-enabled blockchain in the sensor
    network. We offer a refinement for the privacy-preserving FL method. When we examine
    similar architectures qualitatively, the proposed architectures generally have
    used BT for privacy. However, the performance and low cost of smart contracts
    or performance in FL-integrated systems have not been considered. Moreover, the
    overheads of transactions have not been considered quantitatively in other architectures.
    To solve the problems mentioned in our proposed architecture, FL and existing
    cryptographic protocols have blended in the off-chain fog node. Moreover, the
    FL approach has been applied to improve the learning process of data and ensure
    its security and an intelligent model has been provided to improve efficient-secure
    data transmission. Intruders and attack patterns have been prevented by providing
    additional security with a decentralized cloud storage system and authorized digital
    signature and verification in the off-chain fog node. System performance has been
    ensured with an off-chain fog node and decentralized storage system integrated
    architectural model. Moreover, when we consider the contract performance quantitatively,
    in terms of the communication cost, using an event-based smart contract compared
    to storage-based smart contracts has obtained positive results. Therefore, considering
    the current challenges such as user and data privacy, implementing existing cryptographic
    protocols in the off-chain fog node and integrating FL, providing double security,
    and performance and scalability when all these integrated systems are considered,
    these concepts make our architecture different from other architectures. 2. Related
    work In this section, we summarize the sensor-IoT-based architectures implemented
    by the researchers and the currently proposed blockchain-based solutions and analyze
    the shortcomings of IoT-based architectures in current solutions. The development
    of IoT-based architectures can help large-scale real-world applications and bring
    some challenges, such as data security. Recently, we have witnessed an increase
    in mainstream technology studies on the blockchain, IoT, and smart sensors [28].
    BT has many features, such as traceability, controllability, and immutable. Therefore,
    BT can be used in areas that require different security, such as access control
    of IoT devices, authentication or authorization, secure storage of IoT data, and
    DDOS attack detection methods. Also, this technology has improved data storage
    and selection processes. The importance of trust in the big data space can be
    exploited for the secure circulation of data sources [29]. BT has many use cases,
    such as healthcare, smart home, smart agriculture, and supply chain [30]. In addition,
    the important area is machine-to-machine interaction, that is, the IoT ecosystem.
    Building trust as machines interact with each other is still a far-reaching and
    huge challenge for IoT technology [31]. At this point, using BT can act as a catalyst
    that provides security, reliability, and privacy [32]. In this technology, you
    can monitor the millions of devices interacting with the IoT and coordinate processes
    to increase processing so that data from sensors is transferred to a decentralized
    system. Also, regarding the technology used in IoT and information and communication
    technology (ICT), the comprehensive and major challenge in IoT can be overcome
    with BT [33]. In [34], the authors clarified the effects of BT in using IoT systems.
    In [35], a secure hybrid structure has been proposed to receive information from
    IoT devices among various distributed users and store the data on the blockchain.
    In [36], the authors proposed a design for a blockchain-based sensor data protection
    system. System security is the most critical structure in IoT-based blockchain
    architectures. In [37], the authors examined the systematic security analysis
    for IoT-based blockchain architectures. Recently, it has been seen that BT has
    become one of the most important and encouraging technologies in the Industry
    4.0 world for IoT applications [38], [39], [40]. In Industry 4.0, a new blockchain-based
    wireless mechanism has been proposed that ensures transparency and security in
    smart sensors [4]. In another study, a blockchain-based mechanism was designed
    for the security of data from sensor nodes in wireless sensor networks (WSN) [41],
    also in [42], a framework is designed in WSN that reduces the data storage time
    and space of each sensor. In the study [43], a private blockchain-based architecture
    is proposed in Industrial IoT networks. In another study, a double-chain solution
    is presented [12]. The sampled data is initially stored on the IPFS network. IPFS
    hash results are uploaded to the ASDC chain. Instead of files, IPFS hashes are
    stored in the block. Therefore, the ASDS chain has been processing fewer data.
    In [44], the authors have proposed a blockchain-based data integrity verification
    technique. They have ensured the security of the third-party auditor (TPA), which
    has the role of auditing integrity in IoT. In [45], the authors have presented
    a next-generation light blockchain proposal for IoT systems, which provides a
    significant reduction in resource consumption. The ever-growing growth of IoT
    devices has posed new security and privacy challenges within businesses. To this
    challenge, In [36], the authors have proposed a design theory for a blockchain-based
    sensor data reading system that leverages data certification. In [46], the authors
    proposed the EOS blockchain method by combining Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and sensors
    to secure data in IoT-based architecture. Security is an important priority in
    agriculture, as in other systems. Therefore, there has been recent research on
    the blockchain-based IoT system security challenge in agriculture [47]. In [48],
    state-of-the-art IoT-based BT is proposed to contribute to sustainable smart agricultural
    production. In [49], a study using IoT-based and monitoring the process of an
    agricultural product with blockchain has been proposed. The authors in [50] proposed
    a blockchain-enabled approach to provide an optimum greenhouse environment in
    the greenhouse system. In [51], a modular and cost-effective blockchain architecture
    was proposed for sustainable agri-food. In [52], a blockchain-based method using
    smart contracts is presented to transform supply chain transactions. In [53],
    the authors proposed a cost-effective, simple, secure blockchain-based smart contract
    for supply chain transactions. In healthcare information management, the processing
    of IoT-based sensitive patient data and the use of IoT sensors and blockchains
    in this field are of great importance [19]. In [54], the authors proposed a blockchain-enabled
    fog cloud-based framework in the healthcare application system. The goal is to
    improve data accuracy to minimize security risks. The authors present in [55]
    a blockchain-based system proposal that analyzes patient conditions with data
    from wearable sensors. Also, there are sensor studies on world-affected pandemics
    such as cancer. Recently, we experienced a great threat from the COVID-19 pandemic.
    Researchers have addressed the pandemic problem using information and communication
    technologies. For instance, authors in [56] proposed a 6G-enabled blockchain-based
    architecture for detection during the COVID-19 pandemic. The article suggests
    using UAV for contact and to monitor mass surveillance of people in dense areas
    with strong bandwidth, data is received with low latency and stored in blockchain-based
    architecture. Furthermore, the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), which includes
    bio-sensors, medical devices, and their communication technologies, plays a vital
    role in combating and preventing COVID-19 in healthcare. Therefore, the authors
    in [57] proposed to solve the security problems of the blockchain-based system
    architecture for these systems. Recently, IoT-connected ECS applications have
    been developed for the detection of Sars-Cov-2 using electrochemical methods.
    The authors in [58] designed and developed electrochemical biosensors, presenting
    a collective approach for COVID-19 diagnosis, including electrochemical SARS-CoV-2
    biosensing powered by artificial intelligence. The authors in [59] proposed a
    smart covid shield that can detect people infected with COVID-19 with ultrasonic
    sensors (capable of transmitting signals) with acoustic sensing, aimed at transforming
    them into personalized healthcare using IoT technology. With robust bandwidth
    in the architecture, the data is received with low latency and stored in the blockchain-based
    architecture. In [60], a blockchain-based IoT platform is used for privacy in
    smart healthcare services. In addition, FL technology has been adopted for ML
    applications in architecture. There are several reasons why security and privacy
    are seen as one of the most important problems of IoT. These are the reasons such
    as having limited energy and computational resources and designing devices without
    considering security. Therefore, these devices cannot for them execute advanced
    security mechanisms [61]. Furthermore, since IoT devices are connected to the
    core structure and collect sensitive data, they are vulnerable to attacks and
    pose another security problem [62]. The FL model, which is a machine learning
    model that provides the sharing of parameters instead of sharing sensitive data,
    has been adopted in IoT-based blockchain architectures . In [63] the authors proposed
    a blockchain-based FL model in the industrial internet of things (IIoT). In the
    architecture, the central server has a control mechanism with ML on the edge server.
    In [64] the authors proposed a new solution to existing problems using fog computing
    and blockchain for IoT-based secure transactions in healthcare. In [65], the authors
    discussed the integration of FL with blockchain for communication cost and resource
    space in the edge computing scenario. In [66], the authors proposed an FL-based
    architecture for the IIoT that improves learning performance. Various methods
    have been developed that implement the IoT-based blockchain architecture. IoT-based
    lightweight blockchain architectures have been implemented to some extent recently
    but have not considered the need to use lightweight blockchain due to the limited
    resources of IoT devices. Some of those; are concentrated on communication, storage,
    and computation costs [67], bandwidth and security [68], communication costs [69],
    and transaction time improvement [70]. In [71], the authors proposed a blockchain-based
    remote mutual authentication architecture for security in smart devices and cloud
    networks. In [72], the authors proposed a lightweight, scalable blockchain architecture
    that reduces mining processing overhead and latency. In [73], the authors propose
    a machine learning-based lightweight blockchain to reduce the delay in reaching
    consensus and ensure data integrity. However, a comprehensive, blockchain-based
    architecture that can balance the security-privacy and computation-communication
    costs of IoT-based architectures has not yet been designed. Download : Download

    in blockchain (simplified). 3. Conceptual framework 3.1. Preliminaries 3.1.1.
    Blockchain technology We briefly mentioned in Section 1 that BT is a DLT peer-to-peer
    network. This technology uses certain cryptographic algorithms to verify data
    and record transactions sent to peers in blocks. Each new verified block uses
    cryptographic hash functions to form an immutable, traceable blockchain network.
    Transactions on the chain are immutable, and it is impossible to change them mathematically.
    A consensus needs to be reached in the system to verify the validity of transactions
    in the next block. This technology also provides trust in an unreliable environment
    without intermediaries. A blockchain can also be called a block sequence containing
    a list of the current transaction record. The block structure consists of a block
    header and a block body Fig. 2. The block header contains the following data:
    • Previous block hash: the hash value from the previous block is retrieved. •
    Timestamp: the time the current block is created • Nonce: a randomly given value
    of 4 bytes to solve the existing puzzle using the miners’ PoW consensus protocol.
    • Root hash: the hash value of transactions’ hashes. The block body consists of
    verified transactions. The Merkle tree structure is important for the existence
    and validation of transactions. Any changes to the system will create a fake root
    value. This shows its validity. The transaction size and block size of each transaction
    in the system depend on the number of transactions. As stated before, any change
    of the blocks will produce a different hash value, so immutability and security
    in the system are ensured. Recall that the mathematical of the block structure
    is defined as follows [74]: Definition 1 The 256-bit hash value obtained from
    the current block as the first n-bit , and the hash value obtained from the previous
    block, the timehold it takes to create a new block that using the proof-of-work
    (PoW) consensus protocol; It is less than Eq. (1). (1) where block, N nonce value,
    H hash, value transactions, and timehold. The key point here is that transactions
    are held securely by all nodes to avoid double-spending [74]. 3.1.2. Smart contract
    Smart Contracts is a computer program with Ethereum [75] Blockchain 2.0 technology
    that automatically executes predefined conditions beyond cryptocurrencies. In
    other words, it means making agreements between individuals or institutions and
    processing them embedded in the blockchain system in these agreements. It is implemented
    as any software program that uses conditions, loops, etc. Furthermore, Smart contracts
    are used for many purposes, such as fraud prevention and cost reduction. Smart
    contracts are based on three main elements, • autonomy: The person or enterprise
    initiated cannot intervene after the relevant contract has started. • self-sufficiency:
    the ability to be self-sufficient in processes such as processing power or storage
    by providing services of appropriate resources. • decentralization: distributed
    among nodes in the network and self-running without a centralized structure. In
    the blockchain architecture, there is an Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) working
    environment for smart contracts on ethereum. We designed a smart contract using
    this working environment. We conducted our development environment, a part of
    BT, using HTML, CSS, and javascript on the front-end and solidity smart contract
    on the back-end. In classical IoT-based blockchain architectures, the JSON-RPC
    library is used between node and blockchain communication. However, we use the
    QJSON-RPC library, a lightweight and efficient library for limited resource environments
    and supports JSON-RPC 2.0 [76] (Fig. 3). Download : Download high-res image (305KB)

    the integration of smart contract, Web3js, and HTML Tools used in the experimentation.
    3.1.3. Interplanetary File System (IPFS) IPFS is a decentralized protocol designed
    to create a peer-to-peer distribution system. This system keeps data in a distributed
    structure without a central server [77]. The procedure with cryptographic hash
    values addresses data added to the IPFS network. These hash values are unique.
    Finding data between peers without delay in IPFS is based on distributed hash
    tables (DHT). In addition, IPFS is one of the basic building blocks of BT and
    provides secure data exchange between peers and a high-efficiency block storage
    model. Thanks to Merkle DAG, content addressing, tamper resistance, and deduplication
    are the best structure of IPFS. Thanks to this structure, it also aims to change
    HTTP and create a better web. In this study, we used IPFS to store encrypted data
    from the fog node, taking advantage of the integrated and decentralized peer-to-peer
    concept with our smart contract code. The distributed storage system solves the
    failure of the central servers in the classical cloud storage system and increases
    the data retrieval efficiency (Fig. 3). 3.1.4. Public key cryptography Public
    key cryptography is used in the blockchain infrastructure. Ever since public-key
    cryptography was introduced by Diffie–Hellman [78], the difficulty in the discrete
    logarithm problem has also emphasized the cryptographic importance of the system.
    Firstly, ElGamal [79] explained how the system could be used in public key and
    digital signing. This method has been successful and integrated into various protocols
    over time. In public-key cryptography, the public key ( ) is used to encrypt the
    data, and the secret key ( ) pair is used to decrypt the data. While the public
    key is shared with everyone, the private key must be kept secret. Recall the discrete
    logarithm problem works as follows [80]; Definition 2 Let be a finite group of
    order n and a be an element of . Given the integer , 0 x n-1, such that , if there
    is such an integer. In this framework, we used elliptic curve cryptography which
    is a public key encryption system, for the confidentiality of user information
    and to double the system’s security. The difficulty of elliptic curve cryptography
    is the algebraic structures of elliptic curves over a finite field based on the
    discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP) [81]. To balance security and computational
    costs in lightweight IoT-based blockchain architecture, we implemented the cryptographic
    protocol (digital signature) in the fog node. We also used the elliptic curve
    digital signature algorithm (ECDSA) for the digital signature. In addition, the
    ECDSA that we use for digital signature is based on the elliptic curve discrete
    logarithm problem (ECDLP), which is an NP-hard problem [82]. Recall that ECDLP
    is defined as follows [81]; Definition 3 Given and at two points, it is impossible
    to find the value of k in polynomial time such that . 3.2. Model Although there
    are blockchain-based studies for traceability and storing data in sensor-IoT-based
    applications, it has been observed that a comprehensive, lightweight blockchain-based
    architecture can balance the security-privacy and computation communication costs
    of IoT-based architectures that have not yet been designed. In this section, we
    have identified the following requirements for the issues discussed in the previous
    sections; the relevant issues are mainly; • lack of user and data privacy, • refinement
    for efficient-secure data transmission, • quantitative and qualitative evaluation,
    • scalability and uncontrollability, • lack of integrity. In this section, we
    introduce a new lightweight blockchain-based PPFchain that considers the security,
    traceability, and system user privacy of sampled ECS data. Then we explain the
    general structure of PPFchain, how it can balance security-privacy and computation-communication
    costs, and the details. In detail, our framework consists of a two-stage system.

    Fig. 4. Conceptual framework of system architecture. The first step of our framework
    is to generate user credentials on the fog node and perform a digital signature
    using the NIST [83] validated ECDSA. Authentication is performed by considering
    the privacy security of each user who logs into the system. The second step is
    to upload the data at the edge of the network to the fog node. At this stage,
    the encrypted data is uploaded to IPFS after user authentication in the fog node
    Fig. 4. All stages were carried out by maintaining a balance between confidentiality
    and computational cost. Remark 1 There is a point we need to pay attention to
    here. Non-traceability does not conflict with traceability in the system. It should
    be noted that traceability is provided only at the request of the relevant user.
    There is no question of anonymity and confidentiality when traceability at the
    user’s request. Therefore, it is apparent that it is seen that traceability and
    privacy, and anonymity will not occur at the same time. However, our framework
    provides traceability and anonymity depending on the user’s request. 3.2.1. System
    architecture The proof-of-concept architecture is designed to save computational
    and storage resources and resource consumption in its journey of transferring
    data from the edge of the network to the decentralized architecture. The architecture
    also consists of 4 main layers: data access, storage, consensus, and application
    layer. The first layer, data access, is the layer that creates a peer-to-peer
    network and connects it to the blockchain network so that heterogeneous data can
    be processed. Next, the data storage or placement layer is designed to store the
    data at the edge of the IoT network in the fog node and forward it to the decentralized
    network after some cryptographic primitives (digital signature, verification)
    and FL. Another layer is the consensus layer. The proof-of-concept layer, which
    occurs depending on the application environment of our architecture, is the layer
    created when metadata from the edge of the IoT network to the fog node is processed
    and transferred to the decentralized layer via the on-chain and off-chain bridge.
    In addition, PPFchain, which provides on-chain-off-chain integrated (HTML, Web3js,
    smart contract) services for the specified this layers, also has an application
    layer that aims to support data at the edge of the IoT network security and to
    provide a secure storage environment for services in other layers (Fig. 5). Table

    3.2.2. Details of framework In the system, a unique user ID ( ) belonging to each
    user and the elliptic curve signed key pair of the users are kept, where u is
    shown as the user. Key pairs are defined as the corresponding user address, the
    signed hash value of the user information, and the user’s digital signature from
    the key pairs. Our system is entered after verifying the relevant address with
    user key pairs. Firstly, the authorized user logs into the architecture with authentication.
    In the data access layer, heterogeneous data at the edge of the IoT network is
    sent to the data and consensus layer, which is the fog node. data is secured using
    FL and existing cryptographic protocols and sent to the distribution layer, the
    decentralized cloud storage system. Then, at the application layer, the value
    is sent to the smart contract. The hash value is obtained by using keccak-256
    [84] hash of values on the contract and sent to the EVM blockchain with the relevant
    user information. Download : Download high-res image (219KB) Download : Download

    for both gas fees and scalability. Therefore, We use off-chain Web3 javascript
    programming integrated into the smart contract. We perform the digital signature
    in the off-chain and the verification in the on-chain. After the hash value of
    the user information, the signed hash value and the signature of this hash value
    are obtained. These values are our public and private keys (alg. 1). The verification
    has been performed if the found address is equivalent to the current address (alg.
    2). Download : Download high-res image (206KB) Download : Download full-size image

    the federated data model technique used for metadata in the fog node layer is

    each participant is kept in cluster (Eq. (3), Eq. (4)). The basic logic in the
    loss value is that the FL model in the dataset minimizes the loss value and sends
    this data to the next layer. The model is iterated until t to minimize the lost
    function (Eq. (5)); (5) For a certain data-sharing request, data transfer is provided
    with the low computational overhead of the FL model, which will minimize data
    loss in the off-chain fog node layer, carried out through the committee that directs
    the consensus process. After the authorized institution authentication, the metadata
    in the fog node layer, the private data obtained by the federated model of certain
    committee members shown in alg. 3, are transmitted to the next decentralized layer.
    The value given by the system is sent to the contract with an event-based smart
    contract. Then the keccak-256 hash value of the value on the contract is taken
    and stored according to the relevant user ID (alg. 4). Download : Download high-res

    results In the previous sections, we discussed how the secure data upload and
    storage process is handled through the blockchain-based data storage system and
    event-based smart contracts integrated into this system. We also discussed what
    kind of weaknesses the systems used in data security and backup create. The proof-of-concept
    architecture has comprised decentralized cloud storage, off-chain-fog-node, and
    on-chain contract integration. First, We have created a web3-based user-friendly
    interface with on-chain-off-chain-fog-node integrated in our proof-of-concept
    architecture. We have implemented a web-based user interface to visualize blockchain
    data and facilitate network interaction. We have integrated the decentralized
    cloud storage architecture into the interface using solidity programming for smart
    contracts and javascript programming for off-chain transactions. We have created
    a pilot application on a local computer using sampled ECS data. We analyzed the
    ECS data using the potentiometric and voltammetric techniques via the connector
    connected with the PalmSense potentiostat device and the PS Trace program (version
    5.5). We performed our measurements by running the ubuntu 18.04 operating system
    on a 10 GB ram and 3.0 GHz Intel processor on the local computer. We have mentioned
    in previous sections that Solidity is a language that can be run on EVM in smart
    contracts. A certain gas fee must be paid to implement the smart contract. Therefore,
    there should not be too much transaction payload in the contract. For this, we
    created an off-chain concept of the smart contract executed in EVM with a compatible
    event-based Web3 javascript API. Thus, the transaction load was minimized by storing
    some of the data in the off-chain-fog node. The execution of our study consists
    of two stages; The first stage is the signing and verification of authorized user
    information, and the second stage is the uploading of heterogeneous data at the
    IoT edge of the network to the decentralized cloud storage and contract, which
    will cover data security over the fog node (Fig. 6). System performance is considered
    through the off-chain integrated blockchain model of transactions used in the
    layers of the architecture, the FL model, the communication cost, and the transaction
    cost of all these in the smart contract. In addition, the use of additional security
    protocols (signature and verification) in the fog node, the number of transition
    information to the decentralized layer in the workflow, the cost of the transaction
    payload in the contract, the total overheads in the data pass time of each device
    in the IoT network are among the performance measures. Download : Download high-res
    image (1MB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Stage 1 digital signature
    and verification of authorized, stage 2 Private metadata uploaded to IPFS. The
    number of requests from each device in the IoT network, the probability of processing
    in the contract, and the time of information passed to other devices gives us
    the overhead result. Therefore, based on the probability of FL and decentralized
    architecture being processed into the smart system in the fog node, the probabilistic-overheads
    result is calculated against the probability in the FL-enabled blockchain-based
    network. Considering the passing time (delay) ( ) of 10 and 20 ms, the probabilistic
    ( ) 0–1 interval value, a result is obtained about the average overheads (ms)
    at every 0.1 probabilistic value in the calculation, as seen in Fig. 7. As can
    be understood from Eq. (6) and Fig. 7, the overheads are impacted by the delays
    that occur in the network. Network delays impact the system, and more requests
    bring more computational load. Moreover, we can say that the latency is impacted
    due to the FL and existing cryptographic protocols used in the fog layer. Increasing
    probability in architecture means more overheads of services. Therefore, lower
    overhead means high performance. Due to the inverse relationship between performance
    and privacy, this problem was minimized with off-chain integration, and system
    performance was ensured. It is also worth noting that the difference in the connections
    at the device layer in the architecture will be different in the overhead. In
    addition, we stored the value of the private data in our smart contract and tested
    it to understand whether the private data stored on IPFS has changed. Depending
    on the user’s request, we trace private data on both the test screen and the web.
    In our study, we also performed cloud-based, storage-based, and event-based comparisons.
    As a result of testing, our framework has positive results regarding decentralization,
    security, and gas usage (Table 4). Download : Download high-res image (161KB)

    systems, scalability is measured over the gas fee according to the number of transactions
    in the contract deployment. We used event-based web3 API for positive scalability
    results. In other words, we got the transaction load over the contract by using
    off-chain. Therefore, event-based contract and off-chain usage give positive results
    in terms of scalability (Fig. 8). Table 4. Performance comparison of different

    complexity and computational complexity when calculating complexity for our proof-of-concept
    model. The transaction costs for the user to publish both transactions and blocks
    depend on the contract’s number of transactions per second (tps) and the consensus
    model. The transaction complexity for the PoW consensus model is O(N) [91]. In
    this framework, one of the important points in computational complexity is digital
    signature and verification. Therefore, we focus on the complexity of these transactions.
    The complexity depends on the key size of the ECDSA. Let the key size be k, signature
    , verification . Because the computational complexity depends on the key size
    in the ECDSA, the digital signature is linear per transaction. The complexity
    per transaction is linear as the verification depends on the digital signature,
    and the same key size is used. In addition, the metadata in the off-chain fog
    node depends on the number of devices at the edge of the network and the transactions
    in the contract protocol with which each device’s data is processed. Therefore,
    the computational complexity of our framework is summarized in Table 5. Table

    in k key size Signature Validation in k key size Validation The transaction in
    the on-chain has a designated smart contract function and a payload containing
    the input value of the function call. Therefore, the data payload is an important
    concept in smart contracts. In this context, when we re-examine the study [12],
    ASDS hash values used in the architecture will increase system security but cause
    data redundancy. In addition, if the IoT network grows, more data will come to
    the system. In this case, it will put more pressure on the blockchain network.
    To examine the data payload of transactions in our architecture, we compared them
    within themselves, using both storage and event-based smart contracts. Using an
    event-based smart contract integrated with off-chain, we reduced the data payload
    of the transactions that occurred, as seen in Table 4 and Fig. 8, thus improving
    system performance. When IoT-based networks increase, there will be less pressure
    on the blockchain network as the data payload in the smart contract is minimized.
    It is possible to evaluate the security of our framework in two stages; The first
    stage is digital signature and verification. The second stage is sending secure
    data to the decentralized cloud with the federated model. Since we use permissioned
    blockchain in our proof-of-concept model, system login is not allowed without
    user authentication. Also, most transactions are executed in an off-chain fog
    node to avoid transaction overload in smart contracts. A digital signature also
    ensures the authenticity and integrity of each transaction. Download : Download

    of performance measurements event-based and storage-based contract. The second
    stage is data security, which we have examined in detail in the previous sections.
    To reduce the transaction payload in terms of scalability, data privacy is provided
    in an off-chain fog node with the federated model, and encrypted data is uploaded
    to IPFS. After completing authorized transactions, an ipfshash value is given
    by the IFPS system. This value can be shared explicitly at the request of the
    user. In the second security, we send the ipfshash data we obtain as proof of
    data immutability to our smart contract in the on-chain using off-chain. We store
    the keccak-256 hash value of the ipfshash data in the contract to be identified
    by the relevant user ID. Therefore, this provides us with traceability and double
    security. As a result, our framework provides both traceability and anonymity.
    However, as discussed in previous sections, anonymity and traceability differ
    depending on the authorized demand. Furthermore, it should not be forgotten that
    traceability and anonymity cannot be realized at the same time. 5. Discussion
    Existing techniques in IoT-based architectures, which are qualitatively given
    in Table 3, have used BT to provide privacy. In addition, some FL-integrated architectures
    have been offered as a suggestion to improve privacy while providing scalability.
    Our model is a refinement of the implementation of the privacy-preserving blockchain-based
    FL method for sensor networks. Our applied model also integrates the off-chain
    fog node, privacy-preserve, low communication costs, and provides scalability.
    In addition, the overheads of the transactions in the application have been quantitatively
    checked. The PPFchain model increases the efficiency of privacy protection, and
    this differentiates our solution. However, FL in the fog node is theoretically
    limited to an integrated model. In addition, with the architecture’s low-latency
    application instance, it has the capacity to implement FL-based real-time that
    can affect performance. Moreover, the architecture is real-time viable given its
    advantages in protecting the privacy of heterogeneous data in the IoT network,
    from healthcare to smart cities and supply chains. 6. Conclusion In this article,
    we have discussed the usability and performance of FL-enabled blockchain-based
    architecture in IoT networks. Although data traceability has been facilitated
    in sensor-IoT-based studies, we have determined that not enough studies provide
    data auditability and confidentiality. Therefore, we have introduced a new FL-enabled
    permissioned blockchain architecture in the IoT-based network that supports end-device
    privacy, prioritizes data and user privacy, and provides anonymity and transparency
    based on user requests. Using sampled ECS data, we have created a framework that
    provides lightweight, scalable, and double-security data collaboration with an
    off-chain fog node integrated federated model, decentralized cloud storage network,
    and smart contract. In the architecture, we also implemented existing encryption
    protocols (digital signing and authentication) on the off-chain fog node to provide
    low-cost and high performance. The architecture also supports interoperability
    and can be used in all sensor-IoT-based applications. Future research is aimed
    at optimizing the latency to achieve better efficiency. Declaration of Competing

  description: Internet of Things (IoT) technology has been incorporated into the
    majority of people’s everyday lives and places of employment due to the quick
    development in information technology. Modern agricultural techniques increasingly
    use the well-known and superior approach of managing a farm known as “smart farming”.
    Utilizing a variety of information and agricultural technologies, crops are observed
    for their general health and productivity. This requires monitoring the condition
    of field crops and looking at many other indicators. The goal of smart agriculture
    is to reduce the amount of money spent on agricultural inputs while keeping the
    quality of the final product constant. The Internet of Things (IoT) has made smart
    agriculture possible through data collection and storage techniques. For example,
    modern irrigation systems use effective sensor networks to collect field data
    for the best plant irrigation. Smart agriculture will become more susceptible
    to cyber-attacks as its reliance on the IoT ecosystem grows, because IoT networks
    have a large number of nodes but limited resources, which makes security a difficult
    issue. Hence, it is crucial to have an intrusion detection system (IDS) that can
    address such challenges. In this manuscript, an IoT-based privacy-preserving anomaly
    detection model for smart agriculture has been proposed. The motivation behind
    this work is twofold. Firstly, ensuring data privacy in IoT-based agriculture
    is of the utmost importance due to the large volumes of sensitive information
    collected by IoT devices, including on environmental conditions, crop health,
    and resource utilization data. Secondly, the timely detection of anomalies in
    smart agriculture systems is critical to enable proactive interventions, such
    as preventing crop damage, optimizing resource allocation, and ensuring sustainable
    farming practices. In this paper, we propose a privacy-encoding-based enhanced
    deep learning framework for the difficulty of data encryption and intrusion detection.
    In terms of data encoding, a novel method of a sparse capsule-auto encoder (SCAE)
    is proposed along with feature selection, feature mapping, and feature normalization.
    An SCAE is used to convert information into a new encrypted format in order to
    prevent deduction attacks. An attention-based gated recurrent unit neural network
    model is proposed to detect the intrusion. An AGRU is an advanced version of a
    GRU which is enhanced by an attention mechanism. In the results section, the proposed
    model is compared with existing deep learning models using two public datasets.
    Parameters such as recall, precision, accuracy, and F1-score are considered. The
    proposed model has accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score of 99.9%, 99.7%,
    99.9%, and 99.8%, respectively. The proposed method is compared using a variety
    of machine learning techniques such as the deep neural network (DNN), convolutional
    neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), and long short-term memory
    (LSTM).

    humanity greatly and boost a country’s GDP [1]. Better farming and agriculture
    management require technological support and breakthroughs [2]. To enhance the
    quality and output of agricultural goods at a lower cost and with less human involvement,
    a group of tactics known as “smart agriculture” are used [3]. Due to the continuous
    monitoring of numerous elements in the agricultural sector, smart farming is totally
    based on Internet of Things technology [4], with numerous qualities including
    water table and the development of plant and soil properties. Machine learning
    (ML) algorithms are efficiently used to increase crop yield and lower the risk
    of crop damage [5]. The use of data analytics to make judgments and suggest the
    best crops for production in the agricultural sector is also significant. More
    than 80% of people on the planet have access to reliable Internet [6]. Spot messaging,
    immersive two-way video chat, chance mobile contact, social networking, voice-over-Internet
    protocol (VoIP), mobile phone calls, and e-commerce websites are just a few of
    the ways in which technology has impacted modern life [7]. IoT is a technology
    that serves as a future online platform for communication related to technology
    and the environment. The technology is allegedly safer and more affordable in
    several industries, including agriculture. With the use of intelligent devices
    and tools, farms can be tracked and monitored autonomously in the area of agriculture
    with less human participation As it helps farmers to make judgments about crop
    management and dynamic farming, smart agriculture demonstrates interest in academia
    [8]. Crop production may be increased by smart farming, which can also raise a
    nation’s GDP rate. Crop output is reliant on the existence of vermin and plant
    disease [9]. Pests used to hide behind leaves during the day to escape the warmness,
    and by dusk or dark, they were visible on leaves [10]. Therefore, it is too difficult
    to notice their presence throughout the day. Farmers may cause bugs to spread
    and multiply uncontrollably if they begin to harm pests [11]. In order to get
    rid of pests and reduce agricultural damage, a lot of pesticides must be sprayed
    on crops [12]. Additionally, if vegetables are sprayed with pesticides while they
    are still growing, the pesticides remain in the plant even after washing. When
    pests cause severe crop diseases, crops can occasionally become infected with
    bacteria. To stop the spread of bacteria, the afflicted crops must be thoroughly
    cleaned. Without effectively addressing the pest problem, this approach will harm
    the entire agricultural production [13]. As a result, the researchers must consider
    the problem and should use IoT and ML technologies to improve crop growth and
    insect detection in agricultural fields [14]. Sensors, connectivity, gateways,
    location, data analytics, and IoT components are essential components for smart
    agriculture [15]. By gathering crucial data on numerous agricultural characteristics
    including fertilizer level, soil moisture, and water level, sensors are utilized
    to promote accurate farming. Network connectivity, including WIFI, cellular, and
    ZigBee, is referred to as connectivity. Microcontrollers are referred to as gateways.
    Arduino, Device Hive, and Raspberry PI are examples of IoT components. Four stages
    make up the core operating structure of smart agriculture. The sensors first collect
    data regarding the agricultural elements necessary for a crop’s development [16].
    To sense various agricultural characteristics, numerous sensors are utilized.
    The demands and shortfalls in agriculture are then determined by mapping the sensed
    data with additional criteria ] ML algorithms are used to find a solution for
    the given information. The cycle of smart agriculture is continued in this way.
    Security is regarded as a serious issue in IoT-ML-enabled smart agriculture. Location
    monitoring, data theft, known-key assaults, data pollution, data injection, session
    hijacking, cyber-agroterrorism, malicious code attacks, and repudiation attacks
    are just a few of the attacks that can happen in an agricultural setting [17].
    Data encryption, hashing, noise mixing, message authentication codes, location
    concealment, identity-based cryptography, digital signatures, multi-factor authentication,
    group signatures, fault-tolerance, blind signatures, access control, traceable
    meta-data, and pseudonyms are the main defenses against these attacks [18]. For
    secured data transmission, these solutions must be taken into account. If a fast
    DDoS attack occurs before the system has been trained or the detection has been
    performed, it can be difficult to prevent the attack or minimize the damage caused
    by it. By over-provisioning the network bandwidth capacity, the system can better
    withstand DDoS attacks [19]. This can be achieved by upgrading the network infrastructure
    or using traffic filtering services provided by Internet service providers (ISPs).
    Configuring firewalls and routers to drop traffic from known malicious IP addresses
    or blocking traffic to specific ports can help to prevent or mitigate DDoS attacks.
    Cloud-based protection services can provide protection against DDoS attacks by
    absorbing or mitigating attack traffic. These services can be implemented quickly
    and are often more effective than traditional on-premise solutions. By reducing
    the attack surface of the system, it becomes more difficult for attackers to exploit
    vulnerabilities. This can be achieved by removing unnecessary services or protocols,
    patching vulnerabilities, and implementing access controls [20]. By training an
    attention-based gated recurrent unit neural network (AGRU) model to detect DDoS
    attacks, the system can quickly identify and respond to attacks. The model can
    be trained on historical data or using a simulated environment, enabling it to
    quickly adapt to new attack types. While it is always preferable to have a detection
    system in place before an attack occurs, the measures outlined above can help
    mitigate the damage caused by a fast DDoS attack that occurs before the system
    has been trained or the detection has been performed. Motivation An IoT-based
    privacy-preserving anomaly detection system in smart agriculture is used to improve
    crop yield and reduce wastage while maintaining data privacy. These data can be
    used to optimize farming practices and detect any anomalies that could potentially
    harm the crop yield. Therefore, a privacy-preserving anomaly detection system
    that can securely process data without revealing sensitive information is essential.
    Moreover, using attention-based gated recurrent unit (GRU) networks can help to
    improve the accuracy of anomaly detection. Attention mechanisms enable the model
    to focus on specific features of the data that are relevant for detecting anomalies.
    The gated recurrent unit (GRU) network is a type of recurrent neural network that
    is particularly effective in processing sequential data. Therefore, an IoT-based
    privacy-preserving anomaly detection system using an attention-based gated recurrent
    unit network can provide farmers and agricultural organizations with a reliable
    and secure way to monitor crops and optimize farming practices, while protecting
    sensitive data. These are the factors that motivated us to conduct this research
    work. Contributions: The first step in building the model is to collect data from
    IoT devices deployed in the smart agriculture system. These devices can include
    sensors for measuring environmental parameters, crop health, soil conditions,
    weather data, etc. The collected data form the basis for anomaly detection. Preserving
    the privacy of sensitive data is crucial in any IoT-based system. Privacy-preserving
    techniques such as data anonymization, encryption, or differential privacy can
    be employed to protect personal and confidential information while ensuring that
    data retain their utility for anomaly detection. These techniques can help in
    compliance with privacy regulations and prevent unauthorized access. Data are
    changed into a new encoded format using the sparse capsule-auto encoder approach
    to make them more resistant to attacks. The AGRU neural network model is utilized
    for detecting anomalies in the privacy-preserved data. An AGRU extends the capabilities
    of the traditional GRU model by incorporating an attention mechanism. The attention
    process allows the model to focus on important features or time steps, effectively
    capturing temporal dependencies and identifying abnormal patterns in the data.
    The AGRU model is trained on labeled data, distinguishing between normal and anomalous
    instances. The trained AGRU model is evaluated using appropriate performance metrics
    such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The model’s performance is
    assessed on both training and testing datasets to ensure its generalization ability.
    If necessary, the model can be refined via hyper parameter tuning or employing
    ensemble techniques to further improve its anomaly detection capabilities. Section
    2 represents the associated work, including the table that explains the benefits
    and drawbacks of the current methodologies. Section 3 shows the proposed methodology
    and discusses the proposed model with equations, figures, etc. Section 4 shows
    the findings from a comparison of the proposed model to existing models using
    graphs, tables, etc. The conclusion, which includes future scope and references,
    is found in Section 5. 2. Related Works The existing methods used to enhance the
    agricultural domain are discussed below. IoT-driven data mining for smart crop
    prediction in the peasant agricultural sector was presented by Mendoza et al.
    [21]. The approach makes use of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors to record agricultural
    characteristics and collect information from peasants via mobile applications
    about the volume of crop production. The solution incorporates data storage services,
    IoT message hubs, ML models, and IoT data analytics along with data mining concepts.
    The method’s advantage is that it makes use of less expensive IoT sensors, data
    analysis services, and well-known data storage devices. The method’s drawback
    is that the system requires routine maintenance. An ML-based strategy for precise
    agriculture in 5G-based IoT was presented by Murugamani et al. [22]. The proposed
    approach involves assessing soil quality and looking for diseases in cotton leaves.
    Using regression-based techniques, cotton leaf disease can be identified and classified.
    The farmer received information about the crop’s infection via a mobile application.
    Raspberry Pi served as an interface for four different kinds of sensors. The process
    was inexpensive. Due to the presence of big particles in sandy soil, the method’s
    accuracy was limited. The idea of the detection and classification of intrusions
    into IoT networks used in agriculture was put forth by Raghuvanshi et al. [23].
    By using principal component analysis, features from the pre-processed NSL-KDD
    dataset were extracted. The pre-processed data were then classified using ML methods
    such as linear regression, support vector machine (SVM), and random forest. The
    method’s benefit is that it makes sure that the IoT network is secure. The method’s
    low categorization accuracy is a drawback. Kethineni et al. [24] developed a powerful
    intrusion detection system for smart agriculture DDoS attack detection. Data normalization
    and label encoding were used to pre-process the gathered data. The CNN algorithm
    was merged with the Bi-GRU model, which can both detect and categorize intrusions.
    The attention mechanism in the BiGRU model looks for the most important characteristics
    that can be used to recognize the DDoS attack. The wild horse optimization algorithm
    was also used to improve the model’s classification accuracy. Nevertheless, only
    some IoT attacks were detected using this method. Ferrag et al. [25] introduced
    CNNs, deep neural networks, and recurrent neural networks. The effectiveness of
    deep learning and machine learning methods for cyber-security in agriculture 4.0
    was specifically evaluated. Using two brand-new real traffic datasets, the CICDDoS2019
    dataset and the TON IoT dataset, the efficiency of each model was examined for
    both binary and multi-class classifications. For multiple-dimensional time series
    data produced using the smart agricultural Internet of Things, Cheng et al. [26]
    suggested a GAN-based anomaly detection algorithm. For the purpose of identifying
    anomalies, the model employed reconstruction techniques after learning the distribution
    patterns of typical data using the GAN structure. An upgraded improved LSTM network
    was taken into consideration to serve as the foundation for the GAN because time
    series data have temporal dependence and there may be a potential correlation
    between multiple variables. The encoder–decoder was chosen as the GAN generator
    to address the generator inversion problem. By doing this, the requirement for
    real-time anomaly detection was effectively addressed while the computation time
    was also decreased. However, the time window size option was the most important
    factor to be taken into account; even if the time window was extended, the model’s
    performance decreased. A serial–parallel convolutional bidirectional gated recurrent
    network model incorporating ensemble classifiers was a flexible and systematic
    hybrid model proposed by Zhang et al. [27]. In terms of identifying smart contract
    vulnerabilities, the model demonstrated excellent performance gains. A serial–parallel
    convolution (SPCNN) was also suggested as a viable option for a hybrid model.
    By preserving the temporal structure and geographic location data, it extracts
    characteristics from the input sequence for multivariate combinations. The model’s
    resilience increased throughout the classification stage by using the ensemble
    classifier. However, the technique struggles to detect integer overflow vulnerabilities.
    A more scalable method of identifying smart contract vulnerabilities was presented
    by Zhang et al. [28] using a multiple-objective detection neural network (MODNN).
    Without specialized or predetermined information, MODNN can validate 12 types
    of vulnerabilities, including 10 known risks, and find additional unknown types
    using implicit characteristics and multi-objective detection (MOD) techniques.
    Because of its great scalability and support for simultaneous vulnerability detection,
    it does not require separate models to be trained for different types of vulnerabilities,
    saving both a lot of time and money. The absence of smart contract vulnerability
    datasets was also addressed in this work by the creation of a smart contract-crawler
    (SCC). An experimental review of neural-based approaches for network intrusion
    management was presented by Di Mauro et al. [29]. A critical comparison of approaches
    shares a common paradigm including intrusion detection, such as weightless neural
    networks. Then, the CIC-IDS-2017/2018 dataset was utilized, wherein single-class
    cases (benign vs. malign) and multi-class cases (n benign vs. malign1... vs. malignk)
    were deemed to be important. The network abnormal traffic detection model based
    on semi-supervised deep reinforcement learning was presented by Dong, S et al.
    [30]. A semi-supervised double deep Q-network (SSDDQN)-based optimization model
    for network anomalous traffic identification was dependent on the double deep
    Q-network. In SSDDQN, the current network adopts the auto encoder to rebuild the
    traffic features. A deep neural network was applied as a classifier. The NSL-KDD
    and AWID datasets were used for training with testing and made for a comprehensive
    comparison. Deep learning for the categorization of Sentinel-2 image time series
    was presented by Pelletier, C. et al. [31]. The two leading deep learning approaches
    for handling temporal data, recurrent neural networks and temporal convolutional
    neural networks, were used Rangwani, D et al. [32], Vangala, A et al. [33], Vidyashree
    et al. [34]. For precise and current land cover mapping across huge areas, satellite
    image time series have shown to be indispensable Chen, M et al. [35], Gutpa, A
    et al. [36], Bakthavatchalam et al. [37]. The majority of SITS-related writings
    have emphasized the use of conventional classification techniques such as random
    forests Colombo-Mendoza, L.O et al. [38], Murugamani, C et al. [39], Raghuvanshi,
    A et al. [40]. However, with the increasing adoption of these technologies, there
    are several security issues that need to be considered to prevent privacy leaks
    and other potential consequences. A major security issue in smart agriculture
    is the risk of data breaches. Farmers and agricultural companies collect and store
    sensitive data on crop yields, weather patterns, and soil conditions, which can
    be valuable to cyber-criminals. If these data fall into the wrong hands, they
    can be used to manipulate markets, cause crop failures, and other harmful activities.
    Another issue is the vulnerability of the devices and networks used in smart agriculture.
    These devices, such as sensors and drones, are often connected to the Internet
    and can be hacked, leaving the entire system open to attacks. Malware and other
    malicious software can also be introduced into the system through these devices,
    compromising sensitive data. The consequences of privacy leakage in smart agriculture
    can be significant. For instance, if the data collected from smart agriculture
    systems were to be leaked, it could lead to decreased confidence in the industry
    and ultimately a decline in the adoption of these technologies. Additionally,
    farmers could face serious financial losses if their sensitive data, such as crop
    yields or pricing data, were to fall into the hands of competitors or malicious
    actors. Overall, it is crucial to ensure that smart agriculture systems are designed
    with security and privacy. A comparison with the state-of the art techniques is
    shown in Table 1. Table 1. Comparison with state-of the art techniques. 3. Proposed
    Methodology Because of the development and widespread usage of Internet of Things
    (IoT) devices, precision agriculture is revolutionizing traditional farming methods.
    The Internet is an open channel that the agricultural and IoT industries utilize
    to help farmers to collect, process, monitor, and make informed decisions about
    their farms. However, using the Internet exposes users to a variety of risks,
    including security risks (such as carrying out cyber-attacks), data privacy risks
    (such as inference attacks and data poisoning), etc. The use of traditional centralized
    security methods has drawbacks in terms of scalability, verifiability, traceability,
    and single point of failure. We proposed a privacy-encoding-based enhanced deep
    learning framework that uses an intrusion detection model, transformation technique,
    and perturbation-based encoding. The secrecy is considered to be the unprocessed
    data produced via IoT-based smart agriculture in this study. The four steps of
    privacy were used here. Feature selection, feature mapping, feature normalization,
    and feature encoding were used for a normal strategy, along with intrusion detection.
    The feature selection method uses processing time and offers more dependable and
    superior privacy. Data are changed into a new encoded format using the sparse
    capsule-auto encoder approach to make them more resistant to attacks. In order
    to detect intrusions, attention-based gated recurrent unit neural networks are
    used with encoded data. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the suggested framework
    for recognizing normal and attack patterns, the ToN-IoT dataset and IoT Botnet
    were used to test and train the proposed method. The whole framework is depicted
    in Figure 1. Figure 1. Framework of proposed model. 3.1. Strategies for Detecting
    Intrusions A piece of equipment or program known as the intrusion detection system
    (IDS) monitors online activity and guards authorized network users against illegal
    actions that risk availability, integrity, and security. The intrusion detection
    system can be generically categorized according to two factors: (I) installation
    and (II) detection method. Host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDSs) and
    network-based intrusion detection systems (NIDSs) are the first two categories
    into which IDS-basis deployment is split. The host-based intrusion detection scheme
    was created in the host computer (device/client). Internal invasion is less likely
    with HIDS, while NIDS records and examines the movement of detected packets. Second,
    there are two categories of IDS-based detection techniques: (I) knowledge- or
    signature-based (SIDS) and (II) anomaly-based (AIDS). To identify an active attack,
    SIDS uses an authentication system. Although SIDS has a high probability of recognition,
    it cannot detect newly occurring disruptive events in the network. In contrast,
    in AIDS, typical computer system behavior is represented using statistical, machine
    learning, or knowledge-based techniques. When AIDS observes a discrepancy between
    the proposed model behavior and the actual behavior, the discrepancy is interpreted
    as an intrusion. 3.2. Feature Mapping IoT feature values can be found in both
    categorical and numerical forms in network traffic. Categorical values are transformed
    into numerical values using the mapping approach. For instance, the ToN-IoT dataset’s
    protocol feature value is transformed into ordered numbers such as 1, 2, etc.
    This is due to the privacy-preservation mechanism’s ability to handle numerical
    attributes, as seen below. 3.3. Feature Selection To find the most diverse characteristics
    for the available dataset, the feature selection procedure was used. Better characteristics
    increase the likelihood of accurate classification. Reducing duplicate and repeated
    components from IoT network traffic accelerates processing while improving detection
    techniques and privacy. The proposed model chooses its features based on a reciprocal
    information-based process. The quantity of information gained from the feature
    𝑓 1 through the feature 𝑓 2 is approximately calculated between the two random
    characteristics 𝑓 1 and 𝑓 2 . Using the below equation, the mutual information
    ( 𝑀 𝐼 ) function was computed (1). 𝑀 𝐼 ( 𝑓 1 ; 𝑓 2 )= ∫ ∫ 𝑃( 𝑓 1 , 𝑓 2 ) 𝑃( 𝑓
    1 )𝑃( 𝑓 2 ) 1 2 𝑓 1 ∫ ∫ 𝑓 2 𝑃( 𝑓 1 , 𝑓 2 )𝑙𝑜𝑔 (1) where the general probability
    function is given by 𝑃( 𝑓 1 , 𝑓 2 ) of function 𝑓 1 and 𝑓 2 . 𝑃( 𝑓 1 ) and 𝑃(
    𝑓 1 ) are the marginal density functions. The mutual information between the target
    variable 𝑓 2 and the subset of the selected features 𝑍 will be optimized when
    selecting a feature. 𝑀         =𝑎𝑟𝑔 𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑀 𝑈(𝑍; 𝑓 2 ),𝑠.𝑡.|𝑀|=𝑋 (2) 𝑋 is
    the total number of characteristics that were chosen and employed in the model’s
    development. To choose the most advantageous number of features, each of the aforementioned
    processes were carried out with respect to the training dataset. 3.4. Feature
    Normalization This technique transforms feature data to a common scale between
    0 and 1. The maximum value of a feature is changed to 1, while the smallest value
    is transformed to 0. Deep learning methods’ training times are sped up in this
    way. The min–max normalization method is employed in privacy-encoding-based enhanced
    deep learning architecture. 𝑁 𝑓 = 𝑓− 𝑓 𝑚𝑖𝑛 𝑓𝑚𝑖 𝑛 𝑚𝑎𝑥 (3) 𝑓 denotes the feature
    that needs to be shrunk and 𝑁 𝑓 denotes the new feature; 𝑓 𝑚𝑎𝑥 represents the
    highest value and 𝑓 𝑚𝑖𝑛 defines the lowest value for each given feature. 3.5.
    Feature Encoding The auto encoder is used to encrypt the feature normalized data.
    The sparse capsule-auto encoder (SCAE) is the suggested auto encoder which is
    discussed in the following section. 3.5.1. Auto Encoder (AE) An auto encoder is
    a three-layer symmetric neural network that extracts the relevant features from
    unlabeled high-dimensional complex input utilizing system design that has been
    enhanced via unsupervised layer-by-layer greedy learning. A typical AE’s construction
    is depicted in Figure 2. Encoding and decoding refer to the operations that are
    performed from the hidden layer to the output and from the input to the hidden
    layer, respectively. The decoding reconstructs the input data under the extracted
    features after the encoding has extracted features from the dataset. Figure 2.
    The structure of an auto encoder. In order to create 𝑙 significant features 𝑥=
    [ 𝑥 1 , 𝑥 2 , 𝑥 3 ,… 𝑥 𝑘 ] 𝐶 ∈ 𝑅 𝑘×1 from an unlabeled training sample 𝑠= [ 𝑠
    1 , 𝑠 2 , 𝑠 3 ,… 𝑠 𝑙 ] 𝐶 ∈ 𝑅 𝑙×1 using the whole connection layer, the input is
    translated by the encoder to the hidden state. Then, using the same technique,
    the decoder creates the output 𝑥 ̂ = [ 𝑥 ̂ 1 , 𝑥 ̂ 2 , 𝑥 ̂ 3 ,… 𝑥 ̂ 𝑘 ] 𝐶 ∈ 𝑅
    𝑘×1 from the feature 𝑠 . Equations (4) and (5) are descriptions of the encoding
    and decoding processes, respectively: 𝑠=𝑓(𝑥)= 𝛷 𝑎𝑓 ( 𝑊 (1) 𝑥+ 𝑏 𝑎 ) (4) 𝑥 ̂ =𝑔(𝑠)=
    𝛷 𝑎𝑓 ( 𝑊 (2) 𝑠+ 𝑏 𝑏 ) (5) where 𝑊 (1) and 𝑊 (2) are the entire connection layer
    weight matrices, 𝑏 𝑎 and 𝑏 𝑏 are the full connection layer bias matrices, and
    𝛷 𝑎𝑓 activates a nonlinear activation process made up of a number of different
    types, such as the ReLU, TanH, and sigmoid. The intrinsic characteristics S of
    the input are acquired as the reconstruction loss in the parameter set, which
    is constantly minimized { 𝑊 (1) , 𝑏 𝑎 , 𝑊 (2) , 𝑏 𝑏 } . The mean square error
    (MSE) loss function and cross-entropy (CE) loss function are frequently used to
    calculate the reconstruction error among the input vector 𝑥 and reconstruction
    vector 𝑥 ̂ . For a single training dataset 𝑥= [ 𝑥 1 , 𝑥 2 , 𝑥 3 ,… 𝑥 𝑘 ] 𝐶 ∈ 𝑅
    𝑘×1 , the CE loss function is exhibited in (6), and the MSE loss function is exhibited
    in (7): 𝐷 𝑐𝑒 =− ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑘 [ 𝑥 𝑖 𝑙𝑜𝑔( 𝑥 ̂ 𝑖 )+(1− 𝑥 𝑖 )𝑙𝑜𝑔(1− 𝑥 ̂ 𝑖 )] (6) 𝐷 𝑚𝑠𝑒
    = 1 2𝑘 ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑘 ‖ 𝑥 ̂ 𝑖 − 𝑥 ̂ 𝑖 ‖ 2 (7) 3.5.2. Capsule Auto Encoder The capsule
    auto encoder is used in addition to the sparse auto encoder to improve efficiency
    and strengthen attack prevention because the sparse auto encoder cannot defend
    the smart agriculture database by itself. The conventional capsule auto encoder
    has two main modules which are the object capsule auto encoder (OCAE) and part
    capsule auto encoder (PCAE). To begin, the PCAE employs a CNN to extract the pose,
    presence, and features of each component of the objects in the input image. After
    encoding the scattered components produced by the PCAE into bigger objects using
    a set transformer, the OCAE outputs the presence probabilities of all of the potential
    objects. The classifier then outputs a classification outcome based on the output
    of the OCAE. Figure 3 illustrates the CAE architecture, which is comparable to
    that of the normal AE but uses a different calculation method. Figure 3. Structure
    of CAE. The encoder translates the input into a feature layer to produce the feature
    set 𝑠= [ 𝑠 𝐶 1 , 𝑠 𝐶 2 ] 𝐶 = [[ 𝑠 1 ,… 𝑠 𝑘/2 ],[ 𝑠 𝑘/2+1 ,…, 𝑠 𝑘 ]] 𝐶 ∈ 𝑅 𝑘×1
    for an unlabeled training sample 𝑥= [ 𝑥 1 , 𝑥 2 , 𝑥 3 ,… 𝑥 𝑘 ] 𝐶 ∈ 𝑅 𝑘×1 , and
    the decoder subsequently produces the output 𝑥 ̂ = [ 𝑥 ̂ 1 , 𝑥 ̂ 2 , 𝑥 ̂ 3 ,…
    𝑥 ̂ 𝑘 ] 𝐶 ∈ 𝑅 𝑘×1 . Equations (8) and (9) can be used to explain the encoding
    and decoding methods: 𝑠= [ 𝑠 𝐶 1 , 𝑠 𝐶 2 ] 𝐶 =𝑓(𝑥)= 𝛷 𝑎𝑓 ( 𝑊 (1) 𝑥+ 𝑏 𝑎 )= 𝛷 𝑎𝑓
    ( [ 𝑊 𝐶(1) 1 , 𝑊 𝐶(1) 2 ] 𝐶 + [ 𝑏 𝑊 (1) 1 , 𝑏 𝑊 (1) 2 ] 𝐶 ) (8) 𝑥 ̂ =𝑔(𝑠)= 𝛷 𝑎𝑓
    ( 𝑊 (2) 𝑠+ 𝑏 𝑏 )= 𝛷 𝑎𝑓 ( 𝑊 (2) [ 𝑠 𝐶 1 , 𝑠 𝐶 2 ] 𝐶 + 𝑏 𝑊 (2) ) (9) where 𝑊 (1)
    ∈ 𝑅 𝑘×𝑘 and 𝑊 (2) ∈ 𝑅 𝑘×𝑘 are their weight matrices and 𝑏 𝑊 (1) ∈ 𝑅 𝑘×1 and 𝑏
    𝑊 (2) ∈ 𝑅 𝑘×1 are the entire connection layers’ bias vectors. The bias vectors
    and weight matrices for the vector feature 𝑠 1 are 𝑊 (1) ∈ 𝑅 (𝑘/2)×𝑘 and 𝑏 𝑊 (1)
    1 ∈ 𝑅 (𝑘/2)×1 , respectively. The weight matrices along the bias vectors of vector
    feature 𝑠 2 are 𝑊 (1) ∈ 𝑅 (𝑘/2)×𝑘 and 𝑏 𝑊 (1) 2 ∈ 𝑅 (𝑘/2)×1 , respectively. Both
    CAE and conventional AE go through the same training process. As a result, by
    minimizing the loss function, the ideal parameter set { 𝑊 (1) , 𝑏 𝑊 (1) , 𝑊 (2)
    , 𝑏 𝑊 (2) } and also the intrinsic vector features are achieved. As demonstrated
    in (10), the MSE loss function is employed in this study. 𝐷 𝑚𝑠𝑒 = 1 2𝑘 ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑘
    ‖ 𝑥 ̂ 𝑖 − 𝑥 ̂ 𝑖 ‖ 2 = 1 2𝑘 ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑘 ‖ 𝑥 ̂ 𝑖 − 𝛷 𝑎𝑓 ( 𝑊 (2) 𝛷 𝑎𝑓 ( 𝑊 (1) 𝑥+ 𝑏 𝑊
    (1) )+ 𝑏 𝑊 (2) )‖ 2 (10) CAE can extract two vector features { 𝑠 1 , 𝑠 2 } during
    training, whereas normal AE can only extract 𝑙 scalar features { 𝑠 1 , 𝑠 2 , 𝑠
    3 … 𝑠 𝑙 } . Vector features have been shown to exceed scalar features in classification
    situations. 3.5.3. Sparse Capsule-Auto Encoder (SCAE) After choosing the features
    using the MI-based feature selection procedure, the reduced features are extracted
    from the provided raw data utilizing the SCAE technique. In SCAE, the original
    data are transmitted over a weight link to the hidden layer. To recreate the results,
    the hidden layer’s activation value is mapped to an output layer. By carefully
    changing the weight that is meant to provide proper data representations, the
    reconstruction error is reduced. The total number of concealed nodes is widely
    distributed to prevent excessive node activation. Additionally, the sparse penalty
    restriction is included to restrict “active” neurons, and if a neuron’s output
    equals 1, the auto encoder (AE) transforms into a SCAE during application; otherwise,
    the neuron is referred to as “inactive”. Consider the dataset 𝐷 𝑆 𝑖 =[𝑑 𝑠 𝑖𝑗 ,𝑑
    𝑠 22 ,…𝑑 𝑠 𝑚𝑛 ] , where 𝑖=1,…𝑚 indicates a number of samples and 𝑗=1,…𝑛 indicates
    the dimension of samples. Using Equation (11), it is possible to determine the
    activation ℎ 𝑙 of the hidden layer node. ℎ 𝑙 =𝑎 𝑓 𝑙 ( 𝑏 (1) + 𝑊 (1) 𝑑𝑡) (11) where
    𝑊 (1) stands for the weight connecting the input and hidden layers and 𝑏 (1) represents
    the bias. The “elu” function, which represents the activation function, is employed.
    To decode the hidden layer and obtain original data, Equation (12) determines
    the weight relationship between both the output and hidden layer. 𝑟 ̂ =𝑎 𝑓 𝑙 (
    𝑏 (2) + 𝑊 (2) ℎ 𝑙 ) (12) 𝑟 ̂ stands for reconstructed data. 𝑊 (2) stands for the
    weight among the output and hidden layer, while 𝑏 (2) stands for the bias. In
    AE, minimizing the reconstruction error 𝑅 𝑙 , which may be calculated as variance
    between the input data 𝑑 𝑡 and reconstructing data 𝑟 ̂ , the parameter set is
    indicated through 𝜀={ 𝑊 (1) , 𝑏 (1) , 𝑊 (2) , 𝑏 (2) } . Using Equation (13), the,
    𝑑 𝑖 , 𝑖=1,…𝑚 cost functioning of the auto encoder is calculated for the dataset.
    𝐻 𝐸 (𝜀)= ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑚 𝑅 𝑙 ( 𝑑 𝑡(𝑖) , 𝑟 ̂ 𝑖 ) (13) The hidden unit’s mean activation
    is 𝐻=1… 𝑗 𝑙 , which, in the context of SCAE, can be calculated using Equation
    (13), and it is pre-summated to be near to ‘0’, indicating that the bulk of neurons
    in the hidden layer are “deactivated”. To penalize 𝜗 𝑘 , the sparse penalty is
    presented if the established sparse parameter 𝜗 significantly deviates from it.
    When determining the difference between the derived sparse parameter 𝜗 𝑘 and 𝜗
    using Equation (14), Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence is applied. 𝜗 𝑘 = 1 𝑚 ∑
    𝑖=1 𝑚 (𝑎 𝑓 𝑙 ( 𝑏 𝑘 + 𝑊 𝑖𝑘 𝑑 𝑡𝑖 )) (14) ∑ 𝑘=1 𝑗 𝑙 𝑃𝑄(𝜗‖ 𝜗 𝑘 )= ∑ 𝑘=1 𝑗 𝑙 𝜗𝑙𝑜𝑔 𝜗
    𝜗 𝑘 +(1−𝜗)𝑙𝑜𝑔 (1−𝜗) (1− 𝜗 𝑘 ) (15) Nevertheless, Equation (16) can be used to
    define the total cost function and sparse constraint for SCAE. 𝐻 𝑆𝐸 (𝜀)= ∑ 𝑖=1
    𝑚 𝑅 𝑙 ( 𝑑 𝑡(𝑖) , 𝑟 ̂ 𝑖 )+ ∑ 𝑘=1 𝑗 𝑙 𝑃𝑄(𝜗‖ 𝜗 𝑘 ) (16) where 𝐻 𝐸 (𝜀) and the 𝜀 parameter
    are tuned for the sparse penalty. The back propagation algorithm’s original weight
    and bias are updated to resolve the partial derivative of 𝐻 𝑆𝐸 to 𝜀 and lower
    the cost function. A trained SCAE network is acquired when the parameter has been
    upgraded. The product of the existence probability of part capsules and the value
    of the learned alpha channel for each determine the mixing probabilities of various
    components. The pre-training procedure in the suggested method aids SCAE in learning
    many nonlinear transformations, capturing the major changes in frequency spectra.
    After nonlinear transformation, the feature vector is directly truncated to ensure
    that the two features are distinct from one another and that the following features
    are diverse. The SCAE is then assisted in finding the substantially discriminative
    data from various stages throughout the fine-tuning phase, thus enhancing the
    independence of the generated vector features. The hidden layer’s activation value
    is seen as an extracted feature. 3.6. Intrusion Detection Using AGRU In the proposed
    approach, the intrusion detection stage is crucial. An attention-based AGRU (Algorithm
    1) was employed for detection. The following section gives a more detailed examination.
    Attention-Based Gated Recurrent Unit Neural Network Algorithm (AGRU) A traditional
    feed-forward neural network has evolved into a recurrent neural network (RNN).
    The data flow in the conventional neural network paradigm is unidirectional, that
    is, starting with the input layer and then moving via the hidden layer to the
    output layer. Figure 4 depicts the reset gate 𝑅 𝑖 and update gate 𝑈 𝑖 , the two
    gate structure components that make up the GRU. The current moment set of the
    hidden states is where the flow of information about the hidden states from the
    previous moment in the current set is controlled by the 𝑅 𝑖 gate. The 𝑈 𝑖 gate
    is used to govern how much irrelevant content from the previous state has to be
    forgotten and to decide the amount of the hidden state that should be kept. Figure
    4. Gated recurrent unit neural network. In this study, we utilized 𝑅 𝑖 to signify
    the reset gate and 𝑈 𝑖 to denote the update gate, as illustrated in Figure 4.
    After that, the GRU learning model can be explained as follows. First, in a GRU,
    past information ( 𝑠 𝑖 ) and present information ( 𝑦 𝑖 ) define the reset gate
    and update gate. 𝑅 𝑖 =𝜎( 𝑊 𝑅 •[ 𝑠 𝑖−1 , 𝑦 𝑖 ]) (17) 𝑈 𝑖 =𝜎( 𝑊 𝑈 •[ 𝑠 𝑖−1 , 𝑦 𝑖
    ]) (18) Algorithm 1: AGRU Reset gate and update gate are given as follows: 𝑅 𝑖
    =𝜎( 𝑊 𝑅 •[ 𝑠 𝑖−1 , 𝑦 𝑖 ])                                                                                                                            (17)
    𝑈 𝑖 =𝜎( 𝑊 𝑈 •[ 𝑠 𝑖−1 , 𝑦 𝑖 ])                                                                                                                            (18)
    The reset gate, which controls a GRU’s candidate set, operates according to the
    following formula: 𝑠 𝑖 ̃ =𝑡𝑎𝑛ℎ( 𝑊 𝑠 •[ 𝑅 𝑖 × 𝑠 𝑖−1 , 𝑦 𝑖 ])                                                                                                                  (19)
    Third, the GRU updates 𝑠 𝑖 using the following formula during the update memory
    phase: 𝑠 𝑖 =(1− 𝑈 𝑖 )× 𝑠 𝑖−1 + 𝑈 𝑖 × 𝑠 𝑖 ̃                                                                                                                    (20)
    The forward propagation’s final result is 𝑧 𝑖 which can be calculated using the
    following formula: 𝑧 𝑖 =𝑠𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥( 𝑊 0 ∗ 𝑠 𝑖 ) The reset gate, which controls a
    GRU’s candidate set, operates according to the following formula: 𝑠 𝑖 ̃ =𝑡𝑎𝑛ℎ(
    𝑊 𝑠 •[ 𝑅 𝑖 × 𝑠 𝑖−1 , 𝑦 𝑖 ]) (19) Third, the GRU updates 𝑠 𝑖 using the following
    formula during the update memory phase: 𝑠 𝑖 =(1− 𝑈 𝑖 )× 𝑠 𝑖−1 + 𝑈 𝑖 × 𝑠 𝑖 ̃ (20)
    The forward propagation’s final result is 𝑧 𝑖 , which can be calculated using
    the following formula: 𝑧 𝑖 =𝑠𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥( 𝑊 0 ∗ 𝑠 𝑖 ) (21) The ability to concentrate
    on certain items due to attention in the human visual system can significantly
    increase how successfully people process visual information. Attention is a method
    that simulates cognitive attention in neural networks. It is a well-liked approach
    in the disciplines of machine translation and recommendation systems, among others.
    Deep neural networks may more quickly latch onto key areas of the objective from
    an amount of data, eliminate irrelevant data, and work more efficiently by incorporating
    attention processes. The attention mechanism and deep learning model can be compared
    to a weight matrix. To determine the proper attention level, the associated weight
    value for each input value is multiplied by the input value. The weight factor
    can be increased by maximum attention. In the multi-channel time series prediction
    task, the ultimate objective is to predict 𝑟 𝑖 at the subsequent time based on
    the physical values from 𝑔 1 to 𝑔 𝑖 , previously observed in the time window 𝑗
    . Nevertheless, more complex temporal properties are seen in time series data
    sensor information. Different time steps have varying degrees of success in foretelling
    future data. In order to acquire pertinent information to aid in the prediction
    of the future physical value 𝑟 ̂ 𝑖 , we applied soft attention to derive a context
    vector 𝑐 𝑖 . The following formula determines the attention mechanism: 𝛽 𝑡 = 𝑒𝑥𝑝(
    𝑆 𝑡 ) ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑡=1 𝑒𝑥𝑝( 𝑆 𝑡 ) (22) At each time step, we calculated the associated
    weight score, and then applied the softmax function to normalize the score to
    generate the distribution of conditional probabilities 𝛽 𝑡 , which indicates the
    relevance of the 𝑡 𝑡ℎ time window for prediction. The function calculates the
    score 𝑆 𝑡 . 𝑆 𝑡 =𝑡𝑎𝑛ℎ( 𝑎 𝑙 ℎ 𝑠 𝑡 +𝑏) (23) where 𝑎 and 𝑏 are learning parameters
    that may be trained along with other model parameters. The context vector 𝑣 𝑖
    is calculated by the attention mechanism as the weighted average of all of the
    concealed states of ℎ 𝑠 1 to ℎ 𝑠 𝑖−1 . 𝑣 𝑖 = ∑ 𝑡=1 𝑖=1 𝛽 𝑡 ℎ 𝑠 𝑡 (24) We integrated
    the data from the two vectors, the context vector 𝑣 𝑖 , and the current hidden
    state ℎ 𝑠 𝑖 to produce an attentional hidden state, as shown below: 𝑘∗=𝑡𝑎𝑛ℎ( 𝑤
    𝑘 [ 𝑣 𝑖 ;ℎ 𝑠 𝑖 ]) (25) To avert overfitting, the attentional vector 𝑘∗ is supplied
    into the dropout layer. The dense layer predicts the following data. Time complexity
    for attention-based gated recurrent unit neural network. This depends upon the
    number of input features, the number of time steps, the size of the hidden layer,
    and the number of attention heads. Assuming that the input has 𝑁 features, the
    hidden layer size is 𝐻 , the number of time steps is 𝑇 , and the number of attention
    heads is 𝐴 , the time complexity of an attention-based GRU can be expressed as
    𝑂(𝑇𝐴 𝐻 ∧ 2+𝑇 𝐻 ∧ 2) . The first term in the equation, 𝑇𝐴 𝐻 ∧ 2 , corresponds to
    the computational cost of computing the attention weights. The attention mechanism
    involves computing a weighted sum of the hidden states from each time step, and
    this operation needs to be performed for each attention head. The complexity of
    computing the attention weights for one head is 𝑂(𝑇 𝐻 ∧ 2) , and since there are
    𝐴 attention heads, the total complexity for computing the attention weights is
    𝑇𝐴 𝐻 ∧ 2 The second term in the equation, 𝑇 𝐻 ∧ 2 , corresponds to the computational
    cost of updating the hidden state using the GRU cell. This operation involves
    matrix multiplications and element-wise operations, and it needs to be performed
    for each time step. The complexity of updating the hidden state for one time step
    is 𝑂( 𝐻 ∧ 2) , and since there are T time steps, the total complexity for updating
    the hidden state is 𝑇 𝐻 ∧ 2 . Overall, the time complexity of an attention-based
    GRU neural network is 𝑂(𝑇𝐴 𝐻 ∧ 2+𝑇 𝐻 ∧ 2) . This complexity can be reduced by
    using techniques such as pruning, quantization, or parallelization, which can
    help to speed up the computations and reduce the memory requirements of the network.
    Using an attention mechanism in combination with the recurring neural network
    for the identification of an intrusion detection task further complicates and
    improves the model. 4. Results and Discussion To validate the efficacy of the
    proposed technique, the performance indicators of accuracy, detection rate, precision,
    f-score, testing and training, validation accuracy and validation loss, confusion
    matrix analysis, and RoC curve were examined and compared with the existing techniques.
    The implementation took place using Python and the results were tested and plotted.
    Python programming was employed in the creation of the PEDL framework. The Intel(R)
    Core(TM) i5-3570 CPU clocked at 3.40 GHz 3.40 GHz, together with 8 GB of installed
    RAM, powers the SST003.seahost.local computer. Two datasets based on IoT, which
    are IoT-Botnet and ToN-IoT, were utilized to evaluate the effectiveness of the
    intrusion detection systems (IDs). These were chosen because they offer a variety
    of security procedures and reliable IoT network results. To train and assess how
    well the PEDL technique distinguishes between attack and typical observations,
    these datasets were divided into testing and training sets. The results were compared
    using the deep neural network, convolutional neural network, recurrent neural
    network, and long short-term memory. The hyper parameters are given in Table 2
    and Table 3, representing the system configuration. Table 2. Hyper parameters.
    Table 3. System configuration. 4.1. Datasets Used to Assess the Efficiency of
    the PEDL Structure Two of the latest IoT-based publicly accessible datasets were
    utilized to confirm the efficacy of the suggested PEDL approach. The training
    and test sets were divided into 70% and 30%, respectively. Below is a description
    of each dataset’s specifics: ToN-IoT: The ToN-IoT dataset holds a variety of information
    gathered from IoT and IoT sensor telemetry records. This dataset includes a variety
    of current attack instances that have been discovered in IoT contexts, viz, Backdoor,
    MITM, DDoS, DoS, Injection, Password, Scanning, XSS, and Ransomware. A normal
    vector, nine different sorts of attacks, and 43 labeled features make up this
    dataset. These features are used to detect the external attack for the smart agriculture.
    The model utilizes 378,782 data points from this dataset, which are later separated
    into 303,025 and 75,757 for training and testing purposes. Table 4 tabulates common
    and unique attack event statistics. Table 4. The training and testing details
    of the dataset. IoT Botnet: The above was modified to create the IoT Botnet dataset.
    Only a few flow features, out of 46 network features, are present in BoT-IoT.
    The BoT-IoT flow characteristics and network features are multiplied and optimized
    using a network traffic flow detector. This dataset contains a standard vector,
    four alternative attack types, and 88 tagged features. This dataset contains 50,000
    data points that are separated into 40,000 and 10,000 for training with testing.
    These properties are used to train the model to detect an attack and also enable
    effective communication for smart agriculture. The statistics of common and unique
    assault occurrences in the dataset are depicted in Table 4. 4.2. Description of
    Evaluation Metrics To determine the effectiveness of the IDS, multiple performance
    evaluation matrices were employed. Recall, accuracy, F1-score, and precision were
    some of these measurements. Nevertheless, many parameters that were utilized to
    calculate these ratings are explained below. The efficacy of the IDS in distinguishing
    between invasive and nonintrusive activities is described by the metrics in this
    area. An IDS, which is a binary classifier, may provide one of the following outcomes:
    true positive ( 𝑝 𝑡 ) refers to the accurate classification of an intrusion; true
    negative ( 𝑛 𝑡 ) refers to the accurate classification of a reasonable action;
    false positive ( 𝑝 𝑓 ) refers to the incorrect classification of a reasonable
    action as an intrusion; and false negative ( 𝑛 𝑓 ) refers to the incorrect classification
    of an intrusion. The well-known measures are given below. Accuracy: This measurement
    is simply the percentage of validation sets or test sets that an IDS correctly
    classifies. Accuracy is achieved using the following: 𝐴𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑦= 𝑝 𝑡 + 𝑛 𝑡 𝑝 𝑡
    + 𝑛 𝑡 + 𝑝 𝑓 + 𝑛 𝑓 (26) Precision: This indicator shows how often the IDS’s classified
    activities are intrusive. Precision is achieved using the following: 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛=
    𝑝 𝑡 𝑝 𝑡 + 𝑝 𝑓 (27) Recall: This statistic measures the proportion of invasive
    behaviors that the IDS deems to be intrusive. The recall is also known as the
    detection rate (DR). Detection rate data are acquired via the following: 𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙=
    𝑝 𝑡 𝑝 𝑡 + 𝑛 𝑓 (28) F1-score: This measure is a weighted harmonic mean of memory
    and precision, which represents the importance of recall with respect to accuracy.
    When assessing a multi-class classification, the F-score is also used. Equation
    (29) provides the F1-score. By micro-averaging using the class frequency (mico-F1)
    or macro-averaging based on the identical relevance of all classes, the final
    F1-score is achieved (macro-F1). When there is an unbalance in the classes, binary
    and multi-class classifiers are evaluated using the F1-score in comparison to
    the G-measure, which is the geometric mean of the detection rate and accuracy.

    System Each dataset’s twenty characteristics are subjected to the attention-based
    GRU approach for confidentiality. This technique shields data against inference
    attacks that may gather private model information. Including both datasets, the
    attention-based GRU was built up using the 20 characteristics listed in Table
    5 as the input layer. One output node, five hidden nodes, and an Elu activation
    function make up the encoder. The final model was set up to predict attacks and
    normal classes using the following parameters: optimizer = Adam, epochs = 10,
    batch size = 100, and dropout = 0.1. Table 5. Statistics of the features chosen
    using the two datasets. 4.4. Accuracy and Loss Curve Analysis The best fit is
    shown if the validation and training loss or accuracy increased and stabilized
    at a certain point (i.e., the model does not underfit or overfit). Both accuracy
    and loss are examined when the epoch size changes. Figure 5 illustrates how validation
    and training accuracy both rise linearly in IoT Botnet and then stabilize for
    a considerable amount of time beyond a certain threshold. It means that the model
    is perfectly fitted (no under- or overfit), and Figure 6 represents the training
    and validation loss of the ToN IoT dataset, which demonstrates that the validation
    and training losses will vary slightly. The model appears to fit. Figure 5. The
    loss and accuracy of IoT Botnet. Figure 6. The loss and accuracy of ToN-IoT. 4.5.
    Confusion Matrix and ROC Analysis The confusion matrix is the measurement that
    displays the classification’s outcome. For example, it displays the accurate and
    inaccurate categorization results. For binary classification, it may have 2 ×
    2 dimensions. For multi-class classification, including N classes, it may have
    N × N dimensions. Despite not being a standalone statistic, the confusion matrix
    serves as a foundation for other measures that may be used to measure efficacy.
    Utilizing the confusion matrix (CM), the suggested attention-based GRU-based IDS’s
    performance is examined. This provides a clear description of the classifier’s
    behavior in identifying the samples included in the dataset’s various classes.
    The classifying results of the attention-based GRU-based IDS employing the ToN-IoT
    and IoT Botnet datasets are displayed in Figure 7. In CM, the columns represent
    anticipated labels, while the rows represent genuine labels. The suggested attention-based
    GRU-based IDS employing the changed dataset obtains, according to Figure 7, an
    equivalent detection level to the original datasets. Figure 7. Confusion matrix
    of the PEDL using IoT Botnet and ToN-IoT datasets. The ROC curve is a reliable
    measure for displaying the sensitivity and specificity linked to a continuous
    variable. It is a plot of coordinates with a vertical axis for the true positive
    rate (TPR) and a horizontal axis for the false positive rate (FPR). The AUC, often
    known as the area under the ROC curve, is recognized as being a crucial evaluation
    metric. 𝑅𝑂𝐶= 𝑝 𝑓 𝑝 𝑓 + 𝑛 𝑡 (30) The proposed model has better values than the
    existing models, as shown by the ROC curve which is represented in Figure 8. Figure
    8. ROC curve of PEDL utilizing ToN-IoT and IoT Botnet datasets. Some of the most
    effective evaluation metrics for imbalanced datasets are the class-wise prediction
    outcomes of accuracy, F1-score, and detection rate. The frequencies for the attack
    and normal classes are imbalanced in both datasets of IoT Botnet and ToN-IoT.
    Thus, data are calculated at the class level to assess the efficacy of the proposed
    attention-based GRU IDS. The initial class-wise prediction results and converted
    datasets are obtained using 𝑝 𝑡 , 𝑛 𝑡 , 𝑝 𝑓 , and 𝑛 𝑓 and depending on the DR,
    F1-score, and PR. The initial class-wise prediction results that were generated
    utilizing the ToN-IoT and IoT Botnet datasets are shown in Table 6 and Table 7.
    It is important to note that the suggested attention-based GRU IDS has improved
    results for the majority of the threat vectors after implementing confidentiality
    and overall has a small difference compared to the original datasets. Table 6.
    Class-wise prediction of ToN-IoT dataset. Table 7. Class-wise prediction of ToN-IoT
    dataset. 4.6. Comparisons with Existing Detection Models Recent state-of-the-art
    methods were contrasted with the attention-based GRU IDS. For result comparison,
    DNN, RNN, CNN, and LSTM are four unique deep learning algorithms. The results
    of the existing techniques were acquired utilizing both of the datasets in the
    same situation. The performance of the attention-based GRU was assessed and compared
    using evaluation metrics, including class-level precision, detection rate, F1-score,
    and overall accuracy. Figure 9a compares the proposed model’s accuracy with existing
    models. The proposed model was achieved with an accuracy of 99.3%, which is high
    among the existing models because LSTM models require a large dataset to train
    it, so it becomes much slower than the other existing methods. DNN is a complex
    model with a large training time, but the accuracy is high compared to other existing
    models. The location and direction of an object are not encoded by CNN. There
    must be an absence of spatial invariance with respect to the supplied data and
    there must be lots of training data. The conventional RNN is too slow compared
    to the other existing methods, and it is also complex to train and faces problems
    such as gradient vanishing and exploding. Figure 9b shows the detection rate or
    recall. Here, the proposed technique attains a recall rate of 99.3%. The recall
    rate is higher than that of the other existing methods. The F1-score is displayed
    in Figure 9c. Here, the proposed technique attains 98.2%. The F1-score is higher
    than that of the other existing methods. Figure 9d shows the precision. The proposed
    technique attains precision of 98.2%. The precision is higher than that of the
    other existing methods. Figure 9. (a) Accuracy, (b) detection rate, (c) F1-score,
    and (d) precision of IoT Botnet dataset. Figure 10a displays the accuracy of the
    proposed method. The accuracy is 99.8%. Compared to the other approaches now in
    use, the accuracy is higher. Figure 10b shows the detection rate or recall. The
    proposed method has a recall rate of 99.1%. The recall rate is higher than that
    of the other existing methods. The proposed model’s F1-score is shown in Figure
    10c. The recall rates for the suggested model are 99.1%. The F1-score is greater
    than that of the other existing techniques. The proposed model’s precision is
    displayed in Figure 10d. The proposed method attains 99.1% accuracy. The precision
    is greater than that of the other existing methods. Figure 10. (a) Accuracy, (b)
    detection rate, (c) F1-score, and (d) precision of the ToN-IoT dataset. In these
    figures, the proposed classifier obtained improved classification results as compared
    with other conventional deep learning models. Table 8 shows the performance comparison
    analysis over other exiting studies Kumar, S.D et al. [41]. Table 8. Comparison
    of proposed classification performance with other state-of-the-art studies. By
    comparing it with other existing studies Vatti, R. et al [42], the detection performance
    of the proposed AGRU model is enhanced due to its higher efficiency. For each
    dataset, the proposed anomaly detection model generates improved results. The
    existing studies show several limitations while detecting the anomalies from the
    given input data, meaning that the detection outcomes are reduced Patel, B et
    al. [43]. Figure 11a–d shows the performance comparison of the proposed classification
    methods with other conventional RNNs. Figure 11. (a–d) Performance comparison
    of different RNNs with the proposed method. (a) Accuracy in IoT Botnet dataset.
    (b) F-measure in IoT Botnet dataset. (c) Accuracy in ToN-IoT dataset. (d) F-measure
    in ToN-IoT dataset. Here, the proposed AGRU is analyzed using previous models,
    such as attention LSTM, Mogrifier LSTM, transform with attentional LSTM, and RNN.
    The analysis shows that the proposed detection model has improved performance
    compared to the existing models. The values attained for the comparison analysis
    with different RNNs are depicted in Table 9. Table 9. Performance comparison of
    diverse RNNs with proposed AGRU. On the other hand, the strength of the proposed
    SCAE model is analyzed by performing a comparison with other methods, and is illustrated
    in Figure 12. Figure 12. Performance analysis of proposed feature encoding model
    with other methods. (a) Accuracy in IoT Botnet dataset. (b) F-measure in IoT Botnet
    dataset. (c) Accuracy in ToN-IoT dataset. (d) F-measure in ToN-IoT dataset. The
    above analysis proves the effectiveness of the proposed SCAE-based feature encoding
    model. Here, the efficiency of the proposed technique is compared to the existing
    models, such as auto encoder (AE), sparse auto encoder (SAE), and capsule auto
    encoder (CAE). The result analysis proves that the proposed model achieved improved
    performance compared to the other methods. The values obtained for the feature
    encoding comparison are portrayed in Table 10. Table 10. Comparison analysis of
    proposed feature encoding method over others. The above results show the efficacy
    of the proposed methods and they show that the proposed techniques are highly
    suitable for detecting anomalies in IoT devices for the smart agriculture domain.
    Figure 13 shows the time complexity analysis. Here, the proposed AGRU design’s
    CPU operation time and memory usage linearly increase. Here, the time complexity
    of the proposed AGRU is lower than those of the existing LSTM, DNN, CNN, and RNN
    designs. Figure 13. Performance analysis of time complexity. 5. Conclusions Attacks
    and vulnerabilities in smart farming demonstrate the significance of security
    in IoT-based farming. With the help of encryption and intrusion detection using
    an attention-based gated recurrent unit neural network algorithm and sparse capsule
    auto encoder, we suggested a privacy-encoding-based enhanced deep learning framework.
    We examined how to construct a reliable encryption and intrusion detection scheme
    for an IoT network environment. To prevent deduction attacks, SCAE was used to
    change information into a new encrypted format. By enhancing a GRU, we put forward
    a neural network model called AGRU. Then, we suggested a fresh approach to intrusion
    detection using the AGRU. This approach might significantly increase intrusion
    detection’s potency. We tested the effectiveness of our proposed AGRU-based intrusion
    detection technique using simulated trials. The experiment results demonstrated
    that our suggested AGRU-based intrusion detection approach could produce a significant
    improvement in effectiveness and accuracy when compared to several current intrusion
    detection methods including LSTM, CNN, RNN, and DNN. The proposed model has 99.9%
    accuracy, 99.7% precision, 99.9% recall, and 99.8% F1-score, respectively. In
    this proposed work, the hyper parameters were not optimally tuned. By considering
    this limitation, an efficient optimization algorithm will be introduced in future
    work for a parameter tuning purpose. We intend to carry out more research on intrusion
    detection and develop an improved encryption method for smart agriculture in the
    future. Additionally, we will focus on the categorization and early detection
    time analysis of more cyber-malware in complex systems in the actual world. Author

    contractsDLTInternet of Things (IoT) 1. Introduction The Internet of Things (IoT)
    is a network of physical objects called “things”, such as home appliances, machines,
    and various digital objects. These things or devices are mostly resource-constrained
    and can perform operations such as sensing, monitoring, pre-processing (i.e.,
    lightweight computing), and exchanging of data [1]. Moreover, these devices are
    communication-capable and are connected over the Internet using different underlying
    technologies and protocols such as RFID, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Wi-Fi, Zigbee,
    LoRa, and Sigfox [2]. According to [3], the number of such connected devices will
    reach 75 billion by the end of 2025. Further, it is expected that by 2030 the
    number of devices connected to the Internet will touch the mark of 500 billion
    [4]. In 1982 the first practical application of IoT was implemented when a Coca-Cola
    machine installed at Carnegie Melon University was connected with APRANET to find
    if the available drinks were cold or not [3]. Later, the term Internet of Things
    was given by Kevin Ashton in 1999, and in the 2000, LG launched the world’s first
    internet-enabled refrigerator [5]. Since then, the world has witnessed enormous
    growth in IoT-driven devices and applications. The evolution from the early days
    of the Internet to the present IoT comprises five phases [6]. Initially, it started
    with connecting computers, whereas in the second phase, the concept of the World
    Wide Web (WWW) came and led to connecting computers all around. The third phase
    started with the emergence of the mobile internet, which connected mobile devices
    to the Internet. In the next phase (i.e., the fourth phase), people started joining
    the Internet by using social networking platforms, and finally, the concept of
    IoT originated [1], [6]. Some of the promising applications of IoT are healthcare,
    smart home, smart city, smart grid, and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) [1]. Despite
    the hype, several issues revolve around IoT, like centralization, massive data
    gathering, scalability, security threats, privacy issues, resource limitation,
    mobility, and interoperability [3], [7]. Blockchain (BC) can play a cardinal role
    in mitigating these issues thereby paving the way for a blockchain-enabled IoT
    ecosystem. Table 1. Summary of the main acronyms used in this paper. Acronym Definition

    Area Network BC is one of the most prominent types of Distributed Ledger Technology
    (DLT) where the ledger (i.e., database of transactions) is distributed among all
    the nodes in a Peep-to-Peer (P2P) network [8]. The word blockchain implies the
    data structure used to build and manage the distributed ledger. Fundamentally,
    the data structure used for the ledger in BC is a growing sequence of logically
    linked (i.e., cryptographically chained) blocks to build a chain of blocks [9].
    A block is a unit that contains a set of verified transactions that occurs during
    a given time window and are cryptographically secured. Every block is connected
    with the previous block using a hash-based chain. This means the hash of the previous
    block is stored in the current block. The first block of a blockchain is called
    the genesis block [10], which does not have any transaction. Moreover, the value
    of the ‘previous block hash’ field is set to zero in the genesis block [11]. BC
    intensively uses cryptographic techniques such as hashing, public–private key
    pair, digital signature, Merkle tree, and time-stamping. Moreover, it employs
    a consensus mechanism to establish an agreement in a decentralized environment
    [12]. Some unique features of BC technology are tamper-persistent, transparency,
    non-repudiation, proof of provenance, fault tolerance, pseudonymity, decentralized
    decision-making, and distributed ledger. From the application point of view, Bitcoin
    is the most popular and the first use case of blockchain technology specially
    designed for monetary transactions. Nevertheless, with time, BC has been found
    beneficial for many other domains such as healthcare, supply chain, education,
    insurance, and logistics [13]. The meanings of the abbreviations used in this
    paper are introduced in Table 1. 1.1. Advantages of blockchain in IoT BC ends
    up being quite possibly the most promising advancement to unleash the maximum
    potential of IoT. The advantages of using BC for IoT are discussed as follows
    [14]: 1.1.1. Reduced cost For every emerging technology, the cost is an essential
    factor of consideration. IoT follows a centralized approach, and numerous intermediary
    (third-party) services are also used. Each of these services charges some fee
    which gets added to the overall cost [15]. As a result, the overall cost gets
    inflated. On integrating BC with IoT, the BC P2P decentralized network acts as
    backend; thus, the centralized server is no longer required. Furthermore, using
    smart contracts helps eliminate the need for third-party services. Therefore,
    BC for IoT reduces intermediate cost or brokerage fees [14], [16], [17]. 1.1.2.
    Trust among parties Trust is defined as when all the participating nodes in the
    network can communicate and share data without worrying about the integrity of
    the data [18]. For communication and data sharing in the network, maintaining
    trust is important [18]. It can be achieved by removing malevolent nodes from
    the network [18]. IoT involves a lot of interconnected devices and an overwhelming
    amount of data is shared and processed, which requires trust among the users to
    share data. But these IoT devices do not communicate with each other due to possibility
    of a loss of data [19]. But, by integrating BC with IoT brings trust among the
    participants. Because of its decentralized and distributed trust mechanism, all
    the participating nodes can view each transaction’s details and validation is
    done by establishing the consensus, which helps in maintaining the transparency
    and trust between the users [16]. 1.1.3. Privacy Privacy is defined as protection
    of information from exposure to unauthorized ones [20]. It can be either data
    privacy or user privacy or location privacy. The availability of private sensor
    data such as personal identifying information or indirect information like location
    [21], through which users identity can be revealed to malicious users is loss
    of privacy [20]. It is important to maintain privacy for successful implementation
    of IoT. In particular, involves several centrally connected devices, continuously
    transmitting data and numerous companies are monitoring this data, and sometimes
    they can misuse personal data or identity [22]. But by combining BC with IoT,
    a blockchain-generated address is provided to all the participants and interactions
    occur between these addresses. The physical world identity of these participants
    is not revealed. For IoT applications that involve sensitive information, this
    feature will be of great use to hide the real identity [23], [24]. 1.1.4. Security
    Security is defined as the protection against the cyberattacks and vulnerabilities.
    Authentication, authorization, integrity, interoperability, or adaptability are
    the key aspects for any system to maintain security [18]. Maintaining security
    means security of device, data transmission and data storage [25]. Security in
    terms of IoT is protecting devices present in the network, from intruders [25].
    In the large-scale deployment of IoT, handling security vulnerabilities is a major
    challenge due to heterogeneity of the network. BC intrinsically supports security
    by establishing trust through its immutable and decentralized nature [26]. Since
    it intensively uses cryptographic mechanisms like PKI, hashing, Merkle tree, and
    timestamp as well as uses distributed consensus algorithm for adding new content
    in the distributed ledger. Hashing makes it impossible to alter the data and a
    decentralized peer-to-peer approach makes the network resilient against failures

    34 824 1.2. Motivation The central aim of this survey is to focus on what BC can
    bring to the IoT landscape. To this aim, we carried out an in-depth study of various
    contributions made by academia and industry in the domain of BC-integrated IoT.
    Moving forward, we focused on different use cases emerging from BC-integrated
    IoT, such as healthcare, smart cities, smart grids, autonomous vehicle, and UAVs.
    Moreover, efforts have been made to explore numerous technical aspects when integrating
    BC with IoT and identify the challenges related to these technical aspects. Furthermore,
    the open issues and future research directions are also discussed in this survey
    paper. In view of the above discussion, although numerous survey papers exist,
    not many specifically address the integration of BC and IoT for a wide range of
    IoT applications, along with the technical aspects. A survey of existing BC protocols
    for the IoT was presented in [28]. Numerous surveys on BC technology based on
    different viewpoints, such as its architecture, types, consensus algorithm, and
    characteristics, were introduced in [29], [30], [31]. Various studies exploring
    the role of BC in IoT and the impacts of integrating BC with IoT were presented
    in [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37] and the challenges in coordinating BC and
    IoT were presented in [7], [14], [16], [23], [38]. Works [14], [39], [40] discussed
    the future directions in BC technology. Table 4 summarizes the recent survey papers
    on using BC for IoT. In particular, the table shows (in brief) the main contribution
    of the recent surveys, the IoT applications they study, and the BC technical aspects
    they emphasize. Although the existing survey papers cover different IoT applications
    and BC technical aspects, it is difficult to find one paper that studies the use
    of BC for a wide range of IoT applications in detail. Moreover, most existing
    surveys focus on the individual aspects, i.e., either application areas or the
    technical aspects with challenges. Thus, the motivation of this paper is four-fold:
    • To study and investigate the applications and technical aspects of integrating
    blockchain and IoT in-depth. • To cover as many as eight different BC-IoT applications,
    including healthcare, smart homes, smart cities, supply chain, autonomous vehicles,
    smart grid, IIoT, and UAVs. • To classify the existing research works into different
    categories for each of the eight applications considered. • To explore the challenges
    related to the technical aspects (such as scalability, security, privacy, data
    storage, and power consumption) and their possible solutions for the BC-integrated
    IoT ecosystem. • To conduct an exhaustive survey by including the most recent
    research in the space of BC-enabled IoTs. Fig. 1 depicts year-wise statistics
    of the research works surveyed in this paper. We started with a first-level bibliometric
    analysis to further strengthen our motivation behind conducting this survey. To
    do so, the Scopus database is used to extract the bibliometric data that covers
    the research work done in the blockchain and IoT landscape., The data exported
    from Scopus included details like the publication year, author, institution, and
    source journal. The search is done using the title. In total, 477 valid papers
    were exported using Scopus. Next, the VOSviewer tool is used to visualize the
    extracted data and plot the graphs [41]. Fig. 2 shows the geographic distribution,
    i.e., the countries participating in BC-IoT research. As shown in Table 2, China
    has the highest number of publications and citations on Blockchain-IoT, followed
    by India and the United States. Fig. 3 shows the BC-IoT co-citation journal network,
    which helps in analyzing the number of articles from different journals and the
    frequency of citations. The bigger the node size, implies more the number of articles
    published. Moreover, Table 3 depicts the top five productive journals in Blockchain
    for IoT research. IEEE Internet of Things Journal has the highest number of publications.

    of this work is to explore the capabilities of BC technology and to study how
    BC can resolve the potential challenges of emerging IoT applications. In particular,
    the current survey covers the role of BC in numerous IoT application areas such
    as healthcare, smart homes, supply chain and logistics, smart city, smart grid,
    autonomous vehicles, UAVs, and Industrial IoT (IIoT). Moreover, the present survey
    puts the important technical aspects (that need to be considered for BC-enabled
    IoT applications) under a magnifying lens. In this direction, the challenges related
    to these technical aspects are explored, and several proposed solutions to overcome
    these challenges are discussed. Towards the end, the lesson learned from the literature
    survey is presented, which aims to consolidate answers to how the maximum benefits
    can be leveraged by integrating BC with emerging IoT applications. Table 4. Summary

    fundamentals of DLT and BC, key attributes of BC, its terminologies and types,
    and smart contracts. 2.1. Distributed ledger technology (DLT) A conventional centralized
    network uses client–server architecture where one or more clients are directly
    connected to the central server. On the other hand, in a decentralized P2P network,
    multiple nodes are connected in a P2P fashion. Any node is equally capable of
    serving a client attached to this decentralized P2P network. DLT comprises a decentralized
    P2P network of nodes and distributed ledger. Moreover, DLT uses cryptographic
    techniques and a consensus mechanism to secure and synchronize the underlying
    system. A distributed ledger is a type of shared ledger where the ledger is replicated
    at all the nodes in the network [15]. DLT has the potential to address the many
    shortcomings of traditional centralized approaches. The key highlights of DLT
    are (i) decentralized governance, (ii) immutability, (iii) reliability, and (iv)
    authentication [50]. Creating immutable records helps in achieving transparency,
    immutability, and verifiability and also reduces costs associated with distributing
    and maintaining the ledger [51]. In general, DLT is a class, and BC is one of
    the most popular members of that class. In other words, BC is a type of DLT. 2.2.
    Blockchain technology BC, a type of DLT, consists of a distributed ledger and
    a P2P network of nodes and uses cryptographic techniques and consensus mechanisms.
    The distinguishing factor for BC is the data structure (i.e., the chain of blocks)
    used to build the distributed ledger. Any update in the ledger is achieved by
    using a consensus mechanism that establishes agreement among the nodes, which
    helps in achieving consistency. Any change in the ledger is synchronized and reflected
    at each participating node [52]. Before moving forward it is necessary to understand
    the basic block structure and the related terminologies used in BC [30], [53].

    As mentioned above, BC is a chain of blocks where each block contains a set of
    finite and valid transactions. The blocks are connected using a cryptographic
    hash-based chain. In general, a block is divided into two parts — block header
    and block body. The block header is used to hold various fields such as version,
    timestamp, previous block’s hash, the difficulty level in form of nbits, Merkle
    root hash, and nonce. The block body contains transactions and at times smart
    contracts as well [54], [55]. Usually, the number of transactions that can be
    accommodated in one block depends on the maximum allowable block size, which is
    platform-dependent. For instance, the maximum size of the BC block is 1 MB. 2.2.2.
    Merkle tree root hash It is one single hash value that uniquely and compactly
    represents all the transactions present in the block body. This hash digest is
    calculated using the Merkle tree technique. Moreover, it enables easy verification
    of the correctness of the transactions in a given block. 2.2.3. Timestamp It is
    the time of creation of a block, which is stored as one of the fields in the block’s
    header [56]. This field is useful in keeping a record of the time when the transactions
    were confirmed which later helps in knowing when and what has happened on the
    blockchain and makes it more difficult for an intruder to alter the blockchain.
    It is the current time in seconds in GMT since 1 January, 1970 [57], [58]. The
    value of timestamp ( ) is valid if is greater than the median timestamp of the
    previous eleven blocks and is smaller than the network time (median of the timestamps
    returned by all nodes connected to the node) (h is a cryptographic hash function)
    [59]. 2.2.4. Nonce is a number used once. It is a four bytes field used to compute
    the hash of a block’s header such that the hash value meets the difficulty level.
    More specifically, it is a random number that the miner keeps guessing to calculate
    the block header’s hash value. In a brute-force manner, a miner starts with zero
    as a value for the nonce field and keeps increasing it for every iteration of
    hash calculation [58]. A miner stops when the computed hash value meets the difficulty
    level, and a new block is said to be mined for the specific nonce value (used
    in that iteration). 2.2.5. Previous hash The previous block hash field of any
    given block stores the block hash of the immediate previous block. This leads
    to the formation of a chain of blocks and makes the blockchain an append-only
    data structure. Any change in a transaction of any block by an attacker will produce
    a different block hash, which should be reflected in all the subsequent blocks.
    Thus the ledger becomes inconsistent and the changes can be easily detected. The
    value of the previous hash field in the genesis block is set to zero. Another
    interesting concept in BC is forking [60]. At any given time, a large number of
    nodes (i.e., miners) can participate in BC network. Thus, there can be circumstances
    when different miners mine different (valid) blocks at the same time. In this
    situation, these valid but different blocks are being broadcasted in the BC network.
    Hence, different parts of the BC network will append different blocks resulting
    in inconsistency in the blockchain. In other words, different nodes will have
    different recent blocks in their local copy of the ledger, and this is known as
    the forking problem. BC resolves this issue by considering simply the longest
    chain while all the blocks in the other smaller chains will be discarded or considered
    orphaned, as shown in Fig. 5. 2.3. Types of blockchain There are numerous ways
    based on which BCs can be divided into different types. Fundamentally, BCs can
    be considered of three types — public, private, and consortium BC. Table 5. Comparison
    among public, private & consortium blockchains [29], [61]. Property Public Private
    Consortium Consensus Algorithm All nodes One organization Only selected nodes

    Transaction Order of minutes Order of milliseconds Order of milliseconds Write
    Permission Write for all Write for nodes from single organization Write for only
    selected nodes from group organizations Asset Local Asset Any Asset Any Asset
    2.3.1. Public blockchain It is open and accessible for all who want to participate
    in the network. Public BC is fully decentralized, where no entity controls the
    BC, and every participating node has equal rights [30]. Moreover, all the participating
    nodes can participate in the validation of transactions and block mining [62],
    [63]. Examples of public BC implementation are Bitcoin and Ethereum or Litecoin
    [64]. 2.3.2. Private blockchain It is specifically designed for a single organization,
    and participants need permission to join the network. After entering the network,
    participants can access the transactions in the ledger. Only a few selected nodes
    from the governing organization have exclusive rights to add new blocks and update
    the ledger. Participating nodes in the private BC do not need to solve the computationally
    intensive puzzle to reach a consensus. Moreover, usually, the nodes are not provided
    with any financial intensives. Hyperledger fabric is the most widely used private
    permissioned BC [30], [62]. 2.3.3. Consortium or federated blockchain Consortium
    or federated BC is designed for multiple companies or a group of companies participating
    in a single BC. It is partially centralized with known set of participating nodes
    from group organizations [61]. Table 5, shows the comparison among the three types
    of BCs. 2.4. Smart contracts Smart contracts were first proposed in 1994 by Nick
    Szabo [65]. Smart contracts are equivalent to contracts in the real world, the
    only difference is that they do not need any administering body for their execution
    and they are softwarized [66]. Smart contract is a set of logic and functions
    (with the relevant data) that get executed when the pre-defined conditions are
    satisfied by an external or internal trigger [46]. Usually, a smart contract is
    executed when it is invoked by a valid transaction containing the address of the
    smart contract that occurs in the system and has access rights. Smart contracts
    when running on top of a blockchain provide numerous advantages, automation is
    one of them. Moreover, as the need for intermediaries is removed, the contract
    also reduces the expenses required in paper-based traditional contracts [67].
    Ethereum was the first BC platform that supported smart contracts [68]. It runs
    on the Ethereum runtime engine and the byte code is generated since it runs faster
    on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) [46]. Since smart contracts are stored on
    the Ethereum (i.e., on-chain), their byte codes are assigned a unique address
    after deploying it on EVM [46], [69]. This unique address assigned to the smart
    contracts in Ethereum is 20 bytes [70]. The transaction associated with smart
    contracts results in a change in the state of the decentralized ledger [46]. As
    the smart contracts are stored inside the BC, they inherit some of the BC properties
    such as immutability, autonomous execution, transparency, accuracy, and elimination
    of trusted third parties [69]. By immutability, we mean once the smart contract
    is created, it must be verified before the deployment in the nodes as it cannot
    be changed. So no one can tamper with the contract [38]. Autonomous execution
    means the program written in smart contracts will run automatically once the BC
    system reaches the triggering state, which also eliminates any biased operations,
    not only builds trust but also gives accurate output, and also the need for a
    trusted third party is not required [69]. Transparency means that the smart contract
    logic is visible to all the nodes, which ensures trust between the parties [69]
    and distribution means that the output of the contract is validated by each node
    in the same way as any other transactions. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency
    to support smart contracts features but it has very limited features. Then world’s
    second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum was designed specially to support smart
    contracts [71]. Ethereum platform specially designed for financial and asset trading,
    its native cryptocurrency is Ether, also supports smart contracts, written in
    LLL (Low-level lisp-like language), Serpent, Viper, and Solidity [66], [72]. Hyperledger
    fabric designed especially for enterprise users such as supply chain, trade finance,
    and stock trading, supports smart contracts written using Java, NodeJs, and GoLang
    programming language [69]. Corda designed another blockchain-based platform for
    applications like energy trading, insurance, and retail marketing. Its native
    cryptocurrency is Corda coin, which supports smart contracts written using languages
    like Cotlin/Java [69]. NEM is also a blockchain-based cryptocurrency platform
    specially designed for Banking, gaming, advertising, and marketing and its native
    cryptocurrency is XEM [69]. Some additional features of NEM such as time stamping
    documents, identity proof, creation of customized digital assets, and support
    of smart contracts. Stellar, a blockchain platform designed for financial transactions,
    and its native cryptocurrency is Lumen, supports smart contracts [69]. Blockchain-based
    platform Waves, designed for applications like ride-sharing and customized asset
    trading and its native cryptocurrency Waves uses Scala programming language, and
    language for smart contracts is non-Turing complete language [69]. Download :

    of blockchain. 2.5. Salient features of blockchain In this section, we discuss
    the unique features of BC technology as follows. Fig. 6, illustrates the basic
    attributes of BC. 2.5.1. Distributed Since BC is a type of DLT thus at the core
    of blockchain lies a ledger which is shared with all the participating nodes such
    that each node has an exact replica of the ledger [15]. Each node participating
    in the network can access and view the complete history of transactions without
    the need for any centralized authority [73]. 2.5.2. Decentralization In traditional
    centralized architecture each transaction is regulated and validated by a central
    party or an intermediary. In contrast, BC uses decentralized network of nodes
    for validating and confirming transactions. As soon as a transaction is initiated,
    it is broadcasted to every node in the network. Any node can mine a new block
    which contains this transaction and thus the transaction gets confirmed in decentralized
    manner (not by a central authority) [15]. Moreover, decentralization ensure no
    single point of failure and services are unaffected even if some of the nodes
    are unavailable. 2.5.3. Immutability All the data, i.e., blocks (and transactions
    within) are cryptographically sealed and chained together. Smallest change in
    any transaction (in a given block) will lead to drastic change in the value of
    the Merkle root hash and consequently that block header’s hash value will change.
    As a result, all the subsequent blocks will have to be changed which needs lot
    of re-computations and consensus among the participating nodes [74]. Thus, once
    a block is mined and added to blockchain it is said to be immutable (or temper-proof).
    2.5.4. Provenance Whenever a transaction is recorded in the BC, details of the
    transaction are recorded across all the nodes because of the decentralized nature
    of BC. Also, BC uses timestamps to record each transaction which allows each node
    to keep the order of the transactions [75]. Since each transaction is transparently
    and permanently recorded across all the nodes, the user can verify and trace transactions
    at any time [30]. It provides traceability and transparency of the data [76].
    2.5.5. Availability It is another important feature of BC. It means that the services
    are always available to the users because of the decentralized nature of the BC
    network and the system becomes immune to various intentional (e.g., denial of
    service attack) or accidental failures [77]. 2.5.6. Transparency Another important
    key attribute of BC is transparency. All the participating nodes present in the
    network can view all the transaction details and associated values. Each node
    present in the network has a copy of the ledger and is authorized to verify and
    trace the previous records in the distributed network which promotes trusted workflow,
    sharing of data, immutability, and verifiability [75], [78]. 2.5.7. Anonymity
    Anonymity is another key strength of BC technology. Each user in the BC network
    is assigned a unique BC generated alphanumeric address. Thus users are (pseudo)
    anonymous, and no central authority is monitoring users‘ private information.
    Transactions occur between these BC-generated addresses [73]. This feature provides
    a certain amount of privacy but at the same time, illegal activities could also
    happen [76]. 2.5.8. Non-repudiation Non-repudiation is again a very important
    feature of BC. Non-repudiation means users cannot deny the activities performed
    by them, thanks to cryptographic techniques such as digital signature [77], [79].
    3. Blockchain-based IoT applications This section includes the multiple areas
    in which blockchain-based IoT can be utilized, the pertinent challenges, and also
    provides measures to manage these challenges. 3.1. Healthcare Healthcare represents
    an entire ecosystem where health professionals (with the help of advanced medical
    technologies) diagnose, treat and cure illness or diseases of people. It is estimated
    that the healthcare market will touch US$ 372 billion by the year 2022 and the
    hospital industry will reach up to US$ 133.44 billion by 2023 [81]. Smart healthcare
    originated from smart earth proposed by IBM in 2009 [82]. With the increasing
    role of the healthcare ecosystem powered by advanced technologies, a tremendous
    amount of data is generated, which needs to be managed securely [83]. Some of
    the major issues being faced by the healthcare domain are user and location privacy
    leakage, counterfeit drugs and medical equipment, loss of ownership and fraudulent
    access to stored medical (personal) data, fraud in medical claims and bills, and
    secure platforms required for national and international collaboration of a team
    of healthcare professionals to deal with critical cases and pandemic situations
    like COVID-19. Download : Download high-res image (891KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 7. Application of blockchain in healthcare [80]. However,
    managing such a large massive amount of data is a challenging task but BC technology
    has the potential to mitigate these issues and provides a better solution than
    the traditional way of storing data. Blockchain because of its features such as
    distributed, decentralized, immutability, and availability, becomes the most suited
    solution to the problems being faced by the healthcare industry. For maintaining
    the privacy of patients’ medical records, BC empowers patients to have control
    over their medical data and can decide who can access their medical history [84].
    Another issue with medical data (or history) is scattered storage. Usually, part
    of patients’ medical data is stored with hospitals, some of other medical details
    are with the primary doctor, and some can be with the specialists. In this scenario,
    BC provides a solution to assemble all these data at one platform [85]. Counterfeit
    of medical drugs can also be resolved using BC technology, where the details of
    the drug supply chain from drug manufacturing to its supply to the patient can
    be updated on blockchain and the concerned authorities can keep an eye on every
    stage of the pharmaceutical supply chain [86]. Another challenge being faced by
    the healthcare sector is fraud in medical claims and billing. Sometimes healthcare
    providers claim charges for non-performed services, overcharging the actual services.
    Moreover, reimbursement of medical claims is usually a time-consuming process
    and is prone to fraudulent activities. BC can automate the medical claim’s workflow
    where each person involved in the process can be made accountable for his/her
    activities and everyone sees the same information stored on BC [86]. Some of the
    commercial implementations in healthcare are MedRec, used for storing EHR efficiently
    and Medicalchain is used in the UK to maintain patient data [87]. Fig. 7, shows
    the application areas of BC in the healthcare domain. 3.1.1. Applications of blockchain
    in healthcare • Electronic Health Records - Storing data (patient’s details, health
    information) digitally is called electronic health record. EHR are beneficial
    that they can be accessed from anywhere [88]. EHR contains sensitive information
    about patient’s and it is important to maintain the privacy and security [89].
    To maintain the medical records or history in unified manner, BC platforms can
    be instrumental. Along with maintaining the security and privacy of the data,
    EHRs can be stored and accessed easily [85]. Sharing of information is another
    important step and BC provides that sharing and trust mechanism [89]. • Medicine
    Supply Chain - Counterfeit of medicine is another major issue, that can adversely
    effect the lives of patients. BC can resolve this by storing all the details related
    to the drug supply chain, starting from manufacturing to the final supply of the
    medicine to the patient, on the BC network. The key steps involved in the supply
    chain of drugs are manufacturing, transportation, wholesaler, distributor, retailer,
    and patient [90]. All these entities can be registered on the BC platform and
    authorities can keep an eye to ensure the quality compliance [86]. • Medical Claim
    - Nowadays, we heard a lot about fraud by hospitals where they charge for non-performed
    services and overcharge the performed services [91]. As a chain of people involved
    in verifying the bills. A typical process of claim settlement involves a lot of
    communication between the concerned authorities which takes a lot of time and
    sometimes also includes fraud activities. BC can automate the workflow and each
    person involved in the process will share the same copy of the record, which ensures
    no changes in the copy of the bill [86]. Gem Health is one of the practical and
    real-time systems for health claims [92]. 3.1.2. Related work The works related
    to healthcare have been discussed under different categories which are discussed
    as follows: Authentication: Authors Saha et al. [93] and Alzubi et al. [94] have
    worked in the direction of proposing a BC-based approach for authentication and
    access control in healthcare. Saha et al. [93] highlighted the access control
    challenges in electronic health records and proposed a private BC technology-based
    access control approach that enhances features like security, and low computational
    and communication costs. Rather than using public or consortium BC, authors used
    private BC as all the data collected in hospitals using IoT-enabled devices is
    confidential and sensitive. Also authors showed that their proposed approach is
    resistant to various attacks like impersonation attacks, replay attacks, offline
    guessing attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks, ephemeral secret leakage attacks,
    and anonymity and untraceability attack. In their proposed access control scheme,
    the authors considered two tasks i.e. node authentication (all the newly enrolled
    users must authenticate themselves with hospital authority for authentic information)
    and key establishment (after authentication user can establish the shared key
    with hospital authority for future communications). Moving forward Alzubi et al.
    [94] proposed a BC-enabled secured authentication technique for medical IoT devices
    using Lamport Merkle Digital Signature (LMDS). Their proposed approach is designed
    for securing the data transmitted between the patient and the hospital. It includes
    mainly four entities. The first entity records the sensitive medical data of patients
    obtained from MHEALTH, Second and third entity performs signature generation and
    verification using LMDSG and LMDSV respectively. The fourth entity is the centralized
    healthcare controller. Lamport Merkle Digital Signature generation (LMDSG) is
    used for authenticating i.e., (signature generation and verification) IoT devices.
    Authentication is done by creating a tree in which leaves represent a hash function
    of a patient‘s sensitive and confidential medical data. The root of LMDSG is calculated
    using Lamport Merkle Digital Signature verification (LMDSV) by a centralized healthcare
    controller (CHC) to preserve patients’ confidential data from intruders. Verification
    is done when the hash of the public key is equal to the leaf then it becomes the
    root of the tree and the signature becomes valid. Authors analyzed the performance
    in terms of communication overhead (decreased by 20%), communication time (decreased
    by 17%), security (improved by 8%), authentication accuracy (increased by 8%),
    data confidentiality rate (improved by 9%), authentication time (improved by 11%)
    and privacy-preserving rate (increased by 7%). Security: Chen et al. [95], Tripathi
    et al. [81], Hemalatha et al. [96] and Zaabar et al. [97] have worked to improve
    security while storing medical data. Chen et al. [95] discussed the healthcare
    domain and the challenge it faces in storing health records such as no assurance
    of integrity and reliability of patient information, privacy leaks, centralized
    approach, and malicious tampering. Furthermore, the authors showcased the opportunities
    offered by BC technology in the healthcare domain like patient control over the
    data, storage security, privacy, tamper-proof, and interoperability. For this
    authors have presented a scheme to store medical data using BC and compared it
    with the traditional approach in terms of tamper-proof, privacy protection, and
    secure storage. In line with [95], Tripathi et al. [81] not only discussed the
    technical challenges such as data security, users’ privacy, and lack of skilled
    manpower, but also highlighted social barriers such as reluctance to adopt new
    technology, conventional and irrational mindset, and absence of core infrastructure,
    in the adoption of the smart healthcare system. To mitigate these issues authors
    proposed a BC-based framework for smart healthcare to attain the security and
    integrity of the data. BC allows privacy preserved and secure data exchange of
    patient data. Entities involved in Smart and secured healthcare system (S2HS)
    are mainly connected using a wireless sensor network (WSN). Entities involved
    are IoT-based wearable devices, EHR, encryption/decryption and standardization,
    BC mechanism, and end-users. Their proposed approach uses two-level of BC i.e.
    private and public BC to provide isolation among the entities involved and helps
    in achieving consistent and transparent workflow. Taking forward the same issue,
    in 2021, author Hemalatha et al. [96] highlighted the challenges in a traditional
    approach like a single point of failure, mistrust, data manipulation, and tampering,
    and how BC can resolve these issues. To resolve such issues, the authors proposed
    a BC-IoT-based approach to protect and save storage of the medical data. Their
    approach suggested using private BC as it is more stable and provides stronger
    authentication processing. BC with KSI (public key infrastructure strategies)
    is used to verify data integrity and Merkle root hash is used to validate the
    timestamp. To test the performance of the proposed framework, the authors used
    Apache JMeter and showed that the proposed approach takes less time than the current
    system. Along with that, in 2021, Zaabar et al. [97] proposed a Hyperledger fabric
    BC, based approach for the secured management of healthcare data and resolves
    the storage issues of a centralized system. For storage of data, the decentralized
    database OrbitDB with IPFS, as an off-chain database is used. For communication
    HTTP and CoAP (constrained application protocol) are used. In particular, six
    layers are there; IoT physical layer, connectivity layer, off-chain database layer,
    BC network layer, application layer, and users layer. Moreover, analysis was done
    in terms of data integrity, confidentiality, availability, traceability, and data
    privacy. Pandya et al. [98] discussed that federated learning is a cost-effective
    and promising solution to healthcare incorporating privacy, as it utilizes a distributed
    AI approach to receive local updates from various medical devices, such as the
    Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices so that local data does not have to
    be accessed directly, which helps in preserving privacy leaks. Ch, Rupa et al.
    [99] proposed a cyber–physical system and blockchain-based smart healthcare system.
    Bayesian grey filter-based convolution neural network (BGF-CNN), PSO, and GWO
    optimization techniques are used. Moreover, Blockchain with CPS is used to enhance
    security. In particular, accuracy and time complexity are improved. Real Time
    Monitoring: In 2018, Wang et al. [82] and Griggs et al. [101] both worked in the
    same direction and propose approach for real-time monitoring of the patient. Wang
    et al. [82] used an artificial system, computational experiments, and parallel
    execution in combination with BC technology to link patients, hospitals, and healthcare
    communities for sharing of health records. Further, the authors developed a blockchain-based
    system using consortium type BC to deal with the specific case of Gout disease.
    For data storage, the hash of the data is stored on the blockchain, and for generating
    the consensus among the nodes, used Delegated proof of stake (DPoS) consensus
    algorithm. DPoS allows nodes to elect some number of trustees called delegates,
    who can collect transactions turn by turn and bundle them in a block. The remaining
    nodes verify the block and add it to the BC. Data sharing and record review are
    performed using BC-enabled smart contracts. Here health bureaus serve as the audit
    nodes to ensure integrity. While Griggs et al. [101] proposed an approach for
    automated remote patient monitoring, by sending notifications to the patient and
    medical professionals along with a record of who has initiated the activity. All
    the sensitive medical information will not be stored on the BC but stored using
    an EHR storage database instead only the fact that the event occurred is stored
    on the BC. The logs about measurements and treatments are also stored on the blockchain
    along with smart contracts. Authors used a smart contract (written using solidity
    language) for automatic analysis of health data collected and trigger alerts for
    unusual activity. The authors proposed a DApp to manage the user interface. Furthermore,
    their work presented a comparison of the proposed approach with the traditional
    approach in numerous aspects like confidentiality, availability, immutability,
    traceability, speed, privacy, and transparency. In line with that in 2021, Chen
    et al. [103] presented an IPFS and BC-enabled framework for the detection of diabetes
    in a very secure way. In particular have three phases i.e., registration phase,
    user authentication phase, and IoT data upload with BC phase. It uses IPFS for
    storage and smart contract for the exchange of money in a transparent way. Moreover,
    the authors presented the performance evaluation of their proposed approach in
    terms of accountability, block capacity, and processing time of transaction. Table

    ✓ Data Sharing: Cyran et al. [100] and Carter et al. [102] worked to improve the
    data sharing between hospitals and patients. Cyran et al. [100] highlighted the
    challenges in the current centralized system like meeting the scale, accessibility,
    and security requirements of healthcare organizations, and suggested BC as a promising
    solution for addressing these challenges. Authors proposed a BC-based solution
    for protecting sensitive health-related information and deployment of BC across
    various hospitals at large scale. For the deployment of BC across the hospital
    authors built a containerized solution. The proposed approach includes the owner
    for each piece of data and has the right to decide what amount of data can be
    accessed by whom at varying levels. Moreover, the proposed system enables the
    data owner to revoke access to the data and ensures that the receiver’s private
    key with data is not sufficient to access data. While in 2019, Carter et al. [102]
    discussed the interoperability challenge, in sharing data. To resolve this challenge,
    the authors have suggested an approach using the Amazon web service and Ethereum
    BC. The proposed approach uses AWS cloud service, information related to patient
    health identifiers such as Data of Birth (DoB), name, and address are not stored
    on public BC but stored using AWS cloud storage as AWS is highly customizable
    and provides security in sharing health data digitally. Belhadi et al. [104] proposed
    an ensemble learning model for medical image segmentation, for which a voting
    mechanism is used. To secure the learning process blockchain technology is used.
    The paper highlights the advantages of blockchain-enabled IoMT. Moreover, the
    author evaluated the framework IoMT in four different medical datasets. Table
    6, lists out the work done in integrating BC-Health care. 3.1.3. Summary Healthcare
    is a platform where concerned professionals take care of various diseases and
    cure patients. By introducing smart healthcare systems, society will be benefited
    in terms of public healthcare management, online access, medical data sharing,
    availability of data, no central node dependency, and a patient-centric system.
    Nonetheless, the existing system has a few lacking areas such as lack of trust,
    scattered data, centralized approach, security, and privacy. By the application
    of BC, these challenges can be resolved in terms of accuracy, global health data
    sharing, irreversible transactions, distributed and decentralized storage, transparency,
    no third-party involvement, and authorized access. All these features will help
    in improving the overall functioning of the healthcare ecosystem and enable various
    stakeholders to securely access complete medical history which is generally scattered
    among different hospitals and medical institutions. Numerous research works have
    been carried out to explore the applicability of BC in the healthcare domain.
    In particular, researchers have made efforts to enhance authentication and access
    control of medical data using digital signatures, node authenticity, and improved
    key establishment. To enhance security hierarchical BC, public key infrastructure
    strategies, and private type BC are used. Furthermore, off-chain (cloud) data
    storage, consortium type BC, and DPoS consensus algorithm have been suggested
    for real-time monitoring and data sharing with revocability. Few points that need
    attention for widespread adoption of BC in healthcare are better infrastructure
    and interconnection for easy adoption, secured data sharing among hospitals in
    a more cost controllable manner, and more implementation options can be explored
    with hyperledger, a medical BC network connecting as many health organizations,
    the privacy of patient‘s can be improvised by adding anonymous identity. Moreover,
    parallel healthcare systems can be improved and used for other diseases also other
    than Gout disease. Apart from these, a BC-based interoperable electronic health
    record-sharing framework can also be implemented using faster-distributed ledger
    technologies with identity management of patients. Although there are numerous
    benefits of using BC and smart contracts in the healthcare domain, there exist
    some challenges such as scalability, immense data management, Interoperability,
    and a large number of concurrent users. Moreover, some of the operational aspects
    that need attention for the widespread adoption of BC in healthcare are awareness
    among the users, standardization, lack of trust among hospitals and patients to
    share their medical details, and onboarding of various medical organizations over
    BC-based platforms. 3.2. Smart homes A smart home is an IoT-enabled home that
    improves the quality of life of the members of the home by providing them automation,
    security, comfort, and convenience and allowing them to control the gadgets installed
    in the house using a mobile application [105]. In simple words, smart home enables
    automation of daily routine tasks with the help of gadgets or devices installed
    in a house [42]. For a home to be a smart home, it must-have network connectivity,
    IoT devices, and a mobile application to access and control devices from anywhere
    [105]. Smart home adoption rate is continuously growing at a rate of 20.8% from
    the year 2018 to 2022 [106]. The global market for smart meters and home automation
    will grow to $44 billion by 2025 [107]. Some facets of a smart home are smart
    door locks, smart lighting, smart parking, and video surveillance [105]. The key
    challenges faced by smart home applications are security (such as authorization,
    authentication, access control), privacy (data and user), and system configuration
    security [106], [108]. Another challenge is IoT devices have limited memory and
    power. Moreover, conventional IoT systems are centralized and a single point of
    failure can occur. To resolve these challenges BC is the most suitable and promising
    solution [108]. A private blockchain can be used to manage the communication among
    devices and these communications can be recorded as transactions on the BC [84].

    of Blockchain in smart home [106], [109], [110]. 3.2.1. Applications of blockchain
    in smart homes A smart home consists of IoT-enabled devices (smart devices) and
    mobile applications for remote access. These IoT-enabled devices need to communicate
    with each other. For example, when someone enters the home, the light should automatically
    turn on; for this, the lamp needs to receive signals from the motion sensor [84].
    The BC technology enables secure communication among smart devices installed inside
    the smart home, and each device can request data from other devices instantly
    [111]. Communication between these devices are considered as transactions and
    private BC is used to keep the track of these transactions which are immutably
    stored in the BC ledger. Miners, installed in the smart home, are devices that
    process all incoming and outgoing transactions to and from the devices in smart
    home [112]. • Security and Privacy - IoT enabled smart homes generate and exchange
    lot of personal data between the installed devices [112]. Use of heterogeneous
    IoT devices used in smart home creates security, privacy and authentication challenges.
    Existing security frameworks to overcome these challenges are mostly centralized
    along with noisy and incomplete data and thus are not well suited for IoT enabled
    smart home [108], [113]. BC with its strong security, pseudonymity, distributed
    and decentralized nature has potential to resolve these challenges in unified
    manner. • Data Storage - Smart home is a collection of various physical devices,
    connected to internet, sharing data continuously [109]. Data being generated by
    IoT enabled smart home can be very large. The data storage by IoT devices does
    not meet users security requirements because of low capacity, multiple connectivity
    to the internet and heterogeneity [114]. BC can play a vital role in data storage
    along with maintaining privacy and security [115]. 3.2.2. Related work The research
    works related to smart homes have been discussed under different categories which
    are discussed as follows: Privacy & Security: Dorri et al. [116], Aung et al.
    [117], Dorri et al. [112], Dang et al. [113], Singh et al. [118] and Arif et al.
    [108] worked to improve privacy and security in IoT-enabled smart home. In 2016,
    Dorri et al. [116] proposed a lightweight architecture using BC technology by
    removing all the extra overheads of BC but at the same time, it maintains most
    of the security and privacy benefits of BC. The proposed architecture is hierarchical
    and includes three tiers; smart home, overlay network, and cloud storage. The
    first-tier smart home has local BC. Some key attributes of local BC are it is
    always mined by a device that is always online and high processing, managed by
    its owner (responsible for adding or removing devices), and the block is mined
    and added to the chain without solving PoW consensus algorithm which helps in
    reducing extra overheads of BC. Second-tier uses an overlay network which is the
    same as a peer-to-peer network that uses public BC. The nodes (home miner, devices,
    user’s smartphone) present in the network use Tor for connecting to the overlay
    network to add extra anonymity to the network. If the user has more than one smart
    home then they can use shared BC; this can lead to forking in shared BC as each
    device present in the network can decide whether to keep the block or not. To
    resolve this, devices maintain a table containing the block number and hash of
    the data for the last transaction. The proposed architecture is especially for
    storing and accessing data use cases. At last, the author has evaluated the overhead
    and performance of the proposed architecture and shown that it has constant performance.
    In 2017, Aung et al. [117] discussed about the security and privacy issue in IoT-enabled
    smart homes and suggested an approach of integrating BC with IoT to resolve these
    issues. The author suggested using the Ethereum BC platform and proposed and architecture
    that consists of a smart home miner (device to maintain private BC), private BC
    (to store the policies set up by the homeowner or for managing transactions),
    and local storage. Managing transactions means either storing, accessing, or monitoring
    transactions. But before managing these transactions private BC needs to check
    the policies set up by the homeowner means which sensors can store data, who can
    monitor the data and the only homeowner can change smart contract policies. For
    managing all these activities smart contracts are used and computationally intensive
    mining is not required, which means no need for modern hardware with high-processing
    CPUs. In 2017, Dorri et al. [112] proposed an architecture to extend its previous
    work [116]. The proposed architecture includes three tiers same as in [116]. Smart
    homes are connected using shared overlays and groups of these overlays are termed
    clusters, where each cluster chooses a Cluster Head (CH) which are connected using
    public BC with two key lists PK requester (list of overlay users‘ PK) and PK requestee
    (list of PKs of smart homes connected to the cluster). Authors considered four
    different components in their proposed BC and IoT enabled smart home: transaction
    (communication between local devices), local BC (private BC to keep a record of
    transactions), home miner (device that process incoming and outgoing transactions),
    and local storage (a backup device used by smart devices to store data locally
    in FIFO order). Finally, the author evaluated the performance by using the Cooja
    simulator in terms of packet overhead, time overhead, and energy consumption.
    The evaluation results show little increase but are manageable and security is
    analyzed in terms of confidentiality, integrity, and availability against DDOS
    attacks and linking attacks. In 2018, Dang et al. [113] proposed a BC-IoT-based
    architecture for smart homes (termed as SHIB — smart home IoT BC) to resolve the
    security and privacy issues. Authors designed three smart contracts: ACC (access
    control contract for registering, updating, or deleting access control method),
    JC (judge contract for updating the misbehavior judging method), and RC (register
    contract for updating or deleting policy of ACC). Also, it has the facility of
    adding or removing IoT devices just by adding or deleting respective smart contracts
    (only the owner can perform this activity). The proposed SHIB architecture mainly
    includes a service provider (a device that interacts between IoT devices and storage
    devices), a storage device (devices for storing the collected data), the user
    (owner of a smart home), and a smart home (home where IoT devices are installed).
    At last, the author presented the comparison between the proposed and existing
    architecture using terms of smart contract, the privacy of data, usage of tokens,
    updating policies, and judging the misbehavior. Moving ahead in 2019, Singh et
    al. [118] present a blockchain and cloud computing-based smart home architecture
    known as SH-BlockCC. For analyzing network traffic proposed architecture uses
    MCA (multivariate correlation analysis). Their proposed architecture includes
    a smart home layer, blockchain layer, cloud computing, and service layer. Authors
    also discussed the challenges being faced by the smart home such as security and
    privacy, scalability and access control, availability and reliability, and confidentiality
    and integrity. Furthermore, authors talked about numerous services provided by
    the smart home such as remote controlling lights, fuel/smoke leakage, trapped
    in a bathroom, smart refrigerators, security alarms, and measures of important
    health signs. Their approach uses ZigBee technology. Finally evaluated the performance
    across various parameters like confidentiality, integrity, availability, authentication,
    and privacy using Cooja and Netsim simulator and the result shows SH-BlockCC covers
    all these security aspects. Next in 2020, Arif et al. [108] described various
    security issues because of limited storage and processing power and suggested
    BC as the most promising solution. The authors proposed architecture using consortium
    BC. As public BC is an open network and scalability is an issue, the author prefers
    to use consortium BC with PoW consensus algorithm and SHA-256 algorithm for mining
    and transaction verification. Fundamental building blocks are sensor node (for
    communicating with supernodes; responsible for transaction verification), supernode
    (peer-to-peer server as well as storage for BC ledger; responsible for transaction
    management and blockchain storage), blockchain (uses PoW mechanism), and user
    (admin user and general user; users are authorized by RESTful API). In line with
    that, in 2021, Ammi et al. [119] and Qashlan et al. [120] worked to improve the
    privacy and security of smart homes. Ammi et al. [119] proposed an approach for
    a secure smart home by using BC and improved some of the features like privacy,
    integrity, availability, and confidentiality. The proposed approach has four layers;
    cloud storage, hyperledger fabric, hyperledger composer, and smart home layer.
    On the other side, Qashlan et al. [120] proposed an approach by combining attribute-based
    access control with smart contracts and edge computing to resolve the security
    and privacy-related challenges while data collection and sharing. In particular
    have four users; end-user, IoT devices, smart home multi-edge servers, and the
    cloud. Their proposed approach is shown to be resilient against DoS attacks, data
    mining, modification, and linkage attack. Moreover, authors performed the analysis
    in terms of block size, gas cost, and time cost to determine the feasibility and
    efficiency of the proposed approach. In 2022, Liao et al. [121] proposed an approach
    by combining numerous cloud services for secure access control and a hyperledger
    fabric alliance chain. In particular, uses an elliptic curve cryptography algorithm.
    Simulation results show that the proposed approach has a better access control
    scheme. Transactive Energy Management:Yang et al. [122] proposed a BC-based approach
    for transactive energy management in smart homes to resolve the challenges being
    faced by conventional methods such as low efficiency, lack of privacy, and single
    point of failure. It uses open access consortium BC with smart contracts for energy
    management and payment in a decentralized manner; an elliptic curve digital signature
    and distributed optimization algorithm for faster processing and small transactions.
    The authors discussed three reasons to use BC; no need for any central authority,
    secure data communication at low cost, and easy payment option. The proposed approach
    is presented in three steps; the first smart home model includes the load and
    generation, the second trans-active energy management system is introduced, and
    finally, the design of the BC used. The author modified the PBFT consensus algorithm
    and included a leader selection algorithm and message aggregation scheme which
    helps in saving the network bandwidth and increases the speed of the consensus
    process. For leader selection algorithm uses a round-robin leader selection algorithm
    and secondly, messages collected by the leader elected are aggregated in a single
    confirmation message to others in prepare and commit phase, which saves the network
    bandwidth and speeds up the consensus process. The authors also analyzed the performance
    using a systematic test on a realistic network of IoT devices and numerical simulation
    with data collected and the results show that overall cost reduces by 25%. For
    evaluating BC-IoT, uses Quorum as Quorum is a modified form of Ethereum and it
    modified the PoW algorithm of Ethereum into the PBFT algorithm. Storage & Computation:
    Zhou et al. [109] and Ren et al. [115] worked in the same direction to resolve
    the storage challenge in IoT-enabled smart homes. Zhou et al. [109] proposed a
    BC-IoT-based architecture with a smart contract. The architecture includes a smart
    contract (present in each smart home), private BC (local BC in each smart home),
    and public BC (peer-to-peer BC network to connect the houses). Core components
    included are: transactions, smart contract, local storage (data is uploaded to
    the local miner every 10 days due to storage limitations), security (CIA: confidentiality,
    integrity, and availability), and registration service (IoT devices need to be
    registered in a distributed ledger). Taking forward, in 2021, Ren et al. [115]
    discussed the challenges faced by the smart home such as unauthorized access and
    tampering with data. Security challenges other than these are information disclosure,
    illegal user invasion, and equipment failure. To mitigate these issues author
    proposed an identity-based proxy aggregate signature (IBPAS) for improving signature
    verification, compressing storage space, and reducing communication bandwidth.
    IBPAS consists of six elements: Setup, Key-Gen, Delegation, Proxy-Sign, Aggregate,
    and Verify. IBPAS is used to make sure data is viewed by only the home admin and
    BC storage space is compressed. Their proposed scheme uses an edge network center
    to manage smart devices. The administrator generates a proxy signature for each
    block and then aggregates all to obtain the final signature. Then cloud server
    sends the final signature to the BC. Finally, the author analyzed the IBPAS with
    existing aggregate signature schemes and shows that IBPAS has better in terms
    of communication energy consumption and reduces storage space as various signatures
    are aggregated into one. Device Monitoring: Baucas et al. [123] proposed an approach
    to monitor IoT-enabled devices in smart homes to reinforce security. In particular
    uses private BC, to find unrecognized devices and localization, to gain more information
    about the source of an attack, and the Kalman filter is used to increase the accuracy.
    Furthermore, analysis shows that private BC with WiFi is the most consistent choice.

    – – ✓ 3.2.3. Summary The smart home aims to provide its residents with convenience,
    comfort and reduces efforts, and helps in managing, monitoring, controlling, and
    scheduling tasks with just one click i.e., remote monitoring systems and automation.
    For home automation, devices must be connected to the internet which leads to
    IoT-enabled smart homes. The existing IoTized smart home approach faces challenges
    such as the risk of cyber-attacks, threats to personal data privacy and confidentiality,
    unauthorized access control, and centralized architecture. The application of
    BC for IoT-driven smart homes can help in mitigating these issues. BC offers distributed,
    decentralized, and irreversible transactions, which means as new data arrives,
    the consensus is established among the nodes to validate it and a copy of the
    ledger is updated at each node. Several research works have been carried out to
    explore the capability of BC in IoT-enabled smart homes. Authors worked in numerous
    directions like privacy and security, energy management, and storage and computation.
    For privacy and security, both public and private BC along with smart contracts,
    ZigBee technology, consensus algorithms (such as PoW and PBFT), and elliptic curve
    digital signature are used. For storage and computation, private BC with cloud
    storage is preferred and implemented using the Cooja simulator. Whereas, for energy
    management, consortium BC, smart contracts, elliptic curve digital signature,
    and PBFT consensus is used. Despite the benefits offered by BC-powered IoT-enabled
    smart homes, there exist many challenges. Some of them are large energy consumption
    due to inherent computation required in BC, scalability issues in terms of connected
    devices and a large amount of data generated, and interoperability issues. IoT-enabled
    smart home involves heterogeneous devices with different operating systems which
    makes communication and onboarding on the same platform difficult. Hence, there
    are some areas which need more focus from future prospectus are reduction in computational
    complexity of decentralized algorithms, increased throughput, and interoperability.
    3.3. Smart cities A smart city offers higher quality of life to residents, maximum
    utilization of resources, and brings transparency in governance. Smart cities
    are built by connecting and integrating their systems and infrastructures using
    communication technologies, which work collectively to generate intelligent information
    [124], [125]. According to a report, 86% of developed countries and 64% of the
    developing countries will be urbanized by 2050 [126]. According to the United
    Nations report, 55% of the global population lives in urban areas presently, which
    is 30% in 1950 and this will reach up to 68% by 2050 [125]. With the increasing
    number of people moving from villages to cities, city planners and municipal governments
    are facing difficulties. As a result, challenges such as traffic congestion, air
    pollution, greenhouse gas emission, and waste disposal are affecting the quality
    of life of citizens [84]. Thus, smart cities intends bring many advantages such
    as effective management of traffic, improved health, education, energy services,
    transparency in government sectors, and involvement of citizens [84]. Application
    areas of the smart city where BC can have an impact are education, identity management,
    land registration, energy and waste management, public utilities, and intelligent
    government services [124]. Challenges in implementing such systems also exist
    such as accuracy, uniformity, completeness, and timeliness. Many of the issues
    can be resolved by using BC technology and its features like immutability, provenance,
    and availability. Fig. 9, shows some of the application areas of BC in smart cities.
    Some of the global BC initiatives in the government and public sector as discussed
    in [124] and are summarized below: • Government of Estonia has its own BC solution
    known as KSI to integrate and maintain national e-health records. • Government
    of Dubai has partnered with IBM and Consensys, to enable all transactions on BC
    and termed Smart Dubai. 3.3.1. Applications of blockchain in smart cities • Smart
    Governance - Government spends some portion of its annual budget on social welfare
    schemes for poor, sick, elder, and underprivileged citizens. However, due to the
    lack of proper system such facilities can be misused. Individuals can create multiple
    copies of their identities and submit them before the authorities, which causes
    inefficiency and corruption in the system. To avoid such situations, BC can be
    used to make the system more transparent and traceable [124]. Also, BC can be
    used to implement voting system for citizens from the comfort of their homes,
    where citizens’ identity can be verified using BC [127]. Thus, BC-enabled smart
    digital governance approaches can pave the way for improved public administration,
    improved service deliveries, enhanced transparency and accountability [128]. •
    Agriculture - Price extortion, higher prices, the presence of a middleman, quality
    of food, and manipulations in expiry dates are some of the open challenges being
    faced by the agriculture domain. The agricultural food supply chain includes farmers,
    agents, transportation, wholesaler, shopkeepers, and consumers, all can be connected
    in a trustless manner using BC. Moreover, BC provides end-to-end visibility and
    allows tracing the origin of the product and gives a secure, transparent, and
    efficient supply chain [124]. Thus, for building resilient, secure, transparent,
    and trustworthy agricultural food supply chain BC has been considered as a vital
    technology [129]. • Smart Education - To implement BC in the education domain,
    BC can be used where multiple educational institutes, teaches and students can
    join to manage and access the records such as student details, migration from
    one institute to another, course or degree completed along with the transcripts
    [84], [130]. Moreover, BC can be used to store the learning activities of students
    across different organizations [131]. In future, with the increasing online mode
    of education, BC is expected to contribute towards decentralized and secure education
    ecosystem. • Digital Identity - Blockchain provides a platform where the identities
    of the citizens can be stored digitally and can be accessed by citizens from anywhere.
    One example of a practical application of digital identities is the Estonian e-Residency
    program which enables users to create a Digital Identity [132]. Download : Download

    of blockchain in smart cities [84], [124]. 3.3.2. Related work The research works
    related to smart cities have been discussed under different categories which are
    discussed as follows: Security & Privacy: Biswas et al. [133], Sharma et al. [126],
    Rahman et al. [134], Zhang et al. [135] and Kumar et al. [136] all of them worked
    to achieve better security and privacy in a trustworthy manner in IoT enabled
    smart cities. Authors Biswas et al. [133] proposed a framework by integrating
    BC with smart devices installed in smart cities for secure communication. Also
    identified the major threats to smart cities such as threats to availability,
    integrity, confidentiality, authenticity, and accountability, and discussed various
    key attributes provided by BC such as improved reliability and better fault tolerance
    capability. For achieving security, the proposed framework includes mainly four
    layers; the physical layer (which includes sensors and actuators), the communication
    layer (which includes various communication mechanisms such as Bluetooth, WiFi,
    Ethernet, and 6LoWPAN), the database layer (which includes distributed ledgers
    and suggested to use private ledgers to ensure scalability, performance, and security)
    and interface layer (includes various smart applications). In 2018, Sharma et
    al. [126] proposed architecture for a smart city by integrating a software-defined
    network(SDN) with BC. The proposed architecture includes a core (miner nodes with
    high computation and storage resources) and edge network (limited storage and
    computation power), due to which it inherits properties of both centralized and
    distributed networks. Miner nodes are responsible for block creation and verifying
    PoW. For maintaining the integrity of the data, digital signatures and hashing
    (Argon2-based hashing) are used. Includes memory-hardened PoW scheme called “Itsuku
    PoW” and helps in resolving issues such as a raw re-computation attack, memory
    saving, pseudo-random array, parallel searches, and hash composability attack.
    To set up a private BC network it uses Go Ethereum. Finally, the performance is
    analyzed in terms of hash rate (continuously adjusted according to the difficulty)
    and block size (number of transactions for variable block size) which shows that
    the proposed system attains better performance. Also evaluated was the performance
    overhead of the proposed system in terms of latency and throughput. Authors Rahman
    et al. [134] proposed a BC-based infrastructure to provide security and privacy-oriented
    smart contract service for IoT-enabled economy in smart cities. Smart contracts
    offer Spatio-temporal service at a global level without a central authority. For
    system, implementation authors have taken the example of Hajj as a massive crowded
    area. In 2020, Zhang et al. [135] worked to achieve higher data accuracy and to
    reduce the possibility of data being stolen. For this reason, they have proposed
    an LDC (Lightweight data consensus) algorithm based on BC, to be used in smart
    cities and presented a comparison with the traditional approach. After that in
    2021, authors Kumar et al. [136] presented a framework for smart cities named
    trustworthy privacy-preserving secured framework (TP2SF). It includes three modules;
    trustworthiness, two-level privacy, and intrusion detection module. The trustworthiness
    module uses an address-based BC reputation system to ensure that recorded data
    is authentic. In the two-level privacy module, the first level is used for authenticating
    data processing by using the SHA-512 hashing algorithm and enhanced proof of work
    consensus algorithm, and the second level is used for data transformation and
    generation, and original data was transformed into another format by using PCA
    based privacy preservation (feature mapping, selection, normalization, and transformation).
    The proposed approach is deployed using IPFS-based off-chain CloudBlock and BC-enabled
    on-chain FogBlock. The authors analyzed the framework in terms of accuracy, detection
    rate, F1 score, and precision score using two IoT datasets called BoT-IoT and
    ToN-IoT. Experiments are performed using R, Python language, and the machine learning
    algorithm SciKit-learn. The framework is implemented using Ethereum, smart contracts
    written in solidity language, and IPFS. Trustworthiness: Khan et al. [137] highlighted
    the importance of video surveillance in cities to keep an eye on the activities
    happening in the city and presents a BC-based system to store the recordings of
    the video to ensure the trustworthiness of the recordings and will help in differentiating
    between the fake videos and the original video cost-effectively. In particular,
    it includes six participants; a control room manager (CRM): To ensure the operator
    operates all devices, control room supervisors (CRS): who manage all devices in
    line, operators: who perform proactive and reactive surveillance, police officers
    (POs): manages police radio, police control room operators (PCROs): communicates
    CCTV command room operatives and local authority staff (LAS): manages police radio
    to communicate CCTV command room. Data Sharing: Cha et al. [138] discussed the
    challenges being faced during public cloud storage and how BC and secret sharing
    can resolve the personal information sharing issue. The authors also highlighted
    the advantages provided by the proposed system such as a large amount of data
    can be stored on an external cloud service provider (CSP), resolving privacy issues
    that occur in CSP, and data can be restored and verified for integrity. The proposed
    architecture uses consortium BC and a secret sharing algorithm for managing user
    data from CSPs. The proposed approach includes mainly five steps; data gathering,
    processing, data transaction, secret sharing, and data reconstruction. Moreover,
    compared and analyzed the proposed system in terms of the AES-128 encryption algorithm
    and the execution speed. Along with this also discussed how it provides security
    in the smart city use case. Energy Management: Khattak et al. [139] proposed a
    BC-based application for the automatic exchange of electricity between residents.
    The price is calculated by the admin (legal centralized authority). The author
    has highlighted the application of BC in managing energy in smart cities. Discussed
    the automatic bidding of supply and demand for energy. In particular, uses a hyper-ledger
    fabric framework for maintaining privacy and confidentiality as participants are
    directly affiliated with an exchange of electricity and money, and the ledger
    is updated and notified. Authentication & Authorization: Esposito et al. [140]
    and Ferreira et al. [141] worked in the same direction to enhance the authentication
    and authorization in smart cities. Esposito et al. [140] highlighted that existing
    smart city applications are a combination of different existing applications where
    each application has its own set of privacy policies which leads to the challenges
    such as consistent and secure data replicas. To resolve this issue author proposes
    a BC-based approach-integrating it into the FIWARE platform for distributed management
    of identity and authorization policies with a global view of policies within the
    system. In the proposed work permissioned BC platform Hyperledger Fabric is used
    to maintain the consistency between the repositories holding security policies
    and the Kafka-based consensus algorithm. Smart contract chain code is used for
    registration, query, and modification of identity information. In addition to
    this, the proposed approach is evaluated in comparison to the existing approach.
    On the other side, Ferreira et al. [141] proposed an approach to improve the registration
    and authentication of IoT devices in smart city applications. In particular, the
    authors developed API gateways and network gateways to identify and authorize
    messages. Authors have proposed HTTP API gateways, edge computing, network gateways,
    and fog computing. Smart contracts are responsible for registering IoT devices
    and associating them with their respective owners. Table 8, summarizes the work

    foundation for global urbanization where emerging technologies are used to offer
    its citizens effortless services such as smart transportation, smart governance,
    smart healthcare, and smart education. To provide such services the role of IoT
    is considered to be significant. Despite the numerous advantages of IoT-based
    smart cities, it faces some challenges like privacy, security, centralization,
    and denial of service that are preventing faster adaptation of smart cities. These
    challenges can be resolved by combining BC with IoT-smart homes. BC offers irreversible
    transactions, distributed and decentralized architecture, and non-repudiation,
    to its users. Integrating BC with a smart city offers lower administrative costs,
    reduces corruption, and provides a platform for integrated documents. Authors
    have worked in numerous directions i.e., security and privacy, data sharing, trustworthiness,
    energy management, and authorization. For data sharing authors have used external
    cloud storage, consortium BC with a secret sharing algorithm. While for energy
    management and authentication & authorization, permissioned BC platform hyper
    ledger fabric was used. On the other side, authors preferred private BC with a
    PoW consensus algorithm, digital signatures, hashing, and smart contracts to attain
    better privacy and security. Still, there is some future direction that needs
    further attention. Some of them are electricity distribution among the residents
    can be improved, in real-time data sharing distributed sharing algorithm need
    to be more secure, load balancing is another important concern, various emerging
    technologies can be merged like edge and deep leaning with BC enabled smart city.
    BC-IoT-driven smart city offers innumerable opportunities. Yet some challenges
    are typically faced such as massive data storage, scalability, a large number
    of simultaneous users, and chances of centralization. 3.4. Supply chain and logistics
    A supply chain means it is a logical chain of all the different stakeholders involved
    in the different phases of the supply chain. Phases involved in the supply chain
    of any product are raw material, transportation, manufacturing, shipment, wholesalers,
    retailers, and consumers [142]. It is estimated that the worldwide supply chain
    market will expand at a rate of 87% and by the end of the year 2023, it will rise
    from $45 million to $3,314.6 million [143]. A product is a combination of different
    resources provided by possibly different manufacturers across different geographic
    locations. Because of the lack of transparency in the traditional supply chain
    many times low-quality products are counterfeited with the original product. Some
    other challenges faced by conventional supply chains are lack of end-to-end visibility,
    lack of complete trust, ineffective information flow, and lack of advance technologies
    [144]. According to the report of Microsoft out of 408 organizations in 64 countries,
    69% of them lack full visibility in their supply chain and 65% of them have experienced
    disruption in the supply chain [143]. According to a report by Scarano, 70,000
    consumers signed a petition that urged large companies to improvise their supply
    chain transparency [143]. Download : Download high-res image (408KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 10. Application of blockchain in supply chain
    & logistics (food supply chain) [124]. BC integrated IoT can transform the landscape
    of supply chain and logistics by instilling complete visibility, traceability,
    trust, dispute settlement, automation, and auditibility [145]. By using BC not
    only the transparency and the security but also the physical flow of the product
    also increases as decision-making becomes quick [142]. Traceability is very crucial
    in the food and agriculture sector because it helps in providing information about
    the entire food life cycle to ensure the quality of the food [146]. Through e-commerce
    websites, packed foods were delivered and consumers need to pay for food items
    without having any food quality information, and packed foods are more sensitive
    to environmental conditions, and sometimes deterioration of food occurs [146].
    The typical supply chain process focuses mainly on the origin of the raw material
    but today the scope has expanded from origin to end customer. In this context,
    BC-enabled framework can be build, which can potentially offer access to the required
    data at every touchpoint [67]. Furthermore, because of the distributed and decentralized
    nature of BC, all the stakeholders in a supply chain network can immutably view
    and access the data stored on the distributed ledger. Thus, BC allows users to
    securely, transparently, and trustlessly build a flexible and resilient supply
    chain [147]. Walmart and Kroger are the first companies who have implemented BC-based
    supply chains [148]. Some of the commercial implementations of BC in the supply
    chain are IBM Blockchain-TradeLens, which mainly focus on logistics, OriginTrail,
    to bring transparency to the international supply chain from 2013 to let its users
    know more about their food product and Blockverify, an anti-counterfeit which
    brings transparency in the supply chain (especially used in diamonds, pharmaceuticals,
    and electronic industries) [87]. TradeLens is a joint venture of IBM and Maersk
    (largest container shipping company) [149], where multiple parties can interact
    with each other and can access real-time shipping data [143]. Fig. 10, shows the
    application of BC in the supply chain of drugs. 3.4.1. Applications of blockchain
    in supply chain and logistics • Pharmaceutical supply chain - Drug counterfeiting
    is a most common problem that not only affects human lives but also economic loss
    to health sector. According to a report by WHO every year 30% of the drugs sold
    in the market are counterfeit [150]. Blockchain provides traceability capabilities
    to verify the drugs, so that the quality is not compromised [67]. By implementing
    a better system for drugs traceability, will help in protecting patients from
    using fake medicines [151]. • Food supply chain - Food supply chain is one of
    the biggest supply chains. It suffers with adulteration of food due to which health
    and societal issues are on rise. So it is critical to find a way to keep an eye
    on each phase from food cultivation to consumption. Conventional supply chains
    face difficulty in ensuring transparency and visibility, and suffers with single
    point of failure [152]. To maintain the integrity of the product and supply chain,
    records must be tamper-proof, so that the integrity of the food history is maintained
    [153]. Also, traceability brings assurance to food quality and safety. To achieve
    all these discussed features, BC is expected to play a cardinal role. 3.4.2. Related
    work The research works related to supply chain and logistics have been discussed
    under different categories which are discussed as follows: Credit Evaluation:
    Mao et al. [154] proposed a BC-based credit evaluation system for the food supply
    chain to improve supervision and management. By using BC, traders are accountable
    for all their actions, which is known as provenance in BC. The proposed approach
    is a combination of BC technology and a deep learning model to collect and analyze
    the credit evaluation of traders. The system gathers credit evaluation text from
    traders by smart contracts on the BC and is analyzed directly by a deep learning
    network named Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). Payment: Viriyasitavat et al. [155]
    put forward an approach for flexibility and smooth flow of cash and payments and
    improve the efficiency of financial transactions using BC technology and smart
    contracts. The proposed approach was explained using the proposed cryptocurrency
    Future Unspent Transactions Output (FUTXO). The proposed approach uses Blockchain
    technology, smart contracts, matching algorithms, and off-chain verification with
    the PBFT consensus algorithm. Monitoring: Weber et al. [156] presented the use
    of BC and its smart contracts in collaborative process execution and applies it
    in three different use cases i.e supply chain, incident management, and insurance
    claim handling. Moreover, authors highlighted the features of BC like decentralization
    since using BC so that no central authority is required but trust between the
    involved parties remains intact. For implementing proof of concept, authors used
    Ethereum BC platform, smart contracts, and off-chain storage. Double Chain: Leng
    et al. [157] proposed a public BC for an agriculture supply chain using double
    chain architecture. One is the user information chain and the second is the transaction
    chain. User information is recorded in the user information chain which ensures
    authenticity, integrity, and privacy, and all the transaction data is stored using
    the transaction chain which ensures authenticity, integrity, and openness. The
    key benefits of using a double chain are any node can view the resources without
    knowing the private information, reduces the redundant information, and business
    expansion can be easily implemented between platforms and financial institutions.
    Interestingly, authors proposed their own consensus algorithm which they claim
    to work efficiently for agriculture BC. Real time tracking: Helo et al. [158]
    proposed a project known as real-time supply chain architecture (RTSC) for real-time
    tracking and tracing of the supply chain using RFID, IoT, and BC. RFID and IoT
    are used for user interface and to provide real-time information and BC is used
    to verify the authenticity of transactions and provide a chain of immutable transactions.
    The proposed approach uses the Ethereum BC platform and PoW consensus algorithm.
    DApps are used to develop the front end using HTML and the back end using solidity
    smart contract and interaction between the front end and back end was done using
    web3.js. Stakeholders involved in the supply chain can track and trace data about
    the shipped items. The proposed system provides a connection between transport
    companies and tracking devices. Along with this, presented the benefits of the
    proposed system. Traceability: Tian et al. [159], Tian et al. [160], Caro et al.
    [153], Rovzman et al. [161], Tsang et al. [146], Humayun et al. [162], Agrawal
    et al. [163] and Lou et al. [164], worked in the same direction i.e., to track
    and trace the products in supply chain, which offers openness, transparency, reliability
    and trusted environment. Authors Tian et al. [159] proposed a food supply chain
    traceability system using RFID and BC technology to improve food safety and quality.
    RFID technology is used for data acquisition, circulation, and sharing, and BC
    technology is used to ensure that the information shared and published is reliable
    and authentic. The benefits of using BC technology are information is transparent
    and open, no requirement for centralized organization, and irreversible transactions.
    In 2017, Tian et al. [160] put forward a new decentralized traceability system
    which is an extension of [159], based on HACCP (Hazard analysis and critical control
    points), IoT, and BC technology. It includes mainly five links; production, processing,
    warehousing, distribution, and retail. It uses IoT (RFID, WSN, GPS) to collect
    and transfer, and BigchainDB for storing and managing data. Caro et al. [153]
    proposed a decentralized traceability approach for the agriculture food supply
    chain by integrating BC with IoT, known as AgriBlockIoT. As it directly provides
    critical information on production and consumption, it ensures transparency and
    auditable assets. The main modules included are API, controller, and Blockchain.
    Also deployed the proposed system for the use case ‘from farm to fork using two
    different BC platforms Ethereum and Hyperledger Sawtooth. Both of these provide
    a different level of customization as Ethereum works with a single transaction
    while Hyperledger allows custom transactions. A comparison of the performance
    of both the BC platforms is shown in terms of latency, CPU, and network usage
    and results show Hyperledger has better performance as compared to Ethereum. Table

    a concept to integrate BC and IoT and implemented it for supply chains. One of
    the crucial features provided by this approach is modularity which means any number
    of different types of nodes can be linked. Some of the core nodes are the genesis
    node, service node, user node, interface node, agreement node, and mapping node.
    For validation smart contracts are implemented using the Rinkeby test network.
    Tsang et al. [146] discussed the issues in the conventional supply chain like
    reliability, scalability, and information accuracy, and suggested how BC can mitigate
    these challenges. Proposes a BC -IoT-based food traceability system (BIFTS) for
    traceability in the supply chain. IoT is used for monitoring applications, collected
    data is stored using a cloud database and the food life cycle is managed by using
    BC. It is a lightweight and vaporized hybrid approach of BC and cloud. For consensus,
    it uses proof of supply chain share (PoSCS) to mint or forges the blocks and SHA-256
    for hashing. The benefits of using the proposed approach are secure and reliable
    food traceability, lightweight and vaporized design, and intelligent food quality
    evaluation. Authors also highlighted the challenges in implementing BIFTS in the
    supply chain like human errors, honesty, integrity, and open-mindedness for all
    stakeholders to adopt the system. In 2020, Humayun et al. [162] proposed a framework
    by integrating BC with IoT, named BCTLF for logistics and transportation systems
    to make the system more convenient and transparent. Authors highlighted the benefits
    of integrating BC-IoT such as freight tracking, temperature control, carrier authentication,
    and fast delivery through continuous monitoring. In particular, the authors discussed
    the two case studies to highlight the role of BC and IoT in the supply chain.
    Agrawal et al. [163] in 2021 proposed a BC-driven supply chain traceability system
    that uses distributed ledger for storage and authentication, in the textile and
    clothing industry, and explained the proposed approach at an organizational and
    operational level. In particular, the authors presented a use case of the organic
    cotton supply chain through a mass balancing validation mechanism. The proposed
    approach uses private BC, proof of work consensus algorithm, and public and private
    key pairs generated using the RSA algorithm. Lou et al. [164] proposed a BC-based
    framework named SESCF to resolve the challenges being faced by the supply chain
    such as information flow, logistics, and capital flow. The proposed approach uses
    BC, smart contracts, RFID, and payment channels. BC and smart contract ensures
    information symmetry, RFID ensures the unique identity of goods and the payment
    channel solves the issue of a payment default. The proposed approach helps in
    improving the efficiency of the supply chain by putting goods transactions on
    the chain and capital transactions off the chain. The proposed approach follows
    a layered architecture; user layer, transaction layer, and BC layer. Performance
    Evaluation: Bamakan et al. [166] proposed an approach to evaluate the performance
    of the supply chain, save computing time, and speed up information flow. The proposed
    framework includes six layers; data layer (system‘s data input sources), connection
    layer (necessary infrastructure to receive real-time information), blockchain
    layer (exploit data in conjunction with ANFIS model), smart layer (smart contracts),
    ANFIS (adaptive network-based fuzzy interface system) layer (evaluates SSC performance)
    and application layer (performance management). With the help of IoT, BC, and
    ANFIS, a performance management system is created. Security: Song et al. [165]
    proposed an approach using IoT and BC technology to form supply chains effectively.
    In particular, includes an access control framework, an access control policy
    determined by all members jointly, and BC technology to ensure all processing
    is trusted and valid. The access control list has two modules; the registration
    module (for information registration) and the inspection module (for judging misbehavior).
    Moreover, the authors have used a backup peer mechanism, internal data isolation,
    and transmission method to ensure availability. Trust Model: Al et al. [167] proposed
    a BC-driven trust model which simplifies data sharing and reduces computational,
    latency, and storage requirements. It resolves trust challenges between supply
    chain parties and maintains data integrity. In particular, it includes three modules;
    data (data produced by sensors within the supply chain and trade events in between
    its nodes), IoT network (authenticates and supervises the messages and node),
    and BC and supply chain (communicates with each other through series of queries).
    Table 9 summarizes the work done in the BC-supply chain use case. 3.4.3. Summary
    The supply chain is the chain of stakeholders involved from initial production
    stage to final consumption of any product. It aims to provide quality compliance,
    eliminate of communication gaps, optimize shipping, and customer satisfaction.
    However, there are some challenges with the existing system such as the availability
    of resources, limited transparency, traceability, trust issues, and stakeholder
    management. BC has been leveraged to overcome these challenges, such as decentralized
    collective maintenance, matching between supply and demand of resources, verifiability,
    and identifying counterfeit products. To explore the applicability of BC in supply
    chain and management various research has been done. In particular, researchers
    have made efforts to monitor, track and trace the supply chain and ensure smooth
    flow of payment. Especially for real-time tracking and monitoring, various researchers
    have used Ethereum BC platform with smart contracts, double chain, RFID, IoT,
    and Hyperledger BC. For hashing, SHA-256 and consensus PoW is preferred. Nonetheless
    there are many aspects which still need dedicated research efforts, for instance,
    analyzing scalability and interoperability for real-time use cases, speed, and
    efficiency of the consensus algorithm. Quality management, risk management, and
    e-commerce are other significant areas to be considered in the supply chain. Apart
    from information flow, BC and IoT enabled supply chain can be built that manages
    material flow, capital flow, value flow, and risk flow [146]. Lastly, interoperability,
    massive data handling, throughput enhancement are few more areas which need to
    be worked upon when considering BC and IoT enabled supply chain and logistics.
    3.5. Autonomous vehicle Vehicles are becoming smarter as they can not only gather
    information with the help of the sensors installed in them but can also communicate
    that information over the Internet and can act according to the received response
    [168]. An autonomous vehicle refers to a connected, smart, and driverless vehicle
    that can communicate or exchange data with other vehicles, city infrastructure,
    and online services or applications and is traveling without humans controlling
    the vehicle [169]. City infrastructure includes traffic lights, road work, route
    planning, etc. Autonomous vehicles are a network of a vehicle to vehicles (V2V),
    vehicles to infrastructure (V2I), vehicles to the roadside unit (v2R), and vehicles
    to pedestrians (v2P) [145]. The concept of driverless vehicles was first introduced
    in 1920 [170]. The level of automation varies from zero to full automation, according
    to NHTSA, which has classified automation into five levels, (i) no automation,
    (ii) function-specific automation, (iii) combined function automation, (iv) limited
    self-driving automation, and (v) fully autonomous vehicle [170]. According to
    a report, the smart vehicles market will be worth US$87 billion and by the end
    of the year 2040, every four out of ten vehicles could be autonomous [169]. Because
    of human errors, thousands of deaths happened each year which can be reduced to
    zero by using AVs [169]. smart insurance, and self-owning car, are the application
    of autonomous vehicles. Some practical implementations of self-driving vehicles
    are La‘Zooz, a ride-sharing application, a blockchain version of Uber [171], and
    also Uber has ordered 50,000 SUVs to deploy fully self-driving vehicles over the
    street. Implementing autonomous vehicles will help in reducing accidents, reducing
    traffic congestion, increasing lane capacity, and efficient parking. However,
    realizing these benefits from autonomous vehicles requires large exchange of small
    data and real-time processing. Moreover, the data exchanged by these smart vehicles
    leads to new privacy challenges [172]. BC and IoT enabled autonomous vehicles
    will be able to handle these challenges. 3.5.1. Applications of blockchain in
    autonomous vehicles • Electric Vehicle Charging - The increase in electric vehicles
    (EVs) has resulted in high demand for fast charging stations. In this context,
    smart vehicles connected to the owner’s smartphone can provide pro-active services.
    If the travel pattern is securely stored on BC then charging can be done automatically
    at regular intervals. Moreover, based on the secure data stored on BC, EVs can
    be provided with the most efficient charging cycle [172] and the unavailability
    of charging stations can be minimized. In addition to energy management, identity
    management of autonomous EVs is yet another area where BC can be leveraged [173].
    Share and charge are the BC-based platforms that allow P2P energy trading among
    EVs and private charging stations [56]. • Smart Insurance - Today insurance companies
    offer flexible insurance which is based on various data collected from the vehicles
    and evaluation of driving behavior like speed, and breaking pattern [172]. In
    this context, BC enabled vehicles can provide secure, distributed, privacy protected
    exchange of data. Moreover, data is shared on the basis of demand not continuously
    [172]. Since the data stored on BC is tamper-proof and distributed, users are
    not able to alter it, neither for insurance claim fraud nor for inflating insurance
    premium [174]. Smart contracts running on top of BC can enforce automatic claim
    settlement in transparent and trustless manner [175]. 3.5.2. Related work The
    research works related to autonomous vehicles have been discussed under different
    categories as follows: Payment: Jamil et al. [176] proposed a BC-based privacy-preserving
    approach for automatic payment for fueling of smart cars without human intervention,
    ensuring privacy, transparency, and trust. In particular, authors used Hyperledger
    fabric permissioned BC (to provide modular, scalable, and secure foundation),
    off-chain storage, a smart contracts written using solidity language, an elliptic
    curve to generate public and private keys, Diffie Hellman key exchange. Their
    proposed approach includes services like data sharing, smart pump management,
    secure payment transaction, smart car management, and user identity management.
    Finally, the authors analyzed the performance in terms of latency, resource consumption,
    and transactions per second using the Hyperledger caliper. Data Storage: Yin et
    al. [177] proposed a BC-based incremental update system for data storage, improving
    data records and update efficiency. Their proposed system includes only the data
    storage stage and update stage. Copies of the data are stored on different independent
    sources and their index is stored on-chain, which enhances data reliability. Along
    with that, a PoW algorithm is designed to improve transaction efficiency and reduces
    system security risk. For calculating the secret key authors used the elliptic
    curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA) and SHA 256 for hashing. Communication:
    Singh et al. [178] highlighted the issues in intelligent vehicle communication
    using a traditional approach such as trust, data accuracy, and reliability. To
    overcome these challenges, the authors proposed a reward-based approach known
    as Intelligent Vehicle-Trust Point (IV-TP) for communication using BC technology.
    The proposed approach stores all IV-TP details of every vehicle and is accessed
    by IVs. IV-TP provides fast and secure communication between IVs. It includes
    three basic technologies; connected devices, vehicular cloud computing, and BC.
    Forensic Application: Oham et al. [179] and Cebe et al. [168], both worked towards
    forensic aspects of autonomous vehicles. Oham et al. [179] proposed a distributed
    forensic framework using permissioned BC for the auto insurance liability model
    for autonomous vehicles. Their framework provides untampered evidence for automatic
    processing of insurance claims and settling disputes. Thus, the framework puts
    an end to the chances of a single point of trust and allows multiple participants
    to simultaneously agree on the evidence needed to process claims. Authors also
    presented a security analysis of the proposed framework. While Cebe et al. [168]
    proposed a framework to manage the collected data, identify faulty parts, and
    solve the disputes in case of an accident with the help of integrating vehicular
    public key infrastructure (VPKI) with permissioned BC. Their work includes three
    types of data; event data, diagnosis data, and maintenance data which is stored
    using the cloud, and respective hashes are stored in BC. The proposed system connects
    all the stakeholders involved from vehicle manufacturers to customers and offers
    traceable, privacy-aware post-accident analysis with minimum processing overhead.
    Moreover, the proposed approach includes a fragmented ledger that stores data
    such as maintenance information, history, and car diagnosis report. Security &
    Privacy: Yuan et al. [171], Dorri et al. [172], Singh et al. [180], Rathee et
    al. [181], Oham et al. [182] and Tyagi et al. [183], worked towards improving
    security and privacy in Autonomous vehicle using BC. In 2016, Yuan et al. [171]
    provided an overview of BC technology and its potential in a transportation system.
    To resolve security and privacy-related challenges, the authors proposed a seven-layer
    BC-enabled intelligent transportation system (B2ITS) and explained it using a
    case study of a ride-sharing service. Seven layers are the physical layer (which
    includes physical entities such as devices, and vehicles), the data layer (which
    includes chained data blocks using techniques such as asymmetric encryption, time
    stamping, hashing, and Merkle tree), the network layer (includes distributed networking,
    data forwarding, and verification), consensus layer (includes all possible consensus
    algorithm), incentive layer (includes incentives and rewards), contract layer
    (includes scripts, algorithm, and smart contracts) and application layer (includes
    various application scenarios). In 2017, Dorri et al. [172] discussed the conventional
    methods used in smart vehicles and highlighted the challenges namely centralization,
    lack of privacy, and safety threats, and suggested BC as a potential solution
    to all these challenges. Authors proposed a solution based on BC for automotive
    security and privacy. Stakeholders involved in the chain such as smart vehicles,
    equipment manufacturers, and service providers form an overlay network to communicate
    with each other. Communications are encrypted using asymmetric encryption. Discussed
    some of the applications of the proposed architecture like remote software updates,
    insurance, electric vehicle, smart charging services, and car-sharing service.
    Furthermore, compared it with the conventional method in terms of security and
    privacy. In 2018, Singh et al. [180] provided a brief overview of BC technology,
    its advantages like security, transparency, reliability, and its application for
    an intelligent vehicle. Moreover, the authors proposed a BC-driven approach for
    Intelligent Vehicle communication, which ensures trustworthiness among vehicles
    and evaluated the performance using real-time traffic scenarios. Rathee et al.
    [181] in 2019 highlighted the security-related challenges in smart sensors of
    connected vehicles. They proposed a security mechanism for connected autonomous
    vehicles services framework using the BC technique to ensure transparency and
    security. Initially, data is stored using an ordinary database and then stored
    permanently on BC to track each activity. The authors analyzed the proposed approach
    using NS2 simulator against the existing approaches and the results showed a 79%
    success rate. In 2021, Oham et al. [182] proposed a framework for decentralized
    security known as B-FERL for securing smart vehicles using BC. Their framework
    is based on a double-tier architecture which includes initialization operation
    (for creating a record of vehicles for authentication) and challenge-response
    mechanism (to query the integrity of the vehicle’s network). The proposed framework
    includes entities like verifiers (legal authorities) and proposers (vehicle manufacturers,
    service technicians). Transactions are secured using SHA-256, off-chain storage,
    asymmetric encryption, and digital signatures. No consensus algorithm is used,
    instead an appendable block concept is used where transactions are added by the
    verified block owner. The authors analyzed the performance of their proposed framework
    in terms of overhead, the time required, and storage space required. The results
    showed that their proposed approach is resilient against various security attacks
    such as Sybil attacks, fake data, and masquerade attacks. Authors also discussed
    the applicability of the proposed approach in various use cases such as vehicular
    forensic, trust management, and secure vehicular communication. In 2022, Tyagi
    et al. [183] proposed an approach to secure users’ personal information in smart
    vehicles using BC and IPFS. Table 10, summarizes the work done in the BC-autonomous
    vehicle use case. Table 10. Summary of related work in BC-autonomous vehicle.

    smart, and driverless vehicles that can sense, communicate and exchange data with
    other vehicles or infrastructure. Autonomous vehicles are anticipated to enhance
    road safety, reduce the number of road accidents, minimize driving errors, reduce
    traffic congestion, and enable stress-free parking. For providing such services,
    IoT is an integral part of an autonomous vehicle. The existing approach faces
    some challenges such as centralization, trust issues, privacy and security and
    the user‘s control over exchanged data is less. Combining BC with IoT-enabled
    autonomous vehicles brings opportunities such as data integrity, data sharing,
    proof of delivery, unaltered records, transparency, and reliability. To explore
    the applications of BC in an autonomous vehicle, numerous research works have
    been done in different directions like payments, data storage, communication,
    forensic application, and security and privacy. To achieve security and privacy,
    BC, SHA-256, off-chain storage, asymmetric encryption, and digital signatures
    are used. Hyperledger Fabric, off-chain storage, smart contracts, elliptic curve,
    and Diffie Hellman key exchange are used for executing payments. Apart from the
    features offered by BC, there are some challenges in integrating BC with Autonomous
    Vehicles, such as high infrastructural cost, massive data storage, scalability,
    integration into the existing system, and avoiding chances of centralization.
    Some of the research directions for BC-IoT enabled autonomous vehicles are how
    to achieve high throughput without compromising security and privacy, how BC-IoT
    autonomous vehicles can used for accident reconstruction, multiple vehicle communication
    scenarios, and privacy of smart vehicle when moving from one roadside to another.
    System intelligence can be increased by adopting deep and reinforcement learning.
    3.6. Smart grid A smart grid is also known as a smart power grid, intelligent
    grid, or future grid. A conventional power grid has to simply carry power from
    central generators and supply it to users/consumers [184]. In contrast, a smart
    grid involves use of state of the art sensing methods, communication technologies,
    interconnected power systems, advanced control and optimization techniques, smart
    metering, and integration of microgrids and other decentralized sources of renewable
    energy [185], [186]. Nowadays, solar panel installation has seen significant growth
    which has resulted in individual homeowners installing solar panels and contributing
    excess energy generated from solar panels to the larger electric grids [187].
    Due to variable energy consumption pattern, some users’ energy generation can
    be more than required and at the same time other users may be facing insufficient
    energy supplies. Thus, the former can trade their excess energy to latter [188].
    Smart homes, smart buildings, and smart infrastructure, all of these collectively
    form a smart community [189]. All of these must be supported by a smart power
    supply. The challenges being faced by conventional power supply can be reduced
    by Smart grid [189]. Along with this, these smart sensor-based metering systems
    will require less manpower as compared to the conventional approach [56]. Some
    of the general challenges faced by the smart grid are the availability of trusted
    parties for data aggregation, hiding the link between the user’s real identity,
    and pseudonym and authentication speed [189]. Implementing BC-based smart contracts
    in smart grids is an opportunity to increase the speed and security of the smart
    grid [190]. BC makes the grid network decentralized which means the supply and
    distribution of energy need not be channeled through a centralized system [56].
    For instance, users who own some form of renewable energy generation faculty such
    as solar panels can become producers by selling their surplus energy to the grid
    [56]. However, the challenge is to ensure secure and trusted energy trading between
    two trading parties. BC has potential to build decentralized and secure P2P energy
    trading platform [145]. Some existing commercial implementations are PowerLedger,
    Bankymoon, and Brooklyn [56], [87]. PowerLedger is an Australia-based startup
    that enables owners of renewable energy sources to sell their surplus energy [191].
    Bankymoon is a South Africa-based startup, that provides smart prepaid energy
    meters and supplies energy to schools and communities who need affordable power
    supply [192] and Brooklyn, launched by US energy firm is the most significant
    implementation of BC in P2P decentralized energy trading [56]. WePower is another
    Lithuania based company for energy data accounting and storage using smart contracts
    [193]. 3.6.1. Applications of blockchain in smart grids • Decentralized P2P Energy
    Trading- In a traditional grid network, the major concern is lack of security
    in a transaction of energy and high operational costs. However, the BC-based grid
    trading infrastructure is a decentralized platform that enables peer-to-peer transactions
    of energy [56], [194], [195]. Power Ledger platform provides numerous energy trading
    applications [193]. • Power Distribution and Management- BC with its strong security
    features can prevent many attacks that have been made on the traditional power
    grids to manipulate the data and to have control of the system [56]. Moreover,
    BC and smart contracts can enable secure, efficient and reliable management of
    IoT-enabled distribution network in smart grids [195]. • Secure Metering - Meters
    are installed in every house to maintain the record of electricity consumed. Intruders
    can record and analyze the electricity consumption pattern and can reveal users’
    details. BC with advanced cryptography methods can be used to ensure the privacy
    of the information [196], [197]. 3.6.2. Related work The research works related
    to the smart grid have been discussed under different categories which are discussed
    as follows: Grid Monitoring: Mengelkamp et al. [198] discussed smart grids and
    local energy markets and propose an approach based on BC, which underlines the
    decentralized nature of local energy markets with an auction mechanism at a small
    level. The proposed approach consists of a closed double-sided auction market,
    implemented using a smart contract. It uses private permissioned Ethereum BC,
    smart contracts written using solidity language, and a PoW consensus algorithm.
    In 2018, Gao et al. [196] proposed a BC-based solution for creating a system to
    protect consumer data that is recorded and transferred through the smart grids
    in a tamper-proof manner. Cryptographic keys are used for specific tasks such
    as system and data security. The proposed approach includes various layers; user
    layer, data processing and monitoring layer, registration and authentication layer,
    smart contract layer, smart contract database layer, energy center layer, and
    data center layer. SHA-256 is used for hashing the blocks. Along with that, compared
    the proposed solution with the existing solution in terms of information sharing,
    efficient data manageability, data immutability, data confidentiality, and data
    provenance. In line with that, in 2021, Naseer et al. [199] proposed a BC-enabled
    lightweight scheme for access control to ensure temper proof, trusted communication
    between entities of the smart grid and provide a secure channel to submit transactions
    in the network. In particular, uses the Ethereum BC platform, SHA-256 for key
    generation, elliptic curve cryptography for secure communication, and BC. Furthermore,
    the authors analyzed the scheme in terms of security and performance and the results
    show it is effective in terms of computational and storage costs. Device Identification
    & Management: Wang et al. [200] put forward an approach for the connection of
    IoT devices by using BC and 5G MEC technologies. Their approach uses public and
    private BC deployed using MEC server. Authors also discussed numerous consensus
    algorithms and their usefulness in hybrid BC. The authors analyzed the performance
    of different consensus algorithms in terms of average computing time and average
    time to agreement. Privacy Preserving: Guan et al. [189] proposed a BC-based privacy-preserving
    and efficient data aggregation scheme, in which users are divided into different
    groups. Each group consists of a private BC to record its members’ data. The proposed
    approach is specially designed to tackle challenges like privacy, pseudonym, and
    speed. Their scheme allows a user to create multiple pseudonyms to hide user identity
    and bloom filter for fast authentication, to judge the validity of pseudonyms
    and check the existence of pseudonyms based on zero-knowledge proof. Authors showed
    that their proposed scheme outperforms and meets security requirements as compared
    to other popular methods. In 2019, Gai et al. [188] presented a BC-based approach
    to solve the problem of privacy leakage in trading functions and user privacy
    in a smart grid, known as the privacy-preserving blockchain-driven trading model
    (PBT). For preserving privacy it uses a noise-based approach to hide the trading
    distribution. Moreover, their approach use consortium BC to establish a secure
    energy trading system and smart contracts for preventing privacy leakage. It includes
    mainly three phases; energy seller initialization, B-Box operation, and buyer
    purchase. Evaluated the performance in terms of privacy-preserving. In line with
    that, in 2021, Guan et al. [194] proposed another approach named privacy-preserving
    blockchain energy trading scheme (PP-BCETS) based on ciphertext policy attribute,
    exponentially improving operation efficiency. It enables direct transactions between
    electricity users and producers and helps in improving the privacy, security,
    and reliability of the energy trading process by implementing smart contracts.
    Along with that, proposed a credibility-based equity proof consensus algorithm
    to resolve low efficiency and high delay in BC. The design goals of PP-BCET are
    privacy protection, efficiency, and anti-attack. It includes mainly five phases;
    system initialization, user registration, transaction process, building consensus,
    application for arbitration, and generating accounting node. In particular, uses
    an elliptic curve digital signature algorithm for generating public and private
    keys, SHA-256, and the Ethereum BC platform. Finally, security analysis and performance
    evaluation are presented. In 2022, Mazumdar et al. [201] proposed a BC-driven
    approach to detect energy theft in smart grid neighborhood area networks along
    with preserving the privacy of energy consumption data. In particular, authors
    have used consortium BC hyperledger best with Proof of Authority consensus, AES256,
    ZK-STARK, RS256 digital signature, and SHA256. Furthermore, results show that
    the proposed approach achieves more than 98% accuracy in energy theft detection.
    [202] proposed a solution along with dynamic billing and arbitration, named PPDB
    to reduce latency and bandwidth-related issues and to improve efficiency. In particular,
    the author has designed a four-layer data aggregation framework that uses fog
    nodes (FNs) to collect and aggregate electricity consumption data using the ElGamal
    cryptosystem and employ distributed decryption to achieve fine-grained access
    and bill generation based on real-time prices. Along with a trusted third party
    to arbitrate disputed bills. Further, the comparison shows that the communication
    overhead is reduced by 38 percent, and the computational efficiency is improved
    by 40 times. Control Access: Bera et al. [203] proposed a BC-based access control
    protocol named DBACP-IoTSG, for IoT-driven smart grids without the involvement
    of a trusted third party, while preserving the anonymity and untraceable properties.
    In particular, uses Dolev-Yao (DY) threat model, private BC, PBFT consensus algorithm,
    random numbers, and current timestamp is used to protect against the replay attack.
    Phases involved are system setup (either SHA-256/512), registration of smart meters
    and service providers, access control, key management among service providers,
    block formation and addition in the blockchain, and new smart meters addition
    after initial deployment in the smart grid. Furthermore, the analysis shows that
    the proposed approach provides better security and requires less communication
    and computation cost. Charging Coordination: Baza et al. [204] proposed a BC-based
    charging coordination mechanism for energy storage units (ESUs). For defining
    the rules for coordination between different ESUs, smart contracts written in
    solidity language are used, and the Ethereum BC platform. For scheduling the charging
    of ESUs, a greedy algorithm is used. The approach includes three phases; acquiring
    anonymous credentials, charging request submission, and charging schedule computation.
    Finally author evaluated the proposed approach for charging coordination using
    first come first serve (FCFS) and analyzed it in terms of security and privacy.
    Cost Analysis: Sestrem et al. [205] proposed an architecture using BC and side
    chains for smart grids to make them more scalable and adaptable. It includes three
    BCs named BlockPRI, BlockSEC, and BlockTST for user privacy, to store user data,
    and to manage and validate information regarding the energy trade between consumers
    and prosumers respectively. A Loom network, based on the side chain, is used to
    develop these BC. Loom network uses the DPOS consensus algorithm. The proposed
    architecture includes three layers namely the user layer (registers users in the
    blockchain), the protocol layer (uses OSGP protocol to model data package), and
    the blockchain layer (ensures privacy security, and trust). Moreover, evaluation
    was done in terms of several transactions per second, and smart contract cost
    and results show it is feasible for use. Authentication: In 2021, Wang et al.
    [206] proposed a secure, reliable, and efficient mutual authentication protocol
    for smart meters. The proposed approach resolves identity authentication issues
    by combining BC, elliptic curve cryptography, dynamic join and exit mechanism,
    and batch verification. Furthermore, the authors have analyzed the performance
    in terms of security and functionality, and computation overhead and the results
    show the proposed approach is more secure and efficient. Table 11, summarizes
    the work done in the BC-smart grid use case. Table 11. Summary of related work

    of power from producer to consumer without the involvement of any centralized
    system. It allows monitoring of power flow from power generation to power consumption,
    advanced metering infrastructure, better consumer services, fraud detection, technical
    losses, and reduces electricity theft. These services are provided as IoT is a
    significant part of the smart grid. The existing grid system faces challenges
    like data getting stolen and a centralized system which leads to a single point
    of failure and alterations. BC technology helps in mitigating these issues and
    provides transparency and provenance, ensuring the reliability and accuracy of
    smart grid IoT devices. Along with that, it offers decentralized, immutable, trusted
    access control and a highly reliable system. Implementing BC to the smart grid
    has attracted widespread attention. Researchers have worked in different directions
    to explore the applications of BC in smart grids and make it a more efficient
    solution. Several authors worked on grid monitoring, device identification, privacy
    preservation, control access, charging coordination, and cost analysis. In their
    particular work, authors have used private Ethereum BC, smart contracts, PoW consensus
    algorithm, and SHA-256 for hashing. For control access, private BC with PBFT consensus
    algorithm while for cost analysis DPOS consensus algorithm is preferred. Apart
    from the work done, there are some areas, to be considered in the future. Transaction
    processing time and data storage can be improved, while computational overheads
    caused by authentication, during system initialization, can be reduced. Yet some
    challenges are being faced by BC such as high infrastructural and development
    costs, scalability, chances of centralization, and an enormous amount of data
    generated. 3.7. Industrial IoT Industrial IoT or industry 4.0, is a revolution
    in industries. Industrial IoT is a switch from traditional industries to smart
    industries [87]. IIoT is a combination of a wireless sensor network, communication
    protocol, and internet infrastructure for monitoring, analysis, and management
    [87]. IIoT can also be defined as the automation of the conventional manufacturing
    industry. IIoT is an integration of many technologies like the Internet, IIoT,
    blockchain, big data, edge, and cloud computing, robotics, human–machine interaction,
    artificial intelligence, and open-source software [87], [207]. IIoT architecture
    involves three layers, the physical layer, the communication layer, and the application
    layer. The physical layer consists of physical devices like sensors, the communication
    layer uses network technologies like a wireless sensor network, and the application
    layer contains different applications using IIoT [87]. Industry 4.0 will bring
    the revolution by making machines smarter, factories more efficient, processes
    less wasteful, and higher productivity [208]. IIoT is facing several challenges
    which need to be addressed. Some of the general challenges being faced by IIoT
    are interoperability issues, security vulnerability, lack of data analysis, improved
    resilience, fast adaptability, improved trust, and lower maintenance costs [207],
    [209]. As the devices are interconnected, they share information directly and
    are subject to security threats [207]. Because of the tamper-proof and distributed
    nature of BC technology, it can be proved as a game-changer in the IIoT domain.
    Some of the practical implementations are, for example in the agriculture industry,
    iGrow, which associates landowners, farmers, investors, and harvest purchasers
    to make a supply chain for organic food, and Avenues-GT, which supports the commercial
    trade of agriculture products from farmers securely and transparently [87]. 3.7.1.
    Applications of blockchain in IIoT • MIoT - BC can be proved as a revolution in
    the healthcare industry, in particular for Medical IoT (MIoT). It can be used
    to manage security, privacy, trusted ownership, authenticity, interoperability,
    and autonomous cooperation between MIoT devices [74], [210]. • Automatic and Secure
    Micro Payment - As we are moving towards digitization and IoTized systems where
    automatic and micro payments are the need of time. BC provides a solution to secure,
    privacy protected, trustless, and automatic micro payments for IoT devices [210]
    such as smart meters [37]. • Supply Chain Logistics - BC can help in maintaining
    the authenticity and tracing the products to ensure quality of the products from
    raw material to final finished goods and efficient supply of the product [211].
    • Power Industry - Integrating BC and the power industry has many applications
    such as the trade of energy, power demand, and power generation schemes that can
    be stored on the BC network. BC reduces that extra transition cost and makes the
    transition of power in a more efficient way [87]. 3.7.2. Related work The research
    works related to IIoT have been discussed under different categories which are
    discussed as follows: Data Collection and Sharing: Manogaran et al. [212] introduce
    a BC-based secured data sharing model named BSDS for inbound and outbound security
    in data acquisition and dissemination, as BC controls data gathering and dissemination.
    Its design goal is to maximize the response rate of the industrial process by
    reducing false alarm progression (FAP) in IIoT. Analysis shows that the proposed
    model gains a 5.67% high response rate, and reduces the failure rate by 2.14%.
    Network Computing Service: Xu et al. [213] proposed a BC-based non-repudiation
    service provisioning scheme for IIoT applications where BC is used to record evidence
    and a service publication proxy and each service is delivered separately using
    on-chain and off-chain. Moreover, designed a service verification method based
    on homomorphic hash techniques to validate services based on lightweight on-chain
    evidence. Uses smart contracts to efficiently settle disputes between service
    providers and IIoT clients, homomorphic and homomorphism hash function, consortium
    BC with PoA consensus mechanism. The proposed architecture includes three entities;
    the service provider, the IIoT client, and the arbitration node. Also analyzed
    was the security and efficiency of the proposed scheme. Product Life cycle Management:
    Liu et al. [214] proposed a BC-enabled data collection and secure sharing scheme.
    Uses the private BC Ethereum platform to ensure the security and reliability of
    data shared and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to achieve the maximum amount
    of collected data. The proposed scheme is simulated using the python language
    and Ethereum platform with the PBFT consensus algorithm. Authors have analyzed
    the proposed scheme and the results show that it provides better security against
    attacks such as eclipse attacks, majority attacks, and terminal device failure.
    In line with that, Liu et al. [215] proposed a BC-enabled framework for data exchange
    and service sharing among the products, factories, business networks, and customers
    in the product life cycle. First, it proposed the idea of integrating BC with
    IoT, M2M, and consensus algorithm, and secondly developed a BC information service
    to maintain the connection between a single node with the BC network. Smart contracts
    written using GO language are used to automate the alert service in the product
    life cycle and SHA-256 for encryption with Hyperledger fabric Java SDK with redundant
    Byzantine Fault Tolerance consensus algorithm. The proposed framework includes
    mainly five layers; the perception layer (used to collect data using IoT devices
    like QR codes, RFID tags, and GPS sensors), the off-chain layer (collected data
    will be processed in BC information service), the BC layer (which contains smart
    contracts, consensus protocol, DApps, and cryptography), application layer (includes
    services and software) and service layer (services like product creation, tracking
    and tracing, product maintenance, and recycling). Finally, the analysis was presented
    in terms of latency and throughput and the results show that the proposed framework
    is scalable, efficient, and feasible for industries. Secure and Trustworthy Operations:
    Huang et al. [216] presented a BC-based system with a credit-based consensus mechanism
    for IoT devices to decrease the power usage in the consensus mechanism, and to
    ensure system security and efficiency. A data authority management method was
    designed to protect sensitive data and regulate access to sensor data. In particular,
    uses directed acyclic graph (DAG) structured BC, implemented the system using
    Raspberry Pi, symmetric key encryption, SHA-256 to distribute secret keys, AES
    block cipher algorithm, and a case study of the smart factory was presented. The
    proposed system is resilient against various attacks such as DDoS, Sybil attacks,
    and double-spending attacks. In 2019, Rathee et al. [217] proposed a secure hybrid
    IIoT framework using BC technology for tracing workers’ location, product shipment,
    and product documentation and maintaining transparency among users located at
    different locations. Recording of information is done using BC technology. Finally,
    the performance is analyzed using the NS2 simulator and the results show the proposed
    approach offers 89% success over user request time, falsification attack, black
    hole attack, and probabilistic authentication scenario. In 2021, Rathee et al.
    [218] proposed a BC-enabled secured wireless mechanism to preserve transparency
    and secure each activity of smart sensors. The proposed approach uses distributed
    cloud framework using BC, and RFID. Mainly it includes registration of sensors
    on BC and consensus among users and industry providers for the product shipment.
    Finally, the approach is simulated using the NS2 simulator in terms of probability
    of attack success, ease of attack detection, falsification attack, and authentication
    delay. In the line above work, in 2021, Latif et al. [219] proposed a private
    and lightweight BC-based architecture for secured and trustworthy industrial operations
    and implemented it for a food processing plant use case. It uses a low-power ARM
    Cortex M4 processor, energy-efficient consensus mechanism proof of authority (PoAh).
    The proposed architecture is used to perform industrial operations such as user
    and device registration, sensor and actuator data storage, and client service
    task. It has three layers; the physical layer (sensors, actuators, and microcomputers),
    the BC service layer (ARM Cortex-based lightweight nodes, private BC), and the
    application layer (which provides services like administration, user management,
    and task management). It uses sensors, actuators, private BC, ARM Cortex lightweight
    nodes, elliptic curve digital signature algorithm to generate public and private
    keys, and proof of authentication consensus algorithm. Moreover, the performance
    analysis in terms of execution time, power consumption, and memory utilization
    has shown the effectiveness of the proposed architecture. Identity Management:
    Sarier et al. [220] proposed a BC-based identity management system. Combining
    it with off-chain storage ensures GDPR compliance, required to protect user data.
    Moreover, it includes a blinded DLRep scheme to provide multi-show unlinkability.
    For bigger organizations, it replaces the Merkle tree with an accumulator to improve
    scalability. Major participating entities are credential generators, credential
    issuers and verifiers, and service enablers. User privacy is achieved by implementing
    an efficient authentication scheme. BC-IIoT: Teslya et al. [221] presented the
    possible ways to integrate BC technology with IoT. The architecture was developed
    by combining the smart M3 platform and BC along with smart contracts to process
    and store information related to the interaction between smart components. A core
    component is a semantic information broker (SIB) to store information and service
    requests of participants. In particular, uses a tiger tree hashing algorithm to
    calculate transaction hashes. In 2020, Kumar et al. [209] proposed a framework
    named as BlockEdge by integrating edge computing and BC, to resolve the challenges
    such as data integrity, trust, and security. Edge computing helps in achieving
    low latency and lightweight private permissioned BC ensuring secure and trusted
    data sharing, accessing, tracking, tracing, and monitoring. The proposed framework
    includes mainly three parts; IoT-Edge networks, Fog networks, and cloud networks
    Along with this authors have analyzed the performance using the simulator iFogSim
    in terms of latency, power consumption, and network usage. Table 12 summarizes
    the work done in the BC-IIoT use case. Table 12. Summary of related work in BC-IIoT.

    of IoT in different industry domains which helps in achieving automation and an
    efficient industry approach. It offers the ability to interconnect numerous devices,
    process various data, and reduce human intervention, Still, IIoT is facing various
    issues, like privacy-related concerns while collecting and sharing data, high
    costs, high rate of failures, massive data management, and untrusted third parties.
    Here, BC can be used to mitigate these challenges because of the features offered
    by BC such as ease of record-keeping, avoiding fraudulent cases, improved transparency,
    and a decentralized approach. Researchers are exploring different areas for the
    adoption of BC-IIoT on a large scale. Numerous research works have been done in
    various application areas like data collection and sharing, product life cycle
    management, network computing services, secure and trustworthy operations, identity
    management, and BC-IIoT. For secure and trustworthy operations authors have used
    DAG, Raspberry Pi, SHA-256, RFID, PoAh consensus algorithm, and elliptic curve
    digital signature algorithm. Whereas for identity management off-chain storage
    is preferred to ensure GDPR compliance. Ethereum BC platform with PBFT consensus
    algorithm, smart contracts are written using GO language, SHA-256 with hyperledger
    with PBFT is used for product life cycle management. While the PoA consensus algorithm
    with smart contracts was preferred for network computing services. Still, some
    areas need to be focused on in the future such as the time required to validate
    a block can be improved, real network computing enabled IIoT platform to add more
    features, a non-repudiation dispute resolution mechanism for a massive amount
    of data generated, integration of various technologies such as edge computing,
    3D printing, SDN, NFV to address different requirements like adaptive security,
    privacy, and trust mechanism. Integrating BC-IIoT offers various opportunities
    but along with that, some challenges are being faced such as scalability, high
    infrastructural costs, throughput, and a large number of simultaneous users. 3.8.
    Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) UAVs, also known as drones, are self-programmed
    devices that do not require any human pilot but are managed through mobile applications
    [222]. These are equipped with sensors and processors. It was first introduced
    in 1920 for military operations and later on also deployed for civil applications
    such as traffic management, photography, and shooting, product delivery [223]
    and it is simply an aerial device without pilot [224]. UAVs are designed in different
    sizes, large size UAVs are more suitable for defense applications while small-size
    UAVs are best for civilian applications [224]. Based on altitude, UAVs are categorized
    as high altitude (used in wide geographical areas with extended battery) and low
    altitude UAVs (used in normal day-to-day tasks with fast deployment, cost-effective
    and limited battery) [223]. According to the report of SIPRI (Stockholm International
    Peace Research Institute), India is one of the top countries for importing drones
    which is 22.5% of the world‘s UAVs [224]. According to the report by the Federation
    of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), the adoption rate of UAVs
    in India and globally is expected to be 885.7 million USD and 21.47 billion USD
    respectively [223]. Some of the applications of UAVs are product delivery, Military
    surveillance, aerial photography, traffic control, and management and cinematography
    [225]. Some of the general challenges faced by UAVs are security and privacy,
    and latency. Some of the application areas of UAVs are defense, agriculture, transportation,
    delivering goods, and surveying. Integrating BC with UAV has great potential.
    For example, military information is highly sensitive and confidential thus it
    must be safe and secured and BC can be a good choice for this [224]. Some of the
    practical implementations of UAVs are companies like Matternet and Flirtey, which
    uses UAVs for the delivery of medicines in rural areas [224]. 3.8.1. Applications
    of blockchain in UAV • Data Storage and Verification using UAV - The data collected
    with the help of UAVs can be directly transmitted to a cyber–physical system connected
    through BC. Each block will contain details that are scanned through the UAVs
    and the time of the creation of the block. With the integration of BC with UAV,
    information can be stored and monitored efficiently [226]. • BC-based UAV Surveillance
    - Video surveillance is very important whether it is at the border, at traffic
    lights, DAM‘s or in our homes. All these tasks can be performed by using UAVs.
    But because of the dynamic nature of the UAVs, they also face some challenges
    like trust and data authentication, finding the optimal path, security, reliability,
    unauthorized access to the UAVs ID, and DoS attack. BC can mitigate these challenges,
    BC ensures the security of information by sharing and verifying the data in a
    distributed manner. • Blockchain-based UAV system for automation of supply chain
    - Supply chain and logistics require manpower from the production of any product
    to its distribution and sales. Automating all of these tasks leads to reduced
    manpower, on-time deliveries, and increased profits. UAVs can help in surveying
    the stocks, collecting data, and dispatching products. But at the same time automating
    these tasks will also lead to security threats. BC technology can be used to maintain
    trust and security and store data. The supply chain requires the collection of
    data which is generally performed by humans and is prone to errors. This is where
    UAVs can be used to collect the data. 3.8.2. Related work The research works related
    to UAVs have been discussed under different categories which are discussed as
    follows: Communication: Kumari et al. [223] presented a survey on BC-based softwarization
    for UAV networks. It provides a brief introduction about BC and UAV and highlights
    the challenges faced by the conventional UAVs approach such as security is a major
    concern. To resolve the challenges, the authors have proposed a BC-based UAV softwarization
    architecture for secure UAV networks to provide dynamic, flexible, and on-the-fly
    decision capabilities. The proposed approach includes four layers; the infrastructure
    layer, the BC middleware layer, the control layer, and the application layer.
    It uses public BC Ethereum client to store UAV communications and SDN controller
    information as a transaction with IPFS to store data. Moreover, they discussed
    the challenges in integrating BC-UAV such as interoperability, data processing
    latency, data security, real-time deployment, and BC standardization. Privacy
    & Security: Rana et al. [227] and Abualsauod et al. [228] both worked to choose
    the same direction, i.e., security and privacy in UAV. In 2019, Rana et al. [227]
    proposed an approach to improve the security of UAVs using BC. Integrating BC
    with UAV helps in achieving additional security in transmitting signals as BC
    uses private key cryptography and peer-to-peer network. In particular, it uses
    BC, image gathering and sensing of UAV, SHA-256, timestamp (to keep a log of a
    transaction between the server and drone with its GPS location), and GPS location
    (will be added by UAV in the block). In line with that, in 2022, Abualsauod et
    al. [228] proposed a solution to resolve security and privacy-related issues in
    UAV-assisted IoT applications using BC. In particular, the authors choose to use
    Ethereum BC, SHA, and elliptic curve cryptography with numerous machine learning
    algorithms like K Nearest Neighbour and Naive Bayes. Furthermore, the authors
    analyzed the proposed solution in terms of system utility, latency, and processing
    time with overall attack detection accuracy. Results show that with the implementation
    of BC, latency and processing time are increased which increases the overall time
    consumption and reduction in attack rates. Data Collection: Islam et al. [229]
    and Xu et al. [230] worked in the same direction i.e., data collection using BC
    through UAVs. Islam et al. [229] proposed a BC-enabled secure scheme for data
    acquisition through UAVs and IoT devices. It includes two-way validation using
    the pie hash bloom filter and digital signature algorithm. Using the consortium
    BC Ethereum platform, Geth was used as an Ethereum client and proof of authority
    (PoA) consensus algorithm. Furthermore, it presented a performance analysis in
    terms of connectivity, energy consumption, and security analysis against various
    threats such as man in the middle, key spoof resistance, data tampering resistance,
    and resistance against intrusion and reply attacks. A simulation was performed
    using MATLAB and python. In 2020, Xu et al. [230] proposed a BC-based UAV-assisted
    IoT, a data collection secured and energy efficient scheme. An adaptive linear
    prediction algorithm was designed to reduce energy consumption and based on this
    algorithm, a data transmission scheme for BC-based UAV-assisted IoT is also proposed.
    BC-enabled UAVs consist of three main entities; IoT devices, the UAV swarm, and
    the charging station and management swarm. Uses BC in the UAV swarm (to record
    forwarding), private chain, edge computing, and asymmetric encryption for acquiring
    data security. The proposed approach has three special attributes which make it
    suitable for UAV-assisted IoT namely; every forwarding is defined as a transaction
    and each transaction is initiated by the management server, difficulty of mining,
    and charging strategy. Moreover, performance was evaluated using MATLAB in terms
    of security, accuracy, energy efficiency, training overhead, and training delay.
    Simulation results show proposed scheme offers better security and is energy-efficient.
    Health Monitoring: In 2019, Islam et al. [231] proposed a BC-based scheme for
    secure monitoring using UAVs outside the homes in smart cities. The main components
    involved are the user (citizens), UAV (provides extended connectivity and low
    power transmission), and MEC (works as a validator in BC). It accumulates health
    data using wearable sensors and transmits it to the nearest MEC server using UAV.
    It uses the private Ethereum BC platform. Furthermore, performance was evaluated
    in terms of processing time, expected transmission of data, validation time, and
    energy consumption using MATLAB and Python. In line with that, in 2020, Islam
    et al. [232] proposed a BC-based secure healthcare scheme called BHEALTH in which
    health data is collected using UAVs. It uses consortium BC Ethereum BC platform
    with proof of authority (PoA) consensus algorithm, and time division multiple
    access (TDMA) protocols for communication. Core entities involved in the proposed
    scheme are the body sensor hive (BSH) and server. BHEALTH does not have any reward
    for validators. Moreover, the author presented a security and performance analysis
    in terms of throughput, energy consumption, and processing time. BHEALTH is resilient
    against numerous threats such as man in the middle, unauthorized access, illegal
    data tampering, and reply attack. In 2021, Raj et al. [233] proposed an approach
    based on BC, for health monitoring using UAVs. In particular, healthcare data
    is collected using sensors and delivered using UAV to servers, and then saved
    using BC. The authors have highlighted the threats that are faced by UAVs during
    transmissions such as reply attacks, unauthorized access, and man-in-the-middle-attack.
    Furthermore, they have used the threat model to analyze security aspects, performance
    is analyzed in terms of energy consumption, individual processing time, and data
    transmission. Authors Aggarwal et al. [234] proposed an effective and efficient,
    three-layered architecture for the collection, processing, and transmission of
    medical data using UAVs, ensuring security and privacy during the transfer of
    medical data. Three layers are patient-generated data and clinical data, BC network
    of UAV, and data analytics and visualization. In particular, authors have used
    Ethereum BC with the PoW consensus algorithm. For analysis, they have focused
    on three major attacks; confidentiality attack, integrity attack, and availability
    attack. Spectrum Trading: Qiu et al. [235] proposed a BC-based privacy-preserving
    scheme for trading and sharing of the spectrum to resolve issues related to privacy
    and security. It uses consortium BC technology, edge computing, and a proof of
    work consensus algorithm. Major entities involved are trusted authorities, spectrum
    providers and requestors, edge computing nodes, and smart counters. Also for efficient
    pricing of spectrum, a non-uniform pricing algorithm and a distributed uniform
    pricing bargaining algorithm are designed. Analysis shows that the proposed scheme
    offers better security and privacy. UAV Visualization: Pathak et al. [236] proposed
    BC-enabled UAV virtualization for IIoT called AerialBlocks to provide secure and
    persistent UAV services to the end-users with the help of BC to ensure security,
    privacy, service quality, and transparency. It includes three actors; the UAV
    owner (takes care of the maintenance of the UAV), end-users (registers to the
    platform to access UAV service), and the virtual UAV service provider (the link
    between the UAV owner and end-users). The proposed architecture includes three
    layers; the application layer (web-based applications for end-users), the virtualization
    layer (the connecting layer between the physical and application layer), and the
    physical layer (Physical UAVs available on the ground for various UAV missions).
    It uses permissioned BC (to ensure that only registered end users and UAV owners
    can access), smart contracts (used to store transactions and business regulation),
    and a combination of proof of authentication and practical byzantine fault tolerance
    consensus algorithm to ensure lightweight validation for fault tolerance. Authentication:
    Tan et al. [237] proposed a BC-enabled authentication approach for industrial
    UAVs. In particular, they use hyperledger fabric and smart contracts with the
    Kafka consensus algorithm. During designing the particular approach, the authors
    considered some goals; confidentiality, mutual authentication, conditional anonymity,
    perfect forward secrecy, backward secrecy, resistance to cyber-attack, and lightweight.
    Moreover, a security analysis was performed based on two problems i.e., elliptic
    curve discrete logarithmic and computational Diffie Hellman problem, to ensure
    the security provided by the proposed approach. Table 13 summarizes the work done
    in a BC-UAV use case. 3.8.3. Summary UAVs are flying drones equipped with sensors,
    deployed for traffic applications, photography, and surveillance. To achieve such
    services IoT is an important requirement. Security and privacy issues because
    of an untrusted broadcast, and a single point of failure due to a centralized
    system are some of the challenges being faced by the existing approach. Combining
    BC with UAV brings numerous opportunities such as more secure, autonomous, flexible,
    improved service quality, and user experience. Various research works have been
    carried out to explore the applications of BC with UAVs. In particular, the authors
    explored the applications of BC using UAVs for communication, data collection,
    health monitoring, spectrum trading, UAV visualization, and improved privacy and
    security. Authors preferred consortium BC, Ethereum BC, IPFS, and SHA-256 with
    PoA consensus algorithm. For spectrum trading authors used BC with edge technology,
    PoW consensus algorithm, and smart contracts as authors preferred Proof of authentication
    with the PBFT consensus algorithm. Some of the future aspects that need to be
    considered for widespread adoption of BC-enabled UAVs are integrating AI and ML-based
    algorithms, and satellite-based networks for UAV visualization, implementing UAVs
    for different use cases like UAV-driven healthcare use cases, consumer-friendly
    drones where mobile phones can act as servers. Along with the benefits offered
    by integrating BC-UAV, there are some challenges such as interoperability, data

    The integration of BC-IoT has been broadly used in different fields because of
    its key attributes like decentralization, data immutability, and trustworthiness.
    This segment presents the most difficult issues identified with the execution
    of BC for IoT, specifically, Security, Privacy, Scalability, Access Control, Processing
    Power, Data Storage (On Chain versus Off-Chain), and Consensus algorithms. Besides,
    the effect of these issues and the work done on these aspects are talked about
    in this part. Table 14 summarizes the blockchain related challenges for different
    applications and use cases. Table 15. Summary of technical aspect — scalability.
    Reference Technical aspect Proposed solution Atlam et al. [3] All the transactions
    are stored in a ledger that is shared among all the nodes and the size of the
    blockchain increases continuously, which has a direct effect on the speed. No
    solution is proposed. Gao et al. [238] & Zheng et al. [29] Discussed the continuous
    increase in the size of the BC which results in increased cost of storage, BC
    becomes bulky and also leads to a reduction in distribution speed in the network.
    Both have discussed two solutions to resolve this issue: storage optimization
    of data and redesigning blockchain. Reyna et al. [24] Talked about the size of
    the BC, as the size grows nodes required more resources, which also has an effect
    on performance, synchronization time increases. Suggested off-chain storage and
    inter-planetary file system. Mahmoud et al. [40] & Xie et al. [84] Discussed the
    ever-growing and continuously increasing size of the BC. Highlighted the solutions
    like BC pruning and Lightning network and storing data off-chain using DHT (Distributed
    Hash Table) respectively. Monrat et al. [63] As BC is distributed in nature, copies
    of the ledger are stored at each node which has a direct effect on throughput
    and latency. In the PoW algorithm resources are wasted in solving the puzzle which
    also results in low throughput and high latency. Also, the PoW algorithm is CPU
    intensive leading to high electricity consumption. Suggested using DCS (Decentralized,
    Consistent, and Scalable) theorem. Rupasena et al. [152] Discussed FSC, transaction
    data generated is extremely large, leading to the blockchain ledger growing continuously.
    Also discussed that data about the product in FSC is not required after a certain
    period but as BC is an immutable ledger. In contrast to this fact, suggested an
    off-chain storage scheme and a technique to reduce the growth of off-chain storage.
    4.1. Scalability Scalability is defined as the ability of a system to handle the
    increase or decrease in terms of size, volume, performance, and cost [239]. When
    the number of active users increases in blockchain, a scalability issue arises
    that affects blockchain performance [240]. For instance, in the bitcoin blockchain,
    the number of transactions that arrives can vary, maybe 10 or maybe 100 but irrespective
    of the number of arriving transactions, the blockchain process only some fixed
    number of transactions relying upon the size of the block (such as the size of
    bitcoin block is 1 MB and can process only seven transactions per seconds) [29].
    The number of transactions processed per second in blockchain relies upon a wide
    range of factors like network latency, consensus protocol, and CPU processing
    power. This restricted block size cannot process a large number of transactions
    at once which causes delays in transactions [63]. The system must be scalable
    so that it must be able to handle the sudden increase and decrease in the transaction
    load. Because of the decentralized structure of blockchain, each node must process
    each transaction which leads to low capacity and low speed of transaction processing
    [241]. The Sharding process partition the network into numerous small subsets
    known as shards to avoid the duplication of resources such as communication, data
    storage, and computation overhead and improves the blockchain‘s performance [242].
    Each shard includes a different set of transactions instead of the whole network
    processing the same transaction. This helps in improving the throughput of the
    network [243]. As IoT is a collection of connected devices and IoT is becoming
    the Internet of Everything (IoE), that means a lot of connected devices are involved
    or each and everything is connected, which means a lot of transactions occur and
    enormous data will be generated [3], [24]. Therefore, it is important to maintain
    the scalability in BC-IoT. Table 15 encapsulates the technical aspect of the scalability
    of BC. 4.1.1. Challenges related to the scalability: In this segment, we are reviewing
    and discussing the scalability challenges faced by blockchain for IoT. • Throughput:
    In general, throughput is defined as the rate at which something is processed.
    In the context of blockchain for IoT, throughput implies the number of transactions
    processed per second. If we take bitcoin as an example then in bitcoin only seven
    transactions per second can be processed while existing payment systems like VISA
    can process 4000 transactions per second [29], [240]. Here, processing seven transactions
    per second means, irrespective of the input transactions coming at any rate, that
    the system is not scaling up with the inputs and giving a flat response, which
    naturally relies upon the underlying available hardware, the number of peers connected,
    and its available computational power [63]. • Storage: Whenever a new transaction
    comes, all the new transactions get accumulated in the pool of unconfirmed transactions,
    and miners pick a transaction to validate and verify the transaction. As the size
    of the block is limited, so the number of transactions that can be stored in the
    block is also restricted. Miners pick the transactions with a higher processing
    rate and transactions with less processing rate get delayed [29]. For example,
    in the food supply chain, a large number of IoT-enabled devices are used which
    leads to a huge amount of transaction data (may be audio, video, images) to be
    stored on the blockchain which leads to large storage and higher costs and directly
    affects the scalability [152]. 4.2. Security and privacy In general, Security
    is defined as the protection of the system against malicious attacks, unauthorized
    access, modifications, and deletion. In the context of the blockchain, security
    means the protection of transaction information and data in a block, detection
    of threat, and prevention of threat [244]. As blockchain is distributed and decentralized
    in nature it allows nodes to join the network and can view all the details of
    the transactions occurring in the network. It is crucial to maintain the integrity
    of the transactions, and availability of data, and to prevent double-spending,
    the system must be secured [245]. According to a report titled “State of IoT security”,
    cyber-attacks on IoT have increased by 22% [246]. As BC-IoT implies a huge number
    of connected devices in a distributed and decentralized manner, without security,
    these connected devices can be hacked, and once the hacker gains control, they
    can tamper with the data. So all the connected devices must be secured [24]. Privacy
    means protecting stored, transmitted, and processed private information such as
    data, identity, and location [247]. Especially in permissionless blockchain anyone
    can join the network and sometimes the nodes present in the network are the malicious
    ones whose aim is to collect the information from the network [247]. In the context
    of the blockchain, maintaining privacy means performing a transaction without
    leaking the user’s identification information [244]. The privacy and security
    of data can essentially be achieved by fulfilling five basic criteria such as
    confidentiality, availability, integrity, authentication, access control, and
    privacy requirements [247]. As blockchain is distributed and decentralized in
    nature, transaction privacy is not guaranteed. The issue with blockchain is that
    users cannot stay anonymous [84]. Especially, this is a challenge in public blockchain
    as anyone can join the network and all the previous and current transactions are
    visible [29]. If somehow all these transactions can be linked then the identity
    of the person who is behind the transactions gets revealed. So it is important
    to achieve privacy in blockchain [245]. IoT-driven devices collect a lot of data
    and personal information from the surrounding environment and they communicate
    with each other. When such data is managed by some central authority then the
    user’s privacy is at risk. Here blockchain technology can help maintain IoT privacy
    [248]. As BC supports distributed and decentralized features but with this also
    some challenges arise. Table 16 encapsulates the technical aspects of the security
    of BC. 4.2.1. Challenges related to the security & privacy: This section highlights
    the challenges related to the privacy and security of the BC for IoT. • Transaction
    Privacy Leakage: Blockchain uses asymmetric key cryptography as it uses public
    key and private key pairs for transactions. The real identity of the user does
    not get revealed as a blockchain-generated address was provided to the user and
    all the transactions occur between these addresses to hide the original identity
    of the user. But still, the privacy of the transactions is not guaranteed since
    all the transactions that occur in the network are visible to all the nodes present
    in the network and still, some detectable hints can divulge the identity of the
    users. These transactions can be linked or the transaction history can be linked
    to disclose the user’s identity [29], [249]. Various researchers propose methods
    against privacy to link pseudonyms with IP addresses [63]. • Security of Private
    Key: BC uses asymmetric key cryptography, which means it uses public and private
    key pairs. If the private key of the user is compromised then all the transactions
    will be leaked. Maintaining the security of the private key is of utmost importance
    [40], [249]. • Non-Compliance to Privacy Laws: As blockchain is a distributed
    ledger, participating nodes are from across the world, which raises privacy issues.
    A key point is that the miners are spread across different countries and thus
    it is not clear which privacy law(s) will be applied [250]. For instance, this
    may be decided based on the location of the miner who mined the new block or the
    location where the transaction occurs [250]. • Selfish Mining: Selfish mining
    was first reported by Eyal and Sirer [251]. When any malicious node mines the
    block but does not reveal that block and starts maintaining his/her private blockchain
    and still the other blocks are busy mining that block and the malicious node starts
    mining the next block without any competition and when this malicious node’s chain
    becomes longer than the original chain then he reveals that chain. At this point,
    honest miners think that as the selfish miner’s chain is longer, has a large number
    of blocks mined, done more proof of work, this is the original chain and starts
    mining and adding the block to the selfish miners’ chain. Before the private branch
    is revealed the honest miners are wasting their resources [252] on a useless branch
    [29], [238]. • 51% Attack: It is one of the most well-known security attacks and
    is also known as a majority attack. In this attack, if the hashing power of an
    individual miner or a pool of miners becomes more than 50% of the complete blockchain
    then the attacker or the malicious node can roll back the transaction, cause a
    double-spending problem, and modify the order of transaction [63], [238], [249].

    consumption. Dwivedi et al. [258] Talked about IoT and remote patient monitoring
    and also the concerns related to privacy and security such as the transfer of

    to the IoT such as resource constraints, centralization, and lack of privacy,

    blockchain can be useful to resolve this challenge. Proposed a decentralized,
    pseudonymous, and privacy-preserving framework based on blockchain to manage access
    control. Qian et al. [261] Presented the opportunities IoT provides and also the
    challenges it carries like privacy and security issues. Highlighted the three
    layers of IoT and the security issues at each layer. Proposed a decentralized

    et al. [262] Highlighted the issues related to conventional IoT information-sharing
    approaches such as positioning security problems. Proposed blockchain-enabled
    information sharing IoT security framework by using a double chain model and improved
    practical byzantine fault-tolerant consensus algorithm. 4.3. IoT data storage
    Data storage refers to storing or recording data or information using some storage
    medium so that when required it allows easy retrieval of stored data. In IoT,
    the collection of devices leads to the generation of a huge amount of data that
    needs to be efficiently stored for easy access and fast processing. Since IoT
    devices are characterized by less computational and storage resources thus the
    generated data is to be stored at some other location. In conventional methods,
    data is stored in a centralized infrastructure that suffers from security, privacy,
    and single-point-of-failure. Using blockchain, IoT data can be stored in a distributed
    manner (i.e, replicated at all the nodes in the blockchain network). However,
    it is a major concern how blockchains can cater to such data storage demands from
    IoT systems. On the one hand, the distributed ledger helps in improving the security
    and availability of the stored data and makes a blockchain-based IoT system decentralized.
    On the other hand, the distributed nature of the database results in a storage
    challenge because with time IoT devices will exponentially increase in number
    and blockchain does not allow delete operations since is designed to be an append-only
    database. Table 17 encapsulates the data storage aspect of BC. 4.3.1. Challenges
    related to the IoT data storage This section aims to bring the focus of the readers
    towards the challenges related to data storage. The continuous increase in the
    size of the blockchain will increase the difficulty for the full nodes to continue
    their participation in blockchain-based IoT systems. As a result, there will be
    less number of full nodes driving the blockchain at a given point in time making
    the system less decentralized. Variable block sizes are not the optimum solution
    to solve this issue. If we try to store a large number of transactions in a single
    block this will put an additional strain on full nodes. The speed to process a
    transaction depends on block size and block interval. Increasing the block size
    will improve the throughput but take more time to propagate the block to other
    nodes and reducing the block interval reduces latency but leads to instability
    [263]. Table 17. Summary of technical aspect — data storage. Reference Technical
    aspect Proposed solution Wang et al. [34] Discussed the potential blockchain design
    in IoT applications and also discussed possible solutions to reduce storage costs.
    Discussed the off-chain storage in which data can be stored separately at another
    place and for indexing using a pointer. Hepp et al. [264] Discussed the storing
    data in the chain itself, i.e., on-chain, which leads to the question of how much
    data we can store in the main chain, Also discussed off-chain storage and the
    challenges in maintaining the link between the hash stored in the main chain and
    the physical storage location. For on-chain storage, the size of the block can
    be variable to store data while for off-chain storage, suggested solutions like
    smart contracts and Distributed hash tables to maintain the link between hash
    in the chain and physical storage. Eyal et al. [263] Discussed the alternatives
    to improve the latency and bandwidth of the blockchain. To improve the performance
    of the blockchain, the author talked about federated chains, also known as side
    chains. Back et al. [265] Discussed the performance issues of blockchain and their
    solutions. Discussed the Pegged chain and its features. Lu et al. [266] Present
    the comparison between on-chain and off-chain regarding what data should be stored
    on-chain and off-chain. Suggested not to store private data on-chain and raw data
    can be stored off-chain while its hash is stored on-chain. 4.4. Consensus algorithm
    Blockchain is distributed and decentralized in nature, which means the nodes are
    geographically spread. Whenever a new transaction arrives it must be validated
    by every node present in the network and only after validation, each node updates
    its copy of the ledger. This validation is performed by creating a general agreement
    between the nodes by using some algorithms known as consensus algorithms. As Blockchain
    is a distributed and decentralized approach, there is no centralized authority
    to validate and verify the transaction but with the help of the consensus algorithm,
    they ensure that each block added to the network is valid and verified, and agreed
    upon by all the nodes otherwise the challenges like double-spending attack can
    occur. Consensus algorithms help in maintaining the integrity of the system and
    work against double-spending attacks [24]. Consensus Algorithms help in maintaining
    the sanctity of the data recorded on the blockchain [244]. As IoT involves a lot
    of connected devices, a large number of transactions occur. To involve each node
    and each node having equal rights, consensus algorithms are useful. Consensus
    algorithms help in creating consensus among the un-trusted parties involved in
    the public blockchain. Table 18 encapsulates the technical aspect consensus algorithm
    of BC. 4.4.1. Challenges related to the consensus algorithm Some of the challenges
    related to the consensus algorithm are presented in this section. The most commonly
    used consensus algorithm is PoW but it also has some limitations such as waste
    of resources meaning the nodes with high hashing power get more chance to mine
    the block and for this purpose, nodes spend a lot of money on upgrading hardware.
    These machines consume a lot of energy in solving puzzles [267]. But if the hashing
    power of the mining pool is more than 50% then it will be a concern for the network
    as they have control of the network and they can reverse the transactions [267].
    Other than this, PoW is also not suitable for real-time payments because of the
    creation speed of a block [60]. Also, pool mining is possible in PoS (proof-of-stake)
    and difficult to prevent [60]. Table 18. Summary of technical aspect — consensus
    algorithm. Reference Technical aspect Proposed solution Fernandez et al. [64]
    Discussed the power consumed by the PoW consensus algorithm. PoW has a certain
    level of difficulty but at the same time also consumes a lot of energy. Highlighted
    the solutions like PoS (Proof of Space) also known as Proof of Capacity (PoC).
    Some other consensus mechanisms which consumes less energy are PoS. Reyna et al.
    [24] Highlighted the disadvantages of the PoW consensus algorithm like high latency,
    low transaction rate, and high energy consumption. Suggested using another alternative
    algorithm like PoS, DPoS, LPoS, PoB, Also suggested using private BC where the
    number of participants is limited. Mahmoud et al. [40] Discussed the PoW algorithm
    in which miners solve difficult puzzles which consume a lot of electricity. Suggested
    using the Proof of Stake (PoS) algorithm, one who has more stake value will get
    the chance to append the block. Alsunaidi et al. [268] Discussed the technical
    aspects such as node identity management, power consumption, throughput, and block
    creation speed. No solution is proposed. Mingxiao et al. [267] Discussed that
    the nodes that have high hashing power (computation power) will get the right
    to mine the block and get the reward for mining the block, which forces people
    to upgrade their hardware and these systems consume a lot of energy. No solution
    is proposed. 4.5. Processing power Whenever a new technology comes into the market,
    one of the things that need to be considered before its adoption is that it must
    be energy efficient. In the case of BC technology, the mining process requires
    very high computational power and modern hardware resources. BC is a distributed
    and decentralized approach, whenever a new transaction occurs it is validated
    by generating the consensus between the participating nodes [3]. Every time a
    new transaction occurs it is broadcast to all the other users in the network and
    miners start mining the block for this, they are using a considerable amount of
    computer power. It is also a waste of resources when each node repeats the same
    process [84]. Table 19. Summary of technical aspect — processing power. Reference
    Technical aspect Proposed solution Atlam et al. [3] The mining process requires
    very high computation power. Discussed an approach to speed up the mining process
    by simultaneously using CPU & GPU in single machines (originally proposed by [269]).
    Xie et al. [84] PoW algorithm requires high computational power to mine the block.
    Suggested using another consensus algorithm like PoS, DPoS. Monrat et al. [63]
    In the PoW consensus algorithm, the miner needs to solve a difficult puzzle to
    compute the hash, which requires high computational power and modern hardware
    resources, Energy consumption in comparison to other payment systems is too high.
    Suggested solution either to redesign the BC infrastructure or use another consensus
    algorithm like PoS, which consumes less energy. Golosova et al. [270] Discussed
    the high energy consumption. To validate a transaction each node starts computing
    solutions for which they are using an enormous amount of computer power. Each
    node is repeating the same process which is a waste of resources. No solution
    is proposed. Let us take bitcoin as an example, for validating the transactions
    PoW consensus algorithms are used which requires a high amount of energy with
    modern hardware [63]. Depending upon the resources available the transaction processing
    speed in bitcoin is very less compared to other existing systems such as VISA
    payment systems. So it is very important to increase the processing speed in the
    blockchain. IoT includes several divergent types of devices with various computing
    capabilities and all of them will not be able to run the same encryption algorithm
    at the required speed [14]. Table 19 encapsulates the processing power aspect
    of BC. 4.5.1. Challenges related to the processing power Each miner present in
    the network starts mining the block and the one who mines the block first will
    get the chance to append the block to the blockchain with some corresponding reward.
    To receive the reward for mining the block, each participating node starts mining
    the block which requires a huge amount of energy. As each node is repeating the
    same process, this leads to a waste of resources. The energy consumption rate
    of the Bitcoin network has set a new benchmark. According to a report by the bitcoin
    energy consumption index, VISA has consumed a total of 740,000 Gigajoules of energy
    for all its operations which is less than the energy consumed in the bitcoin mining
    process [271]. Also according to the same report carbon footprint of a single
    mined bitcoin is equal to the worth of mining gold [271]. 5. Lesson learned and
    future work BC for IoT is a profoundly dynamic research topic. There are many
    research areas with significant degrees of challenges that should be handled in
    a modern way. Furnishing new arrangements should be limited to specific prerequisites
    and limitations like low complexity and reliability. This segment momentarily
    talks about lessons learned from related works and conceivable future directions
    in incorporating BC and IoT. 5.1. Healthcare 5.1.1. Lessons learned Despite the
    hype around smart healthcare system, it faces many challenges, such as data sharing,
    data integrity, privacy, and access control. Here BC technology has proved the
    potential to resolve these challenges such as patient details, doctor’s records,
    patient’s medical history, and pharmaceutical supply chain can be stored on BC.
    Moreover, integrating BC with healthcare will reduce the counterfeit medicines
    and instruments supplied to hospitals and can inform the authorities about discrepancies
    because of the transparency in the network. But at the same storing a large amount
    of data directly on the main chain is a challenge. To resolve this, researchers
    suggested use of either side chains and cloud storage as off-chain solution. BC
    also helps in maintaining privacy among the users and provides a single platform
    where all previous and present data can be accessed. Some of the authors suggested
    using private BC to exercise tight control access and maintain features like privacy
    and security and confidentiality of the information. Use of both private and public
    BCs have been suggested by various researchers. Many works suggest use of cloud
    storage or IPFS to store a large amount of data since the storage capacity is
    limited and BC adds data in append-mode only. For storing data on the cloud or
    other chain, a hash of the data is stored on the main chain. 5.1.2. Future work
    A lot of data is generated on daily basis in healthcare systems like patients’
    personal records, medical history, and medical reports like MRI, CT Scan, Ultrasounds,
    and many more. As BC supports immutability but according to EU regulations, patients
    will have the right to get their data erased whenever they want. • Data storage:
    In the healthcare system lots of data are generated like medical scanning/imaging,
    reports, and other such large-size data. Storing such a big amount of data is
    a challenge as BC supports only a limited amount of data to be stored on-chain
    as bigger data leads to latency and less throughput [87]. • Security and privacy:
    Healthcare data contain sensitive and personal information about the patient which
    must remain secure. The intruder can attack and can steal a patient‘s details
    or else can make it difficult to share details between hospitals which can lead
    to the wrong diagnosis and come to know everything about your medical history.
    Achieving privacy and the ability to access sensitive information are the major
    challenges. • Interoperability: In the healthcare domain there is a huge number
    of interconnected devices and all these devices must communicate with each other.
    All the users (different stakeholders such as patients and health personnel) have
    multiple types of devices communicating with each other, which requires coordination
    between multiple users. • Standardization: BC technology is in its beginning stage
    and whenever a new technology emerges, it requires some widely-applicable standards
    from Standard Development Organizations (SDOs) such as ISO [272]. [273] lists
    out the basic standardization organizations and their efforts to standardize blockchain.
    [274] calls attention to various standardization organizations and their publications
    about blockchain. But still, there are no globally accepted standards and protocols
    for the applicability of blockchain. 5.2. Smart homes 5.2.1. Lessons learned A
    smart home is defined as a home where all the appliances installed in the house
    are connected through the Internet and can communicate and share data. This process
    involves significant amount of data generation. BC technology enables IoT devices
    to communicate and share data. The primary focus is to maintain security and privacy
    in IoT-enabled homes. Moreover, use of access control list and Lamport Merkle
    Digital Signature algorithm has been suggested by researcher for authorization.
    The most preferred consensus algorithm is PoW by researchers. But PoW adds an
    extra cost which can be removed and can be mined by the homeowner. The secondary
    focus while leveraging BC for smart homes is energy management. For this consortium
    BC with PBFT consensus algorithm has been suggested. Some researchers have suggested
    tiered architecture for efficient integration of BC and IoT-enabled smart homes.
    Use of smart contracts running on top of BC have been also found efficient for
    ensuring tight access control and authentication in smart homes. Moreover, proxy
    signature, Kalman filters, and private BCs have also been used by researchers
    for achieving authentication and monitoring of IoT devices in smart homes. 5.2.2.
    Future work • Access control attack: If the intruder gets access to the device
    controlling the activities in a smart home then the intruder can do malicious
    activities [106]. It is important to design an access control system to permit
    the third person or guests in the house. This permission will be given based on
    access records generated by IoT devices and stored permanently using blockchain
    [106]. • Inter-operability: A smart home consists of different appliances and
    it is difficult to communicate with each other. It is important to work in the
    direction to achieve interoperability among the devices. • Privacy and security:
    Although blockchain provides robust security and privacy, many other malicious
    attacks are possible. So, it is important to research more to improve privacy
    of user data. 5.3. Smart city 5.3.1. Lessons learned Smart cities can be defined
    as cities equipped with modern, smart, and connected amenities that make the lives
    of citizens easier. Due to rapid urbanization and the increase in population,
    cities are facing many challenges. Here BC can serve as a possible solution because
    of the features it offers like improved reliability, better fault tolerance capability,
    and faster and more efficient operations. The idea of combining BC with a smart
    city provides a platform for communication, supports data integrity, motivates
    organizations like schools, hospitals, and government entities to share data transparently,
    and saves individuals’ time. For maintaining privacy and security, SDN with BC
    is used with PoW consensus algorithms with private BC. Different frameworks include
    mainly four layers physical, database, communication, and interface layer. Numerous
    researchers suggested off-chain storage like IPFS, cloud storage, and private
    BC along with BC-enabled on-chain for data storage. This will help in the personal
    data sharing challenge. While some of the authors suggested using Hyperledger
    fabric to maintain authentication and authorization. For data integrity, digital
    signatures and hashing are preferred. For energy management in smart cities, hyperledger
    fabric is used to maintain confidentiality and Kafka algorithm for authentication.
    5.3.2. Future work • Security and privacy: As blockchain is a distributed ledger
    it does not guarantee the privacy of the user’s data, as all the data is shared
    among all the nodes present in the network. Another issue in BC is that each node
    has blockchain generated address and its real identity is not revealed. • Throughput:
    Throughput of the blockchain depends upon the number of transactions inside a
    block which is restricted by block size. The number of transaction rates must
    be improved for faster services. • Storage: Applying blockchain technology in
    smart cities will generate a huge amount of data which leads to data storage issues.
    To manage such large amount of data is another primary focus. • Energy efficiency:
    For any transaction to occur, nodes present in the network need to create consensus
    among themselves for which they need to solve hard computations which consume
    a large amount of electricity. So, the proposed system must be energy efficient.
    5.4. Supply chain management 5.4.1. Lessons learned The major application of BC
    in supply chain management is to trace and keep the track of the products. Also,
    BC helps in secure sharing information among all the entities involved in the
    supply chain. Tracing and sharing information about the product not only prevents
    counterfeiting of products but also provides transparent information about the
    product. Ethereum BC with PoC, BigChainDB, off-chain storage, and double chains
    are some of the solutions proposed by researchers. For monitoring or real-time
    tracking Ethereum and Hyperledger sawtooth with IoT and RFID have been used to
    ensure unique identification of items. While some other researchers discussed
    hyperledger fabric BC as it has better performance. For credit evaluation, BC
    with deep learning has been used. Smart contracts are also used for payments and
    smooth transactions. 5.4.2. Future work Here are some challenges that need to
    be resolved while integrating BC with supply chain management. • Adoption of technology:
    The major hurdle in adopting Blockchain technology is making people aware of the
    adaptability of blockchain technology due to lack of knowledge and lack of skills
    to use the technology [67]. • Throughput performance: As blockchain is decentralized
    in nature, each transaction needs approval from all the other nodes present in
    the network, which brings consensus among the nodes. This validation process and
    size of the block limits the throughput of the blockchain [147]. • Security: In
    the supply chain the privacy of the manufacturer and supplier is the most important
    issue. Any one of the participating entities in the blockchain network can be
    a competitor and can misuse the information flowing in the supply chain [67].
    • Inter-operability: A supply chain consists of different nodes, all of which
    need to communicate and share information between different nodes [67]. 5.5. Autonomous
    vehicle 5.5.1. Lessons learned Autonomous vehicles connected, smart, and driverless
    vehicle that can communicate or exchange data with other vehicles or infrastructure.
    Use of autonomous vehicles help in reducing accidents, reducing traffic congestion,
    increasing lane capacity, and efficient parking. However, security, privacy, trustless
    sharing, provenance are some of the required features which can be achieved with
    the use of BC in IoT-enabled autonomous vehicles. Some of the important use of
    BC for autonomous vehicles are energy trading between electric vehicles and charging
    stations, information sharing, vehicle-to-vehicle communication, and road-related
    messages such as road conditions and traffic congestion [84]. Use of Hyperledger
    Fabric, off-chain storage, and the Diffie hellman key exchange algorithm have
    been proposed for payments in AV. To ensure scalability, off-chain storage and
    separate chains have been proposed. Data is stored on independent sources and
    their indexes are stored on the main chain. 5.5.2. Future work Integrating BC
    with autonomous vehicles brings many challenges along with it like motivating
    vehicles to share road-related messages also it is important to design a trust
    management system. • Scalability: In autonomous vehicles, lots of data are generated
    in the case of connecting vehicles to be shared as road information, traffic jam,
    traffic lights, etc. All this requires memory to store. Data growing rate is 40%
    as compared to IT which is 5% [275]. 5.6. Smart grid 5.6.1. Lessons learned Smart
    grid are build to offer optimized and uninterrupted power supplies to user, however,
    it faces issues like non-trusted data collection, privacy leakage, centralized
    generation and distribution, insecure power system, and energy thefts. BC supports
    features like immutability, non-repudiation, and decentralization, which makes
    it the intriguing solution for achieving security, privacy, and trust in smart
    grid systems. For storing meter readings and electricity consumption, BC can be
    used. Also in the future, IoT-enabled device-to-device electricity trading and
    payments can be done through BC [84]. BC-enabled P2P energy trading platform allows
    decentralized selling of excess energy by one consumer to other consumer who are
    in need. While SHA-256/512 are the most preferred hashing algorithms, researcher
    have used RSA with zero knowledge proof and an elliptic curve algorithm to enhance
    access control and authorization. Another important focus is charging coordination
    among the users for which BC and smart contract enabled smart grid have been advocated.
    5.6.2. Future work According to a bitcoin energy consumption report, for carrying
    out thirty million transactions thirty billion kWh of electricity was consumed
    [87]. If we integrate BC with a smart grid, it will require a lot of energy as
    the number of transactions is a direct multiple of 1000. • Scalability: In the
    energy sector, the number of transactions is very high and energy consumption
    for such BC-based transactions will be very high. Thus, scalability is a challenge.
    • Centralization: The chances of centralization are because all the miners form
    a mining pool to solve the PoW consensus algorithm and which can further lead
    to a 51% attack. • Implementation Cost: Integrating blockchain with smart grids
    requires high infrastructure cost because of restructuring the current grid network.
    So, implementing BC in existing smart grid is a challenge. 5.7. Unmanned aerial
    vehicle 5.7.1. Lessons learned Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), also known as
    drones or Flying Robots [224], are self-regulating devices accessed through remotes
    or sometimes self-controlled and do not require a human pilot. BC has huge potential
    for encouraging the benefits of UAV-based applications. By implementing BC technology,
    governments across different geographical locations can keep an eye on the UAVs
    flying in their domains. With the expanding prominence of UAVs, their utilization
    in metropolitan territories has additionally expanded. BC enables UAVs to be outfitted
    with features like immutability, distribution, and decentralization which makes
    UAVs a prominent approach for applications that carry critical information such
    as defense, healthcare, surveillance, and financial applications. For communication
    among the UAV’s, Ethereum BC with IPFS storage is mostly used by different researchers.
    Although the use of BC for UAVs results in increase in overall processing time
    but it results in reduction in attack rates. For data collection, PoA consensus
    is used with Geth Ethereum BC. A few of the researchers, for health monitoring
    using UAV, also used the PoA consensus algorithm in data collection. Whereas few
    other researchers have also preferred the Kafka consensus algorithm with hyperledger
    fabric and smart contracts. 5.7.2. Future work Integrating BC with UAV is a complex
    task as it requires thorough testing before it is launched in the market. Also,
    UAVs have limited battery capacity with fly-time concerns whereas BC consumes
    more power. Thus, if we integrate BC with UAVs then power consumption is one of
    the major concerns to be resolved [226]. • Privacy: UAVs have cameras, temperature
    sensors, and GPS to collect data which can cause unintentional invasion of privacy
    [224]. • Scalability: In small groups of UAVs, communication is easily possible
    but in large groups, communication is not efficient. The number of transactions
    in Bitcoin and Ethereum is 12 transactions per second [224] which are quite less
    as compared to traditional approaches. • Lack of Standards and Regulations: Many
    organizations are currently working to release the BC standards so that the integration
    of BC with existing technologies will be possible. But the proper guidelines,
    rules, and regulations are yet to be released [224]. • Resource limitations: UAVs
    are lightweight flying machines but BC requires high computational power to run
    consensus algorithm [224]. 6. Conclusion BC is represented as a highly scalable
    technology that can be applied in many areas. Also, the IoT network is growing
    tremendously which leads to many challenges that need to be resolved soon. Here
    blockchain comes as a very promising solution because of its key attributes such
    as decentralization, immutability, distribution, transparency, non-repudiation,
    and pseudonymity. The future of integrating BC and IoT is apparently bright. In
    this paper, we briefly introduce blockchain, related terminology, its types, and
    the technology behind blockchain, i.e., DLT along with a quick overview of IoT.
    Further, this paper has surveyed the available literature on BC for IoT to provide
    an in-depth understanding of the integration of BC and IoT, related technical
    aspects, and their challenges. In particular, we focus attention on the opportunities
    and challenges that exist with the use of blockchain for IoT use cases. The key
    attributes of BC can support the implementation of various use cases such as healthcare,
    supply chain, and logistic management, smart city, smart grid, and autonomous
    vehicles. Our survey covered an aggregate treatment of challenges in integrating
    BC for IoT including scalability, security, and power consumption. We also discussed
    the lessons we learned from our literature survey. Finally, a broad list of future
    directions and open challenges were presented to motivate future research on BC
    for IoT. CRediT authorship contribution statement Shikha Mathur: Investigation,

    Keywords: smart agriculture sensors; IoT; precision farming; sensor-based technologies;
    data analytics; interoperability; wireless communication protocols 1. Introduction
    Agricultural systems will be under tremendous pressure to increase food production
    in sustainable ways as the world’s population is projected to nearly double to
    10 billion by 2050 [1]. In order to be prepared for the future, agriculture must
    find inventive solutions to problems like unstable climatic patterns and dwindling
    arable lands. Agricultural frameworks in the modern era face a number of difficulties.
    Unpredictable weather patterns brought on by climate change include more frequent
    droughts and floods. Such unpredictabilities place a severe pressure on conventional
    farming techniques, necessitating a change to more robust agricultural practises
    [2]. Further increasing the need for effective and sustainable agricultural methods
    is the growing loss of arable land, which is mostly linked to urbanisation and
    soil deterioration [3]. The potential of technology intervention shines brilliantly
    in the midst of these difficulties. A ray of hope is provided by precision agriculture,
    which is supported by cutting-edge sensor technologies. By continuously tracking
    crop conditions, weather patterns, and soil health, these devices provide actionable
    data that enable well-informed decisions and prompt treatments. In essence, sensor-based
    technology integration in farming landscapes resolves many of the current problems
    and, more importantly, sets the way for a sustainable and productive agricultural
    future [4]. 2. Sensor-Based Technologies: An Insight into Modern Agricultural
    Practices The era of traditional farming is evolving towards a tech-centric agricultural
    paradigm. Sensor-based technologies, leveraging data, promise enhanced production
    and sustainability. Table 1 highlights key sensor technology advancements and
    their agricultural applications to illustrate this shift. Table 1. Advanced sensor
    technologies being used in modern agriculture. By providing real-time information
    on the qualities of the soil and optimising irrigation and fertilisation, soil
    sensors have transformed precision farming [5]. Farmers can adjust to changing
    atmospheric conditions by using weather sensors to optimise planting and harvesting
    seasons [6]. Crop health and yield are improved by the fine-tuning of microclimatic
    conditions by light and humidity sensors [7]. Spectral imaging-based crop health
    monitors notify farmers to problems like infections or nutritional deficiencies
    and allow for pre-emptive interventions [8]. 3. The Convergence of IoT and Wireless
    Communication in Precision Agriculture Through the incorporation of sensor technology
    and cutting-edge wireless communication systems, the Internet of Things (IoT)
    has transformed agriculture. Transmitting enormous amounts of real-time data over
    great distances, especially in difficult circumstances, becomes crucial as farms
    transform into digital ecosystems. 3.1. Sensor Networks in IoT-Based Agriculture
    Interconnected sensor networks, which collect various agronomic metrics, are agriculture’s
    IoT [9]. Their true value comes from their ability to interface with centralised
    databases and decision-making tools, giving farmers the power to make quick decisions
    based on current data and promoting a precision culture [10,11]. 3.2. Communication
    Technologies: Bridging the Gap Numerous communication protocols, ranging from
    well-established ones like ZigBee to more recent ones like 5G (fifth generation)
    and NB-IoT (NarrowBand Internet of Things) are available in the tech world for
    smart farming. ZigBee provides balanced power and range, making it perfect for
    isolated farms [12], while NB-IoT provides extensive coverage with low energy
    requirements for large-scale agricultural endeavours [13]. With its speed, low
    latency, and dependability, 5G is poised to redefine data transfer [14]. 4. The
    Interplay of Sensor Technologies and Data Management Modern precision agriculture
    is built on a foundation of seamless sensor technology and data management, creating
    a synergy that offers increased agricultural productivity and better resource
    management. 4.1. Need for Interoperability among Diverse Technologies Different
    sensor systems used in smart agriculture have unique data formats and protocols
    [15]. Interoperability becomes more important as systems become more complex.
    Enhanced interoperability optimises yield and resource consumption by consolidating
    and coherently analysing data. 4.2. Data Analytics, Management Techniques, and
    Challenges Artificial intelligence and smart algorithms help with the rigorous
    management and analysis of the massive amounts of data from sensors [16]. Making
    the transition from raw data to usable insights presents difficulties, such as
    managing storage and protecting data privacy. To solve this, you need to have
    a solid grasp of agriculture and be an expert data manager. 4.3. Techniques for
    Sensor Data Analytics and Management To analyse huge amounts of sensor-generated
    data, advanced analytics, from classical statistical techniques to contemporary
    machine learning, are required. An overview of these analytics and management
    methods for agricultural sensor data is provided in Table 2. Table 2. Comprehensive
    overview of sensor data analytics and management techniques in precision agriculture.
    5. Future Perspectives and Current Challenges in Sensor-Based Agriculture The
    nexus of sensor development, telecommunications, and artificial intelligence is
    the next frontier in agricultural technology. These cutting-edge fields, while
    they hold the potential for paradigm-shifting effects, are also rife with complex
    problems that each call for in-depth investigation. 5.1. Potential of 5G Technology
    and AI Predictive Modelling 5G’s ultra-reliable low latency promises more than
    fast data transfer, facilitating real-time analysis in distant agricultural fields
    [22]. AI (artificial intelligence) predictive modelling, enhanced by real-time
    data, offers precise forecasts, from weather to pest detection [23]. 5.2. Challenges:
    Cost, Data Privacy, System Compatibility, Energy Management Economic difficulties
    arise with the adoption of cutting-edge technologies, particularly for agrarians
    who are resource-constrained [24]. Increased encryption and security measures
    are required due to the increase in data [25]. In order to combine several digital
    platforms in agriculture, seamless system compatibility is essential [26]. Energy
    conservation, notably the use of renewable energy for sensors, must be prioritised
    [27]. For a thorough summary of the obstacles and future directions for sensor-based
    agriculture, see Table 3. Table 3. An analytical synopsis of prospective avenues
    and challenges in sensor-based agriculture. 6. Conclusions With the combination
    of cutting-edge sensor technology and data-driven innovations, agriculture’s historical
    evolution is ready for yet another important revolution. This discussion went
    deep into the technical details of these technologies and highlighted how they
    might affect present and future agricultural endeavours. The analysis of our research
    yields the following key conclusions: Primacy of Sensor Integration: Sensor technologies
    that track factors like soil quality, weather erraticness, light, humidity, and
    crop health are largely responsible for the advancements in precision agriculture.
    They have fuelled data-centric farming methods by offering granular insights,
    assuring the best use of resources and raising yields. Sensor Technologies and
    Data Management Confluence: Different sensor technologies add different data formats
    and communication protocols to the agricultural tapestry as they are woven in.
    Thus, interoperability is essential for achieving a seamless connection. A sophisticated
    analytics and management solution is also required to transform the massive amount
    of collected data into a useful agricultural strategy. Prospective Technological
    Boons: The impending use of 5G technology and the skill of AI predictive modelling
    are positive signs for the future of agriculture. These tools could revolutionise
    agricultural decision making since they promise accurate forecasting and real-time
    data transfer. Inherent Challenges: Even with advances in technology, significant
    problems still exist. These cover issues including the price tag associated with
    adopting new technology, protecting data privacy in an era of information overload,
    establishing system interoperability among various tech solutions, and dealing
    with energy management for remote sensor operations. Implications for Upcoming
    Research: Focused Investigation: Future studies may benefit from focusing on particular
    sensor types as technology continues to progress. This would enable a deeper investigation
    of the problems and applications that are unique to them. Holistic System Design:
    The creation of complete systems that integrate various sensor technologies should
    be prioritised in order to streamline data collection, processing, and the extraction
    of insightful information. Broader Dimensions: Prospective studies ought to extend
    beyond the strictly technical to include ethical considerations of data privacy
    and the larger socio-economic effects of technology adoption in agriculture. Fundamentally,
    even while the fusion of sensor-based technology with agriculture ushers in a
    new era of productivity and sustainability, the road ahead is not without obstacles.
    However, the advantages they offer vastly outweigh these challenges, prompting
    a concerted effort by academics, technologists, and agricultural stakeholders
    to fully realise this enormous potential. Author Contributions Conceptualization,

    scalability, and data quality are thoroughly examined. Ensuring data security
    becomes critical to safeguard against potential cyber threats and breaches that
    could have severe consequences on individuals and organizations alike [2]. As
    data generated by IoT devices continues to escalate exponentially, it becomes
    increasingly crucial to address these challenges and ensure the secure and efficient
    functioning of IoT ecosystems [3]. This research emphasizes the need for robust
    frameworks and standards to overcome these hurdles and foster a conducive environment
    for the integration of IoT and data analytics. Intelligent and autonomous systems
    that adapt to dynamic environments can lead to improvements in predictive maintenance,

    Constant depletion of natural resources, limited fertile soil, increasing natural
    disasters, Population growth, in addition, it helps sensory data to take the necessary
    steps to obtain the correct information. The transition phase is responsible for
    distinguishing the types of agricultural data collected in high levels of knowledge
    [8]. Web of Things provides a wide variety of services for various applications,
    such as communication modules, power supplies, devices. Inadequate players cannot
    integrate, change knowledge, or cause problems such as inequality and diversity
    [9]. After an in-depth analysis of the IoT framework, soon after much experience,
    the five-tier IoT architecture is offered only for security architectures. The
    farmers discussed these five levels and adopted as follows [10]: The middleware
    layer: The problem is resolved at the middle level of the project, collecting,
    combining, filtering and analysing the data received from IoT applications. This
    reduces the time to analyse the above problems and gives developers an easy-to-use
    tool to develop their app. Modern farming practices that facilitate development
    through a centralized system will help them quickly adapt outdated practices,
    which in turn improves the relevance and functionality of the Internet of Things.
    Common Platform Layer: This level includes machine learning algorithms, big data,
    cutting computers, cloud preparation, cloud preparation, similar applications
    and integrated features. This level accounts for agricultural knowledge, management,
    decision making, summarization, and statistical aspects of the first foreign processing
    algorithms developed for agricultural production, e.g. Waiting, first counselling,
    approval for diagnosis, intelligent decision making and skills training. IoT Specialist
    or threshold systems are available for this level, such as insect prediction,
    disease prediction, first aid, animal husbandry and plant monitoring, signalling,
    product protection, and footprint. An intelligent system can improve efficiency.
    The safety of agricultural products can improve efficiency and save time and cost,

    SECTION IV. Iot Challenges in Agriculture as a Case Study The main problem that
    slows down farmers'' ability to take advantage of the latest technologies is to
    slow down communication. The BTRC stated that while there are more than 90 million
    Internet users, we do not have any detailed information on smartphone usage by
    Agriculture for the purpose of farmers. This technique is used in many fields
    Rural farmers are not aware of this. The second and final major problem is awareness.
    According to an American research report, only 68% of the 1,600 farmers are familiar
    with the Internet of Things. These techniques are more complex for small farms
    than large farms. For more value-based services, data tools and sensors control
    tools have become quite difficult to [17]. In IoT, millions of devices like WSAN,
    RFID, etc. are connected to each other. Agricultural information exchange. Therefore,
    due to communication barriers, cloud computing technology is required in this
    industry. However, the cost of manufacturing and maintaining this technology will
    also increase. Agronomy Software material costs increase due to improper environments
    such as water, cold, heat, wind, storm, sand and natural locations. The next challenge
    is to find the right business model. IoT cannot be operated blindly. The IoT business
    model should be an important factor in achieving agricultural goals. The next
    problem is computer security. Instruments should be protected from theft and misuse,
    as forecasting can be understood in agriculture, as well as the prices and costs
    of products under control, and needs to be seen. The final effort is human resource
    training [18]. The knowledge stored in this tool is difficult to analyse or understand.
    However, IoT devices can also be used on small farms if employees are trained
    for such specialized tasks. The introduction of digital technology in the region
    invested more than seven hundred million in the Aggrotech market in 2017. The
    mount of cast avail is double in 2016. In contrast, in 2015, the total world population
    was expected to exceed 9.5 billion, mean that feeding9. 5billionmouths. This would
    dramatically increase the amount of market needed to help farmers meet future
    demand [19]. SECTION V. Proposed Future Solutions The solution is designed to
    meet the increasing demand for WSN-related data and communication resources by
    The Cloud of Things (COT). To describe the integration of survey on cloud systems,
    cloud platforms two IoT devices and communication networks can be presented. For
    an application to be effective, efficient and complete, it needs to open a strategic
    plan for IT planning. Awareness about the development of agricultural culture
    needs to be spread around the world. Artificial Intelligence I Investors in IoT
    technology can bring great success to their businesses, to farmers, and to agriculture
    in general, and open farmers to collaborate. The selected program should be paid
    for using online tools to educate all farmers. Care must be taken to direct and
    maximize the necessary human resources in the affected areas. Fear of technology
    should be gradually spread. Some people ware feel the need to create similar organizations,
    such as “investment of communities”, which include investors, farmers, developers,
    programs, utilities, agriculture, software, hardware expert etc [20]. There is
    a very promising concept called Smart Farming, founded on agricultural management,
    using new technology tools to increase productivity as well as improve the quality
    and quantity of products. Smart agriculture introduces the latest farming methods,
    such as harvesting, individual animal husbandry, higher crop management, animals
    for special farmers, family farming, and organic farming. At this time farmers
    could uses agricultural techniques such as [21]: Sensors: humidity, soil management,
    temperature, light, and water pressure. Software: Accomplishment is available
    by outfitter to make for software farms and with the use of IoT stage goal to

    for the process or plant at home or for the development of the entire farm. Interconnection,
    between experts in smart tools integrated with IT processes to increase the use
    of farming under IoT. SECTION VI. Iot Challenges and Issues Analysis Internet-based
    technology has solved many problems and solutions [22]: Security, Lack Knowledge
    of Technology, and Cost. Reliability: In agriculture, IoTs are tools because critical
    environmental conditions can compromise communication and misuse the resources

    electronics industry and scientific advancements have enabled the mass production
    of affordable smart products. Consequently, there has been a significant rise
    in the number of internet-connected devices, leading to the utilization and improvement
    of existing services across various fields. The Internet of Things (IoT) has gained
    prominence as a research area, where smart devices can be interconnected globally
    via wired or wireless networks. IoT finds application in diverse domains such
    as connected cars, smart cities, government agencies, and wireless sensor networks.
    These IoT structures are characterized by heterogeneity, employing different technologies,
    operating on distinct systems and architectures, and relying on unique devices
    [1]. IoT represents the concept of connecting the entire internet, encompassing
    various communication objects and data exchange methods. It forms a powerful and
    efficient network of interconnected physical devices that operate within cyberspace,
    facilitating real-time data processing, peer-to-peer connectivity, and advanced
    analytics. However, the security of IoT frameworks has emerged as the primary
    challenge for researchers and analysts, impeding the rapid development and widespread
    adoption of this transformative technology [2]. Many IoT devices lack sophistication
    and cannot support complex security measures due to limitations in capacity, power
    handling, and performance. Existing security protocols and conventional approaches
    are often inadequate for ensuring the security of IoT systems. To ensure the success
    of IoT, it is crucial for companies and devices to prioritize security aspects
    such as protection against attacks, data authenticity, controlled access, and
    consumer privacy. Data integrity and privacy are crucial factors influencing the
    adoption of IoT services and applications, particularly in the realm of social
    media. While several privacy and security initiatives are underway, effective
    IoT security mechanisms that meet the requirements of information integrity, privacy,
    and trust are still needed [3]. Therefore, the implementation of robust security
    measures is essential to prevent unauthorized or malicious entities from compromising
    the integrity and functioning of IoT systems. In this context fits the purpose
    of this paper. Where the main objective of this paper is to introduce a secure
    verification framework for user authentication, specifically between an access
    point and a node database. To achieve this objective, three stages are implemented.
    Firstly, a novel hybrid biometric pattern represented by a merge algorithm is
    proposed. This model combines image and password features to enhance randomization
    and bolster the security levels within the pattern structure. Secondly, a combination
    of encryption and blockchain techniques suitable for the new hybrid pattern is
    developed. This ensures the secure transmission of patterns from the access point
    to the node database. By adhering to the information security standard requirements
    of confidentiality, integrity, and availability, the proposed approach guarantees
    the security of the image verification system during the authentication process.
    Finally, a new matching process is proposed. The latter involves of comparing
    the image features and the password features with the corresponding records in
    the database at the destination level. The main contributions of this paper are
    the following: A merging algorithm of image and password has been proposed to
    enhance the security of the authentication process. Hash Function SHA-256 has
    been utilized, to ensure data integrity and security of the hybrid model. Shift-AES
    algorithm has been implemented to offer an extra layer of safety to the hybrid
    pattern. Blockchain technology has been utilized to secure communication between
    access point and destination. Finally, a matching process has been implemented
    to compare the image and password features from the node database with those from
    the access point. By encouraging the use of the proposed methods in this article,
    as it addresses the problem of pattern information leakage and enhance the level
    of security. The protection of both image and password data is guaranteed by the
    proposed hybrid verification model, and it applies not only to the user enrollment
    device and node database but also to the transmission of data from the identification
    phase to the development phase. This new model also addresses other challenges,
    such as pattern randomization and the authentication of the user’s location. As
    a result of the framework’s adaptability to decentralized systems, it can be used
    for a variety of applications. The proposed approach’s efficiency and resistance
    to attacks have been proven through experimental results. These results demonstrate
    that the proposed approach outperforms the benchmark in terms of execution time,
    making it faster and more efficient. Moreover, the proposed framework exhibits
    a higher level of security. In terms of accuracy, the proposed framework achieves
    an impressive rate of 98.3%. It also shows a False Rejection Rate (FRR) of 0.992.
    Conversely, the False Acceptance Rate (FAR) is 0.1, and the error rate is 0.017
    when securing the hybrid pattern during data transmission between the access point
    and the node database. The robustness of the proposed approach against attacks
    makes it highly suitable for Internet of Things networks. However, the main goal
    of future research is to improve the performance of the algorithm by focusing
    on minimizing the false acceptance rate (FAR). The rest of the paper is organized
    as follows. Section 2 presents the recent related work papers. Section 3 describes
    the proposed methodology. Section 4 focuses on results and discussion. Section
    5 provides the validation and evaluation of the proposed approach. Finally, Section
    6 concludes the paper. 2 Related work Data reliability and privacy are key factors
    affecting how distributed IoT products and software packages spread through social
    means. Although a lot of privacy and security software has emerged in recent years.
    Several IoT security solutions have been proposed in the literature, including
    encryption and blockchain technology. Wan et al. [4] presented a distributed blockchain-based
    industrial automation platform that is more secure and private than traditional
    centralized architecture. The above articles suggested application scenarios and
    feasible solutions to implement blockchain on the Internet of Things. However,
    the current implementation of blockchain still has problems with the balance of
    efficiency and security. The following documentation described the solution and
    provided ideas. To develop a decentralized architecture for storing IoT data produced
    by smart homes and cities, Uddin et al. [5] suggested adopting blockchain. IoT
    device privacy and security are ensured by the architecture, which includes a
    secure communication protocol for power-constrained IoT devices and a gateway
    that employs sign encryption, a type of lightweight cryptography for IoT devices.
    To bridge the gap between IoT devices with limited power and memory and blockchain,
    the writers improved Gateway’s capability as a miner selector. A software agent
    operating on the gateway was suggested to choose a miner node based on the criteria
    governing the performance of the miner. In the recognition framework proposed
    by Mohsin et al. [6], blockchain and other techniques (RFID, steganography…) were
    used to verify access control by finger vein recognition. This proposition is
    ingenious in so far as the results could be just unique and strong as a proof
    of security. But an angle was missed. It concerns the emergency cases where the
    finger vein recognition does not permit to give access to unconscious patient
    data. The aforementioned point of view seems to be a start for more research.
    To verify user identity, In [7], the authors propose a new authentication security
    framework to confirm user identification. To improve the randomness and security
    of the system, this framework uses a new composite algorithm-based control protection
    framework that combines RFID and Finger Vein (FV) biometric functions. In addition,
    it combines blockchain and steganography technology to ensure the confidentiality,
    integrity, and availability of user data. In [7], the authors conceived a flexible
    iris authentication system. The information about the iris feature is encrypted
    by the system using homogenous encryption technology before being saved on the
    blockchain for authentication, certification, and high accuracy. In [8], the authors
    examined privacy concerns in IoT systems and explored five privacy preservation
    strategies based on blockchain technology. These strategies encompass private
    contracts, anonymization, encryption, differential privacy, and privacy mixing.
    The authors also discussed future directions and challenges related to privacy
    preservation in IoT systems based on blockchain. Their research provides a foundation
    for the development of privacy preservation strategies in the near future. A blockchain-assisted
    authentication method that facilitates the authentication of devices in various
    Internet of Things domains was proposed in the article [9]. The protocol devises
    an identity management system to keep the authenticated nodes anonymous and introduces
    a consortium blockchain to foster trust between various domains. In paper [10]
    ,the authors introduces and explores the elliptic Galois cryptography protocol,
    which involves utilizing a cryptographic technique to encrypt sensitive data from
    various medical sources. Subsequently, a Matrix XOR encoding steganography technique
    is employed to conceal the encrypted data within a low complexity image. Additionally,
    the proposed approach incorporates an optimization algorithm known as Adaptive
    Firefly to enhance the selection of cover blocks within the image. To address
    the privacy and security challenges associated with centralized IoT, the authors
    in [11] proposed a solution by integrating blockchain technology with IoT. They
    introduced a decentralized security mechanism based on blockchain, aiming to mitigate
    these issues. Additionally, the widespread adoption of this approach ensures enhanced
    transparency, which proves advantageous for handling data streaming from various
    devices and equipment. However, to address the widespread issue of user privacy
    in the Industrial Internet of Things, A new blockchain-based intelligent industry
    identification management system was suggested in the paper [12]. Through biometric
    and fuzzy extractors, the system offers participants anonymous credentials. It
    also permits selective sharing, suspension/unfreezing, and revocation of credentials.
    Targeting the issues with the biometric authentication system’s opaque biometric
    information management, ineffective authentication module, and risk of biometric
    information leakage, A blockchain-based biometric authentication system was suggested
    in the article [13]. By dispersing biometric templates and maintaining them with
    the decentralized and tamper-proof blockchain method, the system enhances the
    security and dependability of current biometric authentication systems. The blockchain-based
    infrastructure suggested in the paper [14] enables for safe, transparent, and
    privacy-protected biometric authentication. The system uses distributed DID to
    handle biometric data and gives users authority over their own electronic identities,
    enabling them to fully manage their biometric identification data and guarantee
    user data security. Given the difficulties that blockchain technology has in storing
    and allowing access to private files, A biometric-based blockchain file storage
    and access permission mechanism are suggested in the paper [15]. This system is
    suitable for usage on devices with limited resources because all file storage
    and access requests and responses are handled on the blockchain and the file owner
    is not needed to store any data locally. In conclusion, while there are certain
    cross-domain authentication solutions based on blockchain, there are significantly
    fewer of them that can combine security, privacy, adaptability, and robustness,
    making it challenging to apply to challenging real-world scenarios. Therefore,
    the need for an effective and all-encompassing cross-domain authentication technique
    is important. In [16], the author presented a centralized cloud cross-domain data-sharing
    platform based on blockchain with several security gateways to address the problem
    of cross-domain data access in product manufacturing. The technology uses blockchain
    to store data in a centralized cloud that can be audited, and smart contracts
    may be used to punish apps or data providers who are found to be acting improperly.
    In [17], the author proposes the utilization of smart contracts in the insurance
    industry to streamline the processing of insurance claims. This approach offers
    the potential to reduce costs and errors associated with manual claim processing,
    while also significantly improving processing speed. The study also explores the
    feasibility of implementing conditional triggers within smart contracts. By leveraging
    smart contracts, customers can place their trust in the software rather than solely
    relying on the insurance company, thereby enhancing transparency between clients
    and the insurance provider. To address the security and privacy concerns between
    drones, In the paper [18], the authors suggest a blockchain-based intelligent
    5G interconnection cross-domain certification scheme for drones. This approach
    combines smart contracts with multiple signatures based on threshold sharing to
    create a collaborative domain and validate trustworthy communication across cross-domain
    devices. The certification link between IoT intelligent devices is abstracted
    in the paper. [19], and the certification problem is then transformed into a signature
    transitivity problem using the blockchain. Here, the strain of digital signature
    authentication can be significantly reduced because the signature only needs to
    calculate the signatures and witnesses of the pertinent edges. The genuine identity
    of the present key user cannot be ascertained during authentication in any of
    the aforementioned studies that use key pairs as the unique identifier of user
    identity authentication, increasing the danger of account attacks. The paper [20],
    examined the effectiveness of blockchain in vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETS).
    As the number of transactions increases and the endorsement policy evolves, there
    is a corresponding increase in the volume of reads and writes occurring within
    a single transaction. Consequently, the overall block size of the blockchain-based
    VANET expands. This expansion leads to improvements in throughput and network
    utilization, while simultaneously reducing latency. According to the authors in
    the paper [21], blockchain technology has the potential to empower patients by
    allowing them to maintain sovereignty and control over their personal data. This
    enables the availability of accurate data for precision medicine. Additionally,
    the high level of transparency offered by blockchain can enhance trust in various
    aspects of healthcare, such as drug delivery, conditions, documentation, and end-to-end
    visibility. This transparency is particularly beneficial for cold chain management
    in ensuring the integrity of temperature-sensitive products. In paper [22], the
    authors propose advanced versions of blockchain technology with the aim of accelerating
    various demanding real-time applications. Through simulation analysis, the proposed
    architecture is shown to meet all essential requirements, empowering network entities
    to fully leverage the benefits of 5G network sharing. The results of the simulation
    kernel demonstrate the effectiveness of the suggested approach. In the paper [23]
    ,the authors introduced solutions for ensuring efficient blockchain hashing and
    validation, including approaches that address deadline, latency, and energy considerations.
    They also presented a BEFC scheme (Blockchain-Enabled Fog Computing) with the
    objective of enhancing scalability in edge computing and expanding the computational
    capacity for processing IoT data. These technologies hold promise in improving
    the overall efficiency and performance of edge computing systems when it comes
    to blockchain operations and IoT data processing. Anitha et al [24],introduced
    a novel approach for secure authentication and improved performance in a multi-Wireless
    Sensor Network (WSN) model using a Light-Weight Authentication Algorithm (LWAA).
    Their method is based on a public blockchain and aims to enhance the verification
    process in Internet of Things (IoT) applications. The proposed method divides
    the WSN nodes into access points, group head nodes, and regular nodes based on
    their power variations, creating a hierarchical model. Through the utilization
    of blockchain, the authentication of nodes in various communication scenarios
    is established, ensuring a secure and reliable network. By implementing cryptography
    techniques, the proposed method not only enhances the lifespan of the network
    but also effectively reduces computation time. This combination of blockchain-based
    authentication and efficient cryptography contributes to the overall security
    and performance improvement of the multi-WSN environment, specifically in IoT
    applications. Author in paper [25],created a decentralized e-healthcare framework
    that grants exclusive access to the user for their stored data on the server.
    This framework incorporates various security components that ensure data integrity
    and protection. In the context of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), the author
    of [26], put forth a novel system that combines deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
    with blockchain technology. This system incorporates DRL-based offloading and
    blockchain-based task scheduling mechanisms, creating a distinctive approach for
    healthcare applications in the IoMT. This paper [27] examines the implementation
    of a patient healthcare data blockchain that utilizes off-chain storage to enhance
    scalability. The blockchain includes the hash value of the medical data, while
    the original data is stored in multiple off-chain servers. Through a multi-server
    authentication system, a patient can conveniently access these servers through
    a single enrollment process and share their health data with authorized care providers.
    In paper [28], the authors propose a method that combines blockchain with wireless-based
    public administration process (WBPAP) technique and auto-metric graph neural network
    (AGNN) approaches. The main goal of this method is to address payload balancing
    and node authentication in order to mitigate money mishandling and provide benefits
    to farmers through the implementation of a secure connection. By utilizing this
    approach, the diffusion, tamper-resistance, and traceability of blockchain movements
    are improved. This helps to reduce the integrity issues related to routing information
    through routing nodes. The integration of WBPAP and AGNN techniques in the blockchain
    system enhances the overall security and efficiency of the process, ensuring a
    more secure and transparent environment for public administration and benefiting
    the farmers involved. In paper [29], The authors introduce a hybrid intelligent
    Intrusion Detection System (HIIDS) for Internet of Things (IoT) applications,
    particularly in the healthcare domain. The proposed system combines machine learning
    and metaheuristic algorithms to enhance the detection capabilities. In IoT-based
    smart healthcare, biomedical sensors play a crucial role in capturing vital health
    parameters. These parameters are then transmitted to a cloud server for storage
    and analysis. However, the security and privacy of the Electronic Health Record
    (EHR) data stored in the cloud server are of utmost importance. The focus of this
    research is on identifying security attacks on cloud servers by employing an anomaly-based
    intrusion detection approach. By leveraging machine learning and metaheuristic
    algorithms, the HIIDS system aims to detect and mitigate potential security breaches,
    ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive health data stored in
    the cloud server. Overall, these studies and proposals demonstrate the wide-ranging
    applications and potential benefits of blockchain technology in ensuring data
    reliability, privacy, and security across various IoT domains. 3 Methodology This
    section describes the data security mechanism of the authentication system. It
    integrates blockchain technology and a hybrid cryptographic image model. As suggested
    by this study, providing a secure way to authenticate the system requires two
    phases. In the identification phase, a hybrid pattern is represented by combining
    image and password features using a merging algorithm. To ensure data integrity
    and security, a SHA-256 hashing function is applied to the hybrid pattern. Additionally,
    the Shift-AES algorithm has been implemented to add an extra layer of safety to
    the hybrid pattern. Finally, blockchain technology is utilized to secure the communication
    between the access point and the destination. In the development phase, the processes
    implemented in the identification phase is applied in the reverse order to separate
    the image features from the password features. The final step involves comparing
    these extracted features with the corresponding records in the database. Figure
    1 illustrates the framework of our technique and its processing at base stations
    and nodes for the use of the proposed technique. The diagram above suggests the
    proposed study architecture. Fig. 1 Verification secure framework Full size image
    The decentralized nature of blockchain allows the distributed transmission of
    the hybrid pattern, obtained by merging image and password features using a merge
    algorithm, in a distributed manner at the blockchain level. This approach ensures
    that participating nodes are distributed and operate in a relaxed manner in terms
    of memory, computing power, and execution time. The even distribution of resources
    contributes to enhanced efficiency and mitigates potential bottlenecks within
    the system. 3.1 The merge algorithm The purpose of the proposed new merge method
    is to ensure the security and integrity of each recording method and avoid duplicate
    references in the database. This proposed method involves combining a password
    string and a randomly selected string from an image. The image features and password
    features are merged using a three-step process. In the first step, the image and
    password features are extracted and converted into a binary string using a simple
    protocol. The second step involves concatenating the binary-converted strings.
    During the rotation phase, repeated data is replaced with bit-word data. The third
    step applies a chaotic function to the data using the equation provided in (1)
    and (2). This chaotic function is known as the standard Chirikov map, commonly
    referred to as the Chirikov-Taylor. $${p}_{n+1}={p}_{n}+k \\ \\text{sin}\\left({\\theta
    }_{n}\\right)$$ (1) $${\\theta }_{n+1}={\\theta }_{n}+{p}_{n+1}$$ (2) Where \\(p\\)
    and \\(\\theta\\) are angles calculated mod 2π and \\(K\\) is a positive constant.
    Algorithm 1 Illustrates the pseudo-code of merge algorithm Full size image 3.2
    Secure hash algorithm The Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) is a cryptographic hash
    function developed jointly by the National Institute of Standards and Technology
    (NIST) and the National Security Agency (NSA). It was published as the Secure
    Hash Standard in May 1993, the main objective of ensuring data integrity and security,
    especially during transmission. In the context of SHA, hashing involves taking
    an input, such as a message or data file, and generating a fixed-length string
    of characters called a hash value or message digest. The length of the hash value
    depends on the specific hash algorithm used. The SHA family of algorithms includes
    four additional hashing algorithms known as SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512.
    The suffix in their names indicates the bit size of the message digests they produce
    [30]. Among them, Secure Hash Algorithm 2 (SHA-2) is widely recognized and utilized,
    with SHA-256 being a well-known subset of SHA-2. SHA-2 remains widely supported
    and used in various cryptographic applications due to its strong security properties
    and widespread adoption. The Secure Hash Algorithm plays a critical role in cryptography
    and data security. Its main functions include verifying the integrity of data,
    authenticating messages, and securely storing passwords. By generating unique
    hash values for input data, SHA ensures that even a small modification in the
    input will produce a significantly different output. This property makes it challenging
    for attackers to tamper with or forge data without detection. Overall, SHA is
    an essential component in ensuring the security and reliability of digital communications
    and data storage. It provides a robust cryptographic foundation for a wide range
    of applications, safeguarding sensitive information, and mitigating the risks
    associated with unauthorized access or data manipulation. And for these reasons
    the hybrid architecture contains SHA-256. 3.3 Encryption using shift-AES algorithm
    Encryption techniques have emerged as the most critical approach to protecting
    recordings from strangers. Encryption structures required records to be encrypted
    using mathematical algorithms and become incomprehensible during transmission,
    these would need to be decrypted in order to be used. Although many encryption
    algorithms have emerged in recent years to provide privacy and security. Several
    security solutions have been proposed in the literature as shown in Table 1. Table
    1 Comparison of encryption algorithms, DES, RSA, AES, and Shift-AES Full size
    table According to the table, AES outperforms RSA and DES algorithms [31]. Accordingly,
    the first-class encryption method for information protection is the AES symmetric
    key encryption standard [32, 33]. The US government employs AES as a symmetric
    data encryption technique [34]. It can be used to encrypt data in both hardware
    and software. The AES algorithm can work with any combination of data (128 bits)
    and key lengths of 128, 192, and 256 bits. Before delivering the final cipher
    text or retrieving the original plain text, the AES system performs 10 rounds
    for 128-bit keys, 12 rounds for 192-bit keys, and 14 rounds for 256-bit keys,
    respectively. Due to the restrictions, physical constraints and hostile conditions
    imposed by the IoT; power consumption which is a crucial concern in IoT network
    to increase network lifetime. Traditional encryption techniques are not suitable
    for this industry. It was necessary to adjust the traditional encryption algorithms,
    to increase storage memory, reduce computational complexity and strengthen security.
    This introduces a new type of encryption called lightweight cryptography. Shift-AES
    [35] is a new lightweight algorithm that can be used with IoT applications. It
    is an improvement of the AES algorithm and takes all these specifications. The
    idea of the Shift-AES algorithm is to replace the Mix-Column transformation of
    the AES algorithm with another Shift-Column transformation, since the multiplication
    process consumes more execution time and storage memory. While the other adjustments
    are very similar to those of the AES algorithm. As a result, the idea of replacing
    one process with another that requires less execution time while adhering to Shannon’s
    concepts of dissipation and confusion emerged. Shift-AES [35] is based on four
    processes in the following sequence: AddRoundKey: is a simple xor function between
    the data entity and the encryption key. ShiftCols: is a column shift function.
    The ShiftCols transformation process is based on several cyclic movements of columns
    with different offsets, allowing a good state swapping, as shown in Eq. 3. $${{S}^{{\\prime
    }}}_{r,c}={S}_{(r+offset\\_shift\\left(c\\right)) \\ {mod} \\ {N}_{b},c}$$ (3)
    $$\\mathrm{With}\\;\\left\\{\\begin{array}{cc}\\begin{array}{ccc}offset\\_shift(0)=1&for&shift=3\\\\offset\\_shift(1)=2&for&shift=2\\\\offset\\_shift(2)=3&for&shift=1\\\\offset\\_shift(3)=0&for&shift=0\\end{array},&N_b=4\\;and\\;0\\leq
    r,\\;c < N_b\\end{array}\\right.$$ Where S is the state before the change. S’
    is the state after the change. r is the state line. and Nb is the variety of rows
    similar to the state size. SubBytes: is a process of changing entity bits by other
    bits of the S-Box. ShiftRows: is a row shift function by its offset. Figures 2
    and 3 shows the design flow of the Shift-AES encryption algorithm that demonstrates
    all the processes. Fig. 2 Flow chart of the Shift-AES algorithm Full size image
    Fig. 3 Blockchain technology Full size image Shift-AES has become a step forward
    due to this modification to solve the problem of massive computations, and considered
    as a lightweight cryptography algorithm used for IoT networks. In addition, it
    is for this reason the hybrid architecture of this paper finds the Shift-AES algorithm
    splendid and realistic to improve it. 3.4 Blockchain technology Blockchain technology
    is a decentralized digital ledger that enables secure and transparent transactions
    to occur without the need for intermediaries like financial institutions or governments
    [36]. In a blockchain, each block comprises information, metadata relating to
    the hash of the information, and a pointer to the hash of the past block. The
    primary components of blockchain include cryptography, transitive hash lists,
    digital signatures, and hash functions [37]. Cryptography ensures secure communication,
    even if a malicious entity gains access to confidential data on a device. A hash
    function can be used to map data of any size to translated data of a fixed size.
    (i) One of the main features of the hash function that makes it interesting to
    implement is collision avoidance. The same action cannot be created by two different
    inputs, and (ii) even if they seem entirely random, deterministic concealment
    of random transcribed data will match the relevant information. These features
    make blockchain packets resistant to manipulation. The transitive hash function
    connects the sites where data alterations may occur. Transitivity is depicted
    in Fig. 3. Any modification to the data will influence the data’s hash function,
    which will subsequently affect the final hash because the hash function combines
    blocks. The hash references help ensure the accuracy of the census. The digital
    signature serves as the final block in the blockchain. The owner of the digital
    hand encrypts the data using the private key, which can only be decrypted with
    the corresponding public key. The verified person is liable for using the private
    key to subscribe to the data. Due to its decentralized nature, the blockchain
    can continue to function even if specific nodes are targeted or compromised. This
    resilience is one of the key advantages of blockchain technology [38]. Therefore,
    the proposed hybrid architecture uses Blockchain technology for secure communication
    between access point and destination to improve authentication. By creating an
    unreadable string whose length is controlled by the hashing algorithm in use,
    hashing is a technique for preventing data from being altered while being transmitted.
    Blockchain uses a hash function to encapsulate data in blocks of data. The average
    string is produced by the hash algorithms SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512,
    SHA-512/224, and SHA-512/256 regardless of the length of the input string. The
    genesis block, the very first block of data, is hashed using the SHA 256 hash
    function. This sample is then retained in the notebook and forwarded to the node.
    Following that, the process is repeated for the next user. Comparing the hashes
    of the present user and the prior user is the first phase in figuring out whether
    a second user’s data block can be verified. 3.5 Matching Verifying the authenticity
    of a user by comparing their provided image and password with the stored records
    in a database is a crucial step in the matching process. This task combines computer
    vision techniques and password verification methods to ensure accurate authentication.
    After applying the merging algorithm in reverse, which separates the image features
    from the password features, the next step involves comparing these features with
    the corresponding records in the database. The image features are compared using
    similarity measures to find the closest matches, while the encrypted password
    is compared using password verification techniques like salting to check for a
    match with the stored password. When both the image characteristics and password
    are successfully validated against the database records, the user is granted authentication.
    However, if there is a mismatch, the user may be denied access or asked to re-enter
    their credentials. This approach of associating an image and a password with a
    database is commonly employed in biometric authentication systems that incorporate
    both visual and textual identification factors. By combining the uniqueness of
    the user’s image with the confidentiality of their password, this new proposed
    approach adds an extra layer of security, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability
    of the authentication process. Figure 4 shows the comparison of the two images.
    Fig. 4 Comparison of the two images Full size image Algorithm 2 Illustrates the
    pseudo-code of the password comparison algorithm with the database Full size image
    The methodology employed in this research draws on the statistical methods chosen
    above for the present specific motivations. First, these methods are crucial for
    integrating and analyzing complex data structures, particularly in merging image
    and password features, necessitating specialized techniques for effective handling.
    Second, they play a pivotal role in enhancing system security, ensuring generated
    patterns exhibit the required randomness and uniqueness. Third, efficiency and
    resource management are paramount, justifying the inclusion of lightweight cryptography
    like Shift-AES for resource-constrained IoT networks. Additionally, statistical
    methods facilitate the integration of blockchain technology, which aligns with
    security objectives. They are also integral to user data validation and accurate
    pattern matching, ensuring reliability. Lastly, these methods emphasize the importance
    of transparency and reproducibility in research. Ultimately, method selection
    aligns closely with the research objective of improving authentication security
    and efficiency. 4 Results and discussion The data security approach presented
    comprises two distinct phases, each aligned with a specific objective based on
    the research goals. The initial phase, referred to as the identification phase,
    focuses on determining the essential conditions required for data operation. This
    phase is elaborated in the dedicated subsection titled “Identification step.”
    the second phase, known as the Development phase, it involves the creation of
    a secure framework for the verification system. This framework is based on a binary
    model recently discovered and detailed in the first phase, as described in the
    subsection titled “Development step”. 4.1 Identification step The method starts
    with the identification stage. This article explains record extraction for a new
    binary instance in data operations. In the second step, called development phase,
    a new security control architecture is built using the binary paradigm discussed
    above. The initial layer includes a new hybrid model based on password and image
    prediction to increase predictability. Password and image features are creatively
    combined to provide hybrid and random functionality. Figure 5 shows the access
    point process. Fig. 5 Identification stage Full size image 4.2 Access point This
    section presents the outcomes of the enrolment process for the first user and
    provides information about the data types involved at each stage of processing.
    The enrolment process begins from the user side, followed by data transmission,
    and concludes with processing on the node side. Enrolment on the access point
    side involves utilizing the user’s image and passwords. The research utilizes
    the Yale Face database and incorporates password functionality. The features are
    enhanced by incorporating one of the earliest fossil images. Subsequently, a double
    string is created based on these features. To achieve this, a hybrid pattern is
    formed by combining the user’s password features with image features (Fig. 6).
    Fig. 6 Image test Full size image 4.2.1 Datasets Yale Face database The Yale Face
    Database is one of the most commonly used face datasets in face recognition. It
    was constructed in the early 1990s by Yale University researchers [39]. This dataset
    was chosen because it has the most relevant data. This series carries 165 GIF
    pictures of him in 15 special themes (Subject01, Subject02, etc.). Each character
    has eleven images of her for every facial emotion or composition indexed below:
    normal, medium light, the right light, wink, with glasses, without glasses, left
    light, sad, sleeping, happy, and Shock (Fig. 7). Fig. 7 Yale Face dataset Full
    size image Password dataset A password dataset was created for five users, containing
    their passwords and emails. There is a set of password information in Table 2.
    Table 2 Password dataset Full size table 4.2.2 Creation of a hybrid pattern Given
    the properties of the image structure and the first user’s password, use the fusion
    system to arbitrarily combine the two properties. The hybrid mode pattern can
    also be used to construct a double string. The 34 bits of the pixel word make
    up this design, along with the characteristics of the animated image corresponding
    to the pixel size. The model consists of images and password features and contains
    the first protective sublayer. To ensure that the samples satisfy the randomness
    criterion, the two feature classes are also randomly combined (Fig. 8). Fig. 8
    Creating a hybrid model Full size image 4.2.3 Production of hash from the random
    pattern The SHA-256 algorithm is used in the proposed approach to generate a hybrid
    model hash. The SHA-256 algorithm should be used to create a 32-bit hash. This
    is because less data, regardless of the amount of input data, is created. Data
    integrity is ensured by utilizing hash functions, which is a benefit. Any modification
    or manipulation of the utility bill will modify the hash value and produce a different
    hash. The integrity of the secret data is thus achieved when the hash is matched
    in the node’s ledger, revealing this modification. 4.2.4 Encryption of the hybrid
    pattern using Shift-AES algorithm A security layer is added to the hybrid model
    using shift-AES encryption technology. Figure 9 describes the process of the new
    hybrid model as well as the location of the encryption algorithm. Subsequently,
    a validation of this process is presented. Fig. 9 Encrypt the hybrid model Full
    size image Validation of Shift-AES algorithm Evaluation studies will be conducted
    to verify the new approach with the image database. The security analysis performance
    of the new Shift-AES method is explained at several levels: visibility scene,
    histogram, entropy image, near-pixel correlation, and execution time comparison
    with other works. These different parameters constitute the statistical attack
    analysis. Visibility scene During the experiment, the standard images of the database
    with a size of 32 KB and a dimension (320 × 243) at the gray level will be used,
    along with a key size equal to 128 bits. The visual observation of the standard
    image in Code Block Chaining (CBC) mode in given by Fig. 10, which explains well
    that the proposed version of the Shift-AES algorithm used in the proposed hybrid
    architecture satisfies the visual scene requirement and make blurry images. Fig.
    10 Example of encryption of Image Full size image Histogram images Image histograms
    are crucial for statistical confidence assessment, and their purpose is to train
    you on image information, including distinguishing between darker and brighter
    images, or the degree of gradient from the most attractive elements in an image.
    For image security and anti-attack, the encrypted image map must be flat. Figure
    11 shows the histograms of the encoded and real images. So, the result proves
    the efficiency of the algorithm. Fig. 11 Histogram analysis of image. a Histogram
    original image, b Histogram encrypted image Full size image The entropy analysis
    The second analytical concept is entropy. It is the amount of calculation of random
    data, or the average uncertainty produced by each level of the input signal, as
    stated in Eq. 4. $$E=\\sum\\nolimits_{i=1}^{N}{X}_{i}\\left({log}2\\left({X}_{i}\\right)\\right)=\\sum\\nolimits_{i=1}^{N}{X}_{i}\\left({log}2\\left(1/{X}_{i}\\right)\\right)$$
    (4) If E is the entropy of the image in bits, X is the probability that intensity
    level i appears in the image, and N represents the total number of intensity levels
    of the image. According to the Eq. 4; to generate a single random distribution,
    the entropy of the gray code image should be 8. These results show how this method
    works and how useful it is for statistical attacks. Feedback is more accurate
    when Shift-AES is enabled for a period, and graphical results are more consistent
    (Table 3). Table 3 Entropy information in CBC cipher mode Full size table Correlation
    coefficient To locate shared data in the image, correlation coefficients of nearby
    pixels are computed. The standard image’s correlation coefficients must be closely

    run time All tweaks made for newer versions of AES are aimed at reducing execution
    time by changing complex math in MixColumn transformations with simple column
    shifts. This increases the lifetime of the sensor nodes and the entire network.
    Compare newer and HD image instances with different AES flavors with different
    encryption settings. The results of execution in seconds of HD images in Table
    4, show that the Shift-AES algorithm is faster than the standard AES algorithm
    and the paper [40]. Moreover, the standard database images used in the proposed
    architecture execute in a few milliseconds in CBC mode; where the execution time
    of the test image in Fig. 11 is equal to 1.451ms for encryption, while it is equal
    to 1.482 ms for decryption. Table 4 Comparison of execution time in seconds of
    different types of images (HD and standard) and different algorithms in CBC encryption
    mode Full size table In conclusion, loading and processing are complete at this
    point. A new stage of communication uses the Blockchain technology started to
    transmit the encrypted data from the access point to the node. 4.2.5 Transmission
    to the node side Firstly, the employment of blockchain technology is utilized
    to divide the data into blocks, and subsequently, the nodes are encrypted. The
    user pattern, starting from the access point device and extending to the node
    side, comprises an encrypted pattern alongside the hashes of both the current
    and previous users. In this chain, every subsequent user, except the first one,
    carries the information of the preceding user. Consequently, a sequential chain
    of data blocks is established, connecting the source to the destination (Fig.
    13). Fig. 13 Access point results Full size image 4.3 Development step The development
    phase involves the creation of a new security control framework based on the recently
    identified binary model defined in the first phase. The first step is usually
    to create a new hybrid modeling template to add randomness based on image and
    password attributes. A combination algorithm is proposed that combines passwords
    and image functions in a mixed and random order. Because securing data from leakage
    is a common issue with authentication systems, a full framework for verifying
    user identity is proposed at this stage. A new verification model is created.
    This new verification model is based on biometric recognition. In the new hybrid
    pattern, the user-defined the first level. Fig. 14 depicts the processing on the
    node side. Fig. 14 Development phase Full size image In the user verification
    process, the data blocks containing encrypted patterns and hash values play a
    crucial role. These blocks are transmitted from the enrollment device to the node
    side, where the verification occurs. The first step is to compare the hash value
    of user N + 1 with the stored hash of user N in the node’s database. This comparison
    ensures the consistency of subsequent user hashes with previous ones, enhancing
    the integrity of the verification process. To maintain transparency and tamper-resistance,
    each hash that reaches the node is recorded in the ledger. The ledger acts as
    an initial filter, validating the integrity of the received data and authenticating
    the user’s location. It serves as a secure repository for storing various user
    data, leveraging the robust protection mechanisms provided by blockchain technology.
    Any attempt to compromise the ledger would require gaining control over the majority
    (51%) of the network’s nodes, which is a highly challenging task. If the hash
    matching process yields positive results, indicating a match between the hashes,
    the verification process proceeds to the next stage. However, if the hash matching
    fails, indicating a discrepancy, the process is halted, and the user’s request
    is rejected. This ensures that only users with valid and consistent data are granted
    access or further processing, reinforcing the security and accuracy of the system.
    Afterwards, the hybrid pattern is decrypted using Shift-AES algorithm in reverse,
    resulting in the decrypted hybrid pattern. Subsequently, the reverse merge algorithm
    is applied to generate image and password features from the decrypted pattern.
    Finally, a matching process is executed to compare the image features extracted
    from the node database with those from the access point side, as well as the password
    features extracted from the node database with those from the access point side.
    This comparison determines whether the user is genuine or an imposter. 5 Validation
    and evaluation Data security is an important influencing factor that researchers
    grapple with. The method evaluates the proposed architecture to determine whether
    the research goals have been met. The motivation behind the testing is to determine
    whether the proposed method is suitable for the industry and whether obstacles
    can be avoided for its planned use. The proposed hybrid model may be suitable
    for applications such as. 1. Enterprise Systems and Network Security: Large organizations
    and businesses may implement the hybrid model for employee authentication and
    access control to sensitive systems and networks. Combining image and password
    authentication can strengthen security measures, especially for high-level access
    privileges. 2. Confidential Document Management Systems: Applications that handle
    confidential documents, such as legal or medical record management systems, may
    benefit from the hybrid model. It can help ensure that only authorized individuals
    with the correct credentials can access and modify sensitive information. Where
    the verification system uses sensor nodes equipped with camera to capture images
    outside. In addition, there are keyboard on the door to enter the password if
    someone wants to enter. In this section, the performance evaluation of the proposed
    approach is conducted using software implementation in Python Version 3.8.7. The
    experiments are executed on a machine equipped with an Intel(R) Core (TM) i7-4790
    CPU running at a speed of 3.60 GHz, and 8.00 GB of RAM (Table 5). Table 5 Comparison
    between proposed system and literature Full size table 5.1 Performance assessment
    of the proposed framework The evaluation of the proposed cancelable biometric
    schemes involves estimating the main and imposter distributions using the chosen
    evaluation metric. The performance of these schemes is assessed by calculating
    four key metrics: the false positive rate (FAR), the false negative rate (FRR),
    the error rate, and accuracy. The false positive rate (FAR) measures the probability
    of the biometric security system incorrectly accepting an access attempt by an
    unauthorized user. It indicates the system’s vulnerability to falsely recognizing
    unauthorized users as legitimate. $$FAR=\\frac{\\text{Number of successful authentications
    by impostors}}{\\text{Number of attempts at authentication by unauthorized users}}$$
    (8) The false negative rate (FRR) quantifies the likelihood of the biometric security
    system incorrectly rejecting an access attempt by an authorized user. It represents
    the system’s tendency to mistakenly identify authorized users as imposters. $$FRR=\\frac{\\text{Number
    of failed attempts at authentication by authorized}}{\\text{Number of attempts
    at authentication by genuine users}}$$ (9) The error rate is a metric that quantifies
    the proportion of misclassifications or incorrect predictions made by a classification
    or prediction model. It provides a measure of the model’s overall accuracy by
    considering both false positives and false negatives. $$Error \\ rate =1-Accruacy$$
    (10) In addition to these metrics, accuracy is also evaluated to assess the overall
    correctness of the biometric system’s classifications defined as follow: $$Accruacy=\\frac{\\text{T}\\text{P}+\\text{T}\\text{N}
    }{\\text{T}\\text{P}+\\text{F}\\text{N}+\\text{T}\\text{N}+\\text{F}\\text{P}
    }$$ (11) In this paper, the False Rejection Rate (FRR) is 0.992, which indicates
    the proportion of legitimate attempts that are incorrectly rejected by the system.
    On the other hand, the False Acceptance Rate (FAR) is 0.1, representing the rate
    at which the system incorrectly accepts unauthorized attempts. These rates are
    important measures of the system’s accuracy and reliability. With an impressive
    accuracy rate of 98.3%, the system’s performance is considered outstanding. This
    means that it correctly identifies and verifies users with a high degree of precision.
    The test level in this context refers to the process of applying the framework
    in a decentralized structure. It outlines how the system can be effectively utilized
    in a distributed network, where multiple nodes or entities are involved in the
    authentication process. The mentioned research is compared to a recommended approach
    that involves a suitable biometric image framework. This comparison highlights
    that the suggested approach incorporates several significant modifications. These
    modifications could encompass improvements in algorithms, data preprocessing techniques,
    feature extraction methods, or other aspects to enhance the accuracy, efficiency,
    or security of the biometric system using image-based data (Table 6). Table 6
    Comparison between proposed system and Mohsin method Full size table 5.2 Benchmark
    checklist The preceding parts describe the evaluation process. Each stage identifies
    and emphasizes issues that must be addressed with more attention when validating
    the security of a biometric image. These issues are highlighted and related to
    the stages of assessment and their relationships. These issues are established
    as a reference point for control comparisons that show the relationship between
    the sub-steps of the assessment and the related problems. Three essential components
    to recall while growing a biometric image authentication gadget are accessibility,
    privacy, and integrity. In the primary and the second steps, you may locate associated
    objects inside the checklist. According to the literature studies, that is the
    maximum essential studies associated with the image biometric protection era,
    so this study is taken into consideration as a reference model. Instead, this
    comparative painting is applied to examine the cautioned steady biometric framework
    era for snapshots primarily based totally on sure essential components. A contrast
    between the questionnaires for this painting and Table 7 indicates the Comparison
    between the proposed system and other state-of-the-art approaches in the literature.
    Table 7 Comparison between the proposed system and other state-of-the-art approaches
    in the literature Full size table Table 7 provides a comprehensive comparison
    of benchmarking points between the proposed approach and the benchmark method
    in detail. As shown in the table, the proposed and benchmark approaches effectively
    solve four frequent issues: hybrid and randomisation pattern, pattern cancellability,
    pattern unreadability, and secrecy. However, as shown in the preceding table,
    the benchmark approach has limited support for hybrid and randomisation, as well
    as confidentiality problems. Although the proposed method demonstrates superior
    performance compared to other approaches, it is essential to acknowledge its limitations,
    specifically in relation to the False Acceptance Rate (FAR). The FAR measures
    the probability of incorrectly accepting an unauthorized user, highlighting the
    system’s vulnerability to impostors. Despite the method’s high accuracy, there
    is still a possibility of false acceptances, underscoring the need for further
    improvements to enhance the system’s security and reliability. 6 Conclusion This
    paper has introduced a robust user authentication framework designed to secure
    the transmission of user data from access points to nodes. The method comprises
    two phases; the identification phase, wherein a hybrid pattern is generated by
    combining image and password features and applies SHA-256 hashing and Shift-AES
    for data integrity and security. Blockchain technology is used for secure communication.
    The subsequent development phase reverses this process to facilitate the comparison
    of extracted features with those stored in the database. The proposed approach
    effectively addresses concerns related to the potential leakage of pattern information,
    enhancing overall security. It ensures the safeguarding of image and password
    data not only within the user enrollment device and node database but also during
    data transmission. Additionally, this method resolves issues like pattern randomization
    and user location authentication, making it adaptable across diverse fields. Experimental
    results validate the efficiency and security of the approach, outperforming benchmarks
    in execution time while achieving an impressive accuracy rate of 98.3%. With a
    False Rejection Rate (FRR) of 0.992 and a low False Acceptance Rate (FAR) of 0.1,
    the method demonstrates its resilience during data transmission between access
    points and node databases, rendering it highly suitable for Internet of Things
    networks. Looking ahead, future work will concentrate on further optimizing the
    algorithm, with a specific focus on minimizing the FAR and bolstering security.
    The incorporation of three user information sources - face image, password, and
    Iris Print - is planned to enhance the method’s integrity. Additionally, the intention
    is to validate the approach on hardware through an FPGA platform, ensuring its
    practical applicability. Data availability The data that has been used is confidential.

    (ML) is nowadays a broad field with numerous research directions, opportunities,
    and limitless challenges. A wide range of ML techniques have been developed in
    modern research and one of the main challenges is the implementation of these
    techniques in areas where handling of sensitive data is of essential interest.
    As a characteristic example, we can mention the utilization of such techniques
    in the processing of very sensitive medical data. Privacy preservation and security
    of such data is essential and strictly guarded by numerous agreements and legal
    documents such as the General Data Protection Agreement (GDPR). Accordingly, new
    techniques have emerged which aim to protect the integrity of such sensitive data
    while also capitalizing on the knowledge hidden within this data. One of the ML
    approaches which nowadays is getting more and more popular and applicable in a
    wide range of domains, especially in highly distributed environments, is Federated
    Learning (FL). Known as decentralized machine learning, its main goal is to have
    each data center (edge node i.e. client) train local models on its local data.
    After this step, all of the trained models at different edge nodes are aggregated
    and combined somehow, either by collecting them at a central location (cloud i.e.,
    server), or in a way that all of the edge nodes communicate their local models
    between them directly. In this paper we give a brief overview of applications
    of FL in several important domains. Several insightful papers are grouped together
    according to the topics they cover. Also, we cover research on the utilization
    of FL in specific areas, different approaches and experimental evaluations of
    these techniques, and challenges which FL faces. We considered papers published
    after 2020. A simple methodological approach was applied based on the use of different
    keywords containing federated learning and searching within Google Scholar. The
    paper is organized as follows. In the second Section different approaches of FL
    implementation are presented. The third Section is devoted to the main challenges
    necessary to be solved when FL is employed in distributed environments. The fourth
    Section briefly presents several characteristic domains where FL approaches are
    natural solutions. Concluding remarks are given in the final section. 2 Different
    Approaches to Federated Learning Federated learning is a form of decentralized
    learning where multiple clients work collaboratively with the main goal to train
    a global machine learning model without sharing their data. The reasons for such
    a style of processing data collected at the edge usually are oriented towards
    the reduction of the overhead cost of communication between edges and cloud or
    preservation of data privacy [13]. It is a powerful technique which attracts a
    lot of research and application interest in industry and academia. Application
    of FL depends on different circumstances, like high number of existing data centers,
    specific data distribution, great amount of data available at each center, orchestration
    method and so on. Depending on the mentioned characteristics, FL may take on many
    forms, with each form introducing different challenges like communication efficiency,
    security and protection against a variety of attacks, privacy protection, etc.
    From the first attempts mentioned in [19], the approach has significantly evolved
    and nowadays covers a broader scope of use cases. It exceeds the standard supervised
    edge learning orchestrated by a central server and moved away from supervised
    learning all together [5]. An interesting approach is the creation of personalized
    federated models [6, 28, 33] which are able to better support clients with different
    data distributions, developing new algorithms [2, 10] and moving away from standard
    Federated Averaging [19]. The implementation of innovative FL algorithms may greatly
    benefit institutions where privacy preservation is crucial, like financial and
    medical sectors. Additionally, symbiosis with other modern approaches and technologies
    like digital twins may also push wider use of FL into fields such as agriculture,
    epidemiology and modeling the spread of diseases in urban areas. Federated learning
    was first envisioned as a technique for coordinating edge devices in training
    ML models by a central server [19]. After that the approach has been quickly spread
    from the initial focus on edge and mobile devices and was broadened in order to
    encompass these new use cases. The terms “cross-silo” and “cross-device” federated
    learning were coined in [13] and cover two general settings. In the first case,
    focus is on applications with a relatively small number of reliable clients (like
    hospitals or banks). In the second case, focus is on initially envisioned applications,
    i.e. on the standard edge device setting. In this case applications can easily
    have hundreds of thousands or even millions of edge nodes. Most research and implementations
    of FL imply having a central entity coordinating the learning process. However,
    there are some concerns regarding this approach. The minor concerns include favoritism
    when updating global models, which can have as a consequence that some edge nodes
    show better performance, while others show significantly worse ones. However,
    this issue can be alleviated by modifying the standard approach with techniques
    known as personalized federated learning [2, 6, 33]. More dangerous concerns regarding
    centralized FL include unsafe or even malicious central servers which may cause
    data leaks. This problematic situation in centralized coordination of FL has led
    to some research fully oriented on decentralized methods. Some of them rely on
    peer-to-peer communication [27], while others are oriented to contemporary approaches
    such as blockchain [17]. Depending on the orchestration method applied, we can
    distinguish: Centralized FL – The learning process is coordinated by a central
    server. The server takes care of orchestration and synchronization of the learning
    processes at each edge node. It is responsible for selecting a subset of edge
    nodes and having them iteratively or concurrently update the global model [13,
    31]. Fully decentralized FL – The central authority which dictates when and how
    training of a particular model should be performed is missing. In such situations,
    certain edge nodes could communicate peer-to-peer with other edge nodes in its
    vicinity to exchange model updates [27]. Also, a blockchain approach may be applied
    to verify and keep track of updates to a certain global model [7, 17]. Depending
    on the number of edge nodes (clients) participating in federated learning, we
    recognize the following cases [13]: Cross-device FL – In this case, the focus
    is on mobile and IoT devices and the number of participating edge nodes can be
    even millions. Having in mind such a large number of edge nodes, a centralized
    server must select a subset of edge devices to perform one round of federated
    updates. Edge nodes can be seen here as unreliable, since limited computing resources
    or network issues may cause significant latency or even a complete failure during
    the training process. Cross-silo FL – In this case, tens or hundreds of edge nodes
    are participating. In a federated environment, it is necessary to have larger
    data centers like banks or hospitals, which are generally more reliable than edge
    IoT devices. With a smaller number of edge nodes, it is not needed to select subsets
    of edge nodes to participate in the training process. In both scenarios, the central
    server organizes the training process i.e., the order in which the edge nodes
    submit their model updates to the server. Several strategies are considered in
    literature [31]: Concurrent FL – In this case, all participating edge nodes carry
    out a single federated learning step (usually it is one epoch of training). The
    server waits for all edge nodes to submit their updates and after that it aggregates
    all updates using some algorithm for federated averaging [13, 23]. In the cross-silo
    setting where clients are reliable, synchronization is rather straightforward.
    In cross-device FL, edge device failure and/or network instability must be considered.
    However, there are some solutions like: implementing a timeout to eliminate devices
    which take too long to respond to model updates, or some novel approaches which
    support asynchronous or semi-asynchronous updates to global models [3, 5]. Incremental
    FL – The server arranges N edge nodes in a queue, \\(E_1...E_n\\). Following the
    specified order, clients update the global model by running local training on
    the global model using available local training datasets \\(D_i\\). After successful
    local training, the updated model \\(M_i\\) is submitted to the server. The main
    drawback of this approach is possible loss of knowledge. In fact, when edge node
    \\(E_{i+1}\\) updates the global model, the performance of the newly updated model
    can significantly drop on the validation set of the previous edge node \\(E_i\\).
    Cyclic-incremental FL – This approach is oriented towards tackling the problem
    of knowledge loss in the previous approach [31]. The idea is to eliminate waiting
    until each edge node \\(E_i\\) runs an entire round of training (sometimes it
    can include hundreds of epochs). So, the queue is transformed into a circular
    list where edge nodes \\(E_1...E_n\\) update the model for one epoch each. After
    the last node finishes its update round, node \\(E_1\\) again initializes the
    update process. In such a manner, each edge node at each step makes slight adjustments
    to the global model. In spite of the fact that both mentioned approaches have
    their own unique problems, there are some common issues. Data distribution is
    an important issue which includes two problems: the number of data points at each
    edge node and the statistical distribution from which data points were drawn.
    Federated learning cannot make any assumptions about the statistical distribution
    of data points, which causes clients which have access to more data usually have
    a greater representation of the global dataset. Local models that are trained
    on small datasets are prone to overfitting and usually show low performance on
    new data instances. As a consequence, for smaller clients the incentive is clear
    – to gain access to better models. However, incentive seems to be lost for edge
    nodes which have bigger datasets. Again, some new methods have been developed
    to solve such problems, like personalized federated learning [6, 33] and meta
    learning [12]. Furthermore, apart from considering data partitioning in federated
    environments, it is necessary to also consider feature sets [13, 36]. Based on
    this criterion, we can distinguish two forms of FL. Horizontal federated learning
    assumes that all clients have access to the same feature set. In Vertical federated
    learning different clients can collect different features for the same instance.
    Finally, for FL could be considered different institutions which can have different
    feature sets, but also different sample spaces. In this case, we have a new FL
    paradigm called federated transfer learning. Federated learning is mostly based
    on supervised learning and availability of labeled data. However, often [3] the
    realistic scenarios are that for different reasons data is partially labeled or
    not labeled. Different approaches such as semi-supervised learning could help
    to consider a variety of problems and domains which could be successfully solved
    by FL. In fact, using a small amount of labeled data, it is possible to create
    pseudo-labelled datasets which can be used to optimize these models. A typical
    scenario could be that a central server can have a small amount of labeled data,
    while the clients have unlabeled data. Some authors [3, 5] proposed semi-supervised
    learning to FL, and thus expand its reach while achieving promising results. 3
    Challenges that Federated Learning Brings Federated learning is branching out
    in numerous directions and opens new and challenging issues in contemporary scientific
    research and industrial applications. Generally, interesting aspects are consideration
    of the number of participating clients, the data distribution, machine learning
    tasks, orchestration methods and strategies, etc. However, some challenges are
    specific to certain setups, while others are common across multiple federated
    scenarios. Some of the characteristic challenges will be briefly discussed in
    the rest of the section. 3.1 Privacy Privacy preservation of sensitive data located
    at clients was originally a driving factor for conceptualizing this approach.
    FL naturally seems to protect the data since it does not require data to leave
    the edge. Initially, the two-way client-server communication which only exchanges
    information of updated model weights was considered safe. However, it has since
    been argued that these weight updates carry hidden information of the dataset
    from which they were created. This phenomenon is known as deep leakage or feature
    leakage from gradients [20, 38]. An untrustworthy party may be able to reconstruct
    the initial dataset based on a certain edge node’s weight updates [20]. This is
    an unintended security vulnerability which threatens the core assumptions of standard
    federated learning. Being aware of such security vulnerabilities, some solutions
    have been proposed. Different methods developed under the umbrella of Differential
    privacy (DP) can be reliable in solving the mentioned problems. DP encompasses
    methods for anonymizing datasets and altering them in such a way to make it harder
    for attackers to infer which individual or instance features from the dataset
    belong to. DP methods are particularly effective in FL as the original data cannot
    be reconstructed since the updates were a result of training on modified data.
    A negative aspect of this approach is the possibility of lowering the performance
    of the models being trained on real data [37]. When applying DP to FL tasks, it
    is often necessary to conduct prior tests to consider possible effects of varying
    amounts of augmentation on the performance of ML models [8, 20]. Another contemporary
    approach for security and privacy preservation of sensitive data which helps in
    reducing the negative effects of feature leakages is Homomorphic encryption (HE).
    Similarly, like the DP approach, HE is an umbrella term that incorporates different
    methods and techniques that allow users to perform operations and computations
    on encrypted data. When results are achieved and sent to the origin and decrypted,
    the results are the same as the results obtained from applying the same computations
    on unencrypted data. In [8] authors demonstrated the use of HE in fully decentralized
    federated learning. In this approach, edge nodes encrypt the model updates generated
    through local training. After that, they share the encrypted gradients with neighboring
    edge nodes. Other, less effective and less advantageous methods include sharing
    fewer gradients with the server or other collaborating clients or dimensionality
    reduction of the data [20]. Privacy also extends to trust issues in client-server
    settings and clients willing to collaborate and share knowledge must apply some
    form of defense mechanism. The differential privacy and homomorphic encryption
    techniques are often applied in practice [20, 37]. In cases where clients cannot
    fully trust servers, a fully decentralized (i.e., serverless) approach offers
    an alternative. Decentralized approaches can rely on empowering technologies like
    blockchain [7, 17] or they can be entirely peer-to-peer and have a more torrent-like
    approach [27]. On the other hand, what to do in situations when servers also cannot
    fully trust edge nodes. Model poisoning [5, 30] is a form of attack on the global
    federated models where clients send damaging updates to the FL coordinator with
    the intention of disrupting the convergence of the global model. Model poisoning
    is a general term describing updates which disrupt the training process and slow
    down or even completely sabotage model convergence. This attack is quite hard
    to counter in federated environments since the server does not have access to
    original training data [5]. Furthermore, there is a question of identifying truly
    malicious training participants from those who simply do not have quality data
    [15]. Privacy can also be enhanced through split learning [10, 13], which is an
    approach where learning starts at the edge and finishes in the cloud. Basically,
    the “head” of a deep neural network is located at the server while the other half,
    which handles input of data, is located at the client side. In this case, the
    training of a single model is done by both the client and the server. 3.2 Personalization
    Federated learning supports creating a global model which can generalize well
    on the entirety of the global dataset, but it is affected by data distribution
    between clients. Generally, it is expected that in the typical FL setting based
    on the federated averaging algorithm, clients with less data available will contribute
    less to the quality and reliability of the overall model. Consequently, their
    datasets will be less represented in the global model and local models will be
    more accurate than the global federated model. Some proposals to solve this problem
    are reported in different papers [5, 12, 15, 16] and we will present them briefly
    in the rest of the section. A widely accepted solution to the mentioned problem
    is known as Federated transfer learning [15]. First activity is that edge nodes
    collaborate in training global models. After that step edge nodes download the
    global model and start with transfer learning locally i.e., fine-tuning of the
    global model is performed on their local data distribution. The second possible
    solution is based on fair resource allocation in a federated learning environment
    [16]. After each iteration of federated updates, the resulting global model would
    be validated by all participating clients. The essence of this approach is: when
    some clients notice poorer performance of the model, the server could shift training
    in their favor, assigning higher significance to their weight updates of the global
    model. The possible negative aspect of such a solution is increasing the risk
    of being vulnerable to model poisoning attacks [5]. As a solution to achieve better
    performing models for certain edge nodes that have specific data distributions,
    personalized federated learning (PFL) has been proposed. Contrary to local ML
    where for each of the N edge nodes a different model exists in traditional FL
    a single global model which would ideally generalize well on all edge nodes is
    created. Personalized federated learning goes in a slightly different direction
    where multiple global models are created, each one best suited for a subset of
    edge nodes. To achieve better performance of models, a kind of prior clustering
    of edge nodes is welcomed [1, 2, 28, 33, 34]. It has been stated in [34] that
    it is expected that cluster specific models converge significantly faster [34]
    compared to models trained without clustering. An additional advantage is that
    numerous clients with small datasets which are not able to train their own useful
    models can use reliable global models [1]. 3.3 Communication Latency In the majority
    of cases in FL environments, almost all computationally intensive work is put
    on the edge. Since edge nodes can be IoT devices without enough computational
    power, local model optimization may take an unacceptable long time. It is especially
    problematic when clients with low computing power may have larger datasets and
    need longer time to train models. If these updates get disregarded by the coordinating
    server, computation power at the edge device is wasted. To solve the problem,
    different approaches to introduce asynchronous federated learning protocols are
    reported [4, 35]. Real world settings also often have data arriving in streams,
    as it is collected. Online learning presented in [4] handles data arriving in
    streams and was coupled with asynchronous FL. 3.4 Other Challenges Certain critical
    systems that include IoT settings which are massively distributed have very high
    accuracy requirements. In [32], short term electrical load forecasting of households
    is pointed out as a problem which could be tackled with FL, as it requires privacy
    protection. The prediction of electrical usage requires high accuracy, which is
    why personalized federated learning methods such as clustered aggregation must
    be implemented [34]. One among several bottlenecks for FL is communication efficiency
    [4, 9, 15, 21] as the number of participating edge devices in each round can be
    quite high. It is very important to solve the communication overhead issue. Asynchronous
    FL [35] presents an acceptable communication cost. However, better approaches
    like extending local training done at the edge [5] have successfully decreased
    the number of transmitted messages between the client and server. The essence
    of this approach is that the server lets clients run multiple epochs before submitting
    their updates instead of having each edge node run only one epoch of training.
    Another approach is presented in [37] where federated learning is considered from
    the perspective of the client. The authors considered the question of what incentive
    clients have to participate in FL. Clients which have big datasets may not benefit
    much from FL as it can happen that the global model has worse performance than
    their local model. On the contrary, clients which have small datasets can have
    more benefits from this approach. However, a classical drawback is that local
    models are prone to overfitting and lose the ability to generalize effectively
    [31, 33]. 4 Application of Federated Learning to Different Domains Federated learning
    faces many challenges and open questions, attracting the research community. It
    has a lot of possibilities to be applied in different domains in academia and
    industry. Contemporary FL applications are predominantly in domains where the
    focus is on IoT and security and privacy preserving datasets like medicine, banking
    and similar domains. The use of FL in medicine is a kind of guarantee of providing
    a high level of security and privacy [11, 29]. The approach based on tensor factorization
    and federated models is presented in [14]. To protect the privacy of involved
    patients and under the assumption that a federated server can only be semi-trusted
    only summarized information is transferred to the cloud. Also, different federated
    orchestration strategies are evaluated [31] and it has been shown that FL can
    achieve results in medicine that are comparable with results obtained by centralized
    learning methods. Patients’ privacy is achieved through application of different
    methods among which differential privacy is dominant. Unification of FL with some
    other contemporary technologies (like digital twins) is considered in [24] where
    it helps to reduce the spread of infectious diseases [24]. By modeling cities
    and simulating certain responses to the spread of disease, it could be possible
    to reduce its negative effect. Also, the cold start problem was pointed out once
    a disease first emerges in some environment. The Internet of Things can also have
    great benefits from applying FL to some workflows. One among the biggest concerns
    in this area is communication overhead because of the numerous devices participating
    in the process. High accuracy is needed for tasks like electrical load forecasting
    [32] which need to be aided by personalization methods such as in [34] or methods
    which are proposed in [1, 2]. Some advantages of implementations of fully decentralized
    FL based on blockchain and development of several advanced approaches are presented
    in [7]. In the presented solution, specific care is taken of problems like edge
    node authentication. However, additional work is necessary on compressing these
    models to reduce communication costs and on incentive mechanisms to encourage
    clients to join the FL process. Federated learning may soon find itself utilized
    in telecommunication. New 5G and 6G networks and telecommunication architectures
    [22] embed intelligence at the network level. The intelligent O-RAN architecture
    would see this intelligence optimize resource allocation and various other tasks
    at the edge [22, 25]. This new architecture would be fully virtualized and would
    be able to run real-time, near real-time or non-real-time applications, which
    would more often than not involve utilization of machine learning models [25].
    According to [21], decentralized ML offers support to reduce energy consumption
    and network bandwidth. One very interesting and challenging area where applications
    of intelligent techniques are rapidly increasing is agriculture. The knowledge
    and experience gained in using intelligent techniques in industrial settings are
    excellent starting points for their application to food production. Factories
    have already experienced great benefits from IoT integrations which involve the
    use of digital twins to help facilitate their processes. This can be carried over
    to agriculture where the use of digital twins may help in modeling and simulating
    fields and the effect of various parameters on crop yield [26]. As symbiosis of
    FL and digital twins is already applied [24], it can be expected that soon similar
    implementations in agriculture will bring significant benefits. Banking and finance
    also have various challenges which slow down the integration of ML systems. However,
    federated learning may provide better solutions and answers [18] to some of these
    blocking issues which could pave the way for future successful integration into
    such systems. 5 Conclusion and Future Challenges The intention of this brief literature
    review was to focus on the latest research of FL in order to identify the latest
    research developments, future research directions, challenges, and open problems
    in this area. Federated learning as a new, powerful distributed intelligent paradigm
    can take on various forms in order to fit a diverse set of problems in numerous
    domains, economy and the industrial sector. Based on presented research results,
    numerous opportunities for future work can be identified. Some notable issues
    which have emerged are connected to communication costs and performance of federated
    models trained by different algorithms and strategies. Communication costs have
    a significant impact on the real-world application of FL and it could be interesting
    to determine the relationship between model performance and communication cost.
    It is also viable to research other techniques which could reduce the overhead
    of communication, other than extending model training at the edge by some fixed
    number of epochs. Although numerous experimental evaluations have been done to
    compare the performance of federated models trained by different algorithms, there
    is little research done on the influence of the federated orchestration strategy
    on the performance of models. For successful evaluation, it is necessary to work
    with variations in dataset sizes available at the edge and the sequence in which
    institutions make updates. References Armacki, A., Bajovic, D., Jakovetic, D.,

    can be transmitted over global networks thanks to the Internet of Things (IoT)
    which is based on the architecture for Internet. It has an impact on security
    and privacy, which is a problem in many contexts. To guarantee the resistance
    of architecture to attacks, data authentication, access control and client privacy,
    procedures must be put in place. The ideal way to develop an appropriate legal
    framework that takes into consideration the underlying technology is through an
    international legislator, supported by the private sector in accordance with particular
    needs, and therefore easily adaptable. The right to information, regulations on
    IT security legislation, measures encouraging the use of IoT technologies, provisions
    limiting or regulating their use and the creation of a task force. According to
    Weber [1], all relevant legislation must take into account the legal issues raised
    by the IoT. Smart cities as well as smart homes are only two examples out of many
    applications and services that the IoT offers. IoT smart things collaborate with
    other elements, like proxies and mobile phones, to deliver new and improved services.
    User privacy is becoming increasingly important in the IoT context, and as more
    devices are connecting to the Internet each day, there is a requirement for security
    solutions. Any security design must take into account the three main security
    needs, also known as CIA: Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability. Only the
    designated user is allowed to read the message due to confidentiality. Integrity
    ensures that the sent information gets its target without modification, and availability
    ensures that each service or piece of data is accessible to the user at any time.
    The most significant danger to the availability of business networks, products
    and services is DoS/DDoS. The majority of DoS/DDoS attacks can now be defended
    against by modern security systems, as described by Malliga et al. [2]. 2 Research
    Methodology This work has been carried out using the following methodology. We
    have looked through IoT security literature to assess the threats taxonomy and
    issues associated with IoT security. In order to find pertinent survey articles,
    the terms IoT and security were searched for in multiple published databases,
    including ACM, IEEE, Elsevier, Springer and MDPI. Following the completion of
    these taxonomies, the authors evaluated the various techniques that were presented
    in those surveys and chose a set of relevant topics that they genuinely think
    are crucial for network security. These topics were chosen based on our own expertise
    in the security domain. We have also looked for papers that have presented different
    solutions that were well known in this field. Finally, we have searched the Internet
    for intriguing security-related items using search engines. 2.1 Assessment of
    Research Content. Finding original reviews of intrusion detection systems as well
    as gathering all relevant publications required an objective search strategy.
    The search process should be as complete as well as logical as it is possible
    to be and search terms need to be provided. We have found that the title of a
    few works on anomaly-based intrusion detection includes the word ‘intrusion’.
    Therefore, in order to include publications on anomaly-based intrusion detection,
    we have defined the search termed ‘network intrusion detection’. 2.2 Research
    Questions In order to direct our research, we came up with particular research
    questions (RQs) and include in-depth sub-questions. The gist of the entire scenario
    can be seen according to these 8 questions that were raised in the entire course
    of study: (a) What issues are addressed by intrusion detection methods? (b) How
    do the literatures split up between the various fields? (c) Why is this distribution
    the way it is? (d) How does research in these areas vary from nation to nation?
    (e) What are the typical data preparation procedures employed in network intrusion
    detection? (f) What technical properties do the pre-processing technologies have
    and how are they implemented? (g) How are their applications for intrusion detection
    distributed? (h) Which models are used in intrusion detection techniques? 3 Literature
    Review Maselli et al. [3] present HyBloSE, a solution that can secure smart buildings
    even if the cloud management system is attacked. Their strategy is based on a
    Moving Window Blockchain and Delegated Proof of Authority consensus. It decouples
    security from IoT application logic, allowing centralized logic to be saved while
    security management is distributed and it solves these restrictions, particularly
    in terms of practicality. It can run on low-power devices and does not require
    any additional hardware. The results show that it has a small overhead (below
    0.4 ms), making it fully compatible with existing hardware. Data security and
    privacy issues with regard to cloud-based smart city technology have been examined
    by Khan et al. [4] in their work. Their approach examines security from many stakeholders’
    points of view and recommends end-to-end security for applications building smart
    cities that make use of open data and encourage citizen participation. They have
    offered a framework to solve challenges with data security, privacy as well as
    trust. In the smart city scenario, such a framework would be useful for providing
    inhabitants with safe, context-sensitive information services. With encouraging
    results, the security verification software is used to assess the authentication
    element of the proposed architecture against potential threats. Other parts of
    the suggested architecture are now being developed and tested as part of future
    work, including the secure communication protocol. IoT security is a topic that
    both academia and business are currently paying significant attention to. Existing
    security methods are not always suited for IoT due to high energy consumption
    and computational complexity, Dorri et al. [5] have proposed the mechanism which
    uses the Bitcoin BC, which is an immutable record of blocks, to overcome these
    issues. A smart home was used in the case study to illustrate the concept. The
    various components of the smart home layer were detailed in this study, as well
    as the various transactions and procedures involved with it. They have also provided
    a comprehensive examination of its security and privacy. The overheads caused
    by their strategy are moderate and reasonable for low-resistance IoT devices,
    according to the simulation results. In this study, Waheed et al. [6] analysed
    the most recent IoT worries and divided them into two categories: security and
    privacy. In their work, the results, attack types, impact layer and possible solutions
    were briefly discussed. In order to fill in any possible gaps, a complete overview
    of the most recent methodology of the research on IoT security and privacy by
    the means of ML algorithms as well as BC technologies was provided. A modern IoT
    security and privacy techniques that integrate ML algorithms with BC methodologies
    have been evaluated in this paper. In an effort to comprehend the security as
    well as privacy concerns in an ML, they have proposed an idea to exhibit an ML
    security plan for IoT based on prior studies. A complete picture of an IoT system
    that needs an object, cloud, as well as controller is provided by Ling et al.
    [7] in their publication. For such a system, ten core functions have been identified.
    According to the risk analysis of various IoT system components, these capabilities
    need to be properly secured. They have then shown how they had exploited an IP
    camera system to find three attacks: device scanning, brute force and device spoofing.
    All of these could completely take control of all IP cameras made by the manufacturer.
    They have tested the attacks in the real world and found that, regardless of the
    password, a device spoofing attack has a 98% chance of recovering a user''s password.
    Shakarami et al. [8] proposed a method for a smart home-based IoT ecosystem, the
    study provides an architecture-oriented enforcement of access the administration.
    The system is decentralized, auditable and dependable since it is built on the
    Ethereum blockchain. Although their implementation outcomes are encouraging and
    the use of blockchain for operational access control is unpromising, an administrative
    model can be benefitted from its advantages. For blockchain technology, one of
    the properties and limitations has also been discussed. The phrases ‘data owners’
    as well as ‘data consumers’ were used by Barhamgi et al. [9] to describe users
    of cyber-physical processes who produce data through communicating with them (for
    example, residents of smart homes, patients being monitored, etc.) and stakeholders
    who are seeking to collect and utilizing the data produced, including electricity
    companies in smart grids, healthcare providers in smart health care networks,
    government agencies and so forth. In this work, they outline an ongoing endeavour
    to enable smart cyber-physical system users to independently protect their privacy.
    Although security procedures and regulations for IoT-based smart environments
    differ greatly from those utilized in non-IoT domains, Karie et al. [10] concur
    that it is now necessary to follow suitable security standards and look into the
    possibilities for these environments. This is supported by the idea that the secured
    design for IoT-based smart environments depends on a wide variety of security
    checks, many of which may not be directly addressed by the present security standards,
    such as the effective identification approaches described in this study. Due to
    these issues, the security of IoT-based smart environments is also most likely
    to be difficult to create, implement, enforce as well as administer, and is largely
    determined by installations and settings made by usually inexperienced staff members.
    Due to the numerous documented issues with IoT-based smart environments, different
    parties have made their efforts to address specific issues. On the other hand,
    the contribution in this work is a remarkable effort based on an architecture
    of challenges for IoT-based smart settings and a review of the literature. The
    taxonomy can only be applied to the data that the authors of this study have examined.
    However, as can be seen in Fig. 1, the taxonomy was developed with the primary
    challenges related to IoT-based smart settings in mind. It is also important to
    note that the concerns discovered and detailed in this study are by no means exhaustive.
    Fig. 1 Various aspects of IoT-based smart environment Full size image According
    to Kulyk et al. [11], smart environments have become more prevalent despite a
    number of possible security and privacy hazards. But are people aware of the implications
    of embracing smart environments? They performed a survey with 575 people from
    three countries to answer the research topic about smart homes and healthy environments
    (Germany, Spain and Romania). Less than half of respondents voiced at least one
    privacy or security worry, with German participants doing so significantly more
    often than Spanish participants, while Spanish participants noticeably more frequently
    as Romanian participants. The majority of abstract concern responses mentioned
    the danger of a cyber-attack, while German participants’ key concerns were privacy
    and data security. The majority of abstract concern responses mentioned the danger
    of a cyber-attack, while German participants’ key concerns were privacy and data
    security. The majority of participants who reported receiving a threat also voiced
    privacy worries, such as being observed or spied on in their own home, having
    information on them collected, or having such information revealed to or provided
    to another person. The majority of participants who reported receiving a threat
    also indicated privacy concerns, such as being observed or overheard in their
    own homes, having information about them collected or having such information
    made public or transferred to another person. Big data as well as IoT-based applications
    involved in making the smart environments are discussed in Hijaji et al. [12].
    In these sectors, the goal is to detect the significant application domains, current
    trends, data architectures and ongoing issues. As per their understanding, this
    is the first literature review of its own kind, examining the literature published
    in peer-reviewed journals between 2014 and 2022, using a feature-step selection
    procedure of identification, screening, eligibility and inclusion. A systematic
    review was done for investigating these records in which six primary research
    questions were answered. The results provide new opportunities for real-world
    smart input signals that monitor, safeguard and enhance natural resources when
    big data with IoT technologies are combined. Among the topics covered in this
    survey are smart metering, smart disaster alerts, smart farming and agriculture
    and smart environment monitoring. We conclude by reviewing the most popular big
    data and IoT approaches, which will hopefully serve as the basis for future research
    on smart cities and their environments. Salim et al. [13]’s explanation of the
    reasons and factors that lead attackers to select new IoT targets for DDoS attacks.
    There are many tools available for creating botnets out of IoT devices, and additional
    tools are being looked into for using IoT bots to conduct DDoS attacks. They investigated
    the hacking and usage of IoT devices as bots, the classification of DDoS assaults
    on the IoT environment and they created a clear and systematic categorization
    of various cloud-based DDoS attack types. They also investigated and gave a complete
    study of twenty-one state-of-the-art defence techniques for preventing, detecting,
    as well as reducing DDoS attacks in the academic literature from the past and
    the present. This survey contributes to a full understanding of the many attack
    types that can be conducted using specific technologies and explains how to defend,
    for example, in order to recognize, halt or mitigate attacks. DDoS (Distributed
    Denial of Service) attacks, that primarily target a web server, pose serious risks
    to data centre applications, according to Singh et al. [34]. The requirements
    of application layer attacks and Flash Events (FE) have not yet been met by the
    various methods for detecting and mitigating such attacks. The goal of this study
    is to recognize application layer DDoS attacks as well as distinguish them apart
    from FE. They have investigated a DDoS attack model and identified the incoming
    packet characteristics which signify the beginning of the attack. Based on the
    type of the attack, they have examined the statistical aspects of arriving packets
    like inter-arrival time, the probability that an IP address will remain unique
    over time and the lack of HTTP GET requests. The fuzzy classification model receives
    these variables as input. To offer an optimal variation for the input parameters,
    we applied the Genetic Algorithm (GA).To identify whether web-accessing clients
    are behaving in an attack, normal or FE fashion, fuzzy logic has been used to
    the optimized values. According to their findings, the Fuzzy-GA model accurately
    detects DDoS attacks with a 98.4% accuracy rate and FE with a 97.3% accuracy rate.
    The effect of DDoS attacks was examined in Thongam et al. [35], as well as key
    aspects that influence the attack. Based on the amount of HTTP GET requests, the
    entropy of the requests and the variation of the entropy, they have employed a
    trained MLP using GA learning method to detect the DDoS attack. They have established
    that entropy has a higher value in the case of typical customers and a lower value
    in the case of an attack. They''ve also determined that the variance for an attacking
    client is nearly zero. It demonstrates that the amount of HTTP GET requests generated
    for the attacking period does not vary much. 4 Security Challenges in IoT-Based
    Smart Environments DDoS attacks have gained popularity recently due to the open
    accessibility and lack of security of IoT devices. DDoS attacks can be started
    against other targets using the intrusion, which is incredibly vulnerable to them.
    Attackers keep picking off different targets until they create a botnet. According
    to Elrawy et al. [14], the three main security issues in an IoT-based network
    are Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability. Both the data security and the
    routing peers participating in data transmission must be authenticated as the
    part of the authentication procedure. A significant challenge in IoT device authentication
    has been identified as the effective deployment and maintenance of keys. The complexities
    in compliance of IoT environments, together with the security of IoT systems,
    severely impede the existence of smart environments in the real world. DoS and
    DDoS attacks targeting IoT networks have an impact on IoT resulting in an impact
    on the services offered by smart environments as well. Researchers look at IoT
    security challenges from a variety of perspectives, including how susceptible
    IoT communication protocols are to security risks. Because this paper focuses
    on IDSs for the IoT architecture regardless of protocol, it highlights the security
    challenges that IoT systems face based on the IEEE classification and the generic
    IoT architecture. The security measures used to protect communications utilizing
    the aforementioned protocols must provide respectable levels. The appropriate
    information confidentiality, integrity, authentication and non-repudiation requirements
    must be met by the security techniques used to protect communications using the
    aforementioned protocols. The security of IoT communications can indeed be examined
    within the context of the protocol stack itself, as we will see throughout the
    article, or on the other end using external mechanisms. Other security factors
    for the IoT must be taken into account, especially for connections with sensing
    devices. For instance, WSN environments could be exposed to Internet-based assaults
    like Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, as mentioned in Granjal et al. [15]. 4.1
    How Communication Technologies like 4G, 5G and 6G Impact the Security and Privacy
    Concerns in the IoT Environment? The physical environment can now be closely associated
    with actuators, sensors, as well as other cognitive factors while maintaining
    stable network connectivity, thanks to considerable advances in communication
    technology and the Internet of Things’ rapid expansion. A smart environment is
    made up of computational elements and a physical environment that is constantly
    connected. A smart environment strives to support and enhance its residents’ capacities
    to carry out tasks, such as guiding elderly people through unfamiliar areas and
    lifting heavy objects. Ahmed et al. [16]''s efforts to employ IoT for life simplification
    and research the effects of IoT-based smart environments on human existence. They
    have also examined ongoing studies with the goal of creating IoT-based smart environments.
    Wireless technologies used to establish connections over the Internet are known
    as communication enablers. Wi-Fi, third generation (3G), fourth generation (4G)
    and satellite are the most widely used wireless Internet Technologies. While Wi-Fi
    is primarily employed in smart homes, smart cities, smart transportation, smart
    industries and smart buildings, 3G, 4G, 5G and 6G are typically used in smart
    city and smart grid contexts. These ecosystems all use satellites. It is expected
    that the fifth- as well as sixth-generation (5G and 6G, respectively) communication
    systems will significantly outperform the current fourth-generation system. Some
    of the major and frequent concerns relating to the quality of service for 5G and
    6G communication systems include high capacity, massive connection, low latency,
    high security, low energy consumption, outstanding level of performance and reliable
    connectivity. 6G communication will likely outperform 5G communication in these
    areas by a wide margin. The IoT, which is built on the multimodal internet, will
    also be necessary for the 5G-and-beyond (5 GB) communication systems (such as
    5G as well as 6G). As a result, 5 GB wireless networks will have a number of challenges
    in managing the diverse range of heterogeneous traffic.5G communications are accessible
    starting in 2020. The launch of 6G connection is then scheduled to take place
    between 2027 and 2030. On the basis of touch internet, it is challenging to realize
    the goals of 5G/6G and IoT. Only RF-based technologies are unable to meet the
    strict standards of the forthcoming 5G/6G and IoT networks. OWC technology offers
    a complementary RF network that is the best. The coexistence of RF and optical
    wireless devices will help these networks achieve their goals. Table 1 compares
    and summarizes the communication techniques utilized in IoT-based smart environments.
    Table 1 Comparison of communication technologies used in smart environment Full
    size table 4.2 Taxonomy of DDoS Attack on IoT A cyber-attack, known as a Denial
    of Service (DoS) attempt, uses the resources or bandwidth of a legitimate user
    to try to block access to a site. In contrast to Distributed Denial of Service
    (DDoS), which is a cyber-attack in which incoming traffic emanates from numerous
    sources, in this instance, an attack is carried out using a single machine without
    the use of malware. In comparison to a DoS attack, it is more sophisticated and
    difficult to prevent. It attacks computers with malware. In recent years, DDoS
    attacks have shown a diversity of attacking strategies, and a lot of alternatives
    are continuously being investigated. Traditional DDoS attacks and IoT-specific
    DDoS attacks are very identical to one another. They employ similar techniques
    to take advantage of flaws in both IoT devices and conventional systems. IoT-specific
    DDoS attacks, on the other hand, are more varied and sophisticated because of
    the variety of IoT devices. On the basis of the attacking methods, all of these
    attacks can be divided into two categories as shown in Fig. 2. One of the most
    important factors to remember regarding DDoS attack classification is that it
    is entirely dependent on the attack''s impact. Fig. 2 Taxonomy of DDoS attack
    Full size image Bandwidth Depletion Attacks and Resource Depletion Attacks are
    the two primary forms of DDoS attacks. 1. Bandwidth Depletion Attack This form
    of attack uses the target''s bandwidth that leads to flooding of the network with
    unsolicited traffic, preventing the legitimate traffic from arriving at the victim.
    Tools like Trinoo are commonly used to carry out these kinds of attacks. Bandwidth
    Depletion Attacks are of two types. I. Flood Attack Flood attack is based on the
    fact that the zombies flood the victim system by IP traffic. The victim system
    is bombarded by a huge number of packets from the zombies, which causes the victim
    system to lag, crash or saturate the network capacity. This prevents authorized
    users from using the victim''s resources. UDP packets are transmitted to the victim
    computer''s random or predefined ports during a DDoS UDP Flood attack as mentioned
    in Specht and Lee [37]. Attacks using UDP flood commonly target arbitrary victim
    ports. In order to identify the applications that have requested data, the victim
    system examines the incoming data. If no applications are correctly running on
    the victim system''s machine''s targeted port, the victim system will send an
    ICMP packet to the sender system. II. Amplification Attack An example of a DDoS
    attack is DNS amplification, in which the attacker impersonates the victim''s
    source address. A DNS amplification attack''s architecture is shown in Fig. 3.
    The hacker instructed the bot to send DNS requests and queries to a DNS server
    using a fictitious IP address and large-text resource records. Recursively, all
    of these queries are forwarded to the DNS name server. There is no need for handshaking
    in this process so the DNS query request or response depends on UDP. The reply
    from the DNS server is then sent to the IP address of the victim. The broadcast
    IP address feature is used in a DDoS amplification attack to magnify and reflect
    the attack [36]. It permits a sender system to use a broadcast IP address instead
    of a specified address as the destination address. This causes packets to be duplicated
    within the network and sent to all IP addresses. In this sort of DDoS attack,
    the attacker transmits the broadcast message directly that increases the volume
    of the attacking traffic. This attack will succeed if the attacker decides to
    send the broadcast message directly. Fig. 3 DNS amplification attack Full size
    image DDoS attacks have been the subject of numerous surveys in the past. The
    majority of them, on the other hand, have covered a typical DDoS attack, its variations
    and established network defence methods. In the literature, there is a wealth
    of knowledge on defending against DDoS attacks that can be used to lay the foundation
    for a protection against DDoS attack. In an IoT network, works of Zargar et al.
    [39] have covered a variety of DDoS flooding attacks, covering various types of
    botnet-based DDoS attack types which did not cover any fresh virus strains. Our
    poll looks at present patterns, potential outcomes and tried-and-true methods
    for stopping DDoS attacks. New virus attack strategies have been presented by
    modern DDoS attacks. In order to create a more efficient defence system against
    these attacks, it is now essential to understand several recently identified malware
    types and their traits. The poll''s results are contrasted with those of recent
    polls that were also performed while being susceptible to DDoS attacks in Table
    2. In order to properly comprehend the required facts, we have collected surveys
    on DDoS attacks in IoT. But the vast majority of them draw inspiration from conventional
    DDoS attacks along with related defences. Table 2 Comparison of DDoS attack on
    IoT networks Full size table There are many surveys on DDoS attack defence in
    conventional networks, but very few on DDoS attack defence in Internet of Things
    networks. Our evaluation examines all of the key protective factors that have
    utilized different strategies to thwart DDoS attacks for both conventional and
    Internet of Things (IoT) networks. Based on the techniques as well as strategies
    they have employed to combat DDoS, each of these defence strategies have been
    divided into three categories: mitigation, detection and prevention. Our study
    is centred on Botnets and Malware, which are the primary contributors to contemporary
    DDoS attacks in the Internet of Things, as well as defence tactics. We''ve briefly
    discussed the well-known IoT malware that hit certain well-known servers. There
    are, undoubtedly, numerous surveys on defending DDoS attacks on traditional networks,
    but only a handful on defending DDoS in cloud networks. We have identified outstanding
    obstacles and issues that need to be solved in order to produce an ideal solution
    against DDoS attacks in an IoT context as a result of our extensive comparison
    investigation of numerous defence systems. 5 Intrusion Detection and Prevention
    for IoT-Based DDoS Attacks It has widely been observed that the services become
    inaccessible, network defences become impenetrable and the availability factor
    is put at risk when a DoS attack is launched against an IoT network system and
    loads the network with a lot of traffic. Regardless of the fact that most Intrusion
    Detection and Prevention (IDPS) use one or two detection approaches, which may
    be grouped into two subgroups: anomaly-based and signature-based, they appear
    to have little chance of surviving a DoS attack. By taking advantage of the weaknesses
    in the employed techniques, a DoS arrives and forces its attack. The signature-based
    detection method, also known as rule-based or misuse-based IDS, can spot an attack
    by examining well-known attack signatures and infection behaviours. A software
    package called the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) keeps an eye on and protects
    against the dangerous behaviour on a network. It can also be viewed as the process
    for detecting unauthorized access to and breaches into computer networks and information
    systems. External intruders seek to enter the network and/or information systems
    from outside the network, whereas internal intruders are legitimate users who
    try to increase their credentials in order to unlock restricted data or services.
    IDS typically consists of a sensor and a reporting system. Information gathering
    is the main objective of the sensors. When developing any form of IDS, whether
    an NIDS or a HIDS, IDS placement is also an important factor to be considered.
    The IDS''s overall efficiency is affected by where it is placed in the IoT network.
    The two most common IDS deployment options are centralized as well as distributed.
    The centralization approach includes the benefit of centralized power, but it
    also carries the risk of overwhelming the system, that would be detrimental to
    the Quality of Service (QoS) for IoT networks. The advantage of the dispersed
    strategy is that it increases processing power while reducing the volume of monitored
    traffic. However, due to the inherent administrative challenges, establishing
    an IDS across multiple areas of an IoT network is tough. Not least of all, it
    requires the updated normal as well as anomaly databases connected with IoT services
    along with their applications. These databases will be very beneficial in analysing
    the different types of IDS and tactics in the IoT framework. Whether or not IDS
    comparison is successful and relevant will depend on these databases. Figure 4
    shows the variety of types of detection techniques which can be incorporated in
    an IoT environment. The detection strategy is the one that attracts the most emphasis
    among these three categories, and Wang et al. [17]''s detection strategy descriptions
    are the sole ones used to build most systems. Signature-based IDS, Anomaly-based
    IDS, specification-based IDS and hybrid IDS are the subcategories of detection
    approaches. Fig. 4 Intrusion detection system in IoT environment Full size image
    The Internet of Things (IoT), which is still extremely new, has already caught
    the attention of a variety of industries, including healthcare, logistics monitoring,
    smart cities, even autos. As a framework, it is vulnerable to a variety of serious
    infiltration problems. This study analyses IoT security problems and various methods
    assessed for its potential to defeat Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks
    using internet packet traces. The taxonomy of risky and safe behaviours in the
    IoT network is the main topic of this study. 5.1 Categories of IoT Threats There
    are different categories of IoT threats: 1. Denial of Service (DoS)—By injecting
    unwanted or worthless traffic, this threat prevents or limits users’ network access.
    2. Malware—To meddle with IoT network devices, attackers employ software files.
    They might get illegal access to equipment or gather sensitive data. The attacker
    can wreak havoc on the IoT architecture by using the devices’ software and exposing
    vulnerabilities in their firmware. 3. Data breaches—a data breach happens whenever
    private, protected, or secret data is removed from a network. By faking ARP packets,
    attackers can eavesdrop on peer-to-peer network conversations. 4. Weakening Parameters—IoT
    network devices are yet to be designed with pervasiveness in mind. An IDS is a
    network security device that detects threats and monitors packets. The IDS''s
    functions include providing threat information, taking corrective action when
    threats are detected and keeping track of all network occurrences. There are two
    kinds of intrusion detection systems available as mentioned in Hodo et al. [19]
    (Table 3): Table 3 Comparison of HIDS and NIDS performance Full size table Host-Based
    Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDS)—These are software-based computer devices that
    are deployed on a host computer and supervise every operating system, system application
    and traffic behaviour. Network-Based IDS (NIDS)—these are used to capture and
    analyse data across a whole network. IoTs are internet-connected gadgets that
    connect real-world objects with the internet in a number of contexts, such as
    business, home security and transportation. Users may not like IoT device vulnerabilities
    or unpredictable faults, which can result in a number of unanticipated outcomes.
    In IoT devices for vehicles or implanted medical equipment, invasions of privacy
    like Eavesdropping, Denial of Service attacks or ransomware may result in financial
    loss and, in severe cases, even death. There are numerous NIDS methods for IoTs
    that employ attack signatures, but according to Tabassum et al. [20], unknown
    attacks were not discovered, and False Positive rates are excessive (false alarms).
    Any component, such as a computer, node or router, can be connected to a host-based
    IDS to analyse network traffic. HIDS monitors modifications to the file system,
    system calls and operating system operations, in contrast to NIDS. 5.2 Survey
    of Intrusion Detection Methods and Datasets These studies grouped intrusion detection
    tactics according to technological principles, listed their advantages and disadvantages,
    however, they did not provide any replicable study ideas or methodology. Further
    research is made challenging by this. Furthermore, these studies don''t go into
    enough detail to explain intrusion detection techniques. In-depth research has
    been done in a number of intrusion detection-related fields, incorporating the
    pre-processing and analytical models along with assessment methodologies. These
    studies are current in terms of intrusion detection research for a specific target
    network. Their research is more comprehensive than these because it covers the
    Internet of Things (IoT), Software Defined Networks (SDN), including Industrial
    Control Networks (ICN). For the benefit of academics, we also investigate datasets
    from other fields. The studies described above have also been separated into several
    categories. The classification of these studies using the following criteria yields
    the findings shown in Table 4. Many different intrusion detection methods have
    been suggested. According to the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) technique,
    we have created a study procedure. This comprises selecting studies, identifying
    research questions, selecting studies, extracting data and synthesizing data.
    To better visually express the aforementioned needs, the method is comprised of
    mixed approaches (qualitative as well as quantitative research techniques). Table
    4 An organized literature review on Intrusion Detection based for IoT-based smart
    cities Full size table Technique: It is stated whether or not the studies are
    in accordance with SLR methodology. Intrusion detection method: This field describes
    whether the work mentions intrusion detection methods in addition to pre-processing
    techniques, analytical models as well as evaluation procedures. Multi-field: If
    the research assessed how intrusion detection systems are currently performing
    in various network settings. Dataset: Whether the study refers to the relevant
    studies in the dataset is indicated. 6 Conclusion and Future Work The Internet
    of Things (IoTs) can be viewed as a group of Internet-connected devices that link
    real-world objects to the internet in a number of contexts, such as business,
    home automation, healthcare and environmental monitoring. IoTs improve human operations
    by rendering routine activities easier, but they also present significant security
    dangers. Due to the potential vulnerability of IoTs as targets for hackers, businesses
    are spending billions of dollars to develop a viable system to detect this kind
    of fraudulent activity in IoT networks. With the use of clever mechanisms including
    Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), innovative attacks can
    now be prevented and recognized with the highest degree of precision. The existing
    Intrusion Detection methods for IoT networks are categorized and described in
    this paper, with a focus on hybrid and intelligent methods. The advantages and
    disadvantages of the revealed attack types, placement strategies and current IDS
    techniques are listed in this study. In particular, for IoTs, real-time validation
    of the machine learning-based Detection approaches published in the literature
    to date has not been done. These sophisticated IDS are primarily designed for
    wireless sensor networks. To create an IDS mechanism that meets the objectives
    of IPv6-connected IoTs while remaining effective in a limited context, artificial
    intelligence and deep learning techniques are needed. It has been planned to develop
    the intrusion detection framework for different IoT networks in the future that
    is independent of network topology, protocols and existing or undiscovered threats.
    An intelligent detection mechanism that detects malicious activities without increasing
    node overhead by secretly analysing network traffic. It also offers mitigating
    techniques when an intrusion is found. The suggested mechanism must show signs
    of adaptability to shifting network topologies, threat environments and other
    networks. References Weber RH (2010) Internet of things-new security and privacy

    The world has seen a rapid growth in its population and food utilization, while
    worldwide environmental change impacts the guaranteeing of food security in an
    economical way. Information-driven farming is one of the most techniques and thoughts
    proposed to broaden creation effectively while weakening its natural effect [7].
    Information-driven advances by and large are rapidly progressing with the occasion
    of the Internet of Things (IoT) and ought to turn into a pivotal piece of the
    more drawn-out term of cultivating [5, 9, 27, 28]. Savvy farming, likewise called
    Agriculture 4.0 or computerized cultivating [6], is creating past the elegant
    idea of accuracy horticulture, which puts together its administration rehearses
    with respect to spatial estimations to a great extent due to Global Positioning
    System (GPS) signals. Brilliant cultivating puts together its administration undertakings
    likewise with respect to spatial information yet is upgraded with setting mindfulness
    and is enacted by continuous occasions, improving the presentation of heretofore
    accuracy horticulture arrangements [25, 28]. Moreover, smart farming typically
    joins insightful administrations for applying and overseeing information and communication
    technologies (ICT) in cultivating and permits cross-over combination all through
    the whole agri-evolved way of life with respect to sanitation and detectability
    [25]. The IoT idea was presented by Kevin Ashton in 1999 regarding connecting
    radio-frequency identification (RFID) for supply chains to the web [2], however,
    has no authoritative definition. It infers, nonetheless, the association of an
    organization of “things” to or through the web without direct human mediation.
    “Things” are frequently any item with sensors as well as actuators that is particularly
    addressable, interconnected, and open through the overall organization, for example,
    the web. The apparatus of IoT in agribusiness is profitable because of the probability
    to watch and control numerous different boundaries in an interoperable, adaptable,
    and open setting with expanding utilization of heterogeneous mechanized segments
    [10], moreover to the inescapable necessity for recognizability. As a consequence
    of IoT, farming is turning out to be information-driven, for example, settling
    on educated constant choices for dealing with the ranch, decreasing vulnerabilities,
    and shortcomings, and as a result, diminishing its ecological effect. The effect
    of the Internet of Things (IoT) and associated gadgets during this current world
    is evident. Today, it is reached all over the place, from home to wellbeing area,
    savvy urban communities, wellness, to the modern area. Its quality is regularly
    seen in many enterprises, and consequently, the space of agribusiness is not unique.
    In the past a while, several technological advancements have taken place in farming,
    and thus, today it is far more industrialized and technology-driven because it
    was decades before. Today, we will see the ranchers effectively using brilliant
    cultivating devices, which empower them to have better power over this method
    of developing yields and raising animals. There are cows’ global positioning frameworks,
    mechanized farming technology, and savvy nurseries. This makes it more efficient
    and predictable. To be specific, COVID-19 emphatically affects IoT in the agribusiness
    piece of the pie. Interruptions in the inventory network, and the lack of qualified
    specialists, have moved its CAGR to 9.9%. Indeed, according to ongoing reports,
    the savvy outlining piece of the pie is set to reach $6.2 billion by 2021. Simultaneously,
    the worldwide savvy horticulture market size is relied upon to significantly increase
    by 2025, coming to $15.3 billion (contrasted with being marginally more than $5
    billion back in 2016). Since the market is as yet creating, there is as yet abundant
    freedom for organizations willing to participate. Building IoT items for agribusiness
    inside the coming years can separate you as an early adopter, and accordingly,
    help you make ready to progress. The literature was studied [1, 3, 8, 11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,
    26, 29, 30] extensively, and the common practices for IoT and its implementation
    in agriculture sector has been discussed in the subsequent sections. 2 IoT Implementation
    in Agriculture Industry As the Internet of Things (IoT) spreads, associated gadgets
    are advancing into brilliant urban areas, savvy homesteads, and shrewd horticulture.
    As associated gadgets become more common, the Internet of Things (IoT) is turning
    into a part of smart cities, smart agriculture, and smarter agriculture. The Internet
    of Things (IoT) helps the rural business in accomplishing its maintainable improvement
    objectives by giving organized arrangements that permit ranchers to boost yields
    while devouring less common assets. IoT in agribusiness is utilized by consolidating
    ceaselessly propelling AI and scientific devices to screen crops, map fields and
    give information to ranchers to levelheaded homestead the executives plan. Notwithstanding
    the information gathered by canny sensors for agribusiness, a key segment is mechanized
    equipment. IoT arrangements and rural use are developing consistently, which is
    the reason BI intelligence predicts that the quantity of horticultural IoT gadgets
    will arrive at 75 million by 2020 and develop by 20% yearly. The improvement of
    IoT applications is turning out to be progressively well known, and IoT''s portion
    of the overall industry in agribusiness will arrive at 5.6 billion by 2021. With
    the 5G-speed data transfer capacity, further applications will be made that will
    take the IoT and agribusiness higher than ever. Before this occurs, it is critical
    to see how IoT is utilized in agribusiness and whether the shrewd cultivating
    industry is reacting rapidly enough to steady development. IoT sensors can be
    utilized to gather information on plant wellbeing, water quality, soil dampness,
    and soil wellbeing. Programmed keen water system highlights sensors that help
    give constant data on the state of the dirt and water supply, just as the accessibility
    of water. The information gathered by these sensors is utilized to know the constant
    status of a harvest and to do it with the assistance of programmed water system.
    A portion of the conspicuous chances recorded in our IoT and farming use cases
    highlight the capability of brilliant agrarian arrangements in horticulture and
    their expected effect on rural efficiency and profitability development. As appeared,
    this incorporates savvy ranches, canny water system frameworks, and insightful
    plant the board. 2.1 Advantages of Using IoT in Agriculture As in different businesses,
    utilization of Internet of Things in horticulture guarantees beforehand inaccessible
    productivity, decrease of assets and value, computerization, and information-driven
    cycles. In agribusiness, nonetheless, these advantages do not go about as enhancements,
    yet rather the answers for the whole business standing up to an assortment of
    risky issues. Dominated effectiveness. The present horticulture is during a race.
    Ranchers need to develop more item in falling apart soil, declining land accessibility,
    and expanding climate variance. IoT-empowered horticulture permits ranchers to
    watch their item and conditions progressively. They get bits of knowledge quick,
    can foresee issues before they occur and settle on educated choices while in transit
    to stay away from them. Moreover, IoT arrangements in agribusiness present robotization,
    for example, request-based water system, preparing and robot reaping. Diminished
    assets. Numerous IoT arrangements are centered around enhancing the usage of assets—water,
    energy, and land. Exactness cultivating utilizing IoT depends on the information
    gathered from different sensors inside the field which assists ranchers with apportioning
    assets to inside one plant. Cleaner measure. A comparable has pertinence to pesticides
    and manures. Not exclusively do IoT-based frameworks for exactness cultivating
    help makers save water and energy and, subsequently, make cultivating greener,
    yet additionally altogether downsize on the usage of pesticides and manure. This
    methodology permits getting a cleaner and more natural end result contrasted with
    customary farming strategies. Readiness. One among the upsides of utilizing IoT
    in farming is that the expanded nimbleness of the cycles. Due to ongoing checking
    and forecast frameworks, ranchers can rapidly answer any critical change in climate,
    mugginess, air quality additionally in light of the fact that the strength of
    each yield or soil inside the field. Inside the states of most extreme climate
    changes, new capacities help horticulture experts save the harvests. 2.2 Current
    Implementation of IoT in Agriculture To exploit IoT, it is imperative to design
    early and to embrace every one of the fundamental gadgets and administrations.
    The advantages are copious, including customizations, capacity to arrange, and
    ceaseless criticism on the general execution of the framework. To lessen costs,
    IoT network can likewise be utilized to make custom web applications on top of
    an IoT arrangement, along these lines disposing of the substantial information
    base administration measure. This can possibly essentially lessen the expense
    of entering the information. Horticulture needs particular Internet of Things
    (IoT) sensors that can gather data about the ranch. To make an IoT answer for
    horticulture and agribusiness, one ought not to fail to remember the rudiments
    of choosing sensors and gear. Given the expected advantages of IoT applications
    in horticulture, it is reasonable that a few ranchers are going to the utilization
    of the innovation on their homesteads. In the agrarian area, we are searching
    for profits by the IoT in zones like food security, bug control, water the board,
    crop assurance, water system, and so forth. From our experience, there are different
    manners by which the Internet of Things can improve horticulture and farming.
    Beneath we layout a portion of the likely advantages of IoT in agribusiness and
    how it will help ranchers meet worldwide food needs in the years ahead. Here are
    a couple of instances of how the Internet can be utilized—of—things to bring ranchers
    the best advantages as far as food security, bother control, water the executives,
    water system, plant wellbeing and water system frameworks, and different parts
    of agribusiness, here and here. The advancement of IoT on ranches has prompted
    an expansion in the time and energy required for seeds to turn out to be completely
    developed plants. Simultaneously, the joining of the Internet—the things that
    are innovatively conceivable—has empowered ranchers to utilize these assets all
    the more proficiently and cost—successfully—more viably than any time in recent
    memory. Advances in IoT innovation in farming have diminished the quantity of
    steps in an agrarian cycle in which a seed needs time or assets to turn into a
    completely mature vegetable, and the development of IOT innovation for agribusiness
    has decreased this. Uses of IoT in horticulture help ranchers screen the water
    tank level, making the water system measure more productive. Machine orders accelerate
    far off observing continuously and limit the requirement for manual work and mechanization.
    This will make it simpler for ranchers to gather precise information on climate
    conditions. Moreover, the diminishing expenses of horticulture and IoT sensors,
    just as the accessibility of ease innovations, are required to urge more ranchers
    to utilize IoT in farming during the recuperation period of COVID-19. Brilliant
    sensors for agribusiness gather huge loads of information, and surprisingly the
    farming area has its offer. Regardless of whether it is shrewd sensors or IoT
    innovation, the utilization of prescient information examination can help ranchers
    settle on educated choices about what they can best use later on. Brilliant cultivating,
    for instance, utilizes sensors associated with fields and harvests to give information
    to agrarian designers and laborers to acquire knowledge and settle on better profitability
    choices. By utilizing shrewd horticultural sensors to screen the state of harvests,
    ranchers can correctly characterize the number of pesticides and manures they
    need to use to accomplish ideal productivity. While IoT applications offer continuous
    advantages that address recent concerns, maybe their most noteworthy benefit is
    the information that IoT-empowered sensors gather. The brilliant horticulture
    area is additionally expected to develop fundamentally to address these issues,
    driven by the normal expansion in the quantity of web associated things (IoT)
    for rural purposes. IoT arrangements and farming use are developing consistently,
    and BI intelligence predicts that almost 12 million horticultural sensors will
    be introduced worldwide by 2023. We currently realize that not exclusively is
    the selection of IoT arrangements in horticulture consistently expanding, yet
    the size of the worldwide market for “keen agribusiness” is likewise quickly expanding.
    The quantity of horticultural IoT gadgets will arrive at 75 million by 2020 and
    develop by 20% yearly. The market will stay dynamic as long as there are buyers
    associated with these gadgets. Yet, in the event that they are not as famous as
    they used to be, markets will in any case be exceptionally unique. It is essential
    to see how IoT is utilized in horticulture and whether the brilliant cultivating
    industry is responding rapidly enough to consistent advancement. Notwithstanding,
    there will be a great deal of advancement in the years to come, in IoT as well
    as in brilliant horticulture. To build up an IoT answer for farming, you need
    to choose a sensor gadget or make a custom one. To create IoT answers for agribusiness
    and horticulture, it is fundamental that you select the sensor gadgets. To fabricate
    an IoT arrangement in horticulture, we need a sensor gadget that is chosen or
    a custom gadget is made. On the off chance that you are building an IoT answer
    for agribusiness, you need a sensor gadget that you have picked or made yourself.
    For sensors, equipment support is a test that is of essential significance for
    IoT items in horticulture, as sensors are commonly utilized in the field and can
    without much of a stretch be harmed. For sensors, equipment support is vital,
    as they are not normally being used for significant stretches of time and can
    undoubtedly be harmed, yet for sensors this is certifiably not an auxiliary test,
    as they are ordinarily being used for a brief timeframe. Horticulture needs particular
    Internet of Things (IoT) sensors that can gather data about the homestead. Horticultural
    IoT sensors that can be associated with livestock and observed are very much like
    checking crops. Figure 1 illustrates the types of communication technologies used
    for data transmission in IoT-based agriculture applications. Fig. 1 Communication
    technologies used for data transmission in percentage Full size image Software
    implantation and benefits: Software as a Service (SaaS) Not necessarily physical
    equipment on farms; No equipment on farms necessary; Each year or month, low-cost
    low-risk subscription plans available. Satellite images with high resolution for
    tracking, GPS geotagging, and weather analysis; Control of the entire supply chain;
    Data on chemical use and labor logs are available. It is possible to combine it
    with existing devices and IoT’s. Hardware implementation and benefits: The Internet
    of Things (IoT) Sensors, robots, drones, and cameras must be installed on farms
    to track and control them. Equipment is both costly and delicate. Hardware recurring
    repair costs; Large initial investments are needed. There is no supply chain management.
    Since it is not scalable, each farm’s data must be handled separately. There is
    no log information. Integration with already installed systems is difficult. Agribusiness
    utilizes IoT to acquire bits of knowledge and screen ranches by consolidating
    robots, robots, sensors, and PC vision with insightful applications. Actual gear
    introduced on ranches screens and records information, which is then broke down.
    As the chances in IoT are expanding each day, various associations are equipping
    to exploit the IoT. For example, ranchers are utilizing IoT for checking crop
    wellbeing and to settle on educated choices, improving the harvest wellbeing the
    executives and supplement application to meet yield objectives. IoT is the base
    that opens up new entryways in horticulture. The incorporated framework is required
    to diminish the expense and dangers of cultivating, improved the yields, and give
    a superior. 3 Applications of IoT in Agriculture Industry IoT assumes part in
    the improvement of horticultural area. As of now, the main point of contention
    in the ebb and flow area is usage of assets like labor and water which is deficient
    in numerous pieces of the country. IoT is an organization of interconnected gadgets
    which can be move information productively without human inclusion. All cultivating
    area should be possible utilizing advanced mobile phones and IoT gadgets. The
    applications of IoT in the agriculture industry have been highlighted in Fig.
    2. Fig. 2 Sector-wise applications of IoT in agriculture industry Full size image
    Precision agriculture. Precise farming, also known as precision agriculture, can
    be considered something that makes farming more regulated and precise when it
    comes to livestock raising and cultivation. The use of IT and different elements,
    such as sensors, control systems, robotics, self-sufficient cars, hardware automation,
    variable rate technology, and so on, are a key component in this farming management
    strategy. A number of primary developments characterizing the precision farming
    pattern are the introduction of connections by the producer to high-speed Internet,
    handheld devices, and secure low-caste satellites (for imagery and placement).
    Precision farming is one of the most renowned agricultural IoT applications and
    various organizations around the world are using this technique. Intelligent greenhouses.
    Greenhouse cultivation is a technique to improve the production of tomatoes, fruits,
    plants, etc. The environmental parameters of the greenhouses are controlled by
    manual action or proportional control. These approaches are less efficient since
    manual action leads to loss of manufacturing, energy loss, and labor costs. With
    the aid of IoT, an intelligent greenhouse can be built, which intelligently monitors
    and regulates the environment, removing the need for manual interaction. Different
    sensors to monitor the temperature according to plant needs are used to regulate
    the environment inside a clever greenhouse. If it is linked via IoT, we can build
    a cloud server to remotely access the device. This prevents the need for continuous
    manual surveillance. The cloud server also allows data collection and a control
    action inside the greenhouse. This architecture provides farmers with low manual
    operation with cost-effective and optimal solutions. It produces new and inexpensive
    greenhouses through the use of IoT sensors with solar power. In the greenhouse,
    IoT sensors provide information about lighting, pressure, humidity, and heat.
    These sensors will automatically control the actuators by opening a window, activating
    light, controlling a heater, switching on a mister or fan. Management of crops.
    IoT crop control systems are a further form of IoT processing and another part
    of precision farming. Similar to meteoric stations, they must be installed on
    the farm for the collection of basic crop statistics, from rainfall, and temperature
    to leaf efficiency and general crop health. So, to avoid infestations or diseases
    that could harm your return, you also track crop growth and other abnormalities.
    Semiosis and Arab, for example, represent the right way to implement this utility
    case. Intelligent farming predictive analytics. Agriculture precision and data
    mining go together. The use of predictive data analysis allows farmers to understand
    it and have key expectations: the probability of infestations/diseases, yield
    and plant harvesting, etc. While smart sensor technology and IoT technology are
    vital to the extremely applicable real-time data. Predictive data analysis systems
    help make agriculture internally more reliant and more stable and manageable on
    weather conditions. The consistency and quantity of yields will foresee, as can
    exposures to unfavorable weather conditions such as droughts and flooding, for
    example, from a seed portal. It enables farmers to pick yield features to maximize
    the provision of water and nutrients to each crop and increase production. 4 Challenges
    and Solutions 4.1 Challenges The overall investment volume in agriculture increased
    by about 80% in the last five years or so. According to experts, precision agriculture—an
    input and nutrient optimisation method, tillage equipment, fields and crops to
    maximize control, and farm yield calculation—has the ability to play an important
    role in fulfilling the increasing world population''s increased food requirements
    [24]. The size of the global precision agriculture industry at the end of this
    decade was calculated in one latest survey at around $4.6 billion—with the CAGR
    being just a little less than 12% between 2015 and 2020. The US alone is expected
    to save more than 14% between now and 2022 on the demand for smart farming applications.
    However, precise agricultural growth and proliferation were not as vigorous as
    previously predicted [31]. The sector faces a number of important problems, and
    in this article, we turn our attention to: Poor Internet Connectivity in Farms.
    Most farms are located in remote places with insufficient Internet access for
    fast transmitting speed. In addition, channels of contact can be obstructed by
    crops, canopies, and other physical obstacles. He states that these conditions
    increase the cost of transmitting and have led to the poor adoption of agricultural
    accuracy technologies. This cost will increase exponentially with the introduction
    of big data. With the help of empty TV frequencies, the farm beats allows farmers
    to conquer this obstacle. Experts noted that in rural areas this is particularly
    useful as inadequate television coverage frequently results in the existence of
    white spaces in television broadcasting frequencies licensed for use. Disrupted
    Connectivity to the Cloud. Today’s IoT technology in agriculture is like every
    other IoT framework, based on a cloud computing system—in this case, the Azure
    Platform of Microsoft. But Internet access is always insufficient in the farmers’
    houses to stream large data sets into the cloud. Furthermore, there may be intrusion
    sources on farms, which also have negative consequences for cloud connections.
    Experts clarified that farmers need to use data-driven technology to increase
    yields, minimize business costs, and ensure environmental sustainability. Experts
    will support farmers in solving the challenges of using IoT in rural areas to
    understand all the advantages of agriculture using info. Developers concluded
    by saying that these and other functionality are yet to be developed but enable
    farmers to use precision farming to operate a more productive and efficient business.
    4.2 Solutions Agriculture must scale up to meet its requirements in view of the
    unfavorable environmental and climate circumstances for a prosperous world population
    expected to reach 9.6 billion by 2050. Agriculture would continue to use creative
    approaches to meet the emerging demands of people in order to achieve a much-needed
    advantage. Internet of Things (IoT) agricultural applications would allow the
    industry''s efficiency improvement, costs reduction, waste reduction, and quality
    enhancement. IoT-based intelligent agriculture is a device designed with sensor-based
    monitoring and automation of the irrigation methods for agricultural land (soil,
    humidity, light, temperature, etc.). Land conditions can be observed by farmers
    everywhere. For example, when soil humidity is poor, it alerts the farmer; for
    the irrigation process, the farmer will be using sensors. In comparison with conventional
    approaches, IoT-based smart farming is highly effective [4]. Irrigation systems
    that are fitted with IoT not only save water, but also ensure that crops receive
    the right water for optimal growth. Instead of a pre-determined period dependent
    irrigation, the irrigation system depends on moisture levels. This technology
    is used by many organizations worldwide. In India, Sat Sure is a data analytics
    firm integrated with the agricultural sector in terms of satellite, weather, and
    IoT analysis to support farmers in their financial protection and crop insurance.
    The company has smartphone apps to provide information on crop and crop stress
    statistics in its region. It helps you decide whether to sow, irrigate, apply,
    or prepare fertilizer. The Government of Andhra Pradesh is now using the start-up
    solutions. Queens employs IoT as a comprehensive IoT solution in order to handle
    fresh foods, to provide quick and accurate grading solutions for fresh foods by
    capturing insights on spoilage, shelf-life and maturity, which enable farms achieve
    greater margins from the same product. The deployment of this technology presents
    unique challenges in India, however, particularly for small-scale farmers in rural
    areas with a lack of decent Internet connectivity and proper infrastructure without
    which progressive monitoring systems are useless. Farmers may also be discouraged
    by the high costs of IoT equipment and the difficulty thereof. The adoption and
    deployment of this intelligent agricultural technology is expected by strategic
    and comprehensive IoT application strategies and supporting government plans.
    With success, the economy of the farming industry would certainly be boosted.
    In India, therefore, it should be of primary importance to promote agriculture
    through digital transformation. The Internet of Things allows farmers to make
    educated decisions to boost crop yields, increase productivity, and improve operational
    efficiency along with better management tools which lead to minimal waste in good
    time. IoT technology allows intelligent agriculture to save farmers water using
    IoT technology. IoT apps and technology are used most prominently at the first
    level, as we allow farmers to determine what to harvest in the season to achieve
    their best yield by using GPS and a weather tracker. As never before, IoT transforms
    agriculture by rising agricultural production and enabling farmers to cope with
    the tremendous difficulties they face. Up till now, farmers have struggled to
    find new water conservation options and their response is today''s IoT technology.
    In addition to the importance of responsible environmental management, IoT supports
    agriculturists by reducing water use by using IoT technologies, networks and data
    collection to up to 25% in accordance with state and federal water legislation.
    5 Conclusion To meet the demands of a rising population, more smarter, better,
    and more effective harvesting techniques are required. Innovation, security and
    nutrition labeling, and collaboration between farmers, suppliers, merchants, and
    buyers are all important factors in the development of innovative ways for increasing
    harvest production. This study considered all of these factors and highlighted
    the role of many innovations, notably the Internet of Things, in making agribusiness
    more bright and capable of meeting future expectations. As a result, remote sensors,
    unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), cloud computing, and communication improvements
    are all thoroughly investigated. In addition, several IoT-based designs and phases
    for farming applications are provided. A list of the business''s ebb and flow
    issues, as well as future assumptions, is compiled to guide specialists and architects.
    Internet of Things (IoT) concerns are becoming increasingly prominent, and they
    are posing challenges in a variety of areas. As a result of this advancement,
    a slew of new mechanical advances have emerged, as well as a slew of new problems.
    Apart from the increase in the number and types of devices in use, the main IoT
    development areas are advancement of organizational advances specie to IoT, security,
    scaling down and device mix, limiting energy requirements, programming usability
    backing and ease of use, and the use of open-source software and open hardware
    gadgets. References A.P. Antony et al., A review of practice and implementation

  description: Internet of Things (IoT) technology is widely applied in various domains
    such as agriculture, health, business, etc. IoT devices mainly deal with collecting
    sensory data and communicating with each other with the help of the Internet.
    The dependability on the Internet has made these IoT devices more vulnerable to
    attacks done by third-party users. To ensure privacy, security, and confidentiality
    for the data generated by these IoT devices, there is a need for cryptographic
    techniques. Light-Weight Cryptography (LWC) is the most commonly used cryptographic
    technique to ensure security for the data generated by IoT devices. The LWC techniques
    consume less power for computation and are most suitable for IoT devices as they
    have limited capacity in terms of memory and power. This paper proposes an LWC
    technique for healthcare Wearable IoT device data. In the proposed method, the
    plain text size is 64 bits which combine the IoT-generated data, i.e., Step count,
    BP level, Heart rate, etc., into a single plaintext and encrypts the same. The
    proposed method's performance is better than the Present LWC technique as it reduces
    the time for encryption and decryption.

    applied in various domains such as agriculture, health, business, etc. IoT devices
    mainly deal with collecting sensory data and communicating with each other with
    the help of the Internet. The dependability on the Internet has made these IoT
    devices more vulnerable to attacks done by third-party users. To ensure privacy,
    security, and confidentiality for the data generated by these IoT devices, there
    is a need for cryptographic techniques. Light-Weight Cryptography (LWC) is the
    most commonly used cryptographic technique to ensure security for the data generated
    by IoT devices. The LWC techniques consume less power for computation and are
    most suitable for IoT devices as they have limited capacity in terms of memory
    and power. This paper proposes an LWC technique for healthcare Wearable IoT device
    data. In the proposed method, the plain text size is 64 bits which combine the
    IoT-generated data, i.e., Step count, BP level, Heart rate, etc., into a single
    plaintext and encrypts the same. The proposed method’s performance is better than
    the Present LWC technique as it reduces the time for encryption and decryption.

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Ballar, India SECTION I. Introduction Many
    organizations rely on IoT devices to provide their users with better and more
    advanced services. The data generated by these devices have to be secured. The
    IoT is a network of intelligent devices that can sense and interact with other
    devices through the internet. This network comprises various units capable of
    performing tasks and exchanging information with other connected devices [1].
    Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is preferable for better security. But these
    traditional cryptography methods are computationally intensive and unsuitable
    for IoT devices as they have resource-constrained environments. Given the demands
    of confidentiality, integrity, authorization, availability, privacy, and regulation
    standards, and the need for regular system updates, cybersecurity has become a
    significant challenge for IoT devices. These circumstances pose various obstacles
    to ensuring the security and protection of data within these devices [2]. LWC
    has become increasingly important as many IoT devices connect and communicate
    with other devices via the internet and require encryption to protect sensitive
    information. LWC refers to cryptographic algorithms and protocols optimized for
    resource-constrained environments such as embedded systems, smart cards, and IoT
    devices. These systems typically have limited computational power, memory, and
    energy, necessitating cryptography tailored to their specific requirements. PRESENT
    (Privacy Enhanced Reduced-Sized Block Cipher) is an ultra-lightweight block cipher
    introduced by [3]. The cipher was designed to have a small code size, low power
    consumption, and a high level of security. Since its introduction, PRESENT has
    gained widespread popularity in cryptography and has been used in various applications
    such as RFID tags, smart cards, and wireless sensor networks. The basic structure
    of PRESENT is based on a Feistel network with 31 rounds. The cipher operates on
    a 64-bit block and supports key sizes of 80 and 128 bits. The key schedule algorithm
    uses a simple bit rotation operation that makes it very efficient in terms of
    code size and execution time. PRESENT is a lightweight block cipher algorithm.
    PRESENT is designed to provide high security with minimal computational and memory
    resources, making it ideal for implementation in low-power embedded systems, wireless
    sensor networks, and other resource-constrained environments. With the increasing
    number of connected devices and the growing need for secure communication and
    data protection, lightweight cryptography algorithms like PRESENT are becoming
    more important. This paper provides a Light-Weight Cryptographic (LWC) technique
    that uses less computation power and memory to provide security and privacy for
    data generated by IoT wearable devices. The proposed method adapts the Present
    LWC technique with respect to key size and SBox operations. For the plain text,
    it combines the IoT-generated data suitably to form a single embedded data and
    encrypts the same. The paper is organized as follows: The detailed literature
    review of various LWC cryptography techniques is represented in Section II. The
    proposed technique to perform the encryption is represented in Section III. The
    comparative analysis along with the results is represented in Section IV followed
    by conclusions and future work. SECTION II. Literature Review Several research
    studies have been conducted to develop and analyze the LWC technique. This section
    summarizes some of the key studies in this area. [4] provides a valuable literature
    review on the state-of-the-art in LWC for smart IoT devices, its implementation
    challenges, and potential applications. The authors highlight the challenges posed
    by IoT devices, including resource constraints such as limited computational power,
    storage, and communication bandwidth. These challenges make traditional cryptographic
    solutions unsuitable for securing IoT devices. The article emphasizes the need
    for further research to develop more effective and efficient lightweight cryptographic
    solutions to meet the growing security demands of IoT devices. [5] overview of
    the different types of lightweight cryptographic protocols, including symmetric
    and asymmetric encryption algorithms, message authentication codes, and key agreement
    protocols. The authors evaluate the effectiveness of these protocols in meeting
    the security requirements of IoT applications, such as data confidentiality, data
    integrity, and device authentication. [6] presents the implementation of two lightweight
    cryptographic algorithms, PRESENT and DM-PRESENT, on FPGA hardware. The authors
    evaluate the performance of the implemented cores in terms of throughput, latency,
    and resource utilization, and compare their performance with other existing implementations.
    [7] presents a new instruction set extension for lightweight cryptography algorithms
    in IoT devices. They propose a lightweight key management scheme that can be implemented
    using the new instruction set extension, which can help address some security
    challenges associated with resource-constrained IoT devices. They highlight the
    need for efficient and secure cryptographic operations in IoT devices, which are
    often resource-constrained and vulnerable to security threats. [8] presents a
    comparative study of various lightweight cryptographic hash functions, including
    their security properties, performance metrics, and implementation considerations.
    The authors evaluate the performance of these hash functions on various platforms,
    including embedded systems, mobile devices, and IoT devices, and compare their
    performance with other existing hash functions. [9] provides a comprehensive review
    of the finalists in the lightweight cryptography competition organized by NIST,
    along with an analysis of their vulnerability to faults. The article highlights
    the importance of evaluating the security of lightweight cryptographic algorithms
    under various fault models and provides insights into the design principles, security
    properties, and performance characteristics of these algorithms. [10] focuses
    on the vulnerability of the PRESENT lightweight block cipher to electromagnetic
    side-channel attack (EMSCA) and proposes a novel countermeasure to enhance its
    resilience. The article demonstrates the effectiveness of the virtual masking
    technique in enhancing the security of the PRESENT cipher without compromising
    its low power consumption and high speed, making it suitable for use in resource-constrained
    environments. [11] provides a literature review of several proposed lightweight
    cryptographic protocols, including the MQV protocol, LSMAP protocol, LEAP protocol,
    and LCLAKA protocol. The authors highlight the importance of these protocols,
    as they provide a high level of security while consuming minimal resources, making
    them suitable for resource-constrained IoT networks. [12] examines the need for
    LWC algorithms to secure constrained objects in IoT devices. They review the current
    state-of-the-art LWC algorithms and evaluate their performance in terms of security,
    memory, and energy consumption. They compare the performance of these algorithms
    against traditional cryptographic algorithms such as RSA, AES, and SHA. The authors
    conclude that lightweight cryptographic algorithms such as PRESENT, PRINCE, and
    SIMON provide a high level of security with minimal resource consumption, making
    them suitable for resource-constrained IoT devices. However, they note that the
    choice of algorithm ultimately depends on the specific requirements and limitations
    of the IoT device being used. [13] focuses on the analysis and evaluation of LWC
    algorithms suitable for IoT applications. They reviewed several lightweight cryptographic
    algorithms, including SIMON, SPECK, PRESENT, and PICAROON, and compared their
    performance in terms of security, efficiency, and energy consumption. The authors
    also evaluate the algorithms against common attack scenarios, such as differential
    and linear attacks. The authors conclude that the choice of algorithm depends
    on the specific requirements and constraints of the IoT device being used and
    that different algorithms offer varying levels of security and efficiency. [14]
    presents a new lightweight block cipher called SLIM, specifically designed for
    use in the Internet of Health Things (IoHT). The SLIM cipher is based on a Feistel
    network and uses a non-linear round function to provide strong diffusion and confusion
    properties. The cipher uses a 128-bit key and a 64-bit block size, which provides
    a high level of security against attacks. The authors compared the SLIM cipher
    with other lightweight block ciphers, and the results showed that SLIM outperformed
    other ciphers in terms of memory footprint and power consumption, while maintaining
    a high level of security. The SLIM cipher has potential applications in securing
    medical and healthcare devices, which are typically resource-constrained. SECTION
    III. Proposed methodology The proposed method, Embedded Light-Weight Cryptography
    (ELWC), encrypts the data using a Substitution- Permutation Network (SPN). In
    this method, the Cipher text (C_Text) is produced by performing a series of mathematical
    operations on Plain text (P_ Text) in 31 rounds with the help of the Master Key
    (M_ Key). Usually, in LWC techniques, the Key is 80 bits or 128 bits. Since the
    IoT devices are resource-constrained, ELWC considers 64 bits of P_Text, 64 bits
    of Block size, and 80 bits of key size. The 80-bit key i.e., the Master key is
    represented as M_Key MK79, MK78, …… MK0 and the number of rounds in the encryption
    process is 31. The parameters such as key size, block size, and plain text size
    considered for the proposed algorithm are represented in Table I. TABLE I. Algorithm
    Parameters For each round of 31 rounds, a Round key R_Key is generated by performing
    rotations on M_Key. The proposed algorithm follows the below three steps: Embed
    the P_Text. SBox operations on P_Text with R_Key Generating R_Keys The basic three
    steps of the proposed ELWC techniques are represented in Algorithm 1. Algorithm
    1 ELWC Algorithm A. Embedded Plain Text Generation The typical data generated
    from wearable healthcare IoT devices are Heart rate (HT), Steps walked (ST), Distance
    Walked (DT), Calories Burnt (CB), Systolic Blood Pressure level (SBP), Diastolic
    Blood Pressure Level (DBP), Glucose Level (GL). Each data item is represented
    using 32-bit or 64- bit depending on the encryption algorithm. But not all the
    above-mentioned data require 32 or 64-bit representation. The actual bit requirement
    of the data generated by IoT wearable device data is represented in Table II.
    The usual way of representing the device data is to take individual data such
    as HT, ST, etc., and represent each of these data with either 32-bit or 64-bit.
    And the data is encrypted separately for each individual data which is represented
    in \" Fig 1\". In this process, each data item is represented by 64 bits, where
    more than half bits are plain zeros. From Table II, it is evident that the data
    items such as HT, DT, SBP, DBP, and GL can be represented in 8 bits. The proposed
    method takes a 64-bit size for P_Text representation. Instead of representing
    the data separately, the proposed technique embeds the data items as P_Text1 (HT),
    P_Text2 (ST), P_Text3 (DT) … P_Textn (GL) into a single plain text depending on
    the data bit size requirement and is represented in \" Fig 2\". TABLE II. Bits
    Requirements for IoT Data Fig. 1. Traditional IoT Data Representation Show All
    Fig. 2. Proposed Method IoT Data Representation Show All B. SBox Operations Once
    the P_Text is embedded, an XOR operation is performed with R_Keyi in Roundi with
    the 64-bit P_Text. The 64-bit output of the XOR operation is given as input to
    SBox (S_Box) for generating the P_Text for the next round. A total of 16 S_Boxes
    (S_Box15, S_Box14, .… S_Box0) are maintained, where each S_Box has a 4-bit input
    and 4-bit output. All these 16 S_Box are independent of each other. As a process
    of P_Text generation for the next round, the places of the bits are switched.
    The process of switching the bits in the S_Box is carried out by swapping the
    places of a bit in the ith position to the jth position which is shown in \" Fig
    3\". For example, 1st bit will be in the 16th-bit place, 2nd bit will be in the
    32nd-bit place, and the 3rd-bit will be in the 48th-bit place. However, 1st bit
    and 64th remain in the same position. The detailed mapping of the bits to their
    position is represented in Table III. After 31 rounds of S_Box operations, 64-bit
    data is generated and that is converted into a 16-bit hexadecimal C_Text. The
    hexadecimal conversion of 64-bit data to 16-bit C_Text from the S_Box is shown
    in \" Fig 4\". If the 4-bit code from ith S_Box is 0000 and the 4-bit code from
    jth S_Box is 1001, then it is represented with hexadecimal numbers C and F respectively.
    Fig. 3. S_Box Operation for Bit Switching Show All TABLE III. Decimal to Hexadecimal
    Representation in S_box [5] Fig. 4. S_Box Operation for Bit Mapping Show All C.
    R_Keys Generation The process of generating the C_Text from the P_Text in the
    proposed algorithm happens in 31 rounds as mentioned in Algorithm 1. As mentioned
    in Table I, the size taken for M_key is 80-bit and the size for P_Text is 64-bit.
    In order to perform the XOR operation for P_Text, a R_Key of 64-bit is generated
    by taking 64 Most Significant Bits (MSB) from M_Key for the XOR operations. And
    for each round, the R_Key is updated using the following steps: The M_Key is right-rotated
    19 times. The first four MSB bits of the rotated M_Key i.e., MK79, MK78, MK77
    and MK76 are replaced with S_Box[MK79, MK78,MK77,MK76] values. The five bits of
    M_Key i.e.; MK19, MK18 MK17, MK16, MK15 are replaced by performing XOR operation
    of 5-bit M_key values MK19, MK18 MK17, MK16, and MK15 with a 5-bit round iteration
    (R_Iteration) value. For the ith round, the round iteration value will be i-1.
    After following the above three steps, the 64 MSB of the M_Key is considered as
    the R_Key for the next round. The R_Key value is updated 31 times, such that for
    every round a separate R_key is generated by right-rotating the bits 19 times
    in the M_Key and performing XOR with the round iteration value. The process of
    Key rotation and R_Keys generation [15] is represented in Algorithm 2. Algorithm
    2 R_Key Generation Algorithm D. Encryption In the process of encryption, the P_Text
    is given to the ELWC algorithm, and the C_Text is generated and is represented
    in \" Fig 5\". Fig. 5. Encryption in ELWC Show All Decryption is the inverse process
    of encryption where the C_Text is given to the ELWC algorithm, and the P_Text
    is generated and is represented in \" Fig 6\". Fig. 6. Decryption in ELWC Show
    All SECTION IV. Results and Discussions To implement the proposed algorithm, the
    sample data generated by the wearable IoT Fitbit wearable Device of one day is
    considered and is represented in Table V along with the required bits for data
    representation. TABLE IV. Embedded and Non-Embedded Representation of Sample IoT
    Device Data The sample data that is considered contains HT, DT, CB, SBP, DBP,
    GL, and ST. TABLE V. Bits Requirements for Sample IoT Device Data The proposed
    method embeds the data into a single 64-bit P_Text based on the bit requirements.
    The 64-bit P_Text generated for the sample data is [01010101 00000101 10110100
    01101110 01011010 01011010 00001011101110000]. The embedded form of the data is
    considered to reduce the encryption and decryption time. Once the data is embedded
    into a single P_Text, the encryption and decryption process is performed on the
    data. The proposed ELWC method is compared with the traditional PRESENT method
    that considers the P_Text individually. The data representation of the sample
    data in both the embedded way i.e.; the ELWC technique and the non-embedded way
    i.e.; the PRESENT technique is represented in Table IV. The time taken for encryption
    and decryption for embedded P_Text and non-embedded P_Text is represented in Table
    VI. In addition to one-day data, different durations of the IoT wearable device
    Fitbit data i.e.; the consolidated data for a week and a month is taken and the
    encryption and decryption are performed using the ELWC and PRESENT technique.
    TABLE VI. Encryption and Decryption Time Comparision The time taken by the ELWC
    technique for encrypting the embedded data of one-day device data, and consolidated
    data for a week and a month is represented in Table VII. TABLE VII. Encryption
    and Decryption Time Comparision for ELWC Technique The time taken by the PRESENT
    technique for encrypting the non-embedded data for one-day device data, and consolidated
    data for a week and a month is represented in Table VIII. TABLE VIII. Encryption
    and Decryption Time Comparision for Present Technique The graphical representation
    of the encryption and decryption times for three different durations i.e.; 1 Day,
    1 Week, and 1 Month are represented respectively in \" Fig 7\" and \" Fig 8\".
    From these figures, it is clear that the proposed ELWC algorithm performed better
    in terms of encryption and decryption time by embedding the data into a single
    plain text. The results have also proved that the proposed algorithm can reduce
    power consumption as it takes less time to perform encryption or decryption operations.
    The same concept of embedding can be applied to any other IoT Device data to reduce
    memory and also power consumption Fig. 7. Encryption and Decryption Time for Embedded
    Data Show All Fig. 8. Encryption and Decryption time for Non-Embedded Data Show
    All SECTION V. Conclusions and Future Works The paper proposes the ELWC technique
    to provide security to the data generated by IoT devices. IoT devices have a very
    limited capacity in terms of memory and power. The paper proposes an ELWC technique
    to perform encryption and decryption operations on the IoT wearable Fitbit device
    data. In this method, instead of considering 64-bit for every device data, the
    data is embedded into a single plain text by combining the various data items
    based on the bit-requirement size and is provided for encryption and decryption.
    The proposed method with embedded data is compared with the traditional LWC technique
    i.e.; PRESENT. The ELWC method performed better in terms of encryption and decryption
    time than the traditional method that uses the non-embedded data format. As further
    work, the proposed algorithm can be deployed in real-time devices to check feasibility
    and performance. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More Like

    IEEE Conference Location: Madurai, India SECTION I. Introduction Anomalies are
    instances or pieces of data that don’t conform to the norm. When information or
    occurrences are compared to a normative standard, anomalies can be uncovered using
    anomaly detection. This method of variation detection has the potential to reveal
    even previously unknown hazards. Nevertheless, the high detection rate of anomaly
    detection is offset by a high false alarm rate. The goal of many data mining techniques
    is to eliminate or drastically diminish the significance of outliers. Yet, doing
    so could potentially reveal private information. That’s why finding and analyzing
    outliers is such a fascinating data mining task: outlier mining. Data mining techniques,
    such as outlier detection, may prove challenging to execute in WSN due to the
    decentralized nature of the network’s nodes. Considering the streaming data at
    the sensor nodes just exacerbates the problems. The communication cost rules out
    doing outlier detection at the sink node. WSNs, which are comprised of a wide
    variety of small, low-cost sensor nodes, help with environmental monitoring and
    detection, allowing for better decision-making in real-world scenarios [1]Nevertheless,
    these holdups could be due to constraints on the node or the connection level
    hard climate,low energy, etc.). The authors of [2]suggest a mechanism based on
    an imperialist competitive algorithm that separates sensor nodes into cover sets
    in order to maintain very efficient monitoring of routing goals and, in doing
    so, extend the lifetime of sensors in WSN. To test this, they construct simulations
    in which nodes and targets are randomly spread around the sensing region. In order
    to provide up-to-the-minute data on a given area, sensors can build a wireless
    sensor network (WSN). Every component in this network is a node that can collect
    data and send it elsewhere. Low-cost sensors efficiently collect the felt data.
    In a sensor network, sensors can be strategically arranged or thrown into the
    mix at random. The detected data can be used with a variety of machine learning
    techniques to assist spot outliers. The machine learning techniques used to find
    anomalies can be broken down into two groups: supervised and unsupervised. Oftentimes,
    learning algorithms are applied to the observed data rather than the nodes themselves
    because of the restricted power available in sensors. The study figures out why
    the data is off by searching for outliers in the right places. Rule-based methods,
    statistical methods, machine learning methods, and data mining techniques are
    the four major categories into which anomaly detection methodologies fall when
    viewed analytically[3] [4]In data mining and machine learning, the classification
    method is a common and powerful tool. Rely node, sensor node, base station, actor
    node, and gateway are the main parts of a WSN system. Samples already collected
    will be used to teach the system how to place newly acquired information into
    one of several categories. Abnormal data collection is often more difficult than
    normal data collection. Hence, anomaly detection is a one-class classification
    problem. The idea behind this method is to first create a model through training
    on typical data, and then utilize this model to spot outliers. The data in a network
    is analyzed and compared to a huge library of previously detected attack signatures
    in inefficient detection methods, also known as signature-based detection methods
    (signatures). Maintaining an up-to-date database is challenging in sensor networks,
    but essential for detecting attacks that have not yet been catalogued. Anomaly
    detection strategies actively look for behavior that is out of the ordinary. Since
    these techniques may detect unknown forms of infiltration without requiring any
    prior information about them, they are ideal for use in sensor networks. An important
    challenge for anomaly detection techniques is determining what constitutes an
    outlier and what does not. Characteristics of a behavior used to determine its
    abnormality are the most important part of an anomaly detection system. In a nutshell,
    it is system-specific and depends on how often and how maliciously each system
    is attacked. Once the input is given It is preprocessed, Features were selected
    by using CFS and finally it is utilized to train the model. SECTION II. Literature
    Survey Several techniques [6] [7] [8]have been developed by researchers to identify
    anomalies in health records. There are a variety of existing methods, some of
    which include machine learning and data mining. The machine learning clustering
    algorithm K-NN is used in [9],but because to the huge amount of training data
    and computing complexity required, this method cannot be used to typical wireless
    sensors. Repeated calculations also require a lot of power. [5]provide an overview
    of outlier detection methods based on machine learning and data mining. Unsupervised
    methods range from those based on distance and density to those based on auto-associative
    neural networks and Hopfield networks. In [10],the authors present a method for
    detecting false alarms by mathematical calculations, with an emphasis on the application
    of this method to Cyber-Physical Systems [11]. One option to ensure beacon nodes
    are trustworthy is to verify their physical locations, however no viable solution
    has been proposed as of yet. [12]were the first to try to address this problem.
    It was suggested that radio waves and ultrasound be utilised in a technology called
    Echo to verify a node’s reported location. However, the Echo protocol does not
    verify the precise location of a sensor node, only that it is present within the
    area of interest.[13] presented a cluster-based technique for anomaly identification
    in WSN. With this method, you may find the ICD between any two clusters and the
    K nearest ones. If a cluster’s ICD is more extreme than the range of ICDs observed
    in the sample as a whole, we call it an outlier. The detection rate is low because
    of the cluster’s unusual growth. Research on embedded, networked devices (like
    WSNs) often use a consistent methodology: Since all the information is in one
    place, it’s much easier to find the anomalies. This, for instance, allows for
    a set of classifiers, each of which may excel in its own way with regard to some
    aspect of the system’s complicated dynamics [14]. Further, it enables the incorporation
    of advanced multivariate time-series transforms [15] or human reinforcement[16]
    as an additional detection approach in, for example, a big oceanic dataset. A
    growing backlog of patients in emergency rooms and a persistent scarcity of medical
    experts are just two examples of the difficulties posed by the world’s ever-increasing
    population when it comes to gaining access to quality healthcare. Owing to insufficient
    resources, many people go without the care they require. The rapid development
    of WSN and smart devices, along with the acute congestion caused by a large number
    of outpatients requiring little attention, has led to the emergence of a new industry
    for remote patient monitoring employing compact, wearable sensor systems. Researchers
    and scientists have invented a plethora of innovative methods in an effort to
    fulfil this demand, and these innovations may help alleviate the stress on healthcare
    practitioners and infrastructure. In [17]a distributed method of anomaly identification,
    anomalies are classified based on their local distribution, which is characterized
    by a hyper ellipsoid. The information contained in these hyper ellipsoids was
    subsequently transmitted to the command center. It is possible to summarize the
    fundamental patterns of distribution across the whole network as a sequence of
    local hyper ellipsoidal clusters. These hyper ellipsoidal clusters serve as the
    backbone of WSN anomaly detection. To alleviate the lengthy processing delays
    inherent in working with massive data-sets, a wavelet-based approach to anomaly
    detection was offered as a potential solution. Much research on outlier detection
    has been undertaken across several disciplines [18],including but not limited
    to machine learning, statistics, information theory, data mining and spectrum
    decomposition]. Many different types of clustering, statistical, spectral decomposition
    based outlier identification algorithms, nearest neighbor, and classification
    have been developed for WSNs [19]. We can classify distance-based and density-based
    AD schemes as special cases of KNN-based AD schemes. Instances of each class are
    provided as examples in the next section. When a multilayer detection (rather
    than a binary detection, i.e., normal or anomalous) of anomalous occurrences is
    desired, like in applications like ecommerce fraud detection [20],density-based
    AD was created to help. In addition, it excels when put to the test by training
    data with a wide range of densities. The local outlier factor (LOF) [21],a frequent
    metric parameter in density-based AD, can be computed using the local reachability
    density of the k nearest neighbors (KNN).[22]presented a system for processing
    and analyzing noisy sensor data. In specifically, they presented a Bayesian method
    for reducing random fluctuations in data in real time. Their approach entailed
    taking into account the known values for the correct sensor reading, the known
    noise characteristics of this sensor, and the observed noisy reading to arrive
    at a more accurate estimate. A sensor or the main station’s cleaning equipment
    could be used for this purpose. Numerous new methods, all of which utilize a statistical
    approach and are based on the authors’ proposed uncertainty models, have been
    published for addressing conventional database queries on top of uncertain sensor
    readings. The authors wrap things up by offering a preliminary evaluation of their
    proposed approach using synthetic data and highlighting some intriguing areas
    for future study. Bayesian belief networks were proposed by [23] as a means of
    discovering outliers in the data (BBNs). With this approach, BBNs are employed
    to keep track of the interdependencies between sensor node observations and interdependencies
    among sensor characteristic observations. A BBN is trained by each node using
    data collected from itself and its neighbours. One data point is considered an
    outlier if it deviates by a large amount from the average of its cohort. The precision
    of the BBN depends on the degree to which there are conditional relationships
    between the observations of sensor features. Considering the limited nature of
    network resources and the volatility of network topology, this strategy is doomed
    to failure. Being inspired by the above papers, the proposed approach uses SVM-RFE-MRMR
    for training the model. SECTION III. Proposed System A. Definition of Outlier
    and Anomaly An outlier is an individual or set of numbers that deviates significantly
    from the mean or median of a data set. An anomaly is a suspicious observation
    produced using a method distinct from that used to produce the remainder of the
    data. Yet, in anomaly detection, the terms anomaly and outlier are sometimes used
    interchangeably. Figure 1 shows the block diagram of proposed model. Fig. 1. Proposed
    Model Flow Diagram Show All B. Preprocessing of Data: 1) Normalization: By applying
    a scale to the attribute data, we can guarantee that it will fit inside the allowed
    range. There are a number of different normalization techniques, but one that
    will be very useful is Min-Max Normalization. With min-max normalization, a value
    C is turned into a range-conforming value D in the interval [C,0] . Here is the
    equation for s. C= (D−min value of D) ( max value of D−min value of D ) (D−C)+C..1
    (1) View Source Normalization and other forms of data pre-processing can considerably
    increase the likelihood of finding useful insights from the data before executing
    a machine learning or data mining method. To normalize data means to provide the
    same weight to all of its features. Normalization is of significant use in classification
    algorithms. 2) Discretization The process of converting the continuous domain
    of a feature into the discrete domain of discrete values is known as discretization
    [24]. It may be necessary to discretize continuous features up front if the classification
    technique cannot handle them. It’s also used to improve accuracy. The method uses
    M as a parameter to establish the range of categories. Each bin has its own distinct
    discrete value. With the equal-width binning method, the continuous range of a
    feature is segmented into bins of uniform width. The range of possible numbers,
    from least to maximum, is divided into N equally spaced intervals in EWD, with
    m typically set to 4. The range is divided into K sections, each one the same
    distance apart. W= (C−F) K …2 (2) View Source The interval width, W, is denoted
    by the numbers C and F, which, respectively, reflect the lo west and highest values
    for the characteristic. C. Feature Selection The process of feature selection
    is applying a criterion to a broad pool of potential characteristics in order
    to filter it down to a smaller, more manageable group. This technique gets rid
    of unnecessary features to boost classification accuracy and save computational
    expenses. 1) Correlation-based Feature Selection Correlation-based Feature Selection
    (CFS) is a straightforward filtering approach that use a heuristic evaluation
    function to rank feature subsets according to their correlation. High-correlation
    subsets with the class as a whole but low-correlation subsets with one another
    are rewarded by the evaluation function. The criterion function for subsets of
    features in CFS is as follows: Merit R = Krpg K+K(R−1) p − gg − − − − − − − −
    − − − − − − √ ⋯2 (3) View Source In this formula, MR represents the heuristic
    “merit” of a feature subset R made up of K features, Average feature-class correlation
    is denoted by the symbol rpg, and The average correlation between features is
    denoted by the symbol Pgg. The predictive power of a set of features for a given
    class is represented by the numerator, while feature redundancy is captured by
    the denominator. D. Training the Model: 1) SVM-RFE: SVM-RFE was initially developed
    to classify cancers by ranking genes based on gene expression data. The backward
    feature elimination method used is SVM-RFE. The candidate feature subset will
    not include a feature with a lower ranking score after all features have first
    been sorted according to their ranking scores. Similar to the above approach,
    the remaining features are sorted until one is left in the candidate feature subset
    before the SVM is literally trained on the new candidate feature subset. The decision
    function of the SVM is expressed as g(z)= v s z+d . where v= v 1 , v 2 ,…. v n
    is a vector and is a scalar. More specifically, given the training dataset {(
    z k , x k ) } M k=1 , x k where is the training sample, x i ∈ R D , y i ∈{−1,+1}
    , is the class label of, is the number of training samples, and is the feature
    dimension of the sample. The dual optimization issue of SVM can be expressed as
    by using the kernel trick min&& 1 2 ∑ k=1 M ∑ i=1 M β k β i z k z i L( z k ⋅ z
    i )− ∑ i=1 M β k (1) View Source when there is a trade-off between the model complexity
    and training accuracy [25]. The weight coefficients of features are used in SVM
    to determine how important they are: V= ∑ i=1 M β k z k y k (2) View Source where
    β k is the optimal value found by solving the optimization problem in (12). Ranking
    score of ith features in SVM-RFE is defined as d k = v 2 k (3) View Source By
    evaluating the weight of features, it is implied that the ranking criteria can
    determine how closely features and decisions correlate. Despite the fact that
    SVM-RFE may remove those unimportant features one at a time, it is highlighted
    that the question of whether the features that have been removed are redundant
    needs to be addressed. The paper introduces MRMR to overcome the problem 2) Minimum
    Redundancy Maximum Relevance (MRMR) By defining maximum relevance criteria and
    minimum redundancy requirements, respectively, MRMR measures the maximum sample
    information and the smallest relevance among features. The ranking score for each
    feature can be attained through MRMR Let q(z,x) be the joint probability density
    of and given two feature vectors q(z) and q(x) with probability densities z and
    x. The term “their mutual information” (MI), which quantifies feature redundancy,
    is defined as follows: L(z,x)=q(z,x)log∬p q(z,x) q(z)q(x) dzdx (3) View Source
    The calculation of the maximum relevance and minimum redundancy is minP(H),P=
    1 |G | 2 ∑ g q , g m ∈F L( g q , g m ) (4) View Source maxE(G,d),E= 1 |G| ∑ g
    q ∈g L( g p ,d) (5) View Source Where d is class label, L( g p ,d) represents
    the MI of feature gp and class label d,L( g q , g m ) represents the MI of feature
    and feature, E is the mean of MI, and represents the MI among the features. Where
    |G| and G denote feature set and the number of features in, respectively. max
    Φ 1 (F,R), Φ 1 =F−R max Φ 2 (F,R), Φ 2 = F R (5) View Source By using the following
    two criteria, MRMR seeks to provide features with a minimum of redundancy and
    a maximum of relevance: 3) SVM-RFE-MRMR: According to the above introduction,
    MRMR may produce the features with the least amount of redundancy and the most
    amount of relevance, while SVM-RFE just considers the relationship between features
    and decisions, neglecting the relationship among features. To produce a subset
    of features with the least amount of redundancy and the most amount of relevance,
    SVM-RFE-MRMR is therefore proposed. In addition to the ranking criterion defined
    by SVM-RFE, SVM-RFE-MRMR defines an additional feature criterion that is developed
    by q k = L( g q ,d) (1/|G|) ∑ g m ∈G L( g q , g m ) (6) View Source The characteristics
    that are kept in each iteration are where G. By standardizing the SVM-RFE and
    MRMR criteria for each feature, a ranking score is created, i.e. d ¯ k q ¯ k =
    d k d ∗ k = q ∗ k q ∗ k (7) View Source Where d ∗ k = max k , d k , q ∗ k = max
    k , q k SECTION IV. Result and Discussion Model generalizability, data fitting
    accuracy, and training efficiency are all impacted by a number of independent
    factors. Both the number of features and the number of hidden nodes should be
    kept to a reasonable level; generally speaking, there shouldn’t be more features
    than there are input dimensions. None of those is good for you, so avoid them.
    Fig. 2. Accuracy Comparision of the Models Show All When discussing machine learning,
    accuracy is defined as the percentage of times a model correctly labels a set
    of observations. The accuracy and reliability of a model are two metrics by which
    its performance can be evaluated. Accuracy is the proportion of relevant results
    that were correctly classified as such, and it is a measure of how well your algorithm
    performs. A statistical technique known as cross-validation is used to evaluate
    a model’s ability to predict and generalize using data that is different from
    the data used to create the model and the data used to test it. Figure 1 and Figure
    2 show comparisons of the accuracy and specificity of the SVM, the CNN, and the
    Fig. 3. Specifity Comparision of the Models Show All Recognizability-wise, SVM-RFE-MRMR
    outperforms both the CNN and SVM. Tab le 1 demonstrates the dramatic improvement
    in recognition accuracy from 92.83 percent to 97.55 percent. TABLE I Comparision
    Of Models (%) Table I presents the results of a model selection procedure, which
    yielded the three models (CNN, SVM, and SVM-RFE-MRMR) as plausible options. The
    results of the experiments demonstrate that the SVM -RFEMRMR algorithm model outperforms
    the other three models by a wide margin. Fig. 4. Accuracy Comparision of SVM-RFE-MRMR
    Model Show All Accuracy of 99% is reached after 150 testing epochs and 98% after
    12 training epochs, as shown in Figure 3. Fig. 5. Epoch Vs Loss Comparision of
    RELM Model Show All Loss of the model is shown as a function of time in Figure
    4, with a high at 0.7 during training and a dip at 0.65 during testing. At 0.65
    seconds, the detection process completed after 650.271 seconds. When compared
    to SVM (93.87% accuracy) and CNN (95.38% accuracy), recommended SVM-RFE-MRMR based
    anomaly detection methodology performs significantly better. Several analyses
    have shown that the suggested SVM-RFE-MRMR based anomaly detection approach is
    both workable and has promising results. SECTION V. Conclusion: Several physical
    properties are monitored and measured in harsh, out-of-the-way places by means
    of wireless sensor networks. Because of the importance of accurate sensing data
    to the success of these applications, effective methods for locating sensor abnormalities
    are in high demand. The difficulty in locating such answers stems from the difficulty
    in precisely characterizing the proper sensor behavior in a dynamic and multifaceted
    setting. Preprocessing, Feature Extraction, and SVM-RFE-MRMR Model Training were
    the three phases used in the proposed model. When compared to other models, such
    as CNN and SVM, the proposed models performed admirably. Improve accuracy and
    decrease processing time with a hybrid model like CNN+ELM in the future. Authors

    New information and communication technologies (ICT), mainly Internet and mobile
    technology, have become indispensable in most sectors of modern societies, including
    the health care sector [1]. The Internet, the network of networks, was previously
    limited to computers. Nowadays, with the advent of the digital revolution, almost
    all devices and objects are connected to the Internet, hence the advent of the
    Internet of things. According to the International Telecommunication Union, the
    Internet of things (IoT) is a “global infrastructure for the information society,
    enabling advanced services by interconnecting objects (physical or virtual) through
    existing or evolving interoperable information and communication technologies.”
    The IoT is applied to several domains. There are five most connected sectors which
    are IoT security of goods and people, connected health, connected transport, smart
    grids and smart cities. In this study, we will focus more on connected health.
    The health sector is also experiencing changes induced by the Internet of things.
    The global market for medical sensors is expected to reach $27.7 billion by 2026
    and to grow by 9.9% over the next few years, according to Transparency Market
    Research [2]. The problematic at the outset posed to conduct this research is
    which bibliometric database to choose for our study and the reasons for this choice.
    We chose the Dimensions database and the VOSviewer software. VOSviewer software
    [3] facilitates access to bibliometric mapping from Dimensions, Scopus and Web
    of Science data. On other side, Dimensions is a bibliometric database developed
    by Digital Science. It allows to export bibliometric data while searching for
    scholarly articles, book chapters and is accessible at app.dimensions.ai [4].
    The research questions addressed in this paper are: What are the most relevant
    sources in the area of IoT security and data protection for hospital information
    systems? Which country and university had published more papers? Which authors
    and papers have been consulted the most? What are the three most cited references
    and authors? Our paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 presents the methodology
    of our work, and Sect. 3 deals with bibliometric results. Subsequently, Sect.
    4 presents the contributions, and Sect. 5 highlights the limitations. Finally,
    Sect. 6 points out the conclusion and the future work. 2 Methodology In this paper,
    the extraction of data in the Dimensions database for the bibliometric study was
    performed on December 20, 2021, and updated on March 12, 2022. The search string
    used for the extraction is: IoT AND Data AND Security AND Protection AND Hospitals
    AND Information Systems. After the export and download, the downloaded file is
    zipped and extracted into a.csv file used in VOSviewer in order to establish the
    different possible joins allowing to bring out the result of each combination
    represented as graphs and bibliometric methods for the analysis of 4743 published
    articles. The research focused on the most cited sources, co-authorship networks,
    co-authorship, co-citations and citations. The tables, graphs and histograms obtained
    are analyzed and interpreted. 3 Bibliometric Results This section presents and
    discusses the key findings from our bibliometric study. The 20 most relevant sources
    in the field of IoT data security and protection for hospital information systems
    are represented in Table 1. The most relevant source is the IEEE access source,
    with 283 published documents. This does not surprise us since it has a lead over
    other sources in the area of IoT-based smart health [5]. This is because many
    journals focus on IoT, sensors and health, but few are used in the field of IoT-based
    smart health. We can say that even most of the journals such as journal of network
    and computer applications, computer networks, journal of medical systems have
    not found the importance of focusing on research in the field of IoT-based smart
    health, which is because IoT-based smart health research has not yet had a great
    influence. Table 1 Top 20 of relevant sources Full size table Encyclopedia of
    big data came in second position with 244 papers, followed by lecture notes in
    computer science with 159 papers and then sensors journal with 129 papers. The
    IEEE Internet of things journal is in fifth position. Table 1 shows the 20 most
    relevant sources, and Fig. 1 illustrates all sources. Fig. 1 Source illustration
    Full size image 3.1 Co-Authorship Network A person can be cited as the author
    of a particular publication for many reasons other than research collaboration.
    Because of the accessibility and other advantages of bibliometric data, co-authorship
    is often used as an indicator of research collaboration [6]. Co-authorship networks
    [7] are networks consisting of nodes called authors and a link indicating joint
    publications. They are social networks consisting of a large amount of data and
    allow the analysis of social phenomena in general. In Table 2, we notice that
    the author zaidan, b. b. has the highest total link strength equal to 40. So,
    he is the one who has published the most in collaboration with all other authors
    in the field of IoT data security and protection for hospital information systems.
    Table 2 Top 20 of relevant co-authorship Full size table Table 2 shows the 20
    most relevant co-authorship, as well as Fig. 2 which is an illustration. Fig.
    2 Co-authorship illustration Full size image 3.2 Co-Authorship and Universities
    The largest value of total link strength in this representation is 98, and this
    value represents King Saud University. According to Fig. 3, this university has
    published fewer papers than the Vellore Institute of Technology. Indeed, Vellore
    Institute of Technology University has published more papers than King Saud University.
    Figure 3 presents the histogram of 20 most relevant co-authorship and organizations.

    and Countries The majority of the research was done in the USA, and the total
    link strength is 636. Furthermore, 690 publications have been made and have been
    cited 41,130 times. So, we can stress that the USA is a reference in the field
    of IoT data security and protection for hospital information systems. Figures
    4 and 5 present the 20 most relevant co-authorship and countries. The number of
    co-authorships per country is decreasing from the USA to Australia but is almost
    stable between South Korea and Pakistan, as well as between Malaysia and France
    with an average percentage of 94.6. It is almost stable from Portugal to Greece.

    in scientific research as it allows us to identify the most relevant sources in
    the field of IoT security and data protection for hospital information systems
    to determine the authors and the most consulted documents in this field. Any researcher
    who wants to undertake a study on IoT data security and protection for hospital
    information systems could be better oriented from this bibliometric study. From
    our study, we notice that even major journals have not found the importance of
    focusing on IoT-based smart health research because it seems that this field has
    not yet got a great influence. Aware of the realities, major journals will now
    be even more interested in the fact that health is priceless. 5 Limitations We
    used the Dimensions database and VOSviewer software for our study. The database
    Dimensions may not be sufficient for a comprehensive study. The Web of Science
    (WoS) database and the bibliometrics tool could also have been used for our study.
    Therefore, other studies can adopt software such as CiteSpace, BibExcel, Eigenfactor
    Score, R package, among others, which are common and effective software used to
    obtain quantitative and visual information and mapping in certain fields. 6 Conclusion
    and Future Work A bibliometric analysis conducted from 2012 to 2022 shows that
    the field of IoT-based smart health research born from 2014 and continues to grow.
    This study provides important knowledge support for further research. It provides:
    the most relevant sources in the field of IoT security and data protection for
    hospital information systems, the country and university with the most published
    articles, the most consulted authors and papers, the three most cited references
    and authors. Our future work will focus on the state of the art of IoT data security
    and protection for hospital information systems that play a very important role
    in online healthcare systems allowing patients to be monitored ubiquitously. However,
    effective and reliable security mechanisms are not yet properly implemented on
    these sensors due to their limited energy and computing power [8]. A comparative
    study performed from different databases and software such as WoS and bibliometrix
    tool on the one hand and Dimensions and VOSviewer on the other hand would allow
    us to know which database provides more relevant information. References Martínez-Alcalá,

    IdentityTrusted data sharing 1. Introduction Agriculture is the primary sector
    in the economy that provides food security and a source of livelihood, while contributing
    to the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This accounts for 4% of world GDP
    (World Bank, 2018) and its contributions toward economic growth in developing
    countries such as India were around 20.2% in 2021 (Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers
    Welfare, 2021). Recent United Nations (UN) estimates show that nearly 690 million
    or 8.9% of the world’s population are reeling under hunger. The impact of climate
    change on food production would push an additional 135 million people to suffer
    from acute hunger (United Nations Organization, 2019). According to the Food and
    Agricultural Organization (FAO), close to 2.5 billion people are directly dependent
    on agriculture as the source of their livelihood (Food and Agriculture Organization,
    2016). Over the past two to three decades, rapid industrialization and unabated
    global warming have resulted in rising agricultural risks that hamper global food
    production. Multi-faceted agricultural risks can be classified as production,
    market, institutional, financial, and personal risks based on the source of risk
    evolution (Komarek et al., 2020). The production risks are caused primarily by
    extreme weather events, disease, pest infestation, and soil conditions. These
    production risks may cause severe losses in crop yield and lead to marginal farmers’
    financial bankruptcy. In recent years, production risks induced by extreme heat
    waves, drought and terrible flooding in larger parts of Europe, China, India and
    other South Asian countries have exacerbated food crisis and ruined livelihood
    of millions of farmers (World Meteorological Organization, 2022). In particular,
    33.9 million hectares of cropped area in India were damaged between 2015–16 and
    2021–22 due to meteorological calamities (Gupta, 2022). The highest priority is
    given to mitigating production risks as they endanger food security and financial
    need for particular geographies (Anandhi et al., 2016). To effectively understand
    and handle the risk environment, different target groups/stakeholders comprised
    of farmers (farmer community organization), policymakers (government and planners),
    and service providers (insurers, bankers, and input suppliers) must actively participate
    in risk mitigation processes. A holistic risk management strategy is required
    to assess and manage risks by adopting informal techniques at the farm level to
    formal techniques in decision-making (Duong et al., 2019). Agriculture insurance
    is a well-identified and formal risk management strategy that can sustain farmers’
    income and hedge against financial losses due to production risks. However, for
    two reasons, agricultural insurance is not widely adopted in developing countries.
    First, the lack of trusted agricultural data sharing platforms and information
    asymmetries discourage insurers from developing higher-quality insurance schemes.
    Second, smallholder farmers are reluctant to insure their crops due to limited
    awareness, high premium costs, delays, and lack of transparency in the payout
    process. There are different methods in practice to collect weather, soil, and
    crop management data influencing agricultural production risks. In many developing
    countries, manual methods like Crop Cutting Experiments (CCEs) are still prevalent
    to estimate production risks. This is labor and resource intensive and has a prolonged
    data collection time (Soyka et al., 2016). Data tampering and falsification are
    the most common errors in CCE. With the foray of Information and Communication
    Technology (ICT), many countries have agricultural information systems to retrieve
    and share agricultural data. These digitized systems are managed by a single organization
    that uses centralized ledgers to record the collection and sharing of data. The
    centralized information systems suffer from a single point of failure, correlatable
    authentication identity, lack of data provenance, loss of privacy, and unauthorized
    data access (Dey and Shekhawat, 2021). With advances in smart farming practices
    across the globe, there has been a gradual increase in the adoption of Internet
    of Things (IoT) devices for the real-time monitoring and sharing of on-farm data
    for risk assessment and decision-making. Specifically, IoT devices used in farm
    data collection are prone to multiple security and privacy attacks, and the data
    shared may not be reliable for further processing (Ferrag et al., 2020). Regulations
    and guidelines such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (GDPR European
    Union, 2018), Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, Reusability (FAIR)
    (Wilkinson et al., 2016), and the EU code of conduct 2018 (van der Burg et al.,
    2020) have mandated certain trust factors such as authentication, data provenance,
    integrity, privacy, and access control to be met by agricultural data sharing
    systems. Adopting the Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is needed to ensure
    trust factors and address the issues of centralized IoT agricultural data sharing.
    Promising and revolutionary DLTs like blockchain aid in achieving trust in agricultural
    IoT data sharing for production risk assessment (Food and Agriculture Organization,
    2019). Blockchain eliminates the need for a centralized authority and remove the
    dependence on trusted third parties. However, having a device-controlled and cryptographically
    verifiable Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) with a robust credential system leverages
    the effectiveness of blockchain in attaining trust factors. The synergy of SSI-based
    Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) with blockchain
    helps realize robust authentication, enhanced privacy, data provenance, and integrity
    for trusted agricultural IoT data sharing. The credentials issued for agricultural
    data sharing with cryptographic constructs guarantee data ownership and irrefutable
    distributed trust. The primary application component of blockchain is smart contracts,
    which is self-executing code that triggers an automated payout to farmers on satisfying
    predefined conditions in agricultural risk assessment. The parametric agricultural
    insurance can be flexibly deployed as smart contracts that cover predefined loss
    events related to weather conditions, crop yield, or soil conditions. As blockchain
    is deterministic and closed system, smart contracts cannot acquire real-world
    risk-related data from agricultural IoT devices for decision-making. An interface
    or a data feed called an oracle is required to read data and events from the outside
    world and deliver them to smart contracts for processing (Moudoud et al., 2019).
    A decentralized oracle-based access control mechanism is required to feed DID-VC
    trusted data securely and assess production risks. This mechanism significantly
    speeds up agricultural insurance payout processes, leading to effective risk management
    strategy implementations. 1.1. Motivation Marginal farmers’ resilience to agricultural
    production risks can be increased by digitizing and automating insurance payouts
    with the help of smart contracts. This assists to cover farmers’ financial losses
    in a time-bound manner and reduces income loss while removing human intervention
    and expediting risk assessment processes. However, this requires gathering production
    risk-related data from multiple agricultural IoT devices. Further, data must be
    shared in a trusted manner for risk assessment and decision-making. The key features
    of blockchain technology, such as decentralization, immutability, traceability,
    and transparency, make it a suitable candidate to address the trust challenges
    required for IoT data sharing and its access. Furthermore, integrating blockchain
    with SSI-based DID and VC can realize trustworthiness in data sharing. Besides
    this, automated payouts to farmers using insurance contracts require a decentralized
    oracle to securely access risk data. Therefore, this work proposes an AgriSSIOracle
    framework for trusted agricultural IoT data sharing and decentralized oracle-based
    data access for production risk management. 1.2. Contributions The major contributions
    of this research work are given as follows: • We initially develop a method for
    privacy preserved authentication and data provenance in agricultural IoT devices
    using DID- and VC-based device data credentials. • We demonstrate a trusted agricultural
    IoT data sharing scheme based on device data credentials using publish–subscribe
    and request–response communication patterns. • We develop a secure decentralized
    oracle-based data access for smart contracts to automate agricultural production
    risk management using insurance. • We conduct security and privacy analysis of
    the framework and provide performance evaluation in terms of transaction throughput,
    latency, credential issue-verify-revoke time, and resource utilization. The rest
    of the paper is organized into following sections: Section 2 gives the background
    related to blockchain and SSI, blockchain oracles, IoT data communication patterns
    and cryptographic primitives. Section 3 describes the existing works related to
    trusted IoT data sharing and oracle-based data access. Section 4 gives overview
    of AgriSSIOracle framework. It details processes for DID and VC based trusted
    agricultural IoT data sharing and secure data access using decentralized oracle.
    Section 5 gives the implementation details and shows the results obtained. It
    provides the performance evaluation for the framework along with security and
    privacy analysis. Section 6 offers the conclusion with the potential scope for
    future research. 2. Background 2.1. Blockchain and Self-Sovereign Identity Blockchain
    is peer-to-peer system that records transactions into a distributed ledger that
    is secured, trusted, transparent, disintermediated, and immutable, which can be
    updated only by consensus of peers. The addition of programming capabilities to
    a blockchain enhances its applicability in domains such as agriculture, healthcare,
    governance, finance, education, supply chain, and entertainment. The technical
    features of blockchain have made it suitable to conceive a user-controlled digital
    identity and credential system. Efforts from the Internet Identity Workshop (IIW)
    and other digital identity communities have resulted in the realization of SSI
    based on blockchain (Preukschat and Hardman, 2021). The SSI is the concept where
    user/IoT devices own their identity-related data and decide when and how it has
    to be shared with others in a trusted way. There is no role for centralized systems
    in storing data and transferring it to third parties upon request. With SSI, anyone
    can verify the claims about identity and data shared with cryptographic validity.
    The SSI is mapped onto Internet Protocol (IP) architecture to enable trusted transactions
    between stakeholders. The DIDs and VCs form the basic building blocks of the SSI
    stack. The DID is a unique global identifier that is cryptographically verifiable,
    decentralized, and human-readable. This can be assigned to any person, organization,
    or device (Hughes et al., 2019). The core properties of DIDs comply with the identity
    principles promoted by SSI. The DID format is similar to the Uniform Resource
    Identifier (URI) [either Uniform Resource Locator (URL) or Uniform Resource Name
    (URN)], which points to an entity identified by DID. The DID syntax is made up
    of three components such as schema, DID method, and DID method-specific string
    separated by a colon. For example, did:example:123456789abcdefghijk. Resolving
    a specific DID point to a document that consists of optional elements such as
    an identifier, public keys, authentication proof, holder’s signature, service
    endpoints, and other metadata. The DID methods can be broadly classified as ledger-based/public
    DIDs, ledger-middleware DIDs, peer DIDs, static DIDs, and alternative DIDs. The
    public and peer DIDs are extensively used in recognizing the entity/device. Public
    DIDs are disclosed to everyone and registered in the blockchain ledger. In contrast,
    peer DIDs are private and used to establish one-to-one contextual relationships
    between peers. Verifiable credentials are tamper-proof evidence for claims made
    by the identity owner, which can be cryptographically verified without relying
    on a centralized authority (Sporny et al., 2019). The VC data model is standardized
    by W3C and provides a universally expressible data format that allows any entity
    to create digital attestations about identity owners. The ecosystem of VCs includes
    various components such as the subject (entity whose attributes are listed in
    claims), issuer (entity that issues credentials to the claims made about the subject),
    holder (entity that holds the VC), verifier (entity that receives VCs from holders
    for claims about the subject), and verifiable data registry (universally accessible
    distributed registry required to hold data and metadata required for VC operations).
    For example, a device manufacturer can issue a credential to an IoT device regarding
    its authenticity and provenance to share agricultural data with interested government
    agencies/insurers/bankers. Currently, the three credential formats that are widely
    used include JavaScript Object Notation-Linked Data (JSON-LD), JSON Web Tokens
    (JWTs), and Indy Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP). 2.2. Blockchain oracles An oracle
    is an intermediary between the blockchain and off-chain real-world data sources
    that query and verify external data and deliver them to smart contracts. Smart
    contracts deployed in diversified domains such as agricultural insurance, supply
    chains, and governance need oracles to read real-world data as blockchain cannot
    access the data directly. The design and characteristics of an oracle vary between
    application domains depending on the type of data source, trust model, design
    of query/response patterns, and type of interaction model (Al-Breiki et al., 2020).
    Data streamed to oracles may come from different sources such as online from the
    internet (software oracle), physically from devices (hardware oracle), or individuals
    possessing specific skillsets (human oracle). The design of an oracle with a centralized
    trust source leads to a single point of failure, which suffers from availability
    and reliability issues. A decentralized trust model achieves trustworthiness by
    sharing the responsibility for the accuracy and validity of data between distributed
    participants. Existing request-response, publish-subscribe, or push-pull models
    are used to design query/response patterns in oracles. Oracles are inbound or
    outbound based on the direction of information flow and interactions with the
    blockchain. Inbound oracles retrieve data from external sources into smart contracts
    in the blockchain, whereas outbound oracles send data from smart contracts back
    to the external world. 2.3. IoT data communication patterns and cryptographic
    primitives The agricultural IoT devices are deployed in remote locations for real-time
    monitoring of physical parameters such as weather, soil conditions, and crop management
    features associated with the farmland. Generally, the IoT devices have different
    protocols embedded in the network stack that allows seamless data transmission
    from edge to cloud. However, specific communication patterns frequently used by
    IoT devices are request-response, publish-subscribe. Request-response is a communication
    pattern where a client (cloud device) requests the data from the server (edge
    device) with the help of GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE operations. The publish-subscribe
    pattern involves a publisher (edge device), broker and subscriber (cloud device)
    in the communication workflow. A publisher is a source of data that publishes
    data on particular topics managed by the broker. Subscribers are the consumers
    of data who subscribe to the topics created by the broker. Cryptographic primitives
    are the basic building blocks for SSI-based blockchain infrastructure to secure
    transactions, maintain data integrity, verify data sources and transactions, and
    prepare privacy-preserving proofs (Zundel and Zouarhi, 2021). In developing a
    trustworthy system, data confidentiality is of utmost importance and is achieved
    through encryption and decryption techniques. Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem (ECC)
    is the preferred choice to attain confidentiality for transactions and messages,
    and the hash function generates a fixed-length unique value that ensures integrity.
    The SHA512 and Keccak512 hashing algorithms are used exhaustively in blockchain
    and SSI environments. Digital signatures create cryptographic trust regarding
    the authenticity of communicating peers. Digital signatures such as Elliptic Curve
    Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) and Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm
    (EdDSA) are used in DID authentication. Specifically, in the VC ecosystem issuers
    use Camenisch-Lysyanskaya(CL) and BBS+ signatures to sign each verifiable credential.
    Cryptographic proofs are used in the SSI ecosystem for privacy-based disclosure
    of computational facts. Proofs are produced with the Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)
    cryptography whose goal is the selective disclosure of messages without revealing
    the value. Here, the prover offers proof to the verifier that a valid signature
    exists for holding the secret value. Download : Download high-res image (673KB)

    framework. 3. Related work Trust is an extensively studied concept in different
    disciplines such as sociology, economics and computer science. Specifically, the
    trust management required for IoT devices has been explored earlier (Yan et al.,
    2014). However, the formalization and quantification of the trust paradigm is
    a complex task in geographically distributed IoT devices. Trust for IoT can be
    analyzed from two perspectives. One is the user/human trust, and the other is
    system trust (Byabazaire et al., 2020). User trust is the subjective expectation
    about the behavior of a particular entity in the future, whereas system trust
    is deeply rooted in technology. System trust is also more quantifiable, expressible,
    and justifiable in an undeniable way. For trust-based IoT data sharing, system
    trust attributes such as identity and authentication, privacy, data provenance
    and integrity, privacy, and access control need to be considered (Kumar and Sharma,
    2021). Many researchers have begun perceiving the concept of decentralization
    through blockchain and investigating its role in leveraging trust factors for
    IoT systems. Khalid et al. (2020) derived a lightweight blockchain-based IoT device
    authentication and access control scheme based on asymmetric cryptography and
    smart contracts. Malik et al. (2019) devised three-layered trustchain architecture
    for authentication and access control in IoT devices based on reputation scores.
    Singh et al. (2021) developed a cross-domain data sharing framework using blockchain
    for industrial IoT domains. This framework focused on data source authentication
    and integrity. Particularly, there is little empirical work available for trust-enabled
    agricultural IoT data sharing using blockchain. The study by Lu et al. (2020)
    focused on describing a decentralized architecture for agricultural IoT data sharing
    and its components without pragmatic implementation. Studies by Rahman et al.
    (2020) and Abraham and Santosh Kumar (2020) illustrated the use of smart contract-based
    secure agricultural data sharing using decentralized file system and blockchain.
    For agricultural data sharing, a blockchain-centered cross-regional big data platform
    was developed by Zhu and Li (2021) for sustainable ecological development. Patel
    and Shrimali (2021) proposed the AgriOnBlock framework to securely share IoT data
    with smart contracts to automate supply chains and insurance processes. However,
    the issue with these decentralized schemes is that they depend on centralized
    identifiers for authentication and lack privacy-preserved data provenance for
    shared data. The SSI community has taken pioneering steps in conceiving the first
    truly decentralized identity that adheres to all identity principles. A white
    paper on SSI and IoT by the Sovrin foundation discussed various opportunities
    to integrate SSI with existing or evolving use cases in IoT ecosystems (The Sovrin
    Foundation, 2020). Kortesniemi et al. (2019) successfully demonstrated the idea
    of integrating DIDs with IoT by delegating device authentication and authorization
    operations to a trusted proxy using the OAuth2 protocol. A lightweight triple-trusting
    architecture comprised of DID authentication, access control and integrity is
    proposed by Shi et al. (2019) for IoT data sharing. Fan et al. (2020) implemented
    decentralized identity and access control framework for a tamper-evident and interoperable
    registry to maintain the life cycle of IoT devices. Samir et al. (2021) showed
    a trust-based SSI identity management services for IoT devices that incorporated
    a secret sharing scheme with smart contracts on the blockchain. The tradechain
    framework (Malik et al., 2021) decoupled the traceability of trade data records
    in supply chain systems from their identity by adopting SSI principles. Diego
    et al. (2021) analyzed and evaluated the feasibility of the IoT-as-a-Service (IoTaaS)
    business model with SSI schemes to enhance the privacy of the identity space.
    For data sharing between untrusted participants in off-grid networks, an SSI-based
    infrastructure is formulated and implemented through the existing Hyperledger
    blockchain framework (Niavis et al., 2020). These SSI-based mechanisms are efficient
    in offering privacy-preserved authentication and data provenance. However, they
    do not ensure secure access of data to smart contracts using oracles. An oracle
    solution has been proposed by various authors and organizations in the form of
    frameworks or standalone applications for trust-based off-chain data access into
    domain-specific on-chain smart contracts. Early efforts to develop oracles began
    with a centralized trust model where authenticity proofs verify third parties
    before feeding data into smart contracts. Kochovski et al. (2019) developed trust
    management architecture for secure access to IoT data for smart contracts using
    centralized trustless oracles. Provable  (Provable, 2019) and TownCrier (Zhang
    et al., 2016) are the instances of a centralized oracle where authenticity proofs
    generated from the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) guarantee data trust. In
    the decentralized trust model for oracles, various off-chain components agree
    regarding data trustworthiness with the help of different data processing mechanisms.
    Aggregation-based oracles collect data from multiple sources based on a predefined
    logic and aggregate them to provide quality data by removing malicious data. Reputation-based
    oracles associate reputation scores with oracle nodes based on data quality. Chainlink
    (Ellis et al., 2017) is an example of both aggregation-based and reputation-based
    oracles. Decentralized agricultural insurance organizations like Etherisc (Mussenbrock
    et al., 2018) and Arbol (Jha et al., 2018) have developed decentralized weather-indexed
    insurance products using the chainlink oracle network for secure access to risk-related
    data. Al Breiki et al. (2019) developed a trust-based oracle to access IoT data
    depending on the reputation score of devices. Band Protocol (Band Protocol, 2019)
    uses the staking method by pledging a certain amount of assets as a stake to enable
    penalties for malicious activity and validate participants in a decentralized
    oracle network. The ASTREA (Adler et al., 2018) provides data feed from multiple
    oracles based on the outcome of the voting process for data truthfulness. These
    data processing mechanisms for decentralized oracles make data visible to all
    processing oracle nodes. As a result, secure and privacy-preserved data access
    is not facilitated for smart contracts. Zhang et al. (2020) designed and developed
    a Decentralized Oracle (DECO) working model for data provenance of websites accessed
    via Transport Layer Security (TLS) using a three-party handshake, two-party computation,
    and ZKPs. A framework called CLOAK was proposed by Ren et al. (2021) to deploy
    confidential smart contracts by preserving privacy with the help of multiparty
    computation. Table 1 compares existing works in the literature based on trust
    attributes like authentication, identity management, data provenance, privacy,
    and access control. Table 1. Comparison of trust attributes focused by existing

    Methods 4.1. AgriSSIOracle framework This section proposes an AgriSSIOracle framework
    to achieve DID- and VC-based trusted agricultural IoT data sharing and provides
    a secure decentralized oracle-based data access for smart contracts in agricultural
    production risk management. Fig. 1 provides a detailed overview of the framework.
    At a high level, the framework can be divided into two planes: data and control.
    The data plane is comprised of different layers, such as the perception layer
    (data sensing), edge layer (local data storage at the farm level), and cloud layer
    (collection of various farm data). The control plane is comprised of the blockchain
    required to enable trust factors in a decentralized way. The framework encompasses
    infrastructural components, such as a permissioned identity blockchain for privacy-preserved
    authentication, data provenance, credential-based data sharing; a public blockchain
    for agricultural production risk assessment with smart contract-based agricultural
    insurance; an IoT edge device for on-farm data sensing and storage; decentralized
    off-chain data storage, and a decentralized oracle. The primary actors involved
    in this framework are the stewards, issuer, holder, verifier, and accessor. In
    a typical agricultural value chain in developing countries, the government authority
    (Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare) plays the role of stewards to
    define a governance model for trusted data sharing. The issuer certifies the IoT
    device data authenticity by issuing the required credentials. The issuers are
    authorized and approved by stewards through the onboarding process. A device manufacturer
    or farmer organization can maintain and operate the required information for the
    issuing device data credentials. The holder is the IoT edge device deployed in
    the farm that wants to share its data for risk assessment. The verifier checks
    the correctness of the IoT device data credentials before collecting the data
    and storing it in the cloud agent’s data storage. The government agricultural
    agencies at the district/county level are the verifiers. An accessor is an entity
    willing to securely access IoT agricultural data for risk assessment in smart
    contracts. The primary processes involved in realizing this framework are (i)
    DID connection establishment between communicating agents, (ii) device registration,
    (iii) issuing and revoking credentials, (iv) verifying credentials, (v) data sharing,
    and (vi) secure decentralized oracle-based data access. Download : Download high-res

    DID connection, device registration, issuing and revoking device data credentials.
    4.2. DID and VC based trusted agricultural IoT data sharing DIDs and VCs needed
    to realize trusted agricultural IoT data sharing are built around permissioned
    identity blockchain. An identity blockchain defines a decentralized network for
    hierarchically and geographically distributed stakeholders of agricultural IoT
    ecosystem. The IoT devices deployed in farmlands generate data related to weather,
    soil or crop conditions required for assessing and managing agricultural risks.
    These devices are assigned with globally unique and cryptographically verifiable
    DIDs required for privacy-preserved authentication. A distributed ledger hosted
    by identity blockchain is a registry for DIDs and their related public keys along
    with service endpoints for communication. Peer DIDs/Private DIDs are used for
    edge IoT devices to preserve identity privacy during data transactions with other
    agents. Using a same DID repeatedly for all transactions allow adversaries to
    derive a correlation and breach the privacy. However, agents such as device manufacturer/farmer
    organization/govt.agricultural agency establish verifiable public identity with
    the help of public DIDs. The cloud agents with a role of issuer publish schema,
    credential definition and revocation registry to issue and revoke the credentials
    for data sharing. Similarly, a verifier cloud agent uses distributed ledger as
    a source for proof of credential. VCs issued to edge IoT devices can be traced
    back to a verifiable source of issuer with identity blockchain being the root
    of trust. Hence, any edge IoT device can assert data provenance for the data collected
    from sensors to actuators. 4.2.1. DID connection establishment Any two agents(entities)
    identified with DIDs willing to exchange information or credentials must establish
    a secure communication channel through mutual authentication, as shown in the
    upper portion of Fig. 2. The agent such as device manufacturer/farmer organization/govt.
    agricultural agency, which plays a role of an issuer or verifier, establishes
    a robust public identity with the help of public DIDs (AgentpublicDID). These
    public DIDs are written to the identity blockchain ledger. However, for the safe
    and secure connection between two agents, a peer DID or private DID is utilized
    as it keeps the information off the ledger and guarantees the privacy-preserving
    contextual relationship. In most scenarios, IoT edge devices create peer DIDs
    to establish secure connections. Each peer DID will have a pair of signing and
    verifying keys for connection establishment. A mutual authentication for DID connection
    is carried out by exchanging connection information and verifying connecting agents’
    digital signatures. To initiate the process of DID connection establishment, an
    agent with a public DID called as RespondingAgent(RespAgent) publishes connection
    invitation which peer agent called as RequestingAgent(ReqAgent) can use to request
    the connection. The request connection received by the RespAgent will be verified
    with the digital signature of ReqAgent and connection response is sent to ReqAgent.
    On receiving the connection response message, the ReqAgent verifies RespAgent’s
    signature and replies with connection completed message. The detailed process
    of DID connection establishment is described in Algorithm 1 where, RespAgentProvisionalPK
    – Provisional public key of RespondingAgent, RespAgentProvisionalSK - Provisional

    with RespondingAgent, ReqAgentPK – Public key of RequestingAgent embedded in peer

    RequestingAgent. Download : Download high-res image (873KB) Download : Download
    full-size image 4.2.2. Device registration IoT edge devices required for farm
    monitoring must register with device data credential issuer, i.e., device manufacturer
    or farmer organization. The device registration process involves getting the information
    related to a device deployed, farm, farm holder, farm location and data sharing
    pattern. With the help of a secure DID communication channel, the device registration
    is done, and details are stored in a decentralized data storage system, as shown
    in the middle portion of Fig. 2. The identity blockchain ledger will not store
    personal identity attributes or raw application data associated with IoT edge
    devices. 4.2.3. Issuing and revoking device data credentials The stewards are
    the actors having authority to read and write to the permissioned identity ledger
    and run validator nodes in blockchain. Stewards have the administrative control
    to add other actors into the blockchain network and assign their roles. The stewards
    do the onboarding of the issuer (device manufacturer/farmer organization) by granting
    them the role of endorser. The issuer with the endorser role registers the public
    DID in the blockchain and obtains write permission for transacting with the ledger.
    The device data schema is designed by the issuer that adds requisite attributes
    such as FarmerName, FarmID, DeviceID, ManufacturerID, IPAddress, PublishTopic,
    ResourcePath, FarmLocation and writes it to the ledger. The issuer creates the
    credential definition with the required information like signature type, reference
    and tag from the device data schema and records it to the ledger. To keep track
    of revoked credentials, issuer publishes the revocation registry to the ledger.
    The revocation registry offers the value of cryptographic accumulator for verifying
    the revocation and provides URI and hash of associated tails file. The sequence
    of messages exchanged between IoT edge device and issuer(CloudAgent) during issuing
    and revoking device data credentials is depicted in the lower portion of Fig.
    2. The process of issuing the credentials commences with the credential offer
    made by issuer cloud agent with public DID called as IssuerCloudAgent(ICAgent)
    to IoT edge device called EdgeAgent(EAgent) requesting the credential. Based on
    the credential offer made by ICAgent, the EAgent generates blinded link secret
    and attaches it to request-credential message to prove the holder binding to credential
    to be issued. On receipt of request-credential message, the ICAgent retrieves
    required device attributes and attach it with credential definition to derive
    a device data credential and issue it to EAgent using issue-credential message.
    Now, the EAgent stores the received device data credential in its wallet and sends
    an acknowledgment to ICAgent. The process of issuing device data credential is
    detailed in the Algorithm 2. The steps required to revoke a credential is straightforward.
    Suppose, if any malicious or illegal use of device data credential is reported
    to the issuer, it revokes the credentials by changing the cryptographic accumulator
    value. Download : Download high-res image (693KB) Download : Download full-size
    image 4.2.4. Verifying device data credentials The verifier registers with an
    endorser role by publishing the public DID to the identity ledger. Fig. 3 shows
    a series of messages exchanged for verifying the device data credential. The set
    of attributes in the device data credential to be verified is decided based on
    the verifier’s requirements. A verifier cloud agent called VerifierCloudAgent(VCAgent)
    triggers the credential verification process by requesting the presentation of
    device data credential proof from EdgeAgent(EAgent) using request-sent message.
    On receiving a request, EAgent prepares a device data credential proof and sends
    it with presentation-sent message. The VCAgent verifies the presentation of proof
    with credential definition in blockchain and acknowledges the EAgent with presentation-ack
    message. The details of verifying device data credential is described in the Algorithm

    for device data credential based data sharing. 4.2.5. Device data credential based
    data sharing This section demonstrates the data sharing scheme based on the verifiable
    credential (device data credential). The two most commonly used communication
    patterns in IoT devices, such as publish–subscribe and request–response are considered
    for data sharing. Fig. 5 shows the attributes used for creating the device data
    credential. The sequence diagram in Fig. 4 illustrates the messages exchanged
    when sharing the data from an edge device to a cloud. The mechanism of data sharing
    involves action between a DataProviderAgent(DPAgent) and cloud agent with public
    DID called as DataRequestorCloudAgent(DRCAgent) with identity blockchain and decentralized
    data storage as the underlying infrastructure. Initially, DRCAgent registers into
    a blockchain using a public DID and verifies the device data credential for a
    specific DPAgent using Algorithm 3. DRCAgent and DPAgent generate their respective
    public–private key pairs and mutually exchange their public key. Both the agents
    derive their shared key using the secret key of their own and the public key of
    the other communicating agent. This shared key is used for sensor data encryption.
    In the publish–subscribe pattern, a DPAgent takes the publisher’s role by creating
    a topic with the EdgeMessageBroker hosted within it. DRCAgent acts as a subscriber
    by enrolling in a published topic and connecting to EdgeMessageBroker. With the
    request–response pattern, a DPAgent and DRCAgent establish a request–response
    communication channel with the underlying DIDComm channel. The DRCAgent, as a
    requestor, makes a specific request for data from DPAgent, the responder. Based
    on the type of communication pattern the necessary steps followed for data sharing
    are detailed in the Algorithm 4. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download

    for agricultural production risk management Agricultural insurance is a financial
    instrument to cover farmers’ financial losses due to production risks related
    to weather, crop yield or soil conditions. In practice, most insurers conduct
    a risk assessment based on certain parameters like temperature, rainfall, humidity,
    crop yield and fix the threshold for indemnifying losses incurred by farmers.
    Specifically, smart contract-based insurance automates the claim settlement process
    on the occurrence of predefined events written in the insurance contract. However,
    claim processing requires real-time agricultural data for smart contracts in decision-making
    regarding the claim by a farmer. Hence, this section illustrates the mechanism
    for secure DID-VC verified IoT data access using decentralized oracle for smart
    contract-based production risk management. Fig. 6 depicts the sequence of messages
    exchanged between actors for agricultural production risk assessment. The mechanism
    for secure access of data from VerifiedDataNode(VDNode) involves the action among
    off-chain component named DecentralizedOracle(DEOVDNode), smart contracts called
    Oracle Contract(OracleContract) and RiskAssessmentInsurance Contract(RAIContract)
    respectively. The steps required for secure data access using decentralized oracle
    for a RAIContract is detailed in the Algorithm 5. The decentralized oracle works
    on the principle of secure multiparty computation where a risk parameter value
    read from a VDNode is divided into ‘n’ different secret shares and distributed
    among the peers of the DEOVDNode. OracleContract reconstructs the original value
    of requested parameter with a minimum threshold ‘t’ shares out of ‘n’ secret shares.
    The secret-sharing scheme helps preserve data privacy and security while accessing
    the data using DEOVDNode. Within the decentralized oracle, no peer reveals its
    share of data to others. However, they work together to achieve the goal of reconstructing
    the original data by combining their part of the data. Download : Download high-res

    agricultural production risk management. 5.1. Implementation details and results
    5.1.1. Experimental setup and implementation This section describes the experimental
    setup and implementation details of workflow required to achieve the objectives
    stated earlier. A permissioned identity blockchain named Hyperledger Indy is used
    to realize device data credential-based agricultural IoT data sharing. Using Indy
    blockchain as the base layer, a framework called Hyperledger Aries is used to
    program the algorithms required to establish secure DID channel, issue, revoke
    and verify device data credentials. A workstation is used for implementing the
    issuer and verifier cloud agents, whereas IoT edge agents are implemented with
    the help of Raspberry Pi devices. The decentralized data storage required for
    issuer and verifier cloud agents is implemented on Interplanetary File System
    (IPFS). A detailed description of device setup used in the experimentation is
    shown in Table 2. IoT edge agents are attached with Digital Humidity and Temperature
    11 (DHT 11), NPK, camera sensors to read the values of weather, soil and crop
    management features. The python packages for Message Queue Transport Telemetry
    (MQTT) and Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) are installed to carry out
    the tasks related to publish–subscribe and request–response communication patterns.
    The decentralized oracle-based data access for agricultural production risk assessment
    is achieved with smart contracts written in Solidity deployed on a public blockchain
    called Ethereum. The off-chain decentralized oracle implementing a multiparty
    computation-based sharing scheme is coded with python scripts. The software frameworks,
    tools, and packages used in experiments are detailed in Table 3. DID channel creation,
    issuing, revoking and verifying device data credentials for authentication and
    data provenance during data sharing is implemented using AgriIoTDataShare workflow.
    Specifically, this workflow comprises an agent called agricultural device manufacturer(agridevcorp)
    issuing the device data credential to IoT edge device(edgedev001) agent verified
    by the government agricultural agency(agrigovtdept) agent before receiving data
    from edgedev001. The edgedev001 after the authentication shares the data with
    agrigovtdept using publish–subscribe(MQTT) or request–response(CoAP) communication
    patterns. The type, format and payload for data shared in production risk management
    during AgriIoTDataShare workflow are described in Table 4. The agricultural production
    risk management using decentralized oracle for data access is demonstrated with
    a smart contract-based insurance accessing the risk parameter values like temperature,
    rainfall, humidity, crop yield from verified data sources provided by agrigovtdept.

    presents the results obtained from the AgriIoTDataShare workflow for trusted agricultural
    IoT data sharing and decentralized oracle-based data access for smart contracts
    in production risk assessment. The agridevcorp agent in AgriIoTDataShare workflow
    creates a device data schema and issues the device data credential to edgedev001,
    as shown in Fig. 7(a) and Fig. 7(b), respectively. The device data credential
    consists of attributes such as Label, FarmerName, FarmID, FarmLocation, ManufacturerID,
    DeviceID, PublishTopic, ResourcePath and IPAddress. Here the attributes required
    for publish–subscribe (PublishTopic,IPAddress) and request–response (ResourcePath,IPAddress)
    communication patterns are combined in a single credential. While verifying the
    device data credential, all the attributes are not requested from edgedev001.
    The edgedev001 is requested to produce the proof for holding value for attributes
    such as FarmerName, FarmID, FarmLocation, PublishTopic, ResourcePath and IPAddress.
    The results obtained upon verification of device data credentials by agrigovtdept
    is depicted in Fig. 7(c). In case the agridevcorp revokes the credentials, it
    issues a notification about revocation to edgedev001, as shown in Fig. 7(d). The
    smart contracts implemented for production risk assessment using decentralized
    oracle conducts transactions and calls for adding administrator, adding farmer
    to blockchain network, registering farmer to insurance, farmer generating claim
    request, sending data request to oracle and receiving the response from the oracle,

    Identity blockchain transactions The Hyperledger Indy maintains three types of
    ledgers: config ledger, pool ledger and domain ledger monitored by audit ledger.
    A config ledger maintains the configuration information pertaining to network
    pool, node updation and authentication. At the same time, a pool ledger takes
    care of adding or deleting nodes in the network pool. Similarly, a domain ledger
    records application- and domain-specific transactions such as generating DIDs,
    rotating keys, publishing schema, credential definition, and revocation registry.
    In particular, for the AgriIoTDataShare workflow, we are interested in key transactions
    specific to domain ledger such as NYM, ATTRIB, SCHEMA, CRED_DEF. The NYM transaction
    generates a new DID and related record for adding a new user to the network with
    specific roles: steward, trustee, endorser or user. The input values, such as
    target DID, user role, and verification key, are required to conduct NYM transactions.
    ATTRIB transaction updates the fields of an existing DID record. The ATTRIB transaction
    expects target DID to be updated and raw or encrypted attributes’ hash value as
    input parameters. SCHEMA transaction defines a new schema with the required attributes
    for issuing the credential. Any party acting as the issuer can define the new
    schema with a schema name, version, and attribute name. The CRED_DEF transaction
    generates the credential definition by writing a primary claim public key (derived
    from ZKP-based signature scheme) to a particular schema. The issuer holding this
    verifiable definition can issue a credential to the required party. The CRED_DEF
    requires schema id, signature type, tag and primary claim public key of all attributes
    to conduct the transaction to the domain ledger. The AgriIoTDataShare workflow
    conducts a frequent NYM, ATTRIB, SCHEMA and CRED_DEF transactions for creating
    DIDs, issuing and verifying of device data credentials. The evaluation of these
    key transactions in indy ledger is done using transaction throughput time(TThroughputTime)
    and request latency(TReqLatency). The TThroughputTime of is defined as no of transaction
    requests processed in a given time period for which commit message has been obtained.
    The TReqLatency provides the time required to order transaction requests and reply
    back to the client. The experiment is conducted by incrementing transaction load
    from 50 to 400 to determine values for TThroughputTime and TReqLatency. The TThroughputTime
    and TReqLatency required for different number of NYM, ATTRIB, SCHEMA and CRED_DEF
    transactions are shown in Figs. 9(a)–9(b) respectively. With the increase in number
    of transactions, both TThroughputTime and TReqLatency for conducting key transactions
    increases linearly. It is observed that TThroughputTime and TReqLatency for CRED_DEF
    transaction is high, as it needs to generate primary claim public keys to sign
    different attributes of credential. The SCHEMA transaction requires low TThroughputTime
    and TReqLatency as it requires to add attribute names to schema. However, TThroughputTime
    and TReqLatency obtained for NYM and ATTRIB transaction falls within range of
    time required for SCHEMA and CRED_DEF. In addition, request latency varying in
    a range of 2.5 s to 3.6 s for a transaction load of 50 to 400, infers that identity
    blockchain transactions are scalable and can be extended to meet higher transaction
    loads. Download : Download high-res image (437KB) Download : Download full-size

    transactions. 5.2.2. Issue-verify-revoke time for device data credentials The
    experiments are conducted to measure the time taken for issuing, verifying and
    revoking credentials to evaluate agents’ performance in AgriIoTDataShare workflow.
    The number of credentials input is varied from 50 to 450 in the incremental steps
    of 50. Fig. 10(a), Fig. 10(b), and Fig. 10(c) respectively depicts the minimum,
    average and maximum time taken for issuing, verifying and revoking device data
    credentials. It is observed that with the incremental credential input load, there
    is slight to moderate increase in the average time taken for issuing, verifying
    and revoking credentials. The average time for issuing device data credentials
    ranges between 0.2 s to 0.6 s per credential. It varies from 99 ms to 160 ms for
    credential verification and 2.9 s to 3.1 s for credential revocation. It is seen
    that the maximum time taken for issuing, verifying and revoking with varying credential
    input load is well within the acceptable limits of computation time. The average
    time taken to verify individual credentials is the lowest, whereas revoking the
    credential is the maximum. The time taken for issuing the credential lies between
    verification and revocation. From these observations, it can be summarized that
    agents deployed in the AgriIoTDataShare workflow are efficient and scalable in
    terms of time taken for issuing, verifying and revoking credentials. In addition,
    Table 5 presents the time taken for connecting two agents, time for public and
    private key generation, time duration for publish–subscribe, and request–response

    The resource utilization by agridevcorp, edgedev001 and agrigovtdept agents during
    AgriIoTDataShare workflow is presented in this section. The multiple metrics consisting
    of CPU utilization, memory consumed, network input, network output are considered
    for evaluation. Fig. 11, Fig. 11 present the results for CPU utilization and memory
    usage of agents during the workflow. The agridevcorp agent shows higher CPU and
    memory usage compared to edgedev001 and agrigovtdept, as it needs to conduct cryptographic
    operations for credential issuance. The credential holder edgedev001 utilizes
    around 3 to 10% of CPU time and consumes memory between 15 MB to 110 MB as part
    of the workflow. Despite edgedev001 being CPU and memory constrained, promising
    results are obtained, which is suitable for real-time deployment in agricultural
    IoT devices. Verifying credentials by agrigovtdept takes half the CPU time compared
    to agridevcorp and utilizes less memory than issuing the credential. The network
    input indicates the total number of bytes received by the agent, whereas network
    output shows the total number of bytes transmitted by the agent. The network input
    and output obtained by the respective agents during workflow is depicted in Fig.
    11, Fig. 11. The network input and output results indicate that the data received
    and transmitted by agridevcorp, edgedev001 and agrigovtdept agents are in the
    range of kilobytes. These results are encouraging and efficient regarding resource

    risk management In this section, evaluation is performed for decentralized oracle
    and agriculture insurance smart contract functions deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.
    The performance metrics such as transaction throughput (TThroughput) and average
    transaction latency(TAvgLatency) is considered to determine the scalability of
    the developed decentralized oracle mechanism. TThroughput measures the rate at
    which the system commits valid transactions to the blockchain in a given time
    interval represented as Transactions Per Second(TPS). TAvgLatency is the time
    interval between the transaction being sent and confirmation received for the
    same. The Hyperledger Caliper is used to measure the transaction throughput and
    latency. In Caliper, the smart contract functions namely registerFarmerToInsurance(),
    farmerClaimRequest(), sendRequestToOracle(), receiveRepsonseOracle() that generates
    transactions to blockchain are organized in the form of rounds for testing. The
    evaluation is conducted by varying the number of transactions from 100 to 450
    fixedly with a transaction send rate of 50 in the Ethereum simulation environment
    (Ganache) and the Ethereum testnet (Ropsten). The TAvgLatency and TThroughput
    obtained for the Ganache network are depicted in 12(a) and 12(b), respectively.
    Similarly, the results obtained for the Ropsten network are presented using 12(c)
    and 12(d), respectively. In both Ganache and Ropsten networks, the average latency
    increases with the number of input transactions. The receiveRepsonseOracle() transaction
    shows higher average latency and lower throughput than other transactions in Ganache
    and Ropsten networks. This behavior of higher delay and low throughput in receiveRepsonseOracle()
    transaction is observed due to the off-chain decentralized oracle component involved
    in securely accessing the data to smart contracts. In the Ropsten network, there
    is a slight decrease in TAvgLatency for sendRequestOracle() transaction for some
    instances of higher transaction loads(300,350) compared to lower transaction loads(200,250).
    This behavior is observed due to delays in submitting the transactions to Ropsten
    network due to communication overhead or network delays. The TThroughput for most
    transactions initiated by four smart contract functions falls between 0.5 TPS
    to 1.5 TPS. This justifies that the proposed mechanism for data access using decentralized
    oracle is well suited to be implemented in real-world scenarios. The gas value
    is the computational effort required to perform Ethereum blockchain transactions.

    23868 5.3. Security and privacy analysis This section analyzes the security and
    privacy of the AgriSSIOracle framework using the properties of the DIDs and VCs.
    The analysis provides insights on how the proposed solution prevents security
    attacks and privacy breaches during agricultural IoT data sharing and its subsequent
    access by smart contracts with oracle. • Correlation Attack: The use of common
    identifiers issued by centralized authorities across multiple systems leads to
    correlation problems. Correlation means associating identity with multiple systems
    without any consent from identity owners. Eventually, the widespread proliferation
    of correlation between various systems leads to privacy loss and a breach of trust.
    As DIDs are decentralized, user-controlled, and transparent, their use in agricultural
    IoT devices avoids unwanted associations with multiple systems. The trust triangle
    of issue-hold-verify created by verifiable credentials for data sharing in agricultural
    IoT devices is non-correlatable. The non-correlating signature used in the credential
    prevents the correlation of the issuer with the holder by the verifier. The signature
    of the issuer is blinded as it is sufficient to share proof of the issuer’s signature
    by the holder to the verifier. These DIDs’ and VCs’ features help prevent correlation-related
    vulnerabilities in data sharing IoT devices. • Data Minimization: Currently, agricultural
    IoT devices provide more device identifiable information than required when sharing
    data. This undesired collection and storage of device information result in a
    privacy violation of agricultural data owners. Data minimization refers to IoT
    devices that share a minimal amount of device identifiable information for a defined
    purpose. The DIDs used in IoT devices only share the information required for
    the context of authentication. Further, when the issuer generates VCs in the form
    of device data credentials, it comes with a choice of no disclosure or the selective
    disclosure of attributes to the verifier. The VCs also provide the option to generate
    predicate proofs or compound proofs from the credential without revealing the
    actual attribute value. Minimum disclosure of a device identity for data provenance
    helps the oracle nodes collect farm data from IoT devices in a verifiable way.
    The presence of multiparty computation-based decentralized oracle for insurance
    contracts preserves privacy by producing final results without revealing the inputs
    to its nodes. • Sybil Attack: The use of common identifiers for agricultural IoT
    devices in a blockchain network allows any malicious actor to create fake identities
    and impersonate the role of others. A malicious device sharing agricultural data
    in the guise of a genuine device has an adverse influence on decision-making.
    However, having DIDs in place for IoT devices makes them Sybil-resistant. Specifically,
    IoT devices use peer DIDs to establish a private contextual connection with public
    data collection entities, which cannot be reused or duplicated by malicious devices.
    Device data credentials are anchored to the specific holder with the help of blinded
    link secrets. So, any malicious actor trying to fake or forge credentials on behalf
    of other identities is completely ruled out. • Message Replay Attack: In message
    replay attacks, adversaries intercept messages exchanged between two agents and
    transmit them to the receiving agent. Only the stewards can write transactions
    into the blockchain ledger when the DIDs and device data credentials are used
    for authentication and data provenance. Hence, any attempt by the attacking adversaries
    to replay transactions into the ledger is thwarted. In addition, all transactions
    have signatures and timestamps, which are difficult for attackers to replicate.
    • Man-in-the-Middle Attack: If the IoT devices communicating with the issuer or
    verifier are not mutually authenticated, then the adversary acting as a middleman
    tries to attack the communicating parties by establishing independent connections
    separately with them. The DID and VC-based solutions for IoT data sharing are
    not vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks as both agents involved in message
    exchange are mutually verified using digital signatures. If the attacker tries
    to produce a forged device data credential, it will not be successful as the link
    secret of the holder anchored by the issuer will be missing. • Substitution Attack:
    In substitution attacks, an adversary tries to intercept and manipulate original
    messages intended for the receiver. However, DID and VC-based authentication are
    non-vulnerable to substitution attacks as the hash of the message is generated
    and signed by the sending agent. The receiving agent checks for the message integrity
    with hash values. In addition, all transactions written into the identity blockchain
    ledger are appended with a hash value. 6. Conclusion and future work Trustworthy
    agricultural data sharing and its access for risk assessment are prominent in
    mitigating agrarian risks. This work proposed and realized the implementation
    of the AgriSSIOracle framework to address the trust concerns in data sharing and
    its access. A trusted data sharing method based on the publish-subscribe and request-response
    is developed by integrating SSI-based DIDs with device data credentials. Further,
    the implementation of decentralized oracle-based data access mechanism for smart
    contract-based agricultural insurance increases transparency and speeds up claim
    settlements. Detailed algorithms and sequence diagrams are presented to better
    understand implemented methods. The entire process of issue-hold-verify of device
    data credentials, as demonstrated using the AgriIoTDataShare workflow offers universal
    proof of trust for shared agricultural data. Moreover, the performance evaluation
    shows that the solution implemented through AgriSSIOracle is reliable and can
    be flexibly extended to existing scenarios in agricultural information systems.
    The detailed security and privacy analysis show how the framework leverages the
    essential trust factors. Thus, this work provides a good foundation for the synergy
    of blockchain-based identity and credential systems with IoT for trusted agricultural
    data sharing and access by reducing information asymmetry. For future work, we
    are interested in extending decentralized identity and credentials for numerous
    processes in agricultural supply chains. In addition, the focus will be on adopting
    the JSON-LD credential format for better interoperability. CRediT authorship contribution

    \ such as the Internet of Things, raising the productivity of\nagricultural and\
    \ farming activities is critical to improving yields and cost-effectiveness. IoT,\
    \ in particular,\ncan improve the efficiency of agriculture and farming processes\
    \ by eliminating human intervention\nthrough automation. The fast rise of Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT)-based tools has changed nearly all life\nsectors, including\
    \ business, agriculture, surveillance, etc. These radical developments are upending\n\
    traditional agricultural practices and presenting new options in the face of various\
    \ obstacles. IoT aids in\ncollecting data that is useful in the farming sector,\
    \ such as changes in climatic conditions, soil fertility,\namount of water required\
    \ for crops, irrigation, insect and pest detection, bug location disruption of\n\
    creatures to the sphere, and horticulture. IoT enables farmers to effectively\
    \ use technology to monitor\ntheir forms remotely round the clock. Several sensors,\
    \ including distributed WSNs (wireless sensor\nnetworks), are utilized for agricultural\
    \ inspection and control, which is very important due to their exact\noutput and\
    \ utilization. In addition, cameras are utilized to keep an eye on the field from\
    \ afar. The goal\nof this research is to evaluate smart agriculture using IoT\
    \ approaches in depth. The paper demonstrates\nIoT applications, benefits, current\
    \ obstacles, and potential solutions in smart agriculture. This smart\nagricultural\
    \ system aims to find existing techniques that may be used to boost crop yield\
    \ and save time,\nsuch as water, pesticides, irrigation, crop, and fertilizer\
    \ management.\nKeywords: agriculture; land monitoring; control strategies; IoT;\
    \ sensors; economic growth; water\nmanagement and water resources\n1. Introduction\n\
    The Internet of Things (IoT) is an interconnected network of computing devices,\n\
    people with unique IDs, and the capacity to communicate via a network without\
    \ human\ninteraction. The Internet of Things (IoT) intends to connect the physical\
    \ and virtual worlds\nby interacting and exchanging data via the internet. Linked\
    \ industries, smart cities, smart\nhomes, smart energy, connected vehicles, smart\
    \ agriculture, connected buildings and\ncampuses, health care, and logistics are\
    \ all examples of IoT applications [1]. The increasing\nneed for food, both in\
    \ terms of quantity and quality, has required the development and\nmodernization\
    \ of the agricultural sector. The “Internet of Things” (IoT) is a promising set\
    \ of\ntechnologies that may be used to provide a variety of agricultural modernization\
    \ solutions.\nScientiﬁc institutions, research institutes, and the agricultural\
    \ sector are racing to provide\nmore and more IoT solutions to agricultural business\
    \ stakeholders, laying the foundation\nfor a clear role when IoT becomes a mainstream\
    \ technology [2]. The world’s biodiversity\nis anticipated to support between\
    \ 9.4 and 10.1 billion people by 2050, increasing the need\nfor specialized food\
    \ production zones, especially for harvesting and livestock. This means\nAgronomy\

    Agronomy 2022, 12, 127\n2 of 21\nthat by 2050, global food production will have\
    \ to grow by 70% [3]. Crop production is\nincreasingly crucial in agriculture,\
    \ with commodities, such as cotton, wheat, gum, and\nothers, playing signiﬁcant\
    \ roles in many nations’ economies.\nIn 2019, the IoT market was 690 billion dollars\
    \ and was projected to be 1256.1 billion\ndollars by 2025 with a 10.53% CAGR globally\
    \ from 2020 to 2025. Solutions are needed to\nassure timely and regular agricultural\
    \ growth and yield due to the combined effects of a\ngrowing population, natural\
    \ weather unpredictability, soil degradation, and climate change.\nFarm management,\
    \ animal monitoring, irrigation control, greenhouse environmental con-\ntrol,\
    \ autonomous agricultural machinery, and drones are examples of IoT applications\
    \ in\nagriculture, all of which contribute to agrarian automation. It also demands\
    \ contributing to\nagricultural food production’s long-term viability. Land appraisal,\
    \ crop protection, and\ncrop yield projection, according to these needs, are essential\
    \ to world food production [4].\nFarmers, for example, can manage ﬁeld environments\
    \ in real-time and more effortlessly\nregulate ﬁelds using wireless sensors and\
    \ mobile networks. Farmers may also utilize IoT\ntechnology to capture essential\
    \ data, subsequently creating yield maps that enable precision\nagriculture to\
    \ produce low-cost high-quality crops [5]. Figure 1 depicts the smart precision\n\
    agriculture cycle.\nFigure 1. Smart precision agriculture cycle.\nSmart agriculture\
    \ is becoming increasingly important to farmers in the modern day,\nand it will\
    \ become even more critical in the future to ensure proper ﬁeld expansion and\n\
    crop output. Unfortunately, traditional farming methods are not up to the task\
    \ of meeting\nrising demand. As a result, the ground stays barren and devoid of\
    \ fertility due to poor\nutilization of nutrients, water management, light, fertilizers,\
    \ and pesticides. Crop diseases,\nwater shortage, irrigation, and pesticide control\
    \ monitoring are only some of the challenges\nthat different IoT automation and\
    \ control systems can efﬁciently address [6]. This is why\ncontemporary agriculture\
    \ employs smart equipment and tools from sowing through crop\nharvesting, storage,\
    \ and transportation. The operation is smart and cost-effective due to its\naccurate\
    \ monitoring capabilities and fast reporting using a range of sensors. Autonomous\n\
    drones, harvesters, tractors, satellites, and robots are now complementing agricultural\n\
    equipment. Sensors may be instantly placed and begin collecting data, which is\
    \ then\nimmediately available for further analysis over the internet. By enabling\
    \ reliable data\ngathering at each place, sensor technology allows crop and site-speciﬁc\
    \ agriculture [7].\nUsing advanced control methods to automate agricultural activities\
    \ has increased crop\nproduction while also improving soil fertility.\nThe following\
    \ are the signiﬁcant contributions made by this study:\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n\
    3 of 21\n•\nThe world’s expectations of the agriculture industry, based on existing\
    \ IoT approaches\nfor providing solutions and new applications and technology.\n\
    •\nIdentiﬁcation of numerous application ﬁelds, as well as a summary of the most\
    \ recent\nstate-of-the-art literature on IoT technology.\n•\nThe Internet of Things’\
    \ task is to address these constraints and other challenges, such\nas resource\
    \ scarcity and precise usage, climate change, etc.\nThe rest of the paper is laid\
    \ out in the following manner. Section 2 delves into the\ndetails of smart agricultural\
    \ applications based on IoT technologies. Section 3 discusses the\nmany types\
    \ of equipment and technology available. Section 4 identiﬁes unsolved problems\n\
    and potential remedies. Finally, Section 5 concludes the research.\n2. Major Applications\
    \ of Smart Agriculture\nPrecision farming, animal monitoring, and greenhouse monitoring\
    \ are a few agri-\ncultural businesses utilizing the Internet of Things. Every\
    \ element of traditional farming\noperation may be substantially improved by combining\
    \ cutting-edge sensors and Internet\nof Things technology. At the moment, the\
    \ Internet of Things’ (IoT’s) and wireless sensors’\nharmonious incorporation\
    \ into smart agriculture can catapult agriculture to formerly in-\nconceivable\
    \ heights. Appropriateness of land, pest monitoring and control, irrigation, and\n\
    yield optimization are just a few of the conventional agricultural issues that\
    \ IoT may assist\nin resolving through the implementation of smart agriculture\
    \ approaches [7]. Figure 2\nillustrates the comprehensive paradigm of smart agricultural\
    \ monitoring system applica-\ntions, facilities, and sensors. Agriculture applications\
    \ are classiﬁed as IoT agricultural apps,\nsmartphone-based agricultural apps,\
    \ and sensor-based agricultural apps. Wireless sensor\nnetworks (WSNs) have recently\
    \ been used to enable IoT applications for smart agriculture,\nincluding irrigation\
    \ sensor networks, frost event prediction, precision agriculture and soil\nfarming,\
    \ smart farming, and unsighted object recognition, among others [8]. Signiﬁcant\n\
    instances of how new technology assists in the general improvement of efﬁciency\
    \ at various\nstages are included here.\nFigure 2. General paradigm of smart agriculture.\n\
    Agronomy 2022, 12, 127\n4 of 21\n2.1. Monitoring of Soil Moisture and Water Levels\n\
    Soil monitoring has developed into one of the most challenging agricultural areas,\n\
    both for manufacturers and farmers. Numerous environmental issues associated with\
    \ soil\nmonitoring affect agricultural yield. When these sorts of obstacles are\
    \ correctly identiﬁed,\nfarming patterns and methods become readily understandable.\
    \ The soil’s moisture content,\nwetness, fertilizer application, and temperature\
    \ trends are all being monitored. Soil’s\nmoisture environment management system\
    \ uses soil humidity and moisture sensors. By\nproposing an appropriate fertilizer\
    \ approach, the results of a soil monitoring test report\nassist farmers in increasing\
    \ crop yield [9]. The sensor can read both analog and digital\noutputs. The judgment\
    \ is made based on data collected from sensors and compared to\npredeﬁned threshold\
    \ levels. The soil moisture sensor is used to regulate the irrigation\nsystem’s\
    \ automatic operation. When the moisture level goes below the threshold value,\
    \ the\nwater pump is triggered [10].\nSoil mapping enables you to sow many crop\
    \ types in the same ﬁeld, allowing you\nto match better soil characteristics,\
    \ such as seed compatibility, sowing timing, and even\nplanting depth, as certain\
    \ crops are deeply rooted while others are not. Additionally,\ngrowing many crops\
    \ concurrently may result in more prudent agricultural practices, such\nas resource\
    \ conservation. The system is composed of a distributed network of soil moisture\n\
    and temperature sensors located in the root zone of the plant, as well as rain\
    \ sensors\nlocated in various zones. The microcontroller collects and transmits\
    \ all sensor data and\ninformation. In addition, a temperature and soil moisture\
    \ threshold algorithm will be\ndevised and implemented in a microcontroller-based\
    \ gateway to regulate the amount of\nwater given to the ﬁelds. Finally, the user\
    \ is provided with control via an IoT module based\non rain sensor data to interrupt\
    \ or restart water ﬂow as needed [11].\nIf the ﬁeld contains an adequate amount\
    \ of water, no water will be pumped into\nit. However, when the soil’s water moisture\
    \ content falls below a predetermined level,\nwater is pumped into the ﬁeld until\
    \ the desired moisture content is attained. The DHT11\nsensor monitors the ﬁeld’s\
    \ temperature and humidity. In addition, a PIR motion sensor\ndetects when an\
    \ intruder (human or animal) enters the area. Consequently, sensor values\nare\
    \ continually monitored and displayed on the farmer’s mobile device through a\
    \ GSM\nsim900A module, which includes a sim card with a 3G data pack and adds\
    \ IoT capabilities\nto the system [12].\n2.2. System of Irrigation Monitoring\n\
    Numerous studies have been conducted on a smart irrigation system. Food production\n\
    technology must signiﬁcantly improve to keep up with the growing demand for food.\n\
    Numerous experts have worked diligently to create an alternative to irrigated\
    \ farming.\nThese efforts, however, have not yet resulted in a feasible solution\
    \ to the irrigation system’s\npresent problems. At the moment, crop irrigation\
    \ is carried out manually and by established\ncustomary practices. When crops\
    \ are given less water, they grow slower and absorb less\ncalcium. Frequent irrigation\
    \ kills roots and wastes water. As a result, accurate irrigation\nof crops becomes\
    \ a considerable difﬁculty [13]. A smart irrigation management and\nmonitoring\
    \ approach is developed to enable autonomous delivery of sufﬁcient water from\n\
    a tank to ﬁeld crops. Automatic sensor systems are cost-effective, offered for\
    \ determining\nwhether plants require watering based on information gathered from\
    \ monitoring and\nregulating the soil water levels to minimize dryness or overﬂow\
    \ [14].\nKamaruddin et al., 2019 [15] developed an Internet of Things (IoT)-based\
    \ wireless sen-\nsor network (WSN) architecture that manually or automatically\
    \ administers and monitors\nthe irrigation system. The proposed method used NRF24L01\
    \ and Arduino tools as the\ncommunication network transceiver and CPU. The soil\
    \ moisture sensor data will be sent to\nthe base station via NRF24L01. Then, the\
    \ sensor node’s data will be sent to the cloud server\nthrough the base station.\
    \ This project utilized Thingspeak as a cloud server to store all data\nin a database\
    \ and connect it to an Android application.\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n5 of 21\n\
    2.3. Fertilizer Administration\nAkshaya et al., 2020 [16] proposed an IOT-based\
    \ technique and upgraded the previous\nsystem, which predicted agricultural yields\
    \ using backpropagation and a random forest\nalgorithm. It recommends fertilizer\
    \ application rates and exclusively monitors atmospheric\ndata via a mobile network\
    \ and pump on/off action. The suggested technique utilizes\na segmented tank to\
    \ collect NPK fertilizer and water. The user can select one of three\nmodes (manual,\
    \ auto, or smart). In manual mode, the user is provided with the fertil-\nizer\
    \ and water ratios for well-known plants and fertilizers. In auto mode, all required\n\
    is to know the plant’s name to select the appropriate fertilizer and water ratio.\
    \ Finally,\nin smart mode, if the user cannot recognize the plant’s name, fertilizer\
    \ ratio, or water,\nthe plant’s name, fertilizer ratio, and water will be recommended\
    \ automatically. The IoT\nmodule will continuously collect information on the\
    \ temperature and soil moisture. The in-\nformation collected will be stored in\
    \ the IoT cloud. The mobile phone will inform you\nwhenever the given data changes\
    \ and the needed fertilizer ratio will be shown on the liquid\ncrystal display.\n\
    2.4. Crop Diseases and Pest Control\nHuman operators frequently monitor insect\
    \ pests via time-consuming and costly on-\nsite inspections, which results in\
    \ low spatial and temporal resolution. Remote monitoring\nhas been possible due\
    \ to advancements in remote sensing, electronics, and informatics.\nMonitoring\
    \ costs and effectiveness can be optimized through the deployment of camera-\n\
    equipped traps. With minimum human intervention, image analysis algorithms can\
    \ locate\nand count insect pests captured in traps automatically.\nReddy et al.,\
    \ 2019 [17] created an IoT-based system for disease and insect pest man-\nagement\
    \ in agriculture and the prediction of plant climatic factors. The integrated\
    \ sensors\nhelp in the measurement of soil and atmospheric moisture and humidity.\
    \ These features\nhelp determine the environmental conditions in which the plant\
    \ ﬂourishes and the plants’\nillnesses. It detects disease on the ﬁeld and sprays\
    \ prescribed insecticides. Web cameras\ntake images that are then preprocessed\
    \ to include RGB to grayscale conversion, defect\ndetection, image scaling, image\
    \ enhancement, and edge detection. SVM is utilized to\ncategorize characteristics\
    \ generated from Citrus Canker diseases, such as energy, kurtosis,\nskewness,\
    \ and entropy (damaged Lemon crop). The Arm7 microcontroller is used for\nhardware,\
    \ power, sensors, and motor driver control. Once the illness is identiﬁed, the\n\
    program will propose fertilizers and transmit the results to an LCD and the recommended\n\
    fertilizers. By pump, the fertilizers will be sprayed on the diseased leaves.\
    \ This study was\nconﬁned to the lemon plant to demonstrate that the same method\
    \ may be used for various\ncrops with favorable outcomes in the future.\nA solution\
    \ is presented for forecasting and detecting grape disease using the CNN\napproach\
    \ and real-time gathered data on environmental factors. First, the CNN technique\n\
    is utilized to analyze the leaf images. Then, different layers of the CNN method\
    \ are used\nto create the image. Finally, it is scaled to a speciﬁc resolution\
    \ before data is sent into\nthe CNN layers for training and testing. The suggested\
    \ algorithm was evaluated on four\ndiseases known to have a higher effect on grape\
    \ production. The diseases include esca\nblack measles, anthracnose, leaf blight,\
    \ and black rot. This gadget not only detects but also\nforecasts illnesses based\
    \ on historical weather data. On the other side, the readings from\nthe humidity,\
    \ temperature, and soil moisture sensors are transferred through Raspberry\nPi\
    \ to Microsoft’s Azure Cloud. Following this, the sensor readings are used to\
    \ anticipate\nthe illness using a trained linear regression model. Based on the\
    \ ﬁndings of the preceding\ndetection and prediction stages, suggestions for appropriate\
    \ fertilizers in the right quantities\nwill be provided to minimize fertilizer\
    \ misuse and cost savings [18].\nTo detect pests in rice during ﬁeld production\
    \ and avoid rice loss, the Internet of Things\nsupported a model-based UAV with\
    \ the Imagga cloud offered. The Internet of Things-based\nUAV was developed on\
    \ AI mechanisms and the Python programming prototype to transmit\nrice disease\
    \ images to the Imagga cloud and supply insect data. The Approach identiﬁes the\n\
    Agronomy 2022, 12, 127\n6 of 21\ndisease and insects by integrating the conﬁdence\
    \ ratings of the labels. The label identiﬁes\nthe objects in the images. To determine\
    \ the pest, the tag with the greatest conﬁdence\nresults and more than or equal\
    \ to the threshold is chosen equal to the target label. If pests\nare discovered\
    \ in the rice, statistics will be transferred to the ﬁeld owner directly to take\n\
    preventative actions. The suggested method is capable of detecting all pests that\
    \ inﬂuence\nrice production. On the other hand, this research attempted to minimize\
    \ rice waste during\nproduction by conducting insect monitoring at regular intervals\
    \ [19]. Table 1 summarizes\nmany current smart agricultural applications.\nTable\
    \ 1. Selected applications based on smart agriculture.\nRef.\nApp\nDescription\n\
    [7]\nSoil Analysis\nLand management offers long-term promise based\non climate,\
    \ geography, and reasonably stable soil\ncharacteristics (like soil texture, depth,\
    \ and\nmineralogy). This application aids farmers in better\nunderstanding the\
    \ potential of their land and climate\nvariations alteration and extenuation measures.\n\
    [9]\nFarm Manager\nFarm Manager App helps the farmers to decide\nwhich techniques\
    \ should apply before planting\nstarts. This app views, organizes, and edits all\n\
    information about your ﬁeld like yield, planting, and\nspraying conditions without\
    \ your mobile phone.\n[7]\nPest Management\nBy collecting pest occurrence information\
    \ from\nfarms, Village Tree provides smart pest control\nsolutions. In addition,\
    \ it employs a crowdsourcing\nstrategy, sending images and location data to other\n\
    farmers who may be affected.\n[9]\nAgrippa\nFarmer can generate electronics maps\
    \ of ﬁeld, keep a\nhistory of growing crops in the ﬁeld (e.g., planting,\nfertilizing,\
    \ harvesting, warehouses, gas station), and\ntrack the location of objects in\
    \ the ﬁeld (e.g., soil\nsampling for agrochemical laboratory) by eFarmer\nApplication.\n\
    Semios\nCovers network coverage, orchard pests, frost,\ndiseases, and irrigation.\
    \ Event notiﬁcations are sent\nout in real-time as part of the monitoring services.\n\
    [7]\nFertilizer\nManagement\nEco Fert assists with fertilizer management so that\
    \ it\nmay be used to its full potential. It determines the\noptimal fertilizer\
    \ mixture created to cover the\nneeded nutrient suspension and considers the\n\
    demands of diverse yields. In addition, it considers\nthe cost of fertilizer based\
    \ on current market pricing.\n2.5. Yield Monitoring, Forecasting and Harvesting\n\
    The AWS IoT platform has been proposed for crop prediction using temperature and\n\
    rainfall monitoring. The Raspberry Pi is utilized as a gateway for remote monitoring\
    \ in this\nstudy. Raspberry Pi can connect with sensors to operate applications,\
    \ such as the DHT11\nTemperature Sensor and Soil Moisture Sensor, which forecasts\
    \ temperature and rainfall\nranges. The gateway is integrated with Amazon Web\
    \ Services’ (AWS) IoT platform. MQTT\nis a messaging protocol that allows for\
    \ various messages across distant connections [20].\nThe study reported establishing\
    \ an autonomous greenhouse smart aquaponics man-\nagement organized on temperature\
    \ via the use of an Android-based monitoring and\nautomatic correction system\
    \ and a Raspberry Pi-based plant growth monitoring system.\nReal-time data is\
    \ collected using the light intensity sensor and the ambient temperature\nand\
    \ humidity sensors. Additionally, the pH and temperature of the recirculating\
    \ water\nare monitored. Suppose the data acquired is beyond the threshold range.\
    \ In this case, the\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n7 of 21\nsystem quickly engages the\
    \ correction devices, which comprise a peristaltic buffer device,\nan aerator,\
    \ an evaporative cooler, inlet and exhaust fans, and grow lights. The internet\n\
    remote access function enables real-time data transmission and receipt through\
    \ the android\napp amongst the smartphone and computer system. This study compared\
    \ plant devel-\nopment in smart aquaponics to traditional agriculture based on\
    \ soil systems employing\nimage processing in two investigational operations.\
    \ Following record collection, it was\ndetermined that the smart aquaponics system\
    \ achieved greater output than conventional\nagriculture monitoring. As lettuce,\
    \ mustard greens, and pak choi are produced in a smart\naquaponics system vs.\
    \ traditional soil-based farming, this study focused exclusively on\nlettuce,\
    \ mustard greens, and pak choi [21].\nA tree topology was used for the WSN-enabled\
    \ agricultural monitoring system to\nimprove performance. A cheap sensor node\
    \ like a commercial sensor or a NodeMCU\nmodule transmits data to the control\
    \ unit over Wi-Fi. Fertilizer, fertigation improvement,\nand agricultural operations\
    \ are monitored by data processing and thresholding. The in-\ncorporation of cost-effective\
    \ ICT technology with traditional crop management or weather\nmonitoring and sensor\
    \ data created the agronomic model. Minimal environmental impact\nfrom crop growing\
    \ was achieved as a consequence of large fertilizer and water savings [22].\n\
    2.6. Climate Conditions Monitoring\nIn farming, the weather is extremely important.\
    \ Incorrect climate knowledge can\nhave an impact on crop quality and quantity.\
    \ On the other hand, farmers may use IoT\nsolutions to put sensors in the ﬁeld,\
    \ including humidity sensors, temperature sensors,\nrainfall sensors, and water\
    \ level sensors, to collect real-time data from the environment.\nThese sensors\
    \ monitor the state of crops and the environment in which they grow. If a\nworrying\
    \ environmental situation is discovered, it is either automatically corrected\
    \ or a\nwarning is sent to the farmer.\nGreenhouses created an Internet of Things-based\
    \ weather station to address the cost\nand accuracy issues. The TI CC2650 Sensor\
    \ Tag and IBM Cloud Platform continuously\nmonitor weather and abiotic factors,\
    \ transfer the detected values to the cloud, and send\ne-mail notiﬁcations when\
    \ values deviate. As a result, this study may be expanded to\ninclude the use\
    \ of ML model-based classiﬁcation training to categorize a plant’s health as\n\
    excellent, moderate, or terrible based on the average temperature, humidity, light\
    \ intensity,\nand air pressure. This would help to clarify abstracts about a plant’s\
    \ health to a larger level\nand might aid in keeping the plants’ health in good\
    \ shape [23].\nArifﬁn et al. [24] used an autonomous temperature control system\
    \ to address the\ndrawbacks of traditional growing methods, which are expensive,\
    \ have low yields, and\nneed a lot of care. The suggested IoT-based architecture\
    \ was evaluated in a real-world\nsetting at the Bandar Puteri Centre of NASOM\
    \ (National Autism Society of Malaysia).\nThe ideal temperature for oyster mushrooms\
    \ is between 20 and 30 ◦C, with a humidity\nlevel of 70 to 80%. Two sensors were\
    \ installed in the mushroom house’s center and corner\nto detect temperature and\
    \ moisture, then communicated to a remote monitoring station\nthrough a microcontroller\
    \ unit for further action. The results of the six-day experiment\nrevealed that\
    \ an effective automatic monitoring system, which can regulate the farm’s\nhome\
    \ while reducing resources and human labor, was developed. The mushroom home,\n\
    IoT control box, and Web Client interface were all designed within the system.\
    \ As a result,\nthe mushroom house provided a regulated environment for mushroom\
    \ growing as well as\nprotection from pests and insects. The climate control system,\
    \ which automates controlling\nthe ideal environment for oyster mushroom production,\
    \ was housed in the IoT control box.\n3. Major Equipment and Technologies\nMajor\
    \ equipment and IoT technologies are fully demonstrated in the next subsections,\n\
    such as various sensors, agricultural drones, and harvesting robots.\nAgronomy\
    \ 2022, 12, 127\n8 of 21\n3.1. Sensors\nThe visual sensor, multispectral sensor,\
    \ thermal sensor, lidar sensor, and hyperspectral\nsensor are only a few of the\
    \ sensors utilized in IoT-based smart agriculture and drone\ntechnologies. Current\
    \ IoT-based sensor applications in smart agriculture are presented in\nTable 2.\n\

    Sensors\nOperations of Different Sensors\nDHT11 Sensor:\nDHT11 sensor measures\
    \ temperature and humidity\n[12].\nSEN0193: Soil Moisture Sensor\nSEN0193 is a\
    \ Soil Moisture Sensor. The dielectric\npermittivity of soil is a consequence\
    \ of its moisture\ncontent. The sensor generates a voltage proportional\nto the\
    \ dielectric permittivity of the soil and hence to\nits water content. The sensor\
    \ takes an average of the\nwater content over its whole length. The Soil\nMoisture\
    \ Sensor is used to quantify moisture loss\nover time due to plant absorption\
    \ and evaporation,\ndetermine optimal soil moisture information for\ndifferent\
    \ plant species, monitor soil moisture\ninformation in greenhouses to regulate\
    \ irrigation,\nand optimize bottle biology research. [20].\nTurbidity Sensor SKU\
    \ SEN0189:\nThe turbidity sensor determines the quality of water\nby detecting\
    \ its turbidity level. It detects suspended\nparticles in water using light by\
    \ measuring the light\ntransmittance and scattering rate, which vary the\nquantity\
    \ of total suspended solids (TSS) in the water\n[25].\nMH-Z14A:\nThis is used\
    \ to monitor the CO2 level at high\nprecision.\nBH1750:\nThis is used to monitor\
    \ the light intensity level (as\nphotosynthesis is related to light intensity)\
    \ and to\nconduct experiments on the inﬂuence of light\nintensity on the greenhouse\
    \ environment’s\ntemperature [26].\nRain sensor:\nA rain sensor is a simple instrument\
    \ for detecting\nrain pressure. It may be used as a switch to\ndetermine the strength\
    \ of rainfall when a raindrop\nfalls through the rainy board [27,28].\nLidar sensor:\n\
    The top camera sensor is an imaging range camera\nthat estimates the distance\
    \ between the camera and\nthe subject at each point in the collected images [29].\n\
    3.2. Agricultural Drones\nUAVs can monitor the health of crops, apply pesticides,\
    \ and take hyperspectral images\nin precision agriculture. Drones can scan a crop\
    \ for issues in plants using visible and\nnear-infrared light, and they can determine\
    \ which plants reﬂect what quantities of green\nand NIR light. Photosynthetic\
    \ activity diminishes when a plant is stressed. This data may\nbe used to create\
    \ numerous images that track plant changes and indicate their health. As a\nresult,\
    \ farmers can more accurately administer treatments after a disease has been identiﬁed.\n\
    Drones are also utilized for surveillance, trafﬁc monitoring, and weather monitoring\
    \ in\nagriculture. Drone technology employs various sensors, including optical,\
    \ multispectral,\nthermal, lidar, and hyperspectral sensors, which are brieﬂy\
    \ detailed in Section 3.1.\nCrop management has beneﬁted from the Internet of\
    \ Things, remote sensing, and\nanalytic data approaches. Pests may be identiﬁed,\
    \ targeted, and managed to utilize remote\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n9 of 21\nsensing\
    \ using UAVs. UAVs can ﬂy in tough and harsh terrains to take high-resolution\n\
    images that allow pests to be identiﬁed and controlled. Many crop security concerns\
    \ may\nbe solved using UAVs equipped with cameras, which are not possible with\
    \ traditional pest\nmanagement methods. UAVs have been used to automate insect\
    \ damage in agricultural\nareas [30,31].\nAn automated rotating device based on\
    \ sun illumination angle perception keeps the\nsolar panel perpendicular to the\
    \ sun and increases solar energy harvesting rates. Based on\nspectrum analysis\
    \ technology, Internet of Things approaches, including several wireless\ntechnologies,\
    \ such as TVWS, ZigBee, and LoRa, are suggested to collect data and send it\n\
    to a base station/gateway to assess the degree of damage caused by pests and diseases.\n\
    In addition, a technique for maximizing wind force usage and to extend the time\
    \ of ﬂight for\ndrones has been established to support drones in downwind by designing\
    \ the ﬂying path\nimplementation. The study’s scope is limited, with the goal\
    \ of developing a long-standing\ninsect and disease detection technique through\
    \ extensive data gathering and analysis.\nThe suggested model will be tested in\
    \ real-world scenarios. For example, crop diseases\nand insects might be tracked\
    \ in real-time and climatic changes could be analyzed [32].\nThe Internet of Things-based\
    \ approach is illustrated for smart agriculture monitoring in\nFigure 3.\nFigure\
    \ 3. IOT-based smart agriculture monitoring system.\n3.3. Harvesting Robots\n\
    Under speciﬁc climatic circumstances, a harvesting robot is intended to gather\
    \ fruits\nautonomously. The advancement of vision-based harvesting robots’ mechanism\
    \ is yet in its\nearly stages. Agricultural robotic systems, on the other hand,\
    \ have comparable architecture.\nThe system is comprised of an autonomous mobile\
    \ platform, a lightweight mechanical\narm with multiple degrees of freedom, an\
    \ adaptable end effector for a power response\nsystem, a multi-sensor machine\
    \ vision system, a smart decision and drive management\nsystem, and supplementary\
    \ hardware and software [33]. Kang et al., 2020 [34] developed\nan intense neural\
    \ network to assist robotic apple harvesting, which detects and grasps\nfruit\
    \ in a real-time environment using a computer vision system. The proposed robotic\n\
    harvesting system was implemented using a customized soft end-effector comprised\
    \ of\nIntel i7-6700 CPU and NVIDIA GTX-1070 GPU and DELL-INSPIRATION main computer\n\
    unit, Intel D-435 RGBD visualization camera, and UR5 Universal Robot (modern robotic\n\
    manipulator). The proposed approach uses Mobile-DasNet, a computationally efﬁcient\n\
    lightweight one-stage instance segmentation network to conduct fruit recognition\
    \ and\ninstance segmentation on sensory input. An improved PointNet model was\
    \ also developed\nto conduct fruit modeling and grip estimates from an RGB-D camera\
    \ through the point\nclouds technique. The two qualities described above were\
    \ utilized and integrated to\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n10 of 21\ndevelop and build\
    \ a precise robotic system for autonomous fruit picking. The goal of the\nstudy\
    \ was to improve the vision algorithm’s performance, boost, and improvements.\n\
    Furthermore, the proposed soft end-effector robotic device may improve its grasping\n\
    recognition proportion and effectiveness under various situations. Ogorodnikova\
    \ and\nAli [35] devised a technique for recognizing ripe tomatoes in a greenhouse\
    \ setting using a\nmachine vision system of a harvesting robot. To effectively\
    \ execute the suggested image\nprocessing method for this purpose, RGB color images\
    \ from a typical digital camera are\nrequired. In the second stage, RGB color\
    \ images are converted to HSV, which is easier\nfor extracting red tomato from\
    \ the green backdrop in the image. Image segmentation,\nthresholding, and morphological\
    \ operations separate a red tomato from a green background\ncolor photograph.\
    \ The algorithm is built using Matlab methods and then evaluated to see\nif it\
    \ produces favorable results. The process can be converted into fast-acting codes\
    \ for the\nharvesting robot’s controller since it is basic and short. The research\
    \ is limited to moving\nthe gripper to the proper place in tomato detection and\
    \ developing efﬁcient algorithms\nusing 3D gripper models to transform the existing\
    \ research system into industrial robots.\nOnly a few robotic devices that can\
    \ successfully perform watering, planting, and\nweeding activities now exist.\
    \ FaRo (Cultivating RObot), a new smart robot based on a CNC\nmachine, has been\
    \ presented for automatic crop farming deprived of human involvement in\nagriculture.\
    \ What sets FaRo apart from other farming platforms is its capability to complete\n\
    the entire farming cycle, from sowing to harvesting. In addition, the FaRo harvesting\n\
    tool will be discussed and shown. FarmBot can only be used for a limited time,\
    \ from\nsowing to harvesting, after which the robot’s tool mount system will be\
    \ exchanged for crop\nharvest. In this example, the robot assumes the role of\
    \ a tomato collector. Both the FaRo\nharvesting robot and the unique kinematics\
    \ of the continuum manipulator design were\nthoroughly discussed. Due to implementation\
    \ problems, the robot’s design is currently in\nthe development stage. The objective\
    \ of the proposed system is to build a model with an\nintelligent agricultural\
    \ monitoring technique linked to the main database, and the robot\nwill have sufﬁcient\
    \ information to plant and cultivate crops without the need for human\nintervention\
    \ [36].\nA depth vision-based approach for detecting and placing truck containers\
    \ is proposed\nfor the joint harvesting system, along with three coordinate systems.\
    \ This method included\ndata preprocessing, point cloud poses transformation using\
    \ the SVD (singular value decom-\nposition) algorithm, upper edge segmentation\
    \ and projection, RANSAC (Random Sample\nConsensus) algorithm edge line extraction\
    \ and corner point positioning, and fusion and\nvisualization of results on the\
    \ depth image. Field trials show that the suggested approach\nis effective in\
    \ identifying and positioning vehicles. However, the study is restricted due\n\
    to its sensitivity to the appearance of truck containers and the presence of loud\
    \ sites in\nthe agricultural area. Autonomous driving and path planning in the\
    \ forage harvester’s\nunloading system is still challenging [37].\nIntelligent\
    \ robots have become extensively employed in various sectors as the in-\ntelligent\
    \ computer industry with automation expands. Currently, manual labor is still\n\
    used to harvest the majority of domestic crops. However, owing to constant worker\
    \ pay\nhikes, the manual picking technique increases the fruit farmer’s ﬁnancial\
    \ expenditures,\nand the appliances of robots in the farming business are challenging.\
    \ As a result, the\nsmart moveable robot picker has been introduced based on computer\
    \ vision machinery by\nincorporating the robot arm, selector, ﬂexible carrier,\
    \ track procedure, and the intelligence\nunit, which accomplishes the robot picker’s\
    \ travel channel coding, auto-judging the ripe\nfruit, and in addition a vision-based\
    \ binocular stereoscopic methodology employed for the\nfunctions of recognition\
    \ and placement. To begin with, precise segmentation recognition\nand maturity\
    \ evaluation of the target fruit is required for proper picking. Thus, the robot\n\
    picker may potentially replace human labor in manual picking. The most important\
    \ part\nof the recognition process is gathering fruit image samples, which is\
    \ performed using a\nCCD camera that shoots following the preprocessed fruit features\
    \ using image content.\nThe color model is then built up, and it separates the\
    \ fruit and surrounding surroundings\nusing segmentation technology before recognizing\
    \ the fruit. Additionally, it precisely traces\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n11 of\
    \ 21\nand goes for the fruit location in relation to the three-dimensional coordinate\
    \ information\nprovided by the infrared source and the fruit contour and image\
    \ differences taken by\nthe two cameras simultaneously. To ﬁnish the picking operation,\
    \ it must program the\npath recognition to avoid the obstacle [38]. The overall\
    \ architecture of IoT-based fruit\nidentiﬁcation for harvesting is shown in Figure\
    \ 4.\nFigure 4. General architecture of IoT-based fruit detection for harvesting.\n\
    4. Open Issues and Key Challenges in Smart Agriculture\nThe problems of deploying\
    \ IoT-based agricultural systems are discussed in this section.\nThe sensors’\
    \ durability and cost are described. The IoT-based system requires a constant\n\
    source of electricity. Depending on the size, a lot of electricity may be required.\
    \ However,\nin rural and village communities, obtaining such electricity is challenging.\
    \ To meet the\nenergy requirement, alternative energy sources, such as solar and\
    \ wind, must be employed.\nThis will also raise the price signiﬁcantly. It is\
    \ necessary to have a dependable internet\nconnection in rural and village regions.\
    \ It is the most crucial aspect of establishing an\nIoT-based system. The connection\
    \ must have a sufﬁcient bandwidth to transport data in\naccordance with the application’s\
    \ requirements. Farmers need basic computer/tablet (HID\ndevice) training and\
    \ an understanding of how the IoT system operates. It is also necessary\nto provide\
    \ proper education on the unique IoT deployment in their farm [39].\nThere are\
    \ six major obstacles to developing a green IoT-based agriculture system,\ninvolving\
    \ infrastructure, mobility, maintenance, hardware, data privacy, data analytics,\
    \ and\ndata security. The selection of meters and sensors used for Internet of\
    \ Things tools is one\nof the hardware issues. As a result, many different sensors\
    \ may be utilized in Internet of\nThings applications, such as the water quality\
    \ sensor, humidity sensor, chemical sensor,\npressure sensor, temperature sensor,\
    \ and more. The data analytics problem is machine\nlearning, deep learning methods,\
    \ and prediction algorithm applications in smart agricul-\nture to produce a nutritional\
    \ suspension using IoT records. Routine sensor inspections\nof all Internet of\
    \ Things appliances are a maintenance issue while it may be certainly\nharmed\
    \ in the farm area. The mobility problem is related to 4G, 5G, WiFi, 6LowPan,\
    \ LoRa\nnetwork connection, which link sensors spread across a broad region in\
    \ the farm areas.\nSome infrastructural trials are developing and implementing\
    \ Internet of Things-connected\narchitectures that incorporate innovative technologies,\
    \ such as cloud and fog computing\nand network virtualization. Finally, the primary\
    \ issue in advancing smart agriculture based\non IoT is not physical maintenance\
    \ but rather ensuring security and privacy [8].\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n12 of\
    \ 21\nThe UAVs that are linked wirelessly are subject to cyber-physical or harmful\
    \ assaults\nto fool the control signals due to open communication lines. Such\
    \ attempts represent a\nsigniﬁcant risk to the unmanned aerial vehicle system\
    \ in terms of private information\ncrash or theft, as well as mission failure.\
    \ Moreover, the faking of control signals may harm\nthe UAV mission and make it\
    \ harder to restore it. As a result, improving UAV wireless\ncommunication’s safety\
    \ and conﬁdentiality element, which necessitates in-depth research\nof security\
    \ concerns covering the entire network protocol layers [40], is an important\n\
    open subject.\nVisual harvesting of robots’ dynamic tracking of objects with great\
    \ precision remains\nan unresolved challenge. Further study should also aim to\
    \ enhance the precision placement\nand operation by merging smart behavior judgment,\
    \ adequate fault tolerance, robot vision\nwith artiﬁcial intelligence technology\
    \ for accurate placement, and function enhancement.\nThe recognition and location\
    \ accuracy are impacted when the crop situation is varied due\nto the lighting\
    \ and unconstrained circumstances of the ﬁeld ecosystem. A robot vision\napproach\
    \ would be efﬁcient in harvesting crops correctly to increase the success rate\
    \ of\nrobotic harvesting in such settings. The researchers used geometric features,\
    \ novel image\nalgorithms, and intelligent decision theory to address the challenges.\
    \ However, because\nmassive datasets are necessary to train efﬁcient deep learning\
    \ algorithms, further study\nis needed [33]. Table 3 presents a comparison of\
    \ the current state of the art on smart\nagriculture obstacles and beneﬁts.\n\

    One of the most challenging aspects of robotic grasping is estimation. Traditional\n\
    techniques have limitations since noise or partial loss of the point cloud might\
    \ impact the\nestimation’s accuracy and resilience. Estimation is more difﬁcult\
    \ in orchard situations than\nit was in interior environments.\nData Handling\
    \ and Processing\nTraditional vision algorithms’ performance is constantly restricted\
    \ in complicated\nand volatile settings [34]. World food consumption is predicted\
    \ to treble by 2050 due to\npopulation expansion and societal progress, yet increasing\
    \ food production is now difﬁcult\ndue to declining water, climate alterations,\
    \ less proper soil, and insects and illnesses. Pests\nand diseases have always\
    \ been signiﬁcant stumbling blocks to increased grain output.\nSatellite technology\
    \ is climate sensitive and has a limited illumination variation, making it\nchallenging\
    \ to satisfy the requirement for insects and infection management in farming\n\
    areas. Currently, low-altitude autonomous drones (offering excellent ﬂexibility\
    \ and image\nresolution) can satisfy the needs of agricultural insect and infection\
    \ management. In some\ncircumstances, such as when there is a high wind, drone\
    \ stability might be difﬁcult. As a\nresult, the drone’s ﬂight route must be designed\
    \ in conjunction with the actual conditions.\nLong ﬂights are necessary for ﬁeld\
    \ pest and disease data collection; thus, choosing a sunny\nday with a moderate\
    \ breeze might be a viable alternative [32]. Identifying malicious and\ncompromised\
    \ nodes among soil sensors interacting with the base station is a signiﬁcant\n\
    problem in the base station to cloud communications. The trust management method\
    \ is\npresented as one of the options for identifying these nodes in a lightweight\
    \ manner.\nFinally, the study highlighted the existing problems and possibilities\
    \ and future re-\nsearch in vegetable and fruit identiﬁcation and placement. The\
    \ majority of previous research\nshowed that illumination variations, grouping,\
    \ and unconstrained situations have been the\nmain obstacles to effective recognition\
    \ and localization of vegetables and fruits in the ﬁeld.\nFurther research will\
    \ be required to overcome the existing state-of-the-art challenges and\nenhance\
    \ the performance, accuracy, efﬁciency, effectiveness, recognition, and success\
    \ rate\nof controlling and image processing techniques. However, fruit recognition,\
    \ detection, posi-\ntioning, harvesting robots, and application robustness enhancement\
    \ need to minimize the\ninclusive computational cost and time. Future research\
    \ might include algorithms and cam-\nera operation advancements, sensor platforms\
    \ that can enhance illumination consistently,\nhorticultural changes, and human–machine\
    \ collaboration [29]. Furthermore, sophisticated\nmethodologies, algorithms, and\
    \ computational approaches are necessary to address the\nlack of precision in\
    \ harvesting operations.\n5. Discussion and Analysis\nIt is estimated that plant\
    \ diseases are a signiﬁcant contributor to global ﬁnancial\ndeﬁcits. Numerous\
    \ abiotic and biotic stresses and continual tension monitoring concerns\nthe impacts\
    \ of the loss of fruit-producing plants. Consequently, the $15 billion U.S. apple\n\
    Agronomy 2022, 12, 127\n14 of 21\nindustry loses millions of dollars every year.\
    \ Fruits are one of the most signiﬁcant sources\nof nutrients in plants; yet,\
    \ illnesses, pests, fungous, infectious, and microbial diseases all\naffect the\
    \ quality and quantity of fruits. Using computer vision-based methods, the issue\n\
    may now be alleviated. Diseases/infections may be detected early and effectively\
    \ using\nthese methods.\nThe sickness classiﬁcation of various fruit leaves was\
    \ achieved using a deep convolu-\ntional neural network DCNN approach. The deep\
    \ features are retrieved by ﬁrst utilizing\ndeep learning networks, such as AlexNet\
    \ and VGG-s, and then tweaked using a transfer\nlearning approach. Before the\
    \ selection step, a multi-level fusion strategy is offered, and\nthe chosen features\
    \ analyzed to produce the entropy basis features. To categorize the\nobtained\
    \ feature map, we employed a multi-SVM classiﬁer. The diseases investigated in\n\
    the experiments include apple rust, scab, black rot, peach bacterial spots, and\
    \ cherry pow-\ndery mildew, and they were all gathered from a plant village dataset.\
    \ The recommended\nmethod’s better performance in terms of a 97.8% accuracy, 97.6%\
    \ sensitivity, 97.6% precision,\nand G-measure was observed in the classiﬁcation\
    \ results (97.6%) [44]. Some research has\ninvestigated whether computer vision\
    \ approaches may be employed for scalable and early\nplant sickness detection.\
    \ There is still a critical lack of non-lab data sets that can be utilized\nto\
    \ allow vision-based plant disease detection. For visual plant disease identiﬁcation,\
    \ the\nPlantDoc dataset was supplied. The collection has 2598 data points in total,\
    \ encompassing\n13 plant species and up to 17 disease categories, and was developed\
    \ by annotating internet-\nscraped photos for 300 human hours. Three models for\
    \ plant disease classiﬁcation were\ntrained to illustrate the dataset’s effectiveness.\
    \ The ﬁndings demonstrate that employing\nour dataset models may enhance the recognition\
    \ rate by up to 31%. The recommended\ndataset, we feel, will contribute to decreasing\
    \ the entry barrier for computer vision algo-\nrithms in plant disease detection.\
    \ For photos featuring leaves from various classes in a\ndataset with contextual\
    \ noise, and low-resolution leaf images, the model fails to give proper\nconclusions.\
    \ Using image segmentation methods to extract leaves from the photos can\nboost\
    \ the dataset’s utility. Although the dataset has been rigorously veriﬁed, particular\n\
    photographs in the collection may be wrongly labeled owing to a lack of sufﬁcient\
    \ topic\nknowledge [45].\nIt is necessary to construct an improved VGG16-based\
    \ DCNN model to detect apple\nleaf diseases (scab, frogeye spots, and cedar rust).\
    \ The global average pooling layer re-\nplaces the fully connected layer to lessen\
    \ restrictions and a batch normalization layer is\nattached to boost the model’s\
    \ computational performance. Furthermore, to avoid a long\ntraining time, a transfer\
    \ learning approach is applied. To detect apple leaf diseases, the\nsuggested\
    \ model makes use of 2446 apple leaves, 2141 photos in the training phase and\
    \ 305\nimages in the testing phase. The experimental data reveal that utilizing\
    \ the recommended\napproach, the total accuracy of apple leaf classiﬁcation may\
    \ reach 99.01%. Furthermore,\nthe ﬁndings demonstrate that cedar rust is accurately\
    \ diagnosed, but one healthy person is\nmisclassiﬁed as scab and the other as\
    \ frogeye spots.\nFurthermore, the model parameters are cut by 89% compared to\
    \ the standard VGG16.\nAs a result, the classiﬁcation performance is raised by\
    \ 6.3%, and the computational com-\nplexity is cut to 0.56% of the innovative\
    \ model. Consequently, the DCNN model developed\nin this study provides a more\
    \ accurate and speedier way for recognizing apple leaf infec-\ntions [46]. Table\

    -\nFor the recognition and detection of olive diseases, such as peacock spot,\
    \ anthracnose,\nand canker, an improved convolutional neural network (CNN) dubbed\
    \ AlexNet was\nsuggested. Several innovations separate the proposed model from\
    \ others. It uses effective\nintelligent data preprocessing with a stable image\
    \ in each class, a transfer learning approach,\nand an extended and upgraded PlantVillage\
    \ dataset to work in more complicated situations.\nThe total accuracy of the suggested\
    \ technique is 99.11%, which is the best possible score.\nFurthermore, it possesses\
    \ precision, recall, and F1 measures of 99.49%, 99.11%, and 99.29%,\nrespectively.\
    \ Despite the fact that model training takes a long time, classiﬁcation during\n\
    testing takes only a few seconds on a CPU [47]. Citrus fruits, leaves, and stems\
    \ are included\nin the image dataset. The collection contains images of normal\
    \ and diseased citrus leaves\nand fruits, including greening, scab, blackspot,\
    \ canker, and melanosis. There are 759 images\nof normal and abnormal citrus leaves\
    \ and fruits in the data collection. The images had\na resolution of 5202 × 3465\
    \ (Mpix), and when scaled at 72 dpi, the width and height\nwere 256 × 256 pixels,\
    \ correspondingly. The contaminated images were divided into four\nvarious citrus\
    \ illnesses and left on their own. The entire process consists of four major\n\
    steps: (a) enhancing the dataset using Top-hat and then Gaussian functions; (b)\
    \ weighted\nsegmentation and segmentation of lesion through a saliency map, which\
    \ highlights the\ninfested area; (c) color, texture, and geometric feature extraction\
    \ from the diseased area;\nand (d) PCA, skewness, and entropy-based feature selection\
    \ and implementation.\nAgriculture management, water contamination, and air quality\
    \ analysis monitoring\nsystems were all investigated as part of the smart environment\
    \ monitoring (SEM) system.\nFigure 5 demonstrates that substantial investigation\
    \ of smart environment monitoring\nhas increased over the period in both cases,\
    \ speciﬁcally research involving the wireless\nsensor network and Internet of\
    \ Things along with research involving machine learning and\nInternet of Things\
    \ [41,51].\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n16 of 21\nFigure 5. Research contribution\
    \ using IoT, WSN, and machine learning.\nImperfect network access, lack of a (or\
    \ no) power supply, and high framework costs\ncompared to an ordinary farmer’s\
    \ income were presented in a low-cost, energy-proﬁcient,\nprotected, dependable,\
    \ and heterogeneous three-layer approach for Internet of Things-\nbased smart\
    \ agriculture. IoT devices make up the ﬁrst layer, including IoT-based smart\n\
    agriculture monitoring like insect detection, theft detection, crop monitoring,\
    \ smart ir-\nrigation, smart poultry, food supply chain, and food preservation\
    \ monitoring systems.\nThe low-power LoRaWAN network connects the IoT devices\
    \ to the gateways. The next\nlayer is made up of local processing servers and\
    \ gateways that are connected with the\ngateways. The cloud layer, which uses\
    \ the publicly available FIWARE framework to offer a\nset of open-source API standards,\
    \ is the third layer. This study aimed to create diagnostic\ntechniques for packet\
    \ combination procedures at the fog node before they were sent over\nthe network\
    \ facility to cloud servers. This aims to decrease short IoT packet processing\n\
    overheads and optimize energy usage at the backbone, as billions of IoT devices\
    \ linked to\nfog nodes are projected to generate massive volumes of short IoT\
    \ packets [52].\nA Cuckoo Search Algorithm has been created, allowing water allocated\
    \ for farming\nunder all situations. Temperature, turbidity, pH, and moisture\
    \ were collected utilizing the\nInternet of Things (IoT) infrastructure outﬁtted\
    \ with wireless communication devices and\nsensors. ThingSpeak presented the sensor\
    \ data in the cloud system in this IoT platform.\nThe ThingSpeak data was utilized\
    \ in the suggested Cuckoo Search Algorithm, which\nidentiﬁed suitable yields for\
    \ a given soil [53]. Incorrect or late identiﬁcation can result in\noveruse or\
    \ underuse of chemicals, resulting in higher production costs and environmental\n\
    and health consequences. With varied lighting, angles, surfaces, noise, and high\
    \ resolutions,\n3651 real-time indication images of various apple infections were\
    \ manually collected.\nA subset of this dataset was labeled by experts, such as\
    \ cedar apple rust, scab, and normal\nleaves, and open-sourced for the Plant Pathology\
    \ Challenge to Kaggle community. We also\nused this data to train a standard CNN\
    \ (convolutional neural network), which obtained\n97% recognition on a held-out\
    \ test set and a maximum AUC value of 0.986. The project’s\ngoal was to keep adding\
    \ additional images to the pilot dataset from various perspectives,\nlighting,\
    \ and distances to create a bigger more complete labeled database by experts.\n\
    The dataset will contain pests and diseases, such as apple mites and aphids and\
    \ apple\nleaves comprising apple marssonina and alternaria leaf blotch, leaf spot,\
    \ frogeye, rot, cedar,\nand powdery mildew, ﬁre blight, and scab-labeled images.\n\
    Additionally, it will be photographed and remarked on fruit infected with apple\
    \ brown\nrot, bitter rot, or scab [54]. An Internet of Things-based cost-effective\
    \ monitoring system\nwas developed to address particular crop irrigation, soil\
    \ erosion, and irregular irrigation.\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n17 of 21\nThe suggested\
    \ method entails building a distributed WSN (wireless sensor network), with\n\
    multiple sensor modules covering each part of the farm and transferring data to\
    \ a central\nserver. ML techniques will aid irrigation pattern forecasts based\
    \ on yields and climate\nenvironments. According to a comparison of several algorithms,\
    \ random forest regression\nhas a decent accuracy of 81.6%. However, due to harsh\
    \ weather conditions, the system\nis constrained in many ways: the forecast accuracy\
    \ is dependent on the setup’s correct\ninstallation, and the threat of wild animals\
    \ can harm the hardware setup [48]. Because\nhuman abilities and agricultural\
    \ gear are severely restricted compared to robot knowledge,\nrobotic systems in\
    \ agriculture can be highly beneﬁcial in achieving both high quality\nand quantity\
    \ goods. To integrate IoT systems with agricultural machinery, a new way\nof managing\
    \ control signals from the control system to the actuators is required. These\n\
    methods should increase economic viability while also lowering environmental impact\
    \ and\nenhancing food sustainability. It handles various agricultural tasks, including\
    \ moisture\nsensing, irrigation, crop monitoring, and insect and animal defense\
    \ [55]. Accordingly, a\nstate-of-the-art technologies-based accuracy comparison\
    \ is presented in Figure 6.\nFigure 6. Accuracy-based analysis of the different\
    \ state of the art techniques.\nWater monitoring is the most highly measured IoT\
    \ sub-vertical, followed by crop,\nsmart agriculture, animal, and irrigation monitoring.\
    \ All of these have the same proportion\nof peer-reviewed articles exploring the\
    \ possible uses of the Internet of Things. According\nto the ﬁndings, the most\
    \ important sensor data for measurement is 15.73% soil moisture,\n19.79% humidity,\
    \ and 24.87% ambient temperature. However, further sensor information,\nsuch as\
    \ soil pH and moisture, are also collected for IoT applications. Wi-Fi has the\
    \ highest\nclaimed use in farming and agriculture, with 30.27% and 21.10% use\
    \ of mobile tools, as\nshown in Figure 7. Other technologies like Bluetooth, WSN,\
    \ RFID, Raspberry Pi, ZigBee,\nLoRa, and GPRS are less popular in the agriculture\
    \ and farming industries. In the agri-\ncultural and farming business comparison,\
    \ the farming sector uses IoT for automation\nslower [42]. The Plant Server and\
    \ User View were created with phpMyAdmin to manage\nMySQL server management. The\
    \ F-RCNN-qualiﬁed model for anomaly detection had\n80% conﬁdence, while the technique\
    \ for the transfer of learning illness had 95.75% accu-\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n\

    \ IoT.\n6. Conclusions and Future Directions\nThe implementation of sustainable\
    \ communication technologies and sensors based on\nIoT is necessary to increase\
    \ agricultural productivity. Wireless sensors, unmanned aerial\nvehicles, and\
    \ cloud computing have been shown to be practical tools for guaranteeing\nlong-term\
    \ agricultural productivity. Many processes throughout the production cycle,\n\
    including irrigation, soil sample and mapping, fertilizer or pest control, yield\
    \ monitoring,\nforecasting, and harvesting, may be automated using smart devices,\
    \ allowing for improved\ncrop quality and growth capacity. The key effective features,\
    \ important applications, IoT-\nbased smart agriculture technology and equipment,\
    \ and open barriers and possibilities\nwere all examined in this study. This research\
    \ will be expanded in the future to include\nsecurity and privacy issues in smart\
    \ agriculture using IoT methods.\nAuthor Contributions: All authors contributed\

    Digital Twins (DTs) have successfully entered industrial applications, including\
    \ aerospace,\nmanufacturing, and healthcare [1–3]. Smart farming, on the other\
    \ hand, which employs\nthe latest technological innovations to optimize crop production,\
    \ is revolutionizing the\nagriculture industry. As virtual replicas of physical\
    \ objects or systems, DTs represent a\nhighly promising advancement in this ﬁeld\
    \ [4]. In smart farming, digital twins enable\nagriculture experts, researchers,\
    \ and farmers to simulate various scenarios, test different\nstrategies, and predict\
    \ outcomes accurately. DTs in smart farming offer transformative\npossibilities,\
    \ revolutionizing crop cultivation and management while enabling optimization\n\
    of resource utilization, minimizing environmental footprint, and enhancing crop\
    \ yields for\na sustainable and efﬁcient agricultural ecosystem.\nHowever, despite\
    \ the signiﬁcant promise of digital twins in smart farming, many\nquestions and\
    \ challenges still need to be addressed. Farming, a traditionally labor-intensive\n\
    sector, after its transformation to a technology-intensive sector in the last\
    \ decade, has\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128. https://doi.org/10.3390/s23167128\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\n\
    Sensors 2023, 23, 7128\n2 of 38\nbecome more complex and technologically advanced\
    \ in recent years, moving toward inno-\nvative technologies, particularly with\
    \ the explosion of precision agriculture and other digital\ntechnologies [5].\
    \ These technologies help farmers make more informed decisions about crop\nmanagement,\
    \ soil health, and various factors inﬂuencing crop yields and economic viability,\n\
    enhancing overall agricultural productivity and proﬁtability. However, these technologies\n\
    can also require specialized knowledge and skills and signiﬁcant investment in\
    \ hardware,\nsoftware, and other infrastructural resources. Additionally, factors\
    \ such as climate change,\nchanging consumer preferences, and market ﬂuctuations\
    \ can add to the complexity of\nmodern farming. While these challenges can make\
    \ farming more complicated, they also\noffer opportunities for innovation and\
    \ growth in the agriculture domain.\nIn this era of smart farming, the incorporation\
    \ of cutting-edge technologies such\nas computing, communication, personal and\
    \ cloud computing, the Internet of Things\n(IoT), Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI),\
    \ and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) has revolutionized\nthe landscape in agriculture.\
    \ These technologies bring additional capabilities beyond the\nphysical realm,\
    \ allowing for enhanced information and an improved understanding of\nthe physical\
    \ structures involved. The concept of DTs plays a pivotal role in providing\n\
    comprehensive and accurate information about physical systems, surpassing the\
    \ limita-\ntions of traditional modelling and simulation approaches. By leveraging\
    \ real-time data\ncollection, processing, and analysis, DTs offer a digital representation\
    \ of physical systems,\nenabling precise monitoring and forecasting of current\
    \ and future system states and re-\nbuilding existing models and re-design systems\
    \ and procedures. These advancements are\ninstrumental in transforming smart systems\
    \ and addressing the evolving challenges in the\nagricultural domain.\nThis review\
    \ paper offers a comprehensive and distinctive outline of the recent research\n\
    results regarding DTs in the context of smart agriculture, highlighting key ﬁndings\
    \ and\nidentifying areas for future research. Speciﬁcally, we report and discuss\
    \ the various types\nof digital twins used in smart farming, such as crop, weather,\
    \ and soil models, and explore\nhow they optimize crop production. We also examine\
    \ the challenges and limitations\nof deploying DTs in smart farming related to\
    \ data management, model accuracy, and\nscalability. By providing a comprehensive\
    \ review of the literature on DTs in smart farming,\nthis paper aims to advance\
    \ the understanding of this rapidly evolving ﬁeld, illustrate the\ngaps in existing\
    \ deployments, and identify opportunities for future research and innovation.\n\
    We proceeded with our research by pursuing the formulation of the DT implementa-\n\
    tion architecture regarding the smart agriculture domain while emphasizing the\
    \ critical\ncomponents taking part in implementing DTs. A comparative accumulation\
    \ of such im-\nplementations and critical components in three tables, while addressing\
    \ technical aspects,\nled to signiﬁcant conclusions regarding DT implementations\
    \ and related limitations that\nseem beneﬁcial to investigate. For example, although\
    \ the necessity of a DT model and\npractical implementations in agriculture is\
    \ addressed in most reviewed papers mentioning\nthe concept and deﬁnition, the\
    \ DT model is proposed merely as an evolving concept lacking\nsubstantial support\
    \ from implemented case studies. While the DTs seem continuously\nevolving, authors\
    \ refer to simulation models merely as proposals for future practical im-\nplementation.\
    \ Our research seeks to expand the scope of Agriculture 4.0 that necessitates\n\
    DTs and address the limitations of IoT-implemented solutions narrowed down by\
    \ mere\ntelemetry implementations.\nThe structure of this study proceeds as follows:\
    \ Section 2 delves into the concept of\nDTs and investigates their usage in the\
    \ realm of smart farming. Section 3 addresses the\nchallenges and confronting\
    \ measures regarding DT building components and relevant\ntechnologies. In Section\
    \ 4, DT applications in the agricultural domain are reviewed, while\nconclusions\
    \ and comments are unfolded in the Discussion in Section 5. Finally, in Section\
    \ 6,\nfuture directions for research and development are outlined respectively.\n\

    \ concept of a DT, which involves a connected virtual representation\nof a physical\
    \ object or system [6], appears to be relatively straightforward. However, its\n\
    application and implementation can differ significantly across various domains\
    \ and industries.\nAlthough it is quite clear that in addition to their core purpose\
    \ of modelling real-\nworld systems, DTs are designed to empower individuals to\
    \ make informed business\ndecisions with tangible impacts on the physical realm,\
    \ a clear deﬁnition of the DT concept\nmay be helpful to distinguish it from related\
    \ concepts such as simulation, modelling, and\ndata analytics. By deﬁning its\
    \ scope, characteristics, and capabilities, researchers and\npractitioners can\
    \ better identify the speciﬁc features and requirements that make a system\na\
    \ true DT.\n2.1. Deﬁnition of Digital Twins—What Does Digital Twins Term Stand\
    \ For?\nThe deﬁnition of DTs emerged in the early 2000s by Michael Grieves [6]\
    \ while evolving\nto a widely acceptable DT concept model where they act as a\
    \ bridge connecting physical\nentities in the real world with their virtual complements\
    \ in a digital environment, closing\nthe gap between the two. They establish vital\
    \ connections between data and information\nto seamlessly integrate these products’\
    \ virtual and real aspects [6,7]. The convergence\nof virtual and physical entities\
    \ in a virtual space and the real world lays the foundation\nfor creating a fundamental\
    \ DT model. By fostering dynamic interplay between these\ntangible and virtual\
    \ elements, the DT is a powerful representation of the combined physical-\nvirtual\
    \ system.\nMashaly M. in [8] outlines that DTs act as digital replicas of physical\
    \ systems and are\norganized by establishing data connections. This transformation\
    \ enables physical systems\nto exist virtually while ensuring a strong synchronization\
    \ between their physical and digital\ncounterparts. As a result, smooth interactions\
    \ and data exchange occur between the two\ndomains. The integration of the physical\
    \ and virtual domains provides valuable insights,\npredictive abilities, and the\
    \ potential for optimizing system performance following the\npattern illustrated\

    \ integration of physical and digital \ndomains. \nFigure 1. The generic representation\
    \ of a DT scheme’s dynamic integration of physical and digital domains.\nAccording\
    \ to Dyck G. et al. [9], the concept of DTs emerged from NASA’s pioneering\nwork\
    \ in integrating physical models and simulations [10,11] to analyze intricate\
    \ systems.\nOriginally conﬁned to the aerospace sector, the scope of DTs expanded\
    \ to encompass\nproduct lifecycle management across diverse industries. At its\
    \ core, as initially proposed\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128\n4 of 38\nby Grieves & Vickers\
    \ [6,7,12], a DT comprises a physical object, its corresponding digi-\ntal representation,\
    \ and the interconnectedness between the two that it is established for\nboth\
    \ ways.\nOngoing research continues to explore the wide-ranging applications and\
    \ integration\nas interfaces of the DTs in areas such as cloud manufacturing,\
    \ IoT, and Industry 4.0,\nwhere explicitly stated that the provided response is\
    \ a unique formulation based on the\ngiven information [13,14].\nHence, DTs serve\
    \ as virtual counterparts of real-world entities, created using sensor\ndata and\
    \ serving as dynamic representations of physical objects or systems throughout\n\
    various stages of their lifecycle. By harnessing the power of simulation and data\
    \ integration,\nDTs provide a comprehensive virtual environment that mirrors the\
    \ characteristics and\nbehaviour of their physical counterparts. This enables\
    \ continuous real-time monitoring,\nanalysis, and enhancement of the physical\
    \ objects or systems, resulting in enhanced perfor-\nmance, efﬁciency, and informed\
    \ decision-making, as stated by Saddik et al. in 2018 [1].\nDTs utilize actual\
    \ data from real-life situations, machine learning (ML) models, and\nsimulation\
    \ combined with data analysis to enhance comprehension, learning, and decision-\n\
    making processes. They enable the monitoring and control of various entities,\
    \ including\ndevices, machines, vehicles, and individuals. The proliferation of\
    \ the IoT has spurred\nthe advancement of diverse DT solutions across diverse\
    \ domains and use cases support-\ning simulation, optimization, and prediction.\
    \ Thus, major improvement steps have been\ntaken in the realm of decision-making\
    \ so that various sectors, including manufacturing,\nhealthcare, and smart cities,\
    \ have witnessed signiﬁcant advancements facilitated by di-\nverse technologies\
    \ like simulation software, IoT, and AI utilized in the ﬁeld of modelling\nand\
    \ simulation [4,13,15,16].\nTo simulate and model the physical system to succeed\
    \ in implementing the DTs, the\nuse of mathematical models is mandatory [17].\
    \ Once the observed physical phenomena of\ninterest are captured, foundational\
    \ mathematical equations are formulated to depict and\ncharacterize the dynamics\
    \ of these phenomena accurately. By constructing these mathemat-\nical models,\
    \ researchers and scientists can effectively represent and analyze the behavior\n\
    and relationships inherent in the observed physical phenomena. The models that\
    \ are\ndeveloped need to be validated by experimental stages on the ﬁeld or in\
    \ laboratory setups\nto verify the physical behavior of the problem under consideration\
    \ soundly. Therefore,\nin advanced DTs, a predominant trend is the utilization\
    \ of extensive datasets to establish\ndata-driven models. This approach operates\
    \ under the assumption that the data obtained\nfrom the system serves as a powerful\
    \ source of insight, offering profound revelations about\nits physical behavior.\
    \ As a result, these well-reﬁned DTs leverage the abundance of data\nto construct\
    \ accurate and thorough models that faithfully capture the intricacies of the\n\
    system’s behavior [18]. The interaction of data between the physical entity and\
    \ its digital\nrepresentation in a DT is visually depicted in Figure 2.\nBy using\
    \ AI tools, such as ML algorithms or artiﬁcial neural networks, or while\nutilizing\
    \ data processing, the system’s behavior against events may be predicted. Actions\n\

    \ we may\nimply that the DT of a physical process or object typically consists\
    \ of a speciﬁc collection\nof models, materialized digitally or virtually by computers\
    \ and associated services and\nprocesses. These models and services are designed\

    \ from agriculture stakeholders to be combined for\neffective decision-making\
    \ and analysis of future trends occasionally produce a large volume\nof non-uniform\
    \ data that needs to be processed in real-time. IoT gateways that provide\nconnectivity\
    \ between one or more ﬁeld devices and a service cloud offer accessibility to\n\
    previously hidden data from sensors, embedded controllers and IO devices and analyze\n\
    such data for multiple purposes, such as remote monitoring, preventive maintenance,\n\
    production optimization and building automation. IoT gateways are critical to\
    \ ensure data\nsecurity and communication security within the IIoT systems. A\
    \ data breach in such IIoT\nsystems could compromise agricultural production,\
    \ i.e., crop health degradation, transport\nand product processing, leading to\
    \ inferior production performance [23].\nThe exponential growth of IIoT and its\
    \ associated technologies has signiﬁcantly con-\ntributed to the advancement of\
    \ Industry 4.0 and intelligent manufacturing, forming the\nunderlying framework\
    \ for CDT. The substantial amount of data induced by IIoT devices\nplay a vital\
    \ role in facilitating the development of data-centric services as a crucial ele-\n\
    ment. While the concept of CDT continues to evolve rapidly, it is imperative to\
    \ address\noutstanding concerns surrounding the technology to unlock its full\
    \ potential and achieve\nits envisioned advantages.\nCDT systems integrate data\
    \ from different stakeholders as they combine several\nparameters, mainly concerning\
    \ immense amounts of data sharing, demanding measures\nto ensure security, privacy,\
    \ and protection of intellectual property (IP) concerning data.\nCDTs incorporate\
    \ cybersecurity infrastructure and employ data encryption mechanisms\nto address\
    \ these critical aspects effectively. These measures are implemented to regulate\n\
    transparency in CDTs, ensure the protection of intellectual property (IP), and\
    \ facilitate\nintegrated development processes [8,24].\nSimilarly, the notion\
    \ of DT systems emerges as a virtual representation of an enter-\nprise, encompassing\
    \ its resources, processes, workforce, locations, and systems to support\nstrategic\
    \ decision-making from the systems used for reporting operational data within\
    \ the\norganization, such as accounting, personnel planning, and sales [25]. This\
    \ type of DT which\nretrieves real-time data from the systems used for reporting\
    \ operational data within an\norganization, as mentioned earlier, is referred\
    \ to as a Strategic DT (SDT), in contrast to the\nindustrial DT that gathers information\
    \ from sensors, serving as a knowledge visualization\ntool that allows managers\
    \ to explore various strategies while minimizing space and time\nconstraints.\
    \ By simulating different strategic options through computer models, managers\n\
    can gain insights into the potential outcomes of their chosen approaches in the\
    \ real world.\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128\n7 of 38\n2.2. DTs in Agriculture\nAs stated\
    \ above, the implementation of DTs seems to extend to various ﬁelds vastly.\n\
    The objective of this review is to illuminate the ﬁeld of agriculture in the following\
    \ manner.\nA DT for agriculture, in particular, may be addressed as a virtual\
    \ model of a physical\nfarm or agricultural operation constructed utilizing cutting-edge\
    \ technologies like sensors,\nIoT devices, and cloud computing. Farmers can utilize\
    \ the DT to simulate and enhance\ntheir farming methods within a virtual setting,\
    \ enabling them to reﬁne their practices before\napplying them in reality [26,27].\
    \ Pylianidis et al. [27] conducted an in-depth report on DTs\nin agriculture,\
    \ encompassing 28 case studies and organizing the key value-added features\nof\
    \ DTs in agricultural applications. The authors highlight the capacity of DT usage\
    \ in\nagriculture, adjusting to ever-evolving circumstances, capturing, and interpreting\
    \ data,\nautonomously managing system actuators in the ﬁeld, and delivering customized\
    \ services\nto individuals, such as reports and transparent information. The DT\
    \ enables capturing\nreal-time data on crop growth rates, weather conditions,\
    \ ambient temperatures, and even\nsoil moisture levels as various environmental\
    \ and operational factors. A dynamic model of\nthe farm may be created by using\
    \ this data to test different scenarios and optimize various\naspects of the farming\
    \ operation, including crop yields, resource utilization, and overall efﬁ-\nciency.\
    \ By creating a DT, farmers can better understand how their farming practices\
    \ impact\nthe environment and identify ways to reduce waste and improve sustainability.\
    \ They can\nalso use the DT to test new technologies and techniques, such as precision\
    \ agriculture and\nautomation, before investing in them for their physical operation.\
    \ Instances of DTs in the\nagricultural sector spanning across various domains\
    \ ﬁnd applications in diverse areas such\nas crop cultivation, dairy production,\
    \ greenhouse horticulture, organic vegetable farming,\nplant disease analysis,\
    \ livestock management, food supply chain optimization, as well as\nfarm machinery\
    \ and building management, including ﬂeet monitoring and control [9].\nThe schematic\

    \ farmers to optimize their farming prac-\ntices and improve the efficiency and\

    \ Farmers can effectively observe and evaluate alterations\nin agricultural land,\

    \ data and visual representations for informed decision-making [29].\nThe overall\
    \ efﬁciency of crop production can be improved by reducing costs associated\n\
    with fuel, fertilizers, labor, and factors affecting production efﬁciency and\
    \ sustainability\nmerely by utilizing DTs in crop production technologies along\
    \ with the use of Digital\nInformation and Communication Technology (ICT) tools,\
    \ referring to agricultural pieces of\nmachinery, such as tractors, combined harvesters,\
    \ fertilizers, and sprayers.\nAccording to Dyck G et al. [9], the DTs seem to\
    \ ﬁnd their way in post-harvest processes,\nencompassing the various stages involved\
    \ in handling agricultural products after harvest-\ning. These products must be\
    \ dried, cooled, transported, stored, and undergo marketing\nprocedures. Digital\
    \ farming methods provide advantages in post-harvest procedures, such\nas minimizing\
    \ losses, optimizing food processing, improving storage conditions, stream-\n\
    lining transportation, and enhancing marketing efﬁciency. These strategies facilitate\
    \ the\nlive tracking of the agricultural and food supply network, leading to increased\
    \ robustness,\nresilience and reduced food waste and losses.\nIoT technology following\
    \ the digitalization prospect of agriculture plays a crucial role\nin transforming\
    \ traditional agriculture into a more efﬁcient and sustainable practice. IoT\n\
    contextual data enables users to interact seamlessly with their surroundings and\
    \ remote lo-\ncations through their digital twin, fostering enhanced connectivity\
    \ and user experiences [1].\nFacts such as precision agriculture that enables\
    \ farmers to gather real-time data on\na range of environmental and operational\
    \ factors, predictive modelling by using both\nhistorical and real-time data so\
    \ that they can generate a dynamic virtual representation of\ntheir agricultural\
    \ operation, sustainability, and automation to identify ways to reduce waste\n\
    and improve sustainability in farming operations [30] in accordance to real-time\
    \ data, focus\non addressing critical IoT needs such as two-way communication,\
    \ comprehensive security\nmeasures, localization, and mobility services to optimize\
    \ its efﬁciency and effectiveness [31].\nIn addition, DTs seem to pose a signiﬁcant\
    \ role in animal farming or precision livestock\nfarming by enhancing productivity,\
    \ animal welfare, and overall farm management. They\ncan be used to create virtual\
    \ representations of individual animals, groups of animals, or\nentire livestock\
    \ production systems [32], to model and predict animal behavior, growth,\nand\
    \ health, allowing farmers to optimize feeding strategies, detect early signs\
    \ of disease or\ndistress, and improve overall animal welfare.\nThrough data-driven\
    \ insights and predictive analytics, farmers can make informed\ndecisions regarding\
    \ nutrition, breeding, and healthcare interventions. By incorporating\nup-to-the-minute\
    \ information gathered from diverse sources, including sensors, monitoring\ndevices,\
    \ and agricultural management systems, DTs enable farmers to monitor, simulate,\n\
    and analyze animal behavior, health, and performance.\nNeethirajan S. [33] presents\
    \ a DT processing pipeline with sensors to classify and esti-\nmate livestock’s\
    \ emotional state and behavior. Various means of communication, including\nvocalizations,\
    \ body movements, facial expressions, and posture, contribute to animals\nexpressing\
    \ their emotional state. The review presents novel approaches for gathering\n\
    extensive real-time data regarding the emotions of farm livestock by implementing\
    \ a sensor\ndata processing pipeline within the DT model. This pipeline involves\
    \ preliminary data\nprocessing, modelling, and simulation phases, ultimately resulting\
    \ in reporting and pre-\ndicting the emotional states of cattle based on their\
    \ tail movements, facial expressions, and\nbody posture. Traditional methods involving\
    \ blood sampling or surveys, for assessing the\nemotional states of livestock\
    \ usually cause interruptions to farming processes while being\ntime-consuming,\
    \ and farm animals frequently experience fear, frustration, and distress. AI\n\
    technologies facilitate the recognition of cattle states, empowering animal caregivers\
    \ and\nethologists to understand animal behavior and optimize their well-being\
    \ and productivity.\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128\n9 of 38\nDTs may support decision-making\
    \ and farm management optimization by simulating\ndifferent scenarios regarding\
    \ environmental conditions or genetic factors on animal perfor-\nmance and production\
    \ outcomes while improving production efﬁciency and minimizing\nenvironmental\
    \ impacts. Furthermore, connections with other digital platforms, such as\nfarm\
    \ management systems, supply chain networks, and veterinary databases, allowing\
    \ for\nseamless data sharing and analysis is feasible with DT, thus enhancing\
    \ traceability, quality\nassurance, and decision-making throughout the value chain.\n\
    In summary, digital twins have the potential to revolutionize animal farming by\n\
    providing real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, and decision support. They\
    \ can\noptimize animal health, welfare, and production efﬁciency while promoting\
    \ sustainable\nfarming practices. Continued research and development in this area\
    \ will be crucial to fully\nharness the beneﬁts of DTs in animal farming and address\
    \ the associated challenges.\nAn Aquaculture 4.0 architecture of a digital twin-based\
    \ intelligent ﬁsh farm man-\nagement system for precision aquaculture is discussed\
    \ in [34], addressing the design\nconsiderations, data integration, analytics,\
    \ and control mechanisms to optimize ﬁsh farm\noperations. The proposed implementation\
    \ utilizes a cloud-based DT technology employing\nML realizations, computer vision,\
    \ and other sensor devices, and AI-based IoT (AIoT) to\nmonitor and control automated\
    \ aquaculture machinery. By optimizing farm production\nin various environments\
    \ throughout the different stages of ﬁsh farming, the system aims\nto maximize\
    \ efﬁciency and productivity. Water quality sensors utilized in ﬁshponds to\n\
    monitor and analyze the condition of the water and in offshore sea cages, and\
    \ RGB or sonar\ncamera devices may collect environmental data and data related\
    \ to ﬁsh populations to es-\ntablish data-driven prediction models. On the other\
    \ hand, land-based monitoring systems\nsend appropriate commands to activate surveillance\
    \ sensors, thus enabling ﬁsh-feeding\nbehavior monitoring, disease spread, and\
    \ ﬁsh population growth.\nFurthermore, DTs address optimization solutions regarding\
    \ water ﬂow and treatment\nprocesses related to water quality reduction following\
    \ ﬂoods and stormwater within trans-\nboundary water security projects due to\
    \ urban expansion [17]. DT models are employed\nto monitor the quality of urban\
    \ water by integrating physical entities and utilizing sen-\nsors in urban drainage\
    \ systems. The models consider natural processes related to soil,\nvegetation,\
    \ clogging, and biological activity in water treatment. This approach enables\n\
    comprehensive monitoring and analysis of urban water systems for effective management\n\
    and maintenance.\n3. Reviewing Relevant Technologies and DT Components\nAlthough\

    \ role as they are\nessential for the functioning of the DT system in an integrated\
    \ manner, as emphasized by\nPedersen et al. in their research [17].\n3.1. Technologies\
    \ Involved in DTs\nTherefore, realizing DTs in real-time is characterized by several\
    \ deﬁning keys that have\nemerged along with key technologies [1] from various\
    \ domains, industries, and scientiﬁc\ndisciplines that pose a decisive entity,\
    \ such as the following.\n3.1.1. Augmented, Virtual, and Mixed-Reality\nDTs rely\
    \ on Augmented (AR), Virtual (VR), and Mixed-Reality (MR) technologies. As\nan\
    \ example, they can be created using three-dimensional (3D) technologies and presented\n\
    as holograms or experienced through AR/VR/MR devices [35], such as the Microsoft\n\
    HoloLens. Using sensors installed in the ﬁeld, their real-time digital twin can\
    \ be generated\nand projected as a hologram in remote locations. This enables\
    \ individuals in different\nlocations to engage in interactions that simulate\
    \ being physically present in the same space.\nCommunication enhancement in digital\
    \ twins is derived by integrating tactile feedback,\nsimulating the sensation\
    \ of physical interaction via haptics. Furthermore, DTs can leverage\nhumanoid\
    \ and soft robotics technologies to enable physical actions on behalf of their\
    \ real-\nlife counterparts. This means digital twins can physically engage with\
    \ the environment\nor perform tasks, utilizing robotic systems that mimic human-like\
    \ or ﬂexible movements.\nThese advancements in augmented, virtual, mixed reality,\
    \ haptics, and robotics greatly en-\nhance the capabilities of digital twins,\
    \ enabling immersive interactions, realistic sensations,\nand physical engagement,\
    \ expanding the possibilities for communication and collaboration.\nSensors 2023,\
    \ 23, 7128\n11 of 38\n3.1.2. Artiﬁcial Intelligence\nArtiﬁcial Intelligence (AI)\
    \ integration into physical assets that lack it inherently is a\nkey advantage\
    \ of DTs. This introduces a specialized intelligence capable of efﬁciently com-\n\
    prehending vast amounts of numerical data and deriving domain-speciﬁc insights\
    \ faster\nthan human experts. Consequently, the data obtained from the digital\
    \ twin’s surroundings\nand physical counterpart should lead to valuable and actionable\
    \ conclusions [36]. As an\nemerging technology, AI empowers computers to exhibit\
    \ intelligent behaviors, including\nbehavioral learning. By amalgamating various\
    \ technologies, including AI, to create twin\nmodels of physical objects, it becomes\
    \ feasible to generate virtual representations that\nclosely resemble the original\
    \ objects, encompassing historical elements and predictive\ninformation [37].\
    \ As a result, DTs often incorporate controllers that utilize ontologies, ML,\n\
    and deep learning (DL) techniques. These controllers enable swift and intelligent\
    \ decision-\nmaking on behalf of their real-life counterparts. Moreover, AI signiﬁcantly\
    \ processes IoT\ndata through continuously enhanced algorithms that leverage updated\
    \ user data. Leverag-\ning such time-series data, a user’s DT has the potential\
    \ to suggest actions for controlling or\nmitigating potentially hazardous situations\
    \ regarding crop health and productivity, in cases\nsuch as droughts to direct\
    \ asses irrigation efﬁciency or even failures of safety mechanisms\nof farm machinery,\
    \ plant production equipment, post-harvest transportation or storage\nequipment\
    \ situations in which DTs may visualize alarm signals to stakeholders or even\
    \ take\nimmediate actions to limit adverse effects or even the destruction of\
    \ crop production [29].\n3.1.3. Communication Technologies and Schemes\nDTs rely\
    \ on communication technologies and schemes to facilitate interaction with the\n\
    environment, their physical twins, and other DTs on a real-time basis. This is\
    \ particularly\nsigniﬁcant in the realm of wireless communication. Effective communication\
    \ must occa-\nsionally occur within a millisecond (ms) timeframe, necessitating\
    \ compliance with 5G and\ntactile internet standards, while time-sensitive and\
    \ safety-critical schemes, coupled with\nthe need for stringent communication\
    \ standards, lead to a growing demand for repeatable\nand cost-effective veriﬁcation\
    \ procedures. Data transmission within a speciﬁc time window\nbecomes crucial\
    \ for time-sensitive and often safety-critical applications, imposing latency\n\
    limitations in addition to reliability requirements [38]. The following paragraphs\
    \ outline\nbasic wireless communications technologies commonly used in DT implementations.\n\
    (a)\nRFID technology offers fast and accurate object identiﬁcation using sensor\
    \ tags, reader\nantennas, and a host system. An antenna, an integrated circuit,\
    \ and a substrate utilize\na tag, where the antenna activates the tag for reading\
    \ or writing. The reader antennas\ncommunicate with the tags using RF waves, facilitating\
    \ data transfer to the database\nsystem. This technology ﬁnds extensive applications\
    \ in storage and inventory man-\nagement, supply chain monitoring, access control,\
    \ aviation transportation, agriculture,\nhealthcare, and more, improving efﬁciency\
    \ and automation in various ﬁelds [39].\n(b)\nWireless Networks, in particular,\
    \ suggest an immense role in sending data from\na source to a connected gateway,\
    \ a role supported by a variety of wireless net-\nwork technologies such as WPAN,\
    \ WLAN, WWAN, and LPWAN that are addressed\nin [18,39–47]. The existing commercial\
    \ 4G or 5G LTE communication networks, utiliz-\ning the transmission of data packets\
    \ through the well-established Internet Protocol\n(IP), serves as a base to sustain\
    \ the architecture of wireless communication networks\nin general.\ni\nWireless\
    \ Personal Area Networks (WPAN) are wireless networks that operate\nwith less\
    \ extensive infrastructure. They are designed to function within a\nlimited range,\
    \ typically within a single room or a small area. Unlike traditional\nnetworks\
    \ that rely on cables, WPANs enable the wireless connectivity of de-\nvices nearby,\
    \ facilitating the connection of devices like wireless keyboards or\nmice to computers\
    \ and supporting printing services. The most common WPAN\ntechnologies include\
    \ Bluetooth, 6LowWPAN, ZigBee, EnOcean, NFC, and\nRFID, each employing different\
    \ techniques to achieve the goals of WPAN [40].\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128\n12 of\
    \ 38\nBluetooth enables devices to communicate with each other wirelessly within\
    \ a\nlimited proximity. It is a short-range, low-power technology that is used\
    \ in a\nwide variety of devices [41].\nii\nWireless Local Area Networks (WLAN)\
    \ are wireless networks that allow de-\nvices to connect and communicate over\
    \ a local area without the need for\nphysical cables within a speciﬁc coverage\
    \ area, such as a home, ofﬁce, or public\nspace. These networks utilize the widely\

    \ transmission\nrates, evolved to the 802.11ac standard, operating in both 2.4\
    \ GHz and 5 GHz\nbands, achieving a maximum throughput of 1 Gbps for multiple\
    \ users, with\na minimum of 500 Mbps. WLANs offer greater coverage than WPANs,\
    \ span-\nning multiple rooms or entire buildings, making them suitable for larger-scale\n\
    wireless networking requirements. They provide convenient and ﬂexible con-\nnectivity\
    \ for various devices and applications, including internet access, ﬁle\nsharing,\
    \ video streaming, and more.\niii\nWireless Wide Area Networks (WWAN) provide\
    \ wireless connectivity on\na larger scale, spanning cities, regions, or even\
    \ entire countries. WWAN\ntechnologies, such as 4G Long-Term Evolution (LTE),\
    \ 5G, and the evolving\n6G, enable high-speed mobile internet access and support\
    \ a wide range of\nservices, including voice communication, video streaming, and\
    \ data transfer.\nThese networks rely on cellular infrastructure and are commonly\
    \ used for\nmobile devices like smartphones, tablets, and laptops to stay connected\
    \ while\non the go.\niv\nLow Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) are wireless network\
    \ technologies\nideal for IoT devices with long battery life, extensive coverage,\
    \ and low cost.\nUnlike 3G/4G or Wi-Fi systems, LPWAN networks are not primarily\
    \ designed\nfor high data transmission speeds or reducing latency. Instead, LPWANs\
    \ target\nenergy efﬁciency, scalability, and coverage [42], thus gaining popularity\
    \ in\nindustrial and research communities. They provide long-range communication,\n\
    covering distances from 10 to 40 km in rural areas and 1 to 5 km in dense\nurban\
    \ areas. Their main advantages include energy efﬁciency, a battery life\nexceeding\
    \ ten years, and low cost, which is ideal for IoT applications that\nrequire small-scale\
    \ data transmission [48]. Various LPWAN technologies have\nbeen developed and\
    \ deployed in either licensed or unlicensed frequency bands,\nsuch as Long-Range\
    \ (LoRa), Narrow-Band IoT (NB-IoT), each employing\ndifferent techniques to achieve\
    \ the goals of LPWAN [49].\n•\nLoRa is an ideal wireless communication technology\
    \ for low-bandwidth\nIoT applications, offering long-range and low-power consumption\
    \ ser-\nvices. It uses a proprietary spread spectrum technique to achieve long-\n\
    range and low power consumption, operating in the unlicensed sub-GHz\nISM band\
    \ available worldwide [50].\n•\nNB-IoT is a widely used LPWAN technology connecting\
    \ various devices\nand services through cellular networks. It operates in a narrow\
    \ band-\nwidth of 180 kHz, providing extensive network coverage and low latency.\n\
    Designed for cost-effective and delay-tolerant IoT devices, NB-IoT utilizes\n\
    LTE techniques and can integrate with existing LTE infrastructure. Coex-\nisting\
    \ with LTE networks, NB-IoT offers power-efﬁcient connectivity and\nleverages\
    \ compatible technologies for seamless integration [51].\nThe main technical features\

    \ network should\nbe selected. Particularly in the context of establishing connectivity\

    \ with wide coverage and low\npower consumption. The LoRa network meets these\
    \ needs, is open, and is used in arti-\ncles [25,39–42,44]. In cases where the\
    \ application requires a higher data rate, Bluetooth\ntechnology can be used,\
    \ as mentioned in the article [44], but it has signiﬁcantly higher\npower consumption\
    \ compared to LoRa, and the coverage is 100 m for Bluetooth 4.x and\n200 m for\
    \ Bluetooth 5.x. For applications aimed at object identiﬁcation and detection,\
    \ such\nas products in warehouses and animals in agricultural operations, RFID\
    \ technology is a\nsuitable choice as mentioned in articles [43,45]. For applications\
    \ that require a high data rate\nand need to utilize a Wi-Fi network, the provision\
    \ of electrical power is necessary. Finally,\nonce DTs rely on data exchange,\
    \ real-time monitoring, and interaction with their physical\ncounterparts, wireless\
    \ networks provide a ﬂexible and efﬁcient means of communication\nfor these purposes\
    \ [8].\n3.1.4. Reliability, Integrity, and Credibility\nReliability, integrity,\
    \ and credibility are pivotal when DTs are entrusted with sensitive\ntasks involving\
    \ transaction management with their real counterparts. It becomes imper-\native\
    \ for the real twin to establish a sense of trust in their digital twin’s capabilities\
    \ and\nactions. Building and maintaining a solid connection between the real twin\
    \ and the DT is\ncrucial to foster effective collaboration, enabling reliable\
    \ decision-making, and ensuring\nsecure interactions. Consequently, a strong foundation\
    \ of trust becomes indispensable\nfor the successful operation and advancement\
    \ of DT-enabled systems [52]. Therefore,\nprivacy and security arise as paramount\
    \ considerations in the realm of DTs. To enable the\nconﬁdentiality and privacy\
    \ of their real twins, DTs should implement robust measures for\nidentity protection.\
    \ This can be achieved using dedicated cryptography algorithms and\nadvanced biometric\
    \ techniques such as ECG and haptic biometrics. By leveraging these\ntechniques,\
    \ the identity and privacy of the real twin can be established and safeguarded.\n\
    In addition to identity protection, DTs must prioritize data integrity, security,\
    \ and privacy.\nMeasures should be in place to prevent unauthorized access and\
    \ interception of data across\nthe network. Unauthorized users should be promptly\
    \ detected and repelled to prevent any\ncompromise of data integrity or security.\
    \ To ensure the authenticity and reliability of data\nsources, rigorous measures\
    \ for data authentication should be implemented before integrat-\ning the data\
    \ into the digital twin. Overall, DTs must incorporate comprehensive privacy\n\
    and security mechanisms to safeguard their real twins’ data’s identity, conﬁdentiality,\
    \ and\nintegrity. By adopting robust cryptographic algorithms, employing biometric\
    \ techniques,\nand implementing strict data authentication protocols, DTs can\
    \ effectively address privacy\nand security concerns, fostering a trustworthy\
    \ and secure environment for the real twins\nand their digital counterparts.\n\
    3.1.5. Distributed Ledger Technologies and Blockchain\nIn recent times, Distributed\
    \ Ledger Technologies (DLT), such as blockchain [44,53],\nhave emerged to add\
    \ to user authentication and data integrity regarding data sharing. To\nunlock\
    \ its full potential and achieve its envisioned advantages, addressing outstanding\n\
    concerns surrounding the technology is imperative. DLT offers a decentralized\
    \ approach\nthat eliminates the need for a central authority or database, distinguishing\
    \ it from traditional\ndata-sharing methods. The distributed nature of this system\
    \ allows for the secure sharing\nof data in a trustless environment. The signiﬁcance\
    \ of DLT has garnered considerable\ninterest from researchers and practitioners\
    \ alike. Various systems and platforms based\non Distributed Ledger Technology\
    \ (DLT), such as private ledgers, public ledgers, and\npermissioned ledgers, have\
    \ been created to address diverse use cases and speciﬁc needs [54].\nProposed\
    \ technological solutions stemming from IoT, AI, DT, and DLT have been put\nforward\
    \ to address the monitoring and tracking of products within the realm of food\n\
    supply logistics and chain and the analysis of collected data to facilitate decision-making\n\
    Sensors 2023, 23, 7128\n15 of 38\nprocesses [55]. Given the numerous advantages\
    \ associated with DLT, it presents itself as a\npromising technology that can\
    \ signiﬁcantly contribute to achieving the vision of CDT.\nBlockchain technologies,\
    \ in particular, seem to be an ideal structure for authenticating\nusers, storing\
    \ data records, and maintaining data integrity [8,56], providing a secure and\n\
    decentralized system of interconnected blocks formed through cryptographic functions.\n\
    It allows transactions to be recorded in a veriﬁable manner without intermediaries.\
    \ Each\npreceding block’s hash is included in the next block and is generated\
    \ through a distributed\nconsensus algorithm. With encryption mechanisms, blockchain\
    \ ensures data integrity\nand prevents tampering [43]. Ethereum, as a blockchain\
    \ scheme, provides an alternative\nprotocol for decentralized applications that,\
    \ unlike another blockchain scheme Bitcoin, is\nnot just a payment network but\
    \ also allows for the creation and use of smart contracts.\nIt uses its digital\
    \ currency called “ether” and incorporates a complete programming lan-\nguage\
    \ (such as Solidity) for smart contract development. Pieces of code stored on\
    \ the\nblockchain that enables decentralized transactions without a trusted central\
    \ authority are\ncalled Smart contracts [57].\nOn the other hand, the Helium Blockchain\
    \ is referred to as the major public decen-\ntralized LoRaWAN network in the world,\
    \ that enables devices anywhere in the world\nto wirelessly connect to the internet\
    \ and have a speciﬁc geographical placement without\nthe need for energy-consuming\
    \ satellite equipment or expensive mobile data plans [58].\nHelium offers low\
    \ transaction fees and connectivity for LoRa nodes and ensures end-to-end\nencryption,\
    \ which is useful whenever sensitive information is at stake.\nThe use of blockchain,\
    \ such as Ethereum and Helium, in IoT and digital twins for\nsmart agriculture\
    \ applications has the following advantages:\n•\nTransparency and trust: Blockchain\
    \ provides an open, transparent, and tamper-proof\ndistributed ledger, allowing\
    \ all stakeholders to verify the accuracy of the data. This can\nhelp build trust\
    \ among different entities in the agricultural supply chain and prevent\nfraud\
    \ or unauthorized interventions.\n•\nBlockchain enhances Data security [59] as\
    \ it utilizes cryptography to protect data. This\nis crucial for safeguarding\
    \ sensitive information related to smart agriculture, such as\ndata on plant health,\
    \ soil quality, and food production.\n•\nAutomation and smart contracts on the\
    \ blockchain enable programmable automatic\nexecution of conditions and actions\
    \ based on speciﬁc information, events, and opera-\ntions such as automated irrigation,\
    \ temperature control, and plant health monitoring\nin smart agriculture.\n•\n\
    The distributed architecture of blockchain ensures that information is stored\
    \ and\nveriﬁed by multiple nodes in the network, thus ensuring integrity and continuity\
    \ of\ndata and reducing dependency on a central authority.\n3.1.6. Cloud Computing\n\
    Cloud computing presents a valuable opportunity for DTs to enhance their scalability\n\
    and availability, assisting their real twins anytime and anywhere. By leveraging\
    \ cloud\ncomputing infrastructures, computation and control tasks can be ofﬂoaded\
    \ from the local\nenvironment to remote servers, enabling DTs to handle complex\
    \ processes and ensure\nseamless availability efﬁciently. The scalability of DTs\
    \ is signiﬁcantly improved through\ncloud computing, as the computational resources\
    \ can be dynamically allocated and scaled\nbased on demand. This allows DTs to\
    \ handle larger datasets, called Big Data sets (BD), per-\nform sophisticated\
    \ analytics, and execute resource-intensive tasks without local hardware\nlimitations.\
    \ As the DT model involves the creation and management of virtual replicas that\n\
    closely mimic real-world objects or systems, it requires extensive data acquisition,\
    \ storage,\nand processing capabilities for collecting and analyzing a massive\
    \ volume of data from\nvarious sources, including sensors, IoT devices, and other\
    \ data-generating components [7],\nfacts that necessitate cloud computing. The\
    \ elastic nature of cloud computing ensures\nthat DTs can adapt to varying workloads\
    \ and seamlessly accommodate ﬂuctuations in\ncomputational requirements.\nSensors\
    \ 2023, 23, 7128\n16 of 38\nFurthermore, cloud-based DTs offer the advantage of\
    \ ubiquitous accessibility by using\nopen-source communication platforms, such\
    \ as OPC Uniﬁed Architecture (UA) commu-\nnication protocol and frameworks, for\
    \ data exchange from sensors to cloud applications\nused in DTs. Real twins can\
    \ access and interact with their DTs from any location and at any\ntime, provided\
    \ an active internet connection is in place. This fosters a ﬂexible and versatile\n\
    environment where real twins can leverage the capabilities of their DTs regardless\
    \ of their\nphysical location.\n3.1.7. Internet of Things\nInternet of Things\
    \ (IoT) with 5G and the Tactile Internet (TI) entity meanings have\nemerged as\
    \ groundbreaking technologies, ushering in a new era of communication with\ntheir\
    \ focus on ultra-high reliability and ultra-low latency. This shift in communication\n\
    paradigms from content-oriented to control-oriented is especially signiﬁcant for\
    \ applica-\ntions that involve human-in-the-loop interactions, demanding minimal\
    \ delays and seamless\nintegration of communication and control mechanisms as\
    \ demanded in DT infrastructure.\nWithin this context, DTs play a pivotal role\
    \ by establishing a continuously operational twin\nfeedback loop, ultimately enhancing\
    \ the service quality of physical systems [60,61]. This\nseamless real-time feedback\
    \ communication loop empowers DTs to constantly monitor,\nanalyze, and adapt to\
    \ the evolving conditions of the physical systems they represent. As a\nresult,\
    \ precise control actions and optimizations can be executed, ultimately enhancing\
    \ the\nphysical systems’ overall service quality and performance.\nThrough the\
    \ IoT, users can seamlessly provide contextual data to their DT while\nreceiving\
    \ feedback that can be used to enhance their interaction with the environment,\n\
    both locally and remotely. Various communication technologies within IoT are required\
    \ to\ntransmit data and status information from sensors in the physical entity\
    \ to the data entity,\nenabling seamless connectivity and communication between\
    \ connected devices [17], as\nshown in Figure 7.\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128 \n17\

    \ enables users to interact seamlessly with their surroundings, whether in \n\

    \ valuable \nfeedback to the environment, further enriching the user experience\
    \ and enabling a more \nintegrated and interconnected ecosystem.  \n3.1.8. Modelling\

    \ and Simulation Software\nA DT could be addressed as a tight combination of (i)\
    \ an object model, in conjunction\nwith (ii) an expansive set of data that is\
    \ directly following the object that may evolve,\nand ﬁnally, (iii) a method for\
    \ modifying and reﬁning the model based on the available\ndata [17,62]. The experts\
    \ decide the need and selection of the training, validation and\nveriﬁcation data\
    \ concerning speciﬁc case studies, types of soil, plant types, leaf area, plant\n\
    height, regarding the Physical Twin, or technological use cases. Critical data\
    \ processing\ndepends on speciﬁc plant characteristics, experimental setups, dedicated\
    \ sensors, ML and\nDL applicable methods and big data analytics software.\nOne\
    \ of the signiﬁcant beneﬁts of utilizing the DT approach is its ability to accurately\n\
    depict objects or entities that change over time, owing to the incorporation of\
    \ dynamic\nand evolving data. Employing a digital twin makes it possible to extend\
    \ the application\nof a validated model across timescales during which the object\
    \ and its behavior undergo\nsigniﬁcant variations. A validated model may offer\
    \ an instant representation of an object’s\nbehavior at a speciﬁc moment, thus\
    \ highlighting the importance of associating the DT with\na corresponding physical\
    \ counterpart and the signiﬁcance of choosing a model according\nto the speciﬁc\
    \ implementation.\nWithout a physical twin, the DT would be considered nothing\
    \ more than a model.\nFurthermore, the availability of a comprehensive and up-to-date\
    \ dataset plays a crucial\nrole in accurately capturing the object’s changes over\
    \ time and ensuring the model is\nadjusted and updated to reﬂect the current system\
    \ conditions. Any model approximating\nthe physical twinned can be used for DTs\
    \ that utilize physics-based models encompassing\nall relevant processes that\
    \ can inﬂuence the measured quantities. In an ideal scenario with\ninstantaneous\
    \ computing and ﬂawless accuracy, these models would accurately simulate\nand\
    \ update the mechanical and thermal processes involved in real-time operations.\
    \ For\ninstance, a DT of a machine tool could simulate the milling of metal, considering\
    \ factors\nlike temperature and part shape, and dynamically update information\
    \ about tool wear\nbased on real-time measurements. This enables proactive and\
    \ effective industrial plant\nfacilities maintenance, enhancing overall efﬁciency\
    \ [62,63]. Similarly, to an industrial plant\nin agriculture, a digital model\
    \ could represent the growth of a plant regarding its physical\nenvironmental\
    \ conditions that are changing over time.\nAccording to researchers, a categorization\
    \ standard centered around the degree of\ndata fusion and integration between\
    \ the PO and its virtual representation can be used as\nan indicator to deﬁne\
    \ and delimit the scope of the proposed concept. Given that this term\nwas initially\
    \ created for the manufacturing industry, it serves as a proxy for evaluating\n\
    agricultural DTs’ development, convergences, and divergences compared to contemporary\n\
    deﬁnitions. Thus, three integration levels represent the digital twin’s ﬁeld.\
    \ First is the\nDigital Model (DM), second is the Digital Shadow (DS), and third\
    \ is the DT. The DM is a\ndepiction of the entity in a digital format without\
    \ the use of an automated data transfer\nsystem. It is equivalent to a Digital\
    \ Twin prototype and represents the lowest possible\nintegration level. The DS\
    \ refers to a digital representation that enables the automatic\nexchange of information\
    \ from the physical entity to its virtual object, reﬂecting changes\nin the entity’s\
    \ state. This one-way information ﬂow is like a DT model, which in contrast,\n\
    involves an automated bi-directional ﬂow of digital information. Like the DS,\
    \ the DT has a\nvirtual representation whose alterations are reﬂected in the physical\
    \ entity’s state. However,\nwhat sets the DT apart is its capacity to impact the\
    \ condition of the physical entity as well,\nalthough the speciﬁc means of inﬂuence\
    \ depend on the type of entity and its context [63].\nIn summary, a DM represents\
    \ a physical system in a digital format but lacks auto-\nmated data exchange.\
    \ A DS involves a one-way automated data ﬂow reaching the digital\ncounterpart\
    \ originating from the physical system. Conversely, a DT involves seamless and\n\
    fully integrated automated communication between the digital counterpart of the\
    \ physical\nsystem and the physical system itself.\nDeﬁning the objectives of\
    \ the modelling process is the initial stage in creating a model\nfor an integrated\
    \ process. Recognizing that a model is merely a reality approximation is\nSensors\
    \ 2023, 23, 7128\n18 of 38\nessential, as diverse objectives can provide different\
    \ levels of complexity in representing\nthe actual procedure. For this reason,\
    \ it is crucial to identify the goal of the model before the\nbuild [64]. Therefore,\
    \ complex systems like an agriculture model should be ﬁrst designed\nand objectively\
    \ deﬁned so their DT model is accurate. Spreadsheet software such as\nMicrosoft\
    \ Excel is commonly employed for process calculations and analyses. This is\n\
    due to its widespread availability and familiarity among scientists, engineers,\
    \ and other\nprofessionals. In contrast, the concept of DTs is somehow new and\
    \ still emerging. The\nspreadsheet’s cells allow users to enter data, make computations,\
    \ and produce results\nwhile they can plot data from them in several graphs. Software\
    \ programs like process\nsimulators allow users to describe and analyze integrated\
    \ processes. The purpose of\nthese tools is to simulate continuous processes and\
    \ their transient behavior. The scientiﬁc\nliterature concerning process simulation\
    \ tools is continuously growing, encompassing\nvarious areas such as techno-economic\
    \ analyses, economic feasibility studies, structural\nprocess enhancements, and\
    \ the exploration of alternative processes to existing ones [64].\nGiven that\
    \ a DT model is much more than a simulation tool, by nature, never being an\n\
    exact representation of reality. Still, really an approximation of it, and different\
    \ objectives\nmay produce various modelling abstractions with varying levels of\
    \ detail concerning the\nactual process. It is crucial to identify the goal of\
    \ the model before we develop it.\nSince cloud computing has many beneﬁts, it\
    \ is the most practical method for introduc-\ning DT services. Due to its ability\
    \ to provide on-demand services, computational resources,\nand ubiquitous network\
    \ access, the implementation of the next-generation information\ntechnology architecture\
    \ is highly compatible with DT environments. In such environments,\ndata owners\
    \ generate data from assets, transmit it to cloud servers, simulate the DT in\
    \ a\nvirtual environment, and subsequently share the insights and ﬁndings of the\
    \ simulation\nwith the data owner. Users can request access to the data at any\
    \ time [59]. In construct-\ning complex DT production systems, like industrial\
    \ or agricultural systems, “machine\nlearning” and “simulation tools” are two\
    \ complementary technologies. Creating stochastic\nsimulations for complicated\
    \ systems takes time and effort. However, these simulations\nare essential for\
    \ DT construction because they have two crucial capabilities. The ﬁrst is\n“uncertainty\
    \ modelling” and the second is “explainable analytics”. Focusing on how ML\nand\
    \ reinforcement learning (RL) improve simulation, many issues arise in digital\
    \ twin use\ncases. The rapid advancement of IoT, edge computing, and cloud computing\
    \ technologies\nhas signiﬁcantly accelerated the progress of digital twins. It\
    \ is widely believed that digital\ntwins will soon become a vital catalyst for\
    \ digital transformation, as evidenced by the com-\nmon theme present in various\
    \ research studies [65]. The primary hurdle lies in establishing\na secure, reliable\
    \ method to share simulation and real-time data. Additionally, there is a\nneed\
    \ for a robust and privacy-centric authentication system that leverages the beneﬁts\
    \ of\nblockchain technology to address the security prerequisites mentioned earlier.\n\
    3.2. Notable Components of DT Implementations\nIn the realm of digital twins,\
    \ components denote the distinct constituents or elements\nthat constitute a digital\
    \ twin system. A representative ensemble follows.\n3.2.1. Sensors and Actuators\n\
    DTs embody sensors and actuators as parts of great signiﬁcance that offer valuable\n\
    data and information about physical phenomena and enable the replication of sensory\n\
    capabilities. In today’s interconnected world, an enormous number of sensors and\
    \ actuators\nare deployed across various domains, ranging from consumer products\
    \ to industrial set-\ntings such as smart factories and smartwatches. These sensors\
    \ capture critical information\nrelated to temperature, humidity, velocity, pressure,\
    \ chemical components, and material\ncomposition, forming the foundation for digital\
    \ twin technology [47,66]. By equipping real\ntwins (physical entities) with sensors,\
    \ DTs can replicate and harness the senses of sight,\ntemperature, sound, humidity,\
    \ and touch through appropriate actuators. For example,\nin the agricultural domain,\
    \ a DT of a plant could leverage sensors to create predictive\nSensors 2023, 23,\
    \ 7128\n19 of 38\nmaintenance services or simulate and optimize the production\
    \ process. This allows for the\ngeneration of actionable insights and the enhancement\
    \ of operational efﬁciency. DTs rely on\nthe integration of actuator and sensor\
    \ technologies to gather continuous and accurate data.\nThe representation of\
    \ a physical asset in digital forms, like a sensor-equipped machine,\nrelies on\
    \ the synchronized operation of virtual sensors and actuators. These software-based\n\
    counterparts replicate the functionalities of physical sensors and actuators,\
    \ aggregating\ndata from multiple sources. Integrating sensors and actuators within\
    \ the digital twin\nframework enables real-time monitoring, data-driven analytics,\
    \ and the ability to simulate\nvarious scenarios for optimization purposes. By\
    \ bridging the physical and digital realms,\ndigital twins empower industries\
    \ and sectors to achieve enhanced performance, increased\nefﬁciency, and cost\
    \ savings.\n3.2.2. Identiﬁcation of Entities\nIn the context of DTs, each twin\
    \ is assigned a distinct identiﬁer that facilitates seamless\ncommunication with\
    \ its physical counterpart. This unique identiﬁer encapsulates vital\ninformation\
    \ about the physical object’s structure, capabilities, and technical speciﬁcations,\n\
    as well as its expected performance under speciﬁc conditions. When creating a\
    \ DT, it is\ncrucial to consider the unique circumstances of the object to ensure\
    \ an accurate represen-\ntation [67]. Even if two physical items are identical,\
    \ they may exhibit different behaviors\nwhen subjected to varying conditions.\
    \ Hence, each digital twin is assigned its unique iden-\ntiﬁer, reﬂecting the\
    \ individual characteristics and attributes of the corresponding physical\nobject.\
    \ By leveraging the DT’s unique identiﬁer, we can accurately simulate and analyze\
    \ its\nproperties and behaviours.\nFurthermore, the expansive network of interconnected\
    \ devices, sensors, and actuators\nhighlights the need for real-time collection\
    \ and sharing of identiﬁed contextual data with\ndigital twins. This data encompasses\
    \ various parameters such as location, environmen-\ntal conditions, user preferences,\
    \ and behavioral patterns. By integrating this uniquely\nidentiﬁed contextual\
    \ data into the DT model, a deep understanding of the user’s context\nand needs\
    \ can be achieved. Adding to that notion, a Geographic Information System\n(GIS)\
    \ as a versatile system generates, controls, examines, and maps various data types\
    \ and\nlinks IoT data to a map. Thus, GIS combines location information, referred\
    \ to as spatial\ndata, with descriptive details of a DT, forming the basis for\
    \ mapping and analysis utilized\nacross multiple industries and scientiﬁc ﬁelds.\
    \ With GIS, users gain insights into patterns,\nrelationships, and the geographical\
    \ context of their data, as in [68].\n3.2.3. Visualization and Representation\n\
    Visualization and representation play a vital role in DTs, offering various forms\n\
    of virtual representation depending on the speciﬁc application. DTs can leverage\
    \ 3D\nvisualizations to facilitate collaborative design or planning [69]. Depending\
    \ on the context,\nthese connections can manifest in various forms, such as a\
    \ 3D representation, hologram,\nhumanoid social robot, or purely as software components\
    \ without physical attendance.\nConsequently, DT commonly refers to the digital\
    \ depiction of a real-world object, system, or\nentity’s physical twin that faithfully\
    \ replicates a unique item, process, person, organization,\nor even a legendary\
    \ narrative. Composite digital twins are formed when multiple digital\ntwins merge.\
    \ These DTs, as reﬂections of the actual world, share similar characteristics,\n\
    necessitating the modelling of digital processes and objects with composition,\
    \ ﬂexibility,\nsensing, collaboration, and simulation capabilities. Furthermore,\
    \ predictions suggest that\nfuture DTs will evolve toward a holistic virtual world\
    \ [70].\n3.2.4. Devices\nDevices that continuously capture data concerning physiological\
    \ and environmental\nfactors information can serve DTs to gain a comprehensive\
    \ understanding of the real\ntwin’s well-being and lifestyle. Such wearable devices,\
    \ for example, smartwatches, ﬁtness\ntrackers, and other health monitoring devices\
    \ have enabled individuals to collect and\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128\n20 of 38\n\
    track various physiological parameters effortlessly. The abundance of such data\
    \ presents\na unique opportunity for digital twins to enhance their support for\
    \ their real twins more\nefﬁciently [71]. By integrating the data from wearables\
    \ into the DT model, real-time\ninsights and personalized recommendations can\
    \ be generated as feedback or alerts based on\nspeciﬁc needs and goals. Furthermore,\
    \ the continuous monitoring and analysis of wearable\ndata by DTs enable proactive\
    \ interventions whilst identifying patterns or deviations from\nnormal physiological\
    \ parameters and providing early warnings or interventions to address\npotential\
    \ health risks or optimize performance. This proactive support can contribute\
    \ to\npreventive healthcare, early detection of health issues, and overall well-being\
    \ management.\nIn summary, the DT is an advanced data management system that integrates\
    \ 3D ani-\nmation, modelling, IoT, AI, and other technologies such as ML. It enables\
    \ the seamless con-\nnection and management of physical and virtual models within\
    \ a digital environment [72].\nAs human civilization grows, agriculture remains\
    \ crucial for our progress and well-being.\nIntelligent DT systems can analyze\
    \ and digitize agricultural areas, enabling macro and\nmicro-level visual processes.\
    \ These systems can provide intelligent recommendations and\nsuggestions that\
    \ can be implemented to achieve multiple beneﬁts in agriculture.\n4. Reviewing\

    \ is mainly addressed in all reviewed papers. In 16 papers\nthough [19,26–28,64,73,82],\
    \ the DT concept is analyzed and utilized in more detail, thus\nposing the signiﬁcance\
    \ of using DTs in smart farming and agriculture.\nAccording to the reviewed literature\
    \ summarized in Table 2, smart farming as an\nimplementation of agriculture 4.0\
    \ [19,26–29,45,63,73,75–77,79–88] includes smart irrigation\nstrategies by monitoring\
    \ and controlling various farming stages [28], implementing data\nacquisition\
    \ techniques [27] for automatically controlling actuator systems in agriculture\
    \ or\neven in high-tech data-driven greenhouses [79]. Furthermore, via simulation,\
    \ monitoring,\ncontrolling, coordinating, and executing farm operations at agricultural\
    \ sites [87], DTs\nimprove predictive control in precision irrigation [28,73,88],\
    \ greenhouse horticulture, and\norganic vegetable and livestock farming. Smart\
    \ farming enhances remote detection and\nmonitoring of vegetation and crop stress\
    \ in agriculture [86], developing DT stages and\nforecasting plant yield in greenhouses,\
    \ vertical farms, or outdoor ﬁelds [76,77], or even in\nurban and indoor farming,\
    \ of vertical agriculture utilizing hydroponics, aeroponics, aqua-\nculture, and\
    \ aquaponics. Smart farming approaches the smart agriculture [85] as well as the\n\
    sustainable agriculture 4.0 [80] sector to address precision farming and management\
    \ [75,76]\nvia the adoption of digital technologies and techniques in agriculture\
    \ [27,29,64], leading the\nway to digital representations of plants [9], inventory\
    \ quality in agriculture, greenhouse\nproduction ﬂow, and food safety and quality\
    \ within the food supply chain [45]. Although\nthe DTs remain a major issue in\
    \ our research criteria, in papers [29,45,63,83–85], they are\nimplied as such.\
    \ In [9], authors propose a functional DT model; in [86], they are proposed\n\

    pose a critical role in smart agriculture by facilitating the collection of real-time\
    \ data and\noffering valuable insights into a wide range of environmental and\
    \ agricultural parameters.\nField or soil probes that measure air and ground temperature,\
    \ humidity, soil moisture,\nand ambient light [28,45,73,81,82,88], added to CO2\
    \ sensors measuring relative CO2 con-\ncentration [80,81], and infrared (IR) thermometers\
    \ provide data acquisition modules for\nautomatically controlled actuator systems\
    \ in agriculture approaching digital modelling\nto the food process [64] monitoring\
    \ activities of livestock, optimization of crops, reducing\nemissions to air,\
    \ soil, and water. Drone image cameras [88] and high-resolution photo-\ngraphic\
    \ cameras seem ideal for AR and VR by constructing virtual natural low-polygon\n\
    3D plant models as proposed in [35,74]. Building Information Modeling (BIM) models\
    \ of\nhigh-tech data-driven greenhouses are made feasible as in [79] and provide\
    \ a VR presenta-\ntion of the farm or ﬁeld with the aid of a head-mounted display\
    \ (HMD) with two handheld\ncontrollers serving as handy sensors for manual stimulus.\

    \ IoT\nsensor nodes to acquire and transmit farm data to IoT gateways or edge\
    \ devices, thus\ncultivating DT requirements for vertical farms, for the greenhouse\
    \ production process and\nﬁnally models in sustainable agriculture.\nRemote detection\
    \ and monitoring of vegetation and crop stress in agriculture seem\nfeasible based\
    \ on [86] utilizing LiDAR—stereo-photogrammetry technology, using multi-\nspectral\
    \ imagery, passive microwave remote sensing, RFID schemes [9,45], active mi-\n\
    crowave remote sensing (RADAR) and sensors onboard UAVs and satellites [45,76,88].\n\
    Location determination in farming via geospatial position (GPS) plays a signiﬁcant\
    \ role in\nthe remote detection and monitoring of vegetation and crop conditions\
    \ in agriculture [88].\nIoT deployments in smart farming are based on serial hardware\
    \ communication pro-\ntocols such as I2C serial bus [28] and UART that uses asynchronous\
    \ serial communication\nwith conﬁgurable speed and pulse width modulation (PWM)\
    \ for driving actuators [77,81],\nin correlation with programmable logic controllers\
    \ (PLC) for data recording [29], monitor-\ning, and optimization aided occasionally\
    \ by fuzzy interference systems (FIS) [73].\nThe decision-making and actions once\
    \ undertaken by the farmers now have given\nway to data-driven agricultural decision-making,\
    \ i.e., assisting them to undertake informed\ndecisions related to planting, fertilization,\
    \ pest control, harvesting, and overall farm man-\nagement. Likewise, derived\
    \ from the smart water management project (SWAMP) [28,73,75]\na hands-on approach\
    \ is being utilized to develop a precision irrigation platform based on\nIoT technology\
    \ for smart water management, distributed in Brazil, Italy, and Spain.\n4.3. The\
    \ Third Categorization of Research Literature That Is Related to Speciﬁc Technical\n\
    Research Aspects\nDTs use software to create, operate, and interact with their\
    \ physical counterparts. The\nsoftware component of a DT enables the collection,\
    \ processing, and analysis of data from\nvarious sources, including sensors, actuators,\
    \ and other connected devices.\nIn [28,77], the high-level programming language\
    \ Python is used for software develop-\nment, scripting, and data analysis, serving\
    \ the purposes of DT applications, implementing\nthe Arduino IDE platform, and\
    \ exploiting the Debian Buster OS to produce a plant simula-\ntion model. Likewise,\
    \ RPi software for the Raspberry Pi platform is used with goal-oriented\nrequirement\
    \ language (GRL) for modelling [80]. We should point out the use of an open\n\
    standard ﬁle format JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) which is used in [73] for\
    \ data repre-\nsentation and communication between systems and is widely adopted\
    \ and supported by\nvarious programming languages and platforms. Speciﬁc software\
    \ packages are utilized\nfor constructing 3D plant models, such as Unreal Engine\
    \ 5, Reality Capture, Photoshop,\nMesh Model Construction, Autodesk, Maya [74],\
    \ Unreal Engine 5 Nanite technology, and\nReality [35]. Other speciﬁc software\
    \ packages serving, for example, the construction of\na DT ﬂowsheet model as in\
    \ [64] found in the researched literature are the Aspen Plus\nand Aspen HYSYS\
    \ from Aspen Technology, Inc. (Burlington, MA, USA), ChemCAD from\nChemstations,\
    \ Inc. (Houston, TX, USA), UniSim Design from Honeywell (Charlotte, NC,\nUSA),\
    \ ProSimPlus from ProSim SA (Labege, France) and PRO/II from AVEVA Group plc.\n\
    Simulation software was employed in this study [28] to generate a virtual setting\
    \ for\nan irrigation system’s digital twin, incorporating a plant simulation model.\n\
    As previously mentioned, in [73], Siemens’s industrial plant simulation software\n\
    was used, and in [74], the Virtual UCF Arboretum Application (V1.0) was developed\n\
    with virtual plant datasets, plant inventories, VR headsets leading to an AR Holodeck\
    \ by\nmultiple captured images taken in 3D space and an AR perpetual garden App.\n\
    In [75], a linear model of plant growth is proposed utilizing a wheat multi-agent\n\
    planning module close enough to the implied structure modelling simulation in\
    \ [29],\nvirtual models are used during the usage phase in [84], an earth system\
    \ model in [78], a\nfarm is represented in 3D in [81], the concept of the DT model\
    \ via data-driven modelling is\nassessed [63]. In [76], the authors imply that\
    \ a software package was developed containing\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128\n29 of 38\n\
    an ontology editor, a DT editor, multi-agent planning module for creating a prototype\
    \ of\nan intelligent plant DT system in Java whilst AR implementations to save\
    \ BIM model ﬁles\nin Film box (.FBX) in [79] by using Unity game engine to provide\
    \ 3D modelling software.\nFurther authors in [9] confronted post-harvest models\
    \ by discrete event simulation such as\ndrying, adding to the simulation models\
    \ for blending and ﬂow DT models [82,83] that rely\nheavily on available real-time\
    \ data a ﬂow for continuous adaption and learning. Finally, DT\nmodelling implies\
    \ simulation, analysis, and prediction [88] that may assess the modelling\nand\
    \ simulation of the fertility of seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, pollution challenges,\
    \ soil\nagents (hydrological models, soil data), and crop agents\nTable 4 summarises\
    \ software, 3D, 3D modelling, simulation, and other research as-\npects addressed\

    Structure\nmodelling\nsimulation\nOn the other hand, AI, ML, and DL algorithms\
    \ seem to be a major issue in [45,63,83,87,88],\nleading to Big Data analytics\
    \ [82] to describe DT modelling that relies heavily on real-time\nSensors 2023,\
    \ 23, 7128\n31 of 38\navailable data ﬂow. The immense amount of data is stored\
    \ in databases such as Mongo\nDB [28,73], Draco, My-SQL [28,73], and SQLite [80,81],\
    \ besides using Excel CSV ﬁles for\nretrieving height values [79] or generally\
    \ mentioned Knowledge bases as in [75] leading to\ncloud big data manipulation\
    \ schemes in [45,81,85]. Major cloud computing platforms such\nas Alibaba Cloud,\
    \ Amazon web services, Google Cloud Platform, IBM, and Microsoft Azure\nare examples\
    \ of cloud computing services provided by leading technology companies that\n\
    serve the DT idea, as seen in [87].\nCloud IoT service broker agents come into\
    \ place as a software component or intermedi-\nary that facilitates the interaction\
    \ between cloud service consumers (users or organizations)\nand cloud service\
    \ providers like FIWARE. In [28,73], FIWARE cloud applications are ex-\nploited,\
    \ adding to IoT broker and IoT agents to facilitate cloud management of context\n\
    information. The procedure includes converting various communication protocols\
    \ into a\nshared base protocol and incorporating intelligent functionality through\
    \ the processing,\nanalysing, and visualising of contextual data. FIWARE generally\
    \ is used as an open-\nsource platform to provide a standardized framework and\
    \ a set of reusable components for\nbuilding smart applications and services in\
    \ the context of the IoT and Future Internet (FI)\ndomains. It aims to simplify\
    \ the development of innovative and interoperable solutions\nby offering a collection\
    \ of open APIs, data models, and software tools that facilitate the\ndevelopment\
    \ of smart applications and services.\nA fuzzy inference system enhances adaptive\
    \ and learning capabilities. It handles\nnonlinear and complex relationships between\
    \ variables, as in [73], in addition to Siemens\nindustrial plant simulation software\
    \ for plant simulation model production with a weather\nstation. In [67,79], the\
    \ Microsoft Excel spreadsheet application is used instead of other\ndedicated\
    \ software such as Geo-Soft-Core, a Geoscientiﬁc Software & Code Repository\n\
    hosted at the archive DIGITAL.CSIC in [78] or Java ontology editor to elaborate\
    \ a DT\neditor in [75,76].\nLastly, wireless network communication technologies\
    \ are addressed in the research\nliterature. Initially, the wired networking technology\
    \ Ethernet is mentioned in [28,73,77],\nwhile the wireless networking technologies\
    \ such as Wi-Fi are mentioned in [35,45,74,77,87],\nLoRaWAN in [45,73], mobile\
    \ or cellular in [45,74,87] and generally mentioned as mandatory\nin [29,82].\
    \ Bluetooth, RFID, and NB-IoT are exploited in [85].\n5. Discussion\nA ﬁrst attempt\
    \ to comment on speciﬁc aspects of the reviewed literature has been done\nin Section\
    \ 2. In total, 14 journal articles or conference papers, including a published\
    \ book,\npropose case studies that support the idea of DT implementation in agriculture,\
    \ contrary to\nthe rest published review papers that sufﬁce to merely describe\
    \ the topic and record the\nachievements of the scientiﬁc community referring\
    \ to it.\nIt is interesting to point out that three (3) relevant case study conference\
    \ papers and a\npublished book, added to nine (9) journal articles, seem to slightly\
    \ overcome the amount\nof the 12 review papers in a total of 26 articles. The\
    \ limited practical application of digital\ntwin technologies is obvious, even\
    \ stated in the literature by the authors.\nEven though [9,86,87] are review papers,\
    \ the authors either describe the necessity of a\nDT model as in [9] for the agriculture\
    \ supply chain management domain, even addressing\nsensors such as level, ﬂow,\
    \ identiﬁcation sensors, RFID or DNA tags, or highlight the need\nfor future study\
    \ on DT models as in [86] making use of remote detection and monitoring\nschemes,\
    \ LiDAR sensors, passive microwave sensing devices, RADARs or even sensors\nonboard\
    \ UAVs and satellites, for monitoring, controlling, coordinating, and executing\
    \ farm\noperations at agricultural sites by IoT sensor nodes as in [87].\nThe\
    \ signiﬁcance of using Sensors as part of a dynamic IoT control-oriented mechanism\n\
    as demanded in DT infrastructure should be acknowledged as in [35,73,74,77,79–81,87,88]\n\
    where soil probes, drone image cameras, multispectral and photographic cameras,\
    \ IR\nthermometers, mini-LiDAR sensors, a mesh of sensors measuring temperature,\
    \ humidity,\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128\n32 of 38\nluminosity, and relative CO2 concentration,\
    \ and air velocity are addressed as essential\nelements to materialize relevant\
    \ IoT platforms accordingly.\nIn [28,73,75,88], the SWAMP IoT-based smart water\
    \ management platform is men-\ntioned. In [19,26], the IoT scheme is merely addressed,\
    \ and in the journal [82], IoT is only\nmentioned as well in the review papers\
    \ [63,85,87], where the IoT is stated as a promising\nconcept. The fact that in\
    \ [73] an OPC UA server is recommended for implementation,\nin [77] an Arduino\
    \ single-board computer is used as well as the Raspberry Pi-3 platform as\nin\
    \ [80,81] in a total of 14 articles that either describe the use of IoT platforms\
    \ or vaguely\npresent a case study project [9,19,26,28,35,64,74–77,79–82] means\
    \ that the practical imple-\nmentation of IoT platforms is quite limited for the\
    \ time being.\nThe necessary software to operate such platforms is focused on\
    \ Python [28,77], ded-\nicated FIS, Json, FIWARE Cygnus connector, IoT Agent,\
    \ OPC agent [73], RPi in [77,80],\nArduino IDE n [77] relevant to the case studies\
    \ previously mentioned. These make use\nof Ethernet communication technologies\
    \ [28,73,77], LoRa [73], and Wi-Fi, [77] in addition\nto [35,74] that make use\
    \ of Wi-Fi and mobile LTE [74] communication technologies that\nfacilitate near\
    \ real-time interaction with the environment.\nThe concept and deﬁnition of DT\
    \ seem to be continuously evolving, but in general,\nit refers to a speciﬁc collection\
    \ of digitally or virtually materialized models that represent\na physical process\
    \ or object. These models are used for simulation and future behavior\nforecasting,\
    \ guiding the feedback loop from the Actuators and Control node to the Physical\n\
    entity, as profoundly visualized in Figures 3–5. The ongoing feedback loop between\
    \ the\nphysical farm and the DT is imperative to update the DT model to optimize\
    \ and enhance\nperformance and efﬁciency.\nSeveral attempts have been made in\
    \ this direction. In the reviews [9,29,63,83,86], the\nconcept of the DT model\
    \ is proposed merely as an evolving concept without an imple-\nmented case study.\
    \ Simulation models [83], referring to data-driven modelling, discrete\nevent\
    \ simulation blending and ﬂow models [9], and structure modelling simulation and\n\
    future multi-domain radiative transfer models (e.g., SCOPE) with dynamic crop\
    \ growth\nmodels for agroecosystems DTs [86] are described merely as proposals\
    \ giving way to future\npractical implementations. On the other hand, in [28],\
    \ simulation software utilizing a\nsimple plant simulation model is employed to\
    \ create a virtual environment for an irrigation\nsystem’s digital twin. In [73],\
    \ the Siemens industrial plant simulation software for the\ndata model is used,\
    \ a model of the Earth system is mentioned in [78], a 3D representation\nof a\
    \ farm in [81], while in [82] it continuous adaption and learning procedure of\
    \ the DT\nmodelling is mentioned as a need that relies heavily on available data.\
    \ A more concise\nproposal to the origin of the holistic DT modelling and simulation\
    \ concept appears in [76],\nwhere a prototype of an intelligent plant DT system\
    \ in Java claimed to be developed, includ-\ning an ontology editor, a digital\
    \ twin editor, and a multi-agent planning module. In [88],\nsimulation, analysis,\
    \ and prediction are addressed by making progress in implementing\nmodelling and\
    \ simulation of the fertility of seeds, fertilizer, pesticides, and pollution\
    \ chal-\nlenges, making efforts to develop plant modelling with soil agents (hydrological\
    \ models,\nsoil data), crop agents and predictive control models, where the adjustment\
    \ of control\nprocesses such as heating and ventilation is automated based on\
    \ short-term temperature\npredictions, ensuring efﬁcient regulation, as an IoT\
    \ derivative scheme.\nA ﬂowsheet model is proposed taking advantage of the widespread\
    \ spreadsheet\napplications of Microsoft Excel in [64] to tamper with simulation\
    \ software such as Aspen\nPlus and Aspen HYSYS from Aspen Technology, Inc. (Burlington,\
    \ MA, USA), ChemCAD\nfrom Chemstations, Inc. (Houston, TX, USA), UniSim Design\
    \ from Honeywell (Charlotte,\nNC, USA), ProSimPlus from ProSim SA (Labege, France)\
    \ and PRO/II from AVEVA Group\nplc, merely to implement a digital modelling approach\
    \ to food processing.\nSpreadsheet applications of Microsoft Excel to retrieve\
    \ height values of plants in high-\ntech data-driven greenhouses are used in [79],\
    \ a fact that proves that process calculations\nand analyses may be conducted\
    \ using popular spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128\n\
    33 of 38\ndue to its wide accessibility and familiarity among scientists, engineers,\
    \ and professionals\nfrom various ﬁelds.\nEnhanced 3D modelling software derived\
    \ from the game industry, i.e., Unity game en-\ngine dictates BIM models in Film\
    \ box (.FBX) format to aid realistic VR/AR representations\nof greenhouses, providing\
    \ a promising realistic overview of a Smart Agriculture imple-\nmentation. Virtual\
    \ representation is accomplished via Unreal Engine 5, Reality Capture,\nPhotoshop,\
    \ Autodesk, and Maya software platforms to construct Mesh models of Plant\nDatasets\
    \ for Virtual UCF Arboretum Applications, plant inventories, and AR Perpetual\n\
    Garden App. as in [74]. These plant datasets are derived from multiple captured\
    \ images\nin 3D space and incorporate VR headsets aided by GIS and AR Holodeck\
    \ software. Ad-\nditionally, Unreal Engine 5 Nanite technology and Reality are\
    \ used for 3D plant models\noffering a linear plant growth model [35] to descriptively\
    \ sufﬁce the wheat multi-agent\nplanning module. Using multiple captured images\
    \ taken in 3D space to support the AR\nPerpetual Garden App, they produce botanically\
    \ correct plant models for use in museums\nand for educational purposes. A promising\
    \ perspective, if by any chance associated with\nthe essential elements of the\
    \ holistic DT scheme, could be capturing real-time data on\nvarious environmental\
    \ and operational factors via communication technologies leading to\na dynamic\
    \ 3D model of a farm entity.\nBesides the 3D representation of DT models, IoT\
    \ Dashboards [87], such as Grafana in\nparticular [28,73] for real-time data presentation\
    \ and analysis or even GUI prototypes [81],\nare proposed, although used on a\
    \ small scale for facilitating near real-time interaction of\nDTs with the environment.\
    \ To reliably transfer and manage data, Blockchain is used, even\non a smaller\
    \ scale, as in [45,87], while Big Data Analytics, as in [82], AI and ML methods\n\
    that enable data analysis, pattern recognition, and decision-making based on large\
    \ datasets,\nare addressed in [45,63,82,83,86,88]. Cloud-based data analytics\
    \ pose a major issue for\nthe advent of smart agriculture as claimed in [45,85,87],\
    \ not to omit the signiﬁcance of\ndatabases such Mongo DB, Draco, My-SQL as used\
    \ in [28,73] or SQLite in [80], and Cloud\ncomputing service providers such as\
    \ Alibaba Cloud, Amazon web services, Microsoft\nAzure and Google Cloud platform\
    \ [87].\nVarious factors, with technical hurdles being the primary challenge,\
    \ seem to be step-\nping behind to allow even further the adoption of the DT technologies.\
    \ It is essential\nto meticulously design and clearly deﬁne intricate agricultural\
    \ systems to guarantee the\naccuracy of their corresponding DT models.\n6. Future\
    \ Directions\nOnce addressing a DT as a tight combination of an object model,\
    \ in conjunction with\nexpansive sets of data that directly follow the object\
    \ that may evolve and continually modify\nand adapt the model based on the available\
    \ data, it is made clear that future research should\nbe realized to overcome\
    \ the current profound lack of reference models and case studies\naccordingly.\
    \ That could serve as a direct guidance for DT research and development.\nTo broaden\
    \ the aspect of Agriculture 4.0 that needs DTs and overcome the limitations\n\
    of mere telemetry narrowed down by IoT schemes implemented till now, further research\n\
    in implementations using DT modelling, 3D visualization, and simulation schemes\
    \ tar-\ngeting virtual nature applications aided by AR, VR, and GIS information\
    \ systems should\nbe realized.\nFurther research into the holistic model perception\
    \ of plant DTs to overcome the focus\nmerely on the phenotype of plants could\
    \ vastly support DT research. We can pursue\nenhancing the accuracy of depicting\
    \ real-world farms, plants, and crops in the digital realm\nby combining non-georeferenced\
    \ visualizations, like gaming engines, with geospatially\nreferenced 3D geo visualizations.\n\
    Implementing additional case studies of digital twins that adhere to the mentioned\n\
    principles can address challenges related to reliable aggregating and handling\
    \ of data\nfrom diverse sources, integrating multiple streams of information,\
    \ and employing ad-\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128\n34 of 38\nvanced computational methods\
    \ for data processing and analysis, which could enhance the\nunderstanding of\
    \ the subject and aid further studies.\nFurther decommissioning of data in the\
    \ future resulting from search—Tables 1–3\nmight be promising. The diverse and\
    \ abundant potential advantages of DTs in agriculture\ncreate anticipation for\
    \ the future evolution of this technology and its profound impact on\nthe farming\
    \ sector.\nWe aspire for our work to inspire fellow researchers to explore the\
    \ application of DTs\nin agriculture even further.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization,\

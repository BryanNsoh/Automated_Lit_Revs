    The low-cost IoT architecture can empower businesses, communities, and individuals
    to harness the transformative capabilities of IoT technology, fostering innovation,
    efficiency, and improved quality of life across various domains4. Smart libraries
    play a crucial role in modernizing and enhancing traditional library services
    through the integration of advanced technologies. The importance of smart libraries
    lies in their ability to leverage innovations such as IoT, artificial intelligence,
    and data analytics to create more efficient and user-centric library experiences5.
    These technologies facilitate tasks like automated cataloging, personalized recommendations,
    and real-time tracking of library resources6. Smart libraries enhance accessibility
    to information, offering users a seamless and interactive environment for research
    and learning. Additionally, they contribute to the preservation of valuable resources
    by employing digital archiving and conservation methods7. The application of smart
    libraries spans across educational institutions, research facilities, and public
    spaces, promoting the evolution of libraries into dynamic hubs that adapt to contemporary
    information needs and technological advancements8. SDN holds paramount importance
    in revolutionizing traditional network architectures by providing a more flexible,
    scalable, and programmable approach to network management. By decoupling the control
    plane from the data plane, SDN allows for centralized control, enabling administrators
    to dynamically allocate network resources and implement changes efficiently9.
    The significance of SDN lies in its ability to streamline network provisioning,
    enhance scalability, and simplify network management, leading to improved operational
    efficiency10. SDN finds applications across various sectors, including data centers,
    telecommunications, and enterprise networks. In data centers, SDN facilitates
    the orchestration of resources and ensures optimal traffic flow, contributing
    to better overall performance. In telecommunications, SDN enables the creation
    of agile and programmable networks, paving the way for innovations like 5G11.
    Enterprises benefit from SDN by achieving greater control over their network infrastructure,
    supporting dynamic business requirements, and enhancing security through centralized
    policy management. Overall, SDN plays a pivotal role in reshaping network architectures
    to meet the demands of modern, dynamic, and data-intensive applications12. The
    IoT-based low-cost architecture for smart libraries utilizing SDN is of significant
    importance in transforming traditional libraries into intelligent, connected spaces13.
    This innovative approach leverages the IoT to enhance library services, improve
    resource management, and provide an enriched experience for users. By integrating
    sensors, RFID technology, and other IoT devices, the system enables real-time
    monitoring of book availability, user preferences, and environmental conditions
    within the library14. SDN comes into play by offering a centralized and programmable
    network infrastructure, allowing efficient communication and control of diverse
    IoT devices4. This architecture not only optimizes resource allocation and energy
    efficiency but also enhances security through centralized monitoring. Applications
    of this IoT-based low-cost architecture for smart libraries are diverse, including

    for library administrators15. Overall, this integrated approach transforms traditional
    libraries into dynamic, responsive, and technology-driven hubs that cater to the
    evolving needs of library users in the digital age16. An IoT-based low-cost architecture
    is a technological framework designed to integrate the IoT into a system or environment
    with a primary focus on cost-effectiveness17. This architecture utilizes IoT devices,
    which are interconnected physical devices equipped with sensors, actuators, and
    communication modules, to efficiently collect and exchange data18. Emphasizing
    affordability, it enables the deployment of IoT applications in various scenarios
    with budget constraints, optimizing resource utilization and ensuring efficient
    connectivity among IoT devices. The goal is to bring the benefits of IoT, such
    as real-time data monitoring and enhanced automation, to environments where cost
    efficiency is paramount. Smart libraries, on the other hand, are modernized library
    systems incorporating advanced technologies like IoT, artificial intelligence,
    and data analytics to streamline operations and services19. These libraries use
    automation for tasks such as cataloging, check-in/check-out, and inventory management,
    enhancing efficiency and accuracy. Featuring digitized collections, interactive
    learning spaces, and personalized services, smart libraries create an intelligent
    and user-centric environment, adapting to the evolving needs of patrons in the
    digital age20. SDN, or Software-Defined Networking, is a revolutionary networking
    paradigm that revolutionizes traditional network architectures by separating the
    control plane from the data plane21. In SDN, network intelligence and decision-making
    are centralized through a software-based controller, offering programmability,
    flexibility, and dynamic management of network resources. This decoupling enables
    efficient network configuration, monitoring, and optimization through software
    applications, fostering automation and agility in response to changing network
    conditions22. The goal is to simplify network management, enhance scalability,
    and expedite the deployment of new services. When applied to an IoT-based low-cost
    architecture for smart libraries, SDN becomes instrumental in creating intelligent
    and affordable library systems23. By integrating IoT devices like sensors and
    smart devices into the library environment, data collection and diverse applications
    are enabled. The emphasis on being low-cost ensures accessibility for libraries
    facing resource constraints, with SDN providing a programmable and centralized
    control plane for dynamic adaptation to changing requirements. This integrated
    approach enhances library services, facilitates real-time monitoring, and supports
    innovative applications, ultimately establishing a smart and interconnected library
    ecosystem24. Our research paper significantly contributes to the field of smart
    libraries by introducing a groundbreaking IoT-based low-cost architecture. Unlike
    prior studies that have primarily focused on IoT-based low-cost architecture,
    our work explores a novel approach by integrating IoT and SDN technologies to
    optimize library activities. The key contribution lies in adapting the synergy
    of IoT and SDN, originally designed for smart libraries. Our proposed algorithm,
    leveraging RFID-based processes and SDN-based network configuration, provides
    a unique and efficient strategy for enhancing library intelligence. The integration
    of RFID technology for authentication, property circulation management, and library
    book loan management, along with SDN''s streamlined communication infrastructure,
    forms a pioneering architecture. This novel framework not only reduces the need
    for constant operator supervision in libraries but also presents a scalable and
    software-oriented solution. The hierarchical tree topology, formed through our
    clustering algorithm, further enhances communication efficiency, offering a valuable
    and innovative perspective for future developments in IoT-based library systems.

    which is particularly advantageous for securing diverse and interconnected IoT
    ecosystems. The paper contributed to the field by addressing the unique security
    challenges posed by IoT devices through a distributed SDN-based approach with

    ensuring that individuals in diverse geographical areas can access healthcare
    services seamlessly. The model considered the specific challenges and requirements
    of both rural and urban environments, aiming to provide an inclusive and effective
    healthcare monitoring solution. This paper contributed to the advancement of IoT-based
    healthcare systems by offering a feasible and adaptable model tailored to the
    unique characteristics of different regions. Besides, de Melo, Miani28 addressed
    the critical issue of securing home networks through the introduction of the FamilyGuard
    security architecture. The proposed model focused on anomaly detection within
    home environments, aiming to safeguard the interconnected devices and systems
    commonly found in modern households. The authors presented a comprehensive approach
    to network security, utilizing anomaly detection techniques to identify potential
    threats or irregularities. By addressing the unique challenges posed by home networks,
    FamilyGuard offered a tailored and effective security solution to protect the
    privacy and integrity of users'' connected devices within a domestic setting.
    Additionally, Elhoseny, Siraj29 concentrated on addressing the challenges of energy
    efficiency and security in IoT applications. The authors proposed a mobile agent-based
    protocol designed to enhance the sustainability of IoT systems. The protocol aimed
    to optimize energy consumption in IoT devices while ensuring robust security measures.

    table As well, Chiliquinga, Manzano22 explored an approach for monitoring IoT
    networks by leveraging SDN and efficient traffic signatures. The proposed method
    aimed to address the challenges associated with the growing complexity and diversity

    traffic signatures helped in efficiently identifying and analyzing IoT-related
    traffic, optimizing resource utilization. The paper emphasized a progressive monitoring
    strategy that evolves with the evolving landscape of IoT networks, enhancing overall
    network security and performance. Also, Njah, Pham30 proposed an innovative approach
    to flow management in a smart digital campus using SDN. The proposed scheme focused
    on efficiently managing network flows by considering both service requirements

    and resource utilization of the network infrastructure, ensuring that services
    in the smart campus environment are delivered optimally. The paper contributed
    to the advancement of SDN-based solutions tailored for complex digital campus
    scenarios, emphasizing the importance of balancing service requirements and resource
    management for effective flow control. Furthermore, Gordon, Batula31 presented
    an innovative approach to enhancing the security of smart homes. The authors proposed
    a solution that integrates SDN with low-cost traffic classification techniques.
    This combination allowed for dynamic and programmable control over the home network,
    enabling adaptive responses to security threats. The use of low-cost traffic classification
    enhanced the efficiency of identifying and managing different types of network
    traffic associated with smart home devices. By leveraging SDN''s capabilities
    and cost-effective traffic classification, the paper contributed to the development
    of practical and accessible security measures tailored for the unique challenges
    presented by smart home environments, ultimately aiming to provide homeowners
    with a more resilient and responsive defense against potential cybersecurity threats.
    Moreover, Ganesan, Hwang32 presented an approach to network traffic classification

    management, dynamic adaptation to changing conditions, and improved overall performance.
    The paper discussed key concepts and challenges associated with this evolution,
    providing insights into the future of smart and software-defined IoT systems.
    Proposed algorithm The proposed method for imbuing libraries with intelligence
    leverages the synergy of IoT and SDN technologies. This architecture demonstrates
    the capability to intelligently oversee a diverse array of library activities,
    thereby mitigating the requirement for constant operator supervision. The suggested
    framework incorporates SDN to streamline the intricacies associated with resource
    management in IoT, offering an efficient and cost-effective strategy. The supported
    activities within libraries employing this architecture include: 1. RFID-based
    processes encompass: Authentication Property circulation management Library book
    loan management 2. Data exchange based on IoT SDN Thus, the entire intelligent
    processes in the library can be categorized into two groups based on RFID and
    SDN, depending on the platform used. In the proposed architecture, authentication,
    property circulation management, and book lending processes utilize RFID technology
    and operate on the IoT communication platform. Conversely, the information exchange
    mechanism relies on SDN architecture to furnish an efficient communication platform
    in smart libraries. Figure 1 illustrates the proposed architecture, which, based
    on the amalgamation of Internet of Things and software-oriented network technologies,
    can be segmented into the following fundamental components: Data center SDN controllers
    RFID tags and tag readers, along with other network sensors Users Figure 1 A view
    of the proposed smart library model. Full size image The architecture presented
    in Fig. 1 offers the potential to modernize key processes in traditional libraries.
    In this proposed architecture, intelligent library information management relies
    on a data center, serving as the hub for organizing crucial data for intelligent
    library management. The data center accommodates key information in the following
    tables: Books information Member information Book loan information The table for
    book information encompasses key attributes associated with each book in the library.
    Within this table, access to individual books is facilitated through a master
    key. This unique key, recorded in the book information table, is also stored in
    the RFID tag affixed to the corresponding book. Consequently, by scanning the
    RFID tag and extracting its unique code, the book''s information can be retrieved
    via the data center. Similarly, the member information table comprises distinct
    characteristics of each library member, with each member differentiated by a unique
    membership ID. This unique code is stored in the RFID tag on the member''s card,
    enabling the retrieval of all personal information through tag access. The book
    loan information table serves as a communication interface between the aforementioned
    tables, managing transactions related to book entries and exits. Each entry in
    this table describes the loan or return of a book by a member, utilizing foreign
    keys corresponding to the unique identifiers of the book and the member. Additionally,
    it includes time information regarding the book''s loan and return. Two additional
    tables are employed to oversee book reservation processes and library property
    management. These tables mirror the structure of the book loan information table,
    storing information on book reservations or transfers of library property by members.
    It is evident that components such as book and member RFID tags, the data center,
    and RFID tag reader nodes play essential roles in processes related to member
    authentication, book loans, and returns. Conducting the mentioned processes intelligently,
    especially in extensive libraries, necessitates the utilization of an efficient
    communication infrastructure. The proposed method addresses this requirement through
    the integration of IoT and SDN, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The suggested architecture
    categorizes the array of smart library sensors using SDN technology, organizing
    each group of adjacent sensors into a subnet. Controller nodes, supervising each
    sub-network, govern the data exchange between the sensors and the data center
    within the smart library. This communication mechanism, coupled with RFID technology,
    offers a solution to concerns related to the model''s cost and scalability in
    expansive environments. The subsequent section provides a detailed description
    of each process outlined in the proposed smart library model. RFID-based processes
    in the proposed architecture As mentioned, RFID-based processes encompass a range
    of functions associated with member authentication, property movement control,
    and library book loan management. In all these processes, three key components—data
    center, RFID tag, and tag reader—collaborate. Figure 2 illustrates the mechanism
    of RFID-based processes within the proposed system architecture. Figure 2 The
    mechanism of RFID-based processes in the proposed system architecture. Full size
    image As illustrated in Fig. 2, the architecture of this system comprises four
    components: tag, tag reader, antenna, and computer network. In the proposed model,
    passive tags are utilized to minimize the overall implementation cost of the system.
    This choice is based on the suitable distance of 5–10 m supported by passive tags
    for effective identification. To detect the presence of a person, a sensor and
    an activating switch are employed in the identity verification station. When an
    individual enters the identity verification station, the switch within the sensor
    triggers the tag reader. The tag reader component is positioned adjacent to the
    sensor. Consequently, upon switch activation, the tag reader component transmits
    a coded signal to the tags affixed to the user''s membership card, books, or property.
    Each tag component then emits its unique identification code as a radio signal
    to the reader. Upon receiving the identification codes, this information is transmitted
    to the computer system linked to the tag reader. Subsequently, the computer system
    relays this data to the data center via the network. The data center securely
    stores the encrypted IDs of all members, assets, and books in the library. The
    received identifier undergoes a search operation within the data center through
    the tag reader. If the desired identifier is located in the database, a confirmation
    message is dispatched to the sender''s computer system, signaling successful verification.
    Conversely, if the identifier is deemed invalid, an error message is generated.
    Upon successful identity verification, the data center records the transaction
    time and other pertinent details. Notably, the search and validation processes
    are carried out independently for each member and book/property component. To
    achieve this, the unique membership ID (Tagcard in Fig. 2) is sought in the member
    information table, while the book/property''s unique ID (Tagbook/Tagproperty)
    is searched in the books/property information table. The corresponding flowchart
    depicting these processes is presented in Fig. 3. Figure 3 Flowchart of RFID-based
    processes in the proposed architecture. Full size image The electronic tags employed
    to identify library members, books, and assets in the proposed model represent
    an automated data carrier utilizing RFID technology. The system''s architecture
    adopts passive RFID tags operating in the UHF band, with a reading range spanning
    6–10 m. Figure 4 illustrates the structure of these tags. Passive tags, as mentioned,
    lack an independent energy source for transmitting identifiers to the reader component.
    Instead, they harness energy from radio frequency pulses dispatched by the reader
    component. Upon receiving these pulses, the tag charges its internal capacitor,
    utilizing it as an energy supply source. Subsequently, the tag transmits its information
    to the reader component through internal antennas. It''s noteworthy that the identifiers
    stored in these specialized electronic tags boast resistance to copying or alteration.
    The extended lifespan and cost-effectiveness of RFID technology contribute to
    its advantageous use in creating intelligent libraries. Figure 4 UFH band passive
    tag structure used in the proposed architecture. Full size image SDN-based network
    configuration and routing The proposed architecture for smart libraries adopts
    a scalable and software-oriented network-based mechanism to establish the data
    exchange pattern among network components. This entails defining the necessary
    mechanisms for constructing topology and data routing based on that topology—an
    essential process in the network operations of IoT-based architectures. The topology
    construction involves creating a network communication infrastructure using a
    subset of stable communication links. Simultaneously, the routing process dictates
    how data is exchanged between network sensors (such as members'' smartphones,
    tag readers, and controllers) and the data center, leveraging the established
    topology. This facilitates data routing for activities like book search, reservation,
    identity authentication, and other smart library functions between diverse network
    components. The proposed routing algorithm, detailed in the subsequent section,
    is a multi-step strategy rooted in the SDN architecture. This algorithm determines
    optimal routes for data transmission based on a cost function. Construction of
    topology The configuration process of the proposed intelligent library architecture
    commences with the construction and control of the network topology, utilizing
    a software-based network. In this method, network nodes initially exchange positional
    information and then establish the clustering structure based on SDN principles.
    Notably, as a substantial portion of network sensors consists of members'' smartphones,
    all of which are mobile, considering the movement characteristics of these objects
    during the topology construction process becomes paramount. Therefore, the topology
    construction process begins by calculating the relative speed between the network
    nodes. To assess the relative speed of two nodes, the first step involves estimating
    the distance to the node. In this proposed method, it is assumed that the distance
    between two nodes can be estimated based on the received signal strength of each
    node, calculated using the provided equation. $$RSS{I}_{d}={K}_{1}- {K}_{2}{\\text{log}}\\left(d\\right)+
    u$$ (1) In the given equation, ''d'' denotes the distance between two nodes, and
    ''u'' is an independent random parameter following a Gaussian distribution with
    a zero mean. Additionally, ''K1'' and ''K2'' represent the path loss parameters
    in the 802.11 standard. As expressed in Eq. (1), the distance between two nodes
    can be approximated through the received signal strength. This relationship can
    be estimated as described below, without taking the environmental noise factor
    into account: $${d}_{{c}_{1},{c}_{2}}={e}^{\\frac{\\left({K}_{1}-rssi\\right)}{{K}_{2}}}$$
    (2) In the next step of the proposed method, we calculate the relative speed and
    communication stability. Let''s consider two nodes, A and B, at a distance ''d''
    from each other. These nodes move in a straight line with a speed ''v'', and each
    node has a movement angle ''θ''. Therefore, the velocity vector for nodes A and
    B will be denoted as \\(\\overline{{V }_{A}}=\\left({v}_{A}, {\\theta }_{A}\\right)\\)
    and \\(\\overline{{V }_{B}}=({v}_{B}, {\\theta }_{B})\\). We assume that the radio
    range of nodes is ''R'', and. d < R. The relative velocity vector of the two nodes
    can be calculated using the following equation: $$\\overline{{V }_{BA}}=\\overline{{V
    }_{B}}-\\overline{{V }_{A}}=({v}_{BA},{\\theta }_{BA})$$ (3) In the above relationship,
    θ_BA is the relative angle of two nodes A and B. also: $${v}_{BA}=\\sqrt{{\\left({v}_{B}cos{\\theta
    }_{B}- {v}_{A}cos{\\theta }_{A}\\right)}^{2}+{\\left({v}_{B}sin{\\theta }_{B}-
    {v}_{A}sin{\\theta }_{A}\\right)}^{2} } ,$$ (4) $${\\theta }_{BA}={{\\text{tan}}}^{-1}\\frac{{v}_{B}sin{\\theta
    }_{B}- {v}_{A}sin{\\theta }_{A}}{{v}_{B}cos{\\theta }_{B}- {v}_{A}cos{\\theta
    }_{A}}$$ (5) Using relations (4) and (5), it can be shown that the duration of
    two nodes being neighbors will be equal to: $${T}_{neighbor}=\\frac{dcos{\\theta
    }_{BA}+ \\sqrt{{r}^{2}-{d}^{2}{{\\text{sin}}}^{2}{\\theta }_{BA}}}{{v}_{BA}}$$
    (6) Using the above relationship, it is possible to predict whether two nodes
    A and B will be neighbors after the time interval tΔ or not? This will happen
    if T_neighbor > ∆t. In this case, the similarity of the movement pattern of two
    users A and B will be stored in a matrix as follows: $${T}_{A,B}=\\left| lo{c}_{a}^{current}-
    lo{c}_{b}^{current}\\right|+\\left| lo{c}_{a}^{future}- lo{c}_{b}^{future}\\right|$$
    (7) In the above relationship, loc_a^current is the current position of node A
    as (x_a,y_a) and loc_a^future is the predicted position for node A after the time
    interval tΔ and is calculated as follows: $$lo{c}_{a}^{future}=({x}_{a}+ {V}_{{x}_{a}}*
    \\Delta t , {y}_{a}+ {V}_{{y}_{a}}* \\Delta t )$$ (8) In the above relationship,
    \\({V}_{{x}_{a}}\\) represents the speed of the node along the x-axis, and \\({V}_{{y}_{a}}\\)
    is its speed along the y-axis. By calculating the value of Tab for each pair of
    nodes in the network, a portion of the similarity matrix is formed. This matrix
    contains the degree of similarity in the movement patterns of each pair of nodes.
    All nodes transmit their matrix portions to the data center node, contributing
    to the construction of the topology based on the clustering structure. The central
    node responsible for clustering the moving nodes integrates these \\({T}_{ab}\\)
    matrix parts and categorizes nodes into clusters using two fundamental rules.
    In this method, nodes with similar movement patterns are grouped into a cluster.
    To assess the similarity of the movement pattern between two nodes, the following
    conditions are checked: 1. The term \"two nodes should be in the same radio range
    (both nodes have direct one-step access to each other)\" refers to the requirement
    that two nodes should be within each other''s direct radio communication range,
    enabling a one-step direct connection. 2. Additionally, it should be anticipated
    that after a period of time Δt, the distance between the two nodes does not exceed
    a predefined threshold distance. The second condition involves predicting the
    persistent position of the connection between two nodes, and based on these criteria,
    the user''s movement pattern information is stored in a matrix, denoted as T.
    Following these rules, the steps for clustering network nodes by the central node
    are as follows: Input: List of users L and connection period matrix T Output:
    C network clusters Repeat the following steps until a node is in the L list. Pick
    a random node x from list L, remove it from L, and create a new cluster in C.
    For each node \\(y\\in L\\): if y is a neighbor of x and based on the matrix T,
    \\({T}_{x,y}\\ge \\Delta t\\), then add y to the current cluster in clustering
    C and omit node y from the list L. Go to step 1. After this process, all network
    nodes will be grouped into clusters based on their movement patterns, and each
    cluster will be assigned to the nearest SDN controller node in the form of a subnet.
    The result will be a set of isolated clusters. At the end of the topology control
    step, these clusters need to be efficiently connected. The proposed algorithm
    achieves this by forming the network topology based on an optimal subset of connections
    for each cluster, facilitated through cluster head controller nodes. In the proposed
    method, neighbors belonging to other clusters are evaluated for each controller
    node, and the weight of the connection between two nodes i and j is determined
    using the provided relationship. $${W}_{i,j}=\\frac{|{N}_{(i)}-{B}_{K}^{\\prime}|}{|{B}_{K}^{\\prime}|}-\\frac{P}{{E}_{j}}\\times
    {D}_{ij}$$ (9) In the above relation, \\({N}_{(i)}\\) represents the neighborhood
    set of node i. \\({B}_{K}^{\\prime}\\) represents the set of nodes covered by
    the current topology structure (nodes that are either members of the topology
    or are located in the neighborhood of at least one of its members). P represents
    the initial energy of network nodes, and \\({E}_{j}\\) specifies the current energy
    of node j. Finally, \\({D}_{ij}\\) indicates the end-to-end delay in communication
    between two nodes i and j, which is estimated during the neighbor discovery process.
    The weight function used in relation (9) consists of two parts: profit and loss.
    This function states that connecting two clusters by adding a link between two
    nodes i and j to the network topology, how much benefit and how much loss will
    result. The first part of this relationship is \\(\\frac{|{N}_{(i)}-{B}_{K}^{\\prime}|}{|{B}_{K}^{\\prime}|}\\)
    and it shows the number of new nodes that will be covered by the topology by joining
    these two clusters. If the selection of a node can add more members to the topology,
    adding with that node will have a high benefit. On the other hand, if the selection
    of a node does not add any new member to the topology, then \\(\\frac{|{N}_{(i)}-{B}_{K}^{\\prime}|}{|{B}_{K}^{\\prime}|}=0\\)
    and relation (9) is negative Will have. As a result, the proposed weight calculation
    relationship will prevent the addition of ineffective nodes in the topology. The
    second part of the weight function in relation (9) represents the amount of loss
    resulting from the selection of node j and is described as \\(\\frac{P{\\times
    D}_{ij}}{{E}_{j}}\\). This part of the weight function shows how adding node j
    to the topology will affect the topology''s lifetime and latency. After evaluating
    the weight function by the nodes completing the topology (Relation 9), each time
    the link with the most positive weight is selected and the cluster corresponding
    to that selection will be added to the topology. Considering this feature, the
    network clustering structure will become a hierarchical tree topology, an example
    of which is shown in Fig. 5. Figure 5 A view of the topology structure formed
    in the proposed method. Full size image In Fig. 5, each SDN controller and its
    neighboring nodes are considered as a sub-domain in SDN. Communication between
    subdomains is facilitated through gateway nodes (shown in gray in the figure).
    Additionally, the connections between the controllers are illustrated with dashed
    lines in this figure. Once each cluster is formed, the controller node will possess
    its member list and exchange it with other controllers. After establishing the
    network topology, route selection, and data exchange operations will be executed.
    This step of the proposed method will be further elucidated in the following section.
    Data routing using a structured structure After forming the network topology,
    this structure will be utilized for data routing concerning library information.
    Due to the tree topology, it is evident that there will be only one path between
    each controller node and the data center. Thus, if a node intends to send a request
    to receive information from the data center, the source node initially transmits
    its ID to its subdomain controller. The controller node then searches for the
    source ID in its member list, and if it corresponds, it forwards the sensor request
    to the central node through the unique path in the hierarchical tree. Upon receiving
    this message, the central node matches the requester''s sensor ID with the requested
    information ID, and if the information is accurate, the requested media is transmitted
    to the controller node through the existing path. Result and discussion The approach
    under consideration underwent a thorough assessment comprising two specific stages.
    During the initial phase, we concentrated on the practical application in a small-scale
    library for a month. Through this on-site evaluation, we scrupulously examined
    the effectiveness of the suggested architectural method, making comparisons with
    the library''s conventional approach during the same period. In the subsequent
    phase, we created a simulation environment utilizing MATLAB 2021. In this stage,
    we methodically evaluated the performance of the proposed algorithm, offering
    a detailed analysis in contrast to the algorithm outlined in the reference articles25
    and6. Real-world implementation results The proposed architecture addresses the
    evolving landscape of smart libraries by introducing an IoT-based low-cost system
    leveraging SDN. Targeting RFID-based processes, such as authentication, property
    circulation, and book loans, the system intelligently oversees various library
    activities, reducing the need for constant operator supervision and providing
    scalability for extensive library environments. The evaluation of this architecture
    over a one-month period, as indicated in Figs. 6,7,8,9, demonstrates its practical
    implementation in a small-scale library, highlighting its potential to enhance
    efficiency and cost-effectiveness in managing library processes. Figures 6,7,8,9
    pertain to the first phase, where we conducted evaluations at various instances
    to record library item transactions, encompassing four components: the first involves
    tag identification, the second encompasses tag processing, the third engages in
    ID searching, and the fourth involves saving the results. Average processing times
    were scrutinized at different intervals, revealing that, on the whole, this architecture
    can accomplish each transaction in under half a second, signifying a substantial
    enhancement in system speed. Figure 7 illustrates accuracy and the frequency of
    error types. The average accuracy rate is presented in Fig. 7.a, calculated by
    determining the error count on different days, dividing it by the total number
    of transactions, and deriving its rate. The results, as depicted in Fig. 7.a,
    indicate that the proposed method attains a minimum accuracy of 99% on various
    days, demonstrating an error probability of less than one percent. Figure 7b further
    categorizes errors by type, revealing three categories: (1) tag reader error,
    (2) user error, and (3) network error, with user error exhibiting the highest
    error rate. Nearly half of the errors are attributed to user operator mistakes,
    largely attributed to users'' unfamiliarity with the system, although this has
    significantly decreased over different days with the operators gaining more familiarity
    with the system. Figure 6 The average processing time of the proposed system for
    recording the transaction of library items. Full size image Figure 7 System performance
    chart in transaction registration (a) average accuracy per day, (b) frequency
    of error types. Full size image Figure 8 Average demand queue by day. Full size
    image Figure 9 Comparison of sensitivity and specificity criteria of the proposed
    method with the traditional method. Full size image Figure 8 presents the daily
    average number of demand queues, determined over a span of days, with an observed
    average of 1.4 queues. This signifies that, even in the presence of continuous
    demand within the library system, the number of individuals in the demand queue
    remains below a specified threshold, effectively preventing congestion in the
    system. In Fig. 9, a comparative analysis is conducted between the proposed smart
    system, denoted as RFID, and the traditional user-based system, focusing on specificity
    and sensitivity criteria. This comparison assesses whether the RFID system excels
    in identifying users and making book judgments compared to human users. The findings
    suggest that the proposed method, marked as RFID, demonstrates relatively high
    accuracy and ideal performance compared to the traditional system. Simulation
    results In this operational phase, where the proposed method is simulated in an
    environment, we have focused on the construction of topology and information routing
    between the nodes of the smart library network and compared the results with6
    and25. Moving on to Figs. 10,11,12,13, these figures delve into a comprehensive
    comparison of the proposed method with previous approaches. Figure 10 specifically
    addresses the packet delivery rate concerning changes in the number of network
    nodes. Through a simulated environment involving 100 to 300 nodes with heterogeneous
    characteristics, the figure reveals an increasing packet delivery rate as the
    number of nodes rises. This is attributed to the multi-step method employed, utilizing
    users themselves to exchange data, resulting in a higher probability of successful
    packet delivery. Figure 10 The percentage of successful reception of packets against
    the number of visiting nodes. Full size image Figure 11 Energy consumption of
    the whole network in relation to the number of visiting nodes. Full size image
    Figure 12 Average end-to-end network latency versus number of visitors. Full size
    image Figure 13 Load imposed on each node for forwarding data according to the
    position of that node in the environment. Full size image Figure 11 shifts the
    focus to energy consumption, indicating an exponential increase in constant energy
    as the number of nodes rises. Interestingly, the proposed method consumes less
    energy up to 250 nodes, exceeding the compared method for 300 nodes. This lower
    energy consumption for 100 to 250 nodes indicates superior performance in terms
    of energy efficiency, attributed to the use of an efficient energy topology in
    the software network architecture considered. However, as the number of nodes
    reaches 300, energy consumption rises due to significant differences in transmissions
    between the proposed and compared methods. Figure 12 calculates the average user
    delay, revealing consistently lower delays in the proposed method across various
    scenarios. Lastly, Fig. 13 showcases the successful load balancing achieved by
    the proposed method. The equal participation of nodes in sending data, regardless
    of their position, demonstrates the method''s effectiveness in load distribution,
    contributing to an extended network lifespan and enhanced efficiency. Conclusion
    Our research paper proposes an innovative IoT-based low-cost architecture for
    smart libraries using SDN, presenting a comprehensive method for imbuing libraries
    with intelligence. The core contribution lies in the synergy of IoT and SDN technologies,
    showcasing the capacity to intelligently oversee diverse library activities, thus
    reducing the need for constant operator supervision. Our proposed framework incorporates
    RFID-based processes for authentication, property circulation management, and
    library book loan management, while the data exchange relies on IoT SDN. The architecture
    encompasses key components such as a data center, SDN controllers, RFID tags,
    tag readers, and other network sensors. Our proposed architecture offers a transformative
    approach to traditional libraries, enhancing key processes through intelligent
    information management. The data center plays a pivotal role in organizing crucial
    information related to books, members, and book loans, facilitating efficient
    library resource management. Leveraging RFID technology for member and book identification,
    the proposed system ensures secure and streamlined processes. The integration
    of SDN-based network configuration involves a hierarchical tree topology and a
    weight-based algorithm for efficient cluster connectivity, addressing concerns
    related to cost and scalability. Our innovative approach provides a foundation
    for modernizing extensive libraries and lays the groundwork for future advancements
    in the integration of IoT and SDN technologies. Data availability All data generated

    of technological advancements in robotics, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality
    (VR) and computing power has led to a growing application of Artificial intelligence
    (AI) in several fields including medicine. In the clinical surgery field, advancements
    in sensor and robotics coupled with AI technology has a potential to replace error-prone
    manual procedures. AI-enabled surgical robots assist surgeons to undertake complex
    surgical procedures with improved accuracy (Panesar et al., 2019). Furthermore,
    AI can learn patterns from clinical data and medical instrumentations to guide
    surgeons towards more efficient decision-making. However, the integration of AI
    into daily clinical surgical practice is still in the early stages, with many
    potential applications yet to be fully explored. In the field of Orthopaedic surgery,
    AI has shown significant improvements in the quality and efficiency of surgical
    operations in recent years. Orthopaedic surgery is a procedure that involves replacing
    a missing or disabled body part such as an arm or a leg with an artificial extension
    (Rajťúková et al., 2014). AI improves the overall performance of Orthopaedic surgery
    during preoperative, intra-operative and post-operative phases in several ways.
    AI can be used for surgical outcome prediction based on clinical data (Haleem
    et al., 2020). AI solutions can also assist surgeons with real-time feedback leading
    to improvements in the efficiency of surgery procedures during the intra-operative
    stage (Parums, 2021), (Alvarado-Landeo et al., 2022), (Memon et al., 2021). Furthermore,
    during postoperative phases, AI can be used to monitor and assess postoperative
    patient recovery (Bian et al., 2020). Recent research in the application of AI
    in Orthopaedic surgery focuses on clinical decision support systems. Previous
    studies largely focused on reducing human errors and improving the efficiency
    of diagnosis (Gupta et al., 2022), planning, surgical operation (Luo et al., 2022),
    and outcome prediction (Groot et al., 2022). However, despite the growing volume
    of research, there is a lack of understanding regarding the state of the art of
    research in the field of AI-assisted orthopaedic surgery. While studies demonstrate
    promising accuracy and technical capabilities of AI, uncertainties remain regarding
    definitive clinical benefits over conventional methods. In this paper, we conducted
    a systematic review and meta-analysis of previous studies on the application of
    AI in Orthopaedic surgery to provide a summary of the key findings. The key motivation
    of this systematic review is to provide a comprehensive synthesis of the state-of-the-art
    applications and performance of AI techniques in orthopaedic surgery. We conduct
    a comprehensive analysis of the potential applications and performance of AI techniques
    compared to conventional methods. The meta-analysis further objectively quantifies
    outcomes in key areas including surgical time, complications, and functional results.
    Furthermore, this paper aims to objectively analyze the evidence to reveal limitations
    requiring further research and guide the effective integration of AI in clinical
    practice. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the
    literature review. Section 3 discusses the systematic review and meta-analysis
    methodology followed in this study. The main results are presented in section
    4 followed by a discussion of the results in section 5. Finally, section 6 presents
    the conclusion of the study. 2. Literature review 2.1. Types of Orthopaedic Surgery
    The prevalence of Orthopaedic surgery is expected to increase due to increasing
    ageing populations. The most common types of Orthopaedic surgery include total
    knee replacement (TKR) (Woolhead et al., 2005), total knee arthroplasty (TKA)
    (Li et al., 2019), total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) (Ahmed et al., 2021), total
    hip arthroplasty (THA) (Varacallo et al., 2017), total hip replacement (THR) (Günther
    et al., 2021), total joint replacement (TJR) (Bumpass and Nunley, 2012). The THA
    and the TKA are used for the surgical treatment of advanced osteoarthritis (joint
    condition). Studies show that an estimated 512,000 and 700,000 THA and TKA procedures,
    respectively, are carried out annually in the USA alone (Ferguson et al., 2018).
    A significant rise in TKA procedures has also been observed in France, with a
    62% overall increase from 2009 to 2019 (Fig. 1), indicating a global trend in
    the growing need for these surgeries (Le Stum et al., 2023). The study also showed
    a 33% rise in TKA procedures by the year 2050 for both male and female patients,
    which suggests a growing demand for these types of surgeries in the forthcoming
    decades (Le Stum et al., 2023). Download : Download high-res image (433KB) Download

    et al., 2023). 2.2. AI application in surgery AI is a modern technology that is
    expanding quickly and finding more uses in healthcare (Lam et al., 2020), (Tang
    et al., 2020). AI mimics human intelligence to automate tasks with precision.
    It makes use of specific algorithms, rules, and instructions to intelligently
    accomplish a task. AI techniques have been used for the diagnosis of infection,
    provision of patient-specific treatments and the prediction of implant sizes as
    well as clinical outcomes of various pre- and post-operative procedures in Orthopaedics
    (Hinterwimmer et al., 2022), (Kunze et al., 2022). Compared with conventional
    rule-based approaches and regression models, machine learning models can interface
    a huge volume of data and variables to predict and evaluate performance metrics
    (Chen and Asch, 2017). This can help improve surgeons’ decision-making to improve
    surgical outcomes. Several AI tools were developed in recent years to standardize
    the screening of patients before specific Orthopaedic treatment. For instance,
    the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons developed an AI tool for the selection
    of patients based on their symptom intensity, medical history etc. (Katz et al.,
    2017). Although several AI models have been developed in recent years for applications
    in Orthopaedics surgery, their safety and effectiveness remain an issue. Hence
    a thorough investigation needs to be carried out to validate the technology before
    deploying it for clinical use. 2.3. Robot and computer-assisted surgery Robotic-assisted
    Orthopaedic surgery refers to an automated Orthopaedic surgery carried out with
    the help of a programmable robot which accomplishes complex actions as instructed.
    The use of such advanced technology has been shown to improve surgical planning,
    the precision of implantation thereby enhancing patient satisfaction (Hernandez
    et al., 2017). Robotic surgery can involve varying levels of autonomy, from completely
    surgeon-controlled to more autonomous techniques, which can improve accuracy and
    precision (Hernandez et al., 2017), (D''Souza et al., 2019). Despite these advantages,
    the adoption of robotic and computer-assisted surgery has been hindered by factors
    such as high costs, limited accessibility, and a lack of robust evidence demonstrating
    its effectiveness over traditional methods (Hernandez et al., 2017), (Desai et
    al., 2023). The initial investment for robotic systems is substantial, and there
    is an ongoing debate about their cost-effectiveness in surgery procedures (Fiani
    et al., 2020). A comprehensive analysis by Ong et al. (2024) found that a novel,
    fluoroscopy-based robotic-assisted THA system was more cost-effective compared
    to manual approaches. However, the study also acknowledged the substantial annual
    expenditures required for robotic maintenance and operation. This suggests that
    to maintain cost-effectiveness, care providers must balance costs with high procedure
    volumes and improvements in postoperative outcomes. The survey conducted by Desai
    et al., 2023) within the Indian context highlighted that while there is a willingness
    to adopt robotic technology, the high installation costs and limited insurance
    coverage are significant impediments. Accessibility and training are additional
    barriers to the widespread implementation of robot-assisted procedures (Desai
    et al., 2023), (Fiani et al., 2020). The study by Bareeq et al. (2008) acknowledges
    the learning curve associated with minimally invasive and robot-assisted surgery
    and emphasizes the role of simulators in training novice surgeons. The development
    of these simulators allows for skill transfer without compromising patient safety.
    McDonnell et al. (2020) further elaborate on the need for appropriate training
    to use surgical robots effectively. They highlight the importance of training
    platforms to prepare surgeons for the era of robotic spinal surgery, addressing
    the training barrier. Furthermore, Casas-Yrurzum et al. (2023) introduced a mixed-reality
    tool that provides a novel approach to robot-assisted surgery training. The proposed
    tool offers an immersive and collaborative learning experience that can be very
    useful in addressing both accessibility and training challenges. 3. Methodology
    This study combines systematic review and meta-analysis for a thorough review
    of studies on the application of AI in Orthopaedic surgery. For the meta-analysis,
    we use Reference Manager v5.4 software. Reference Manager allowed for quantitative
    synthesis and statistical analysis of the data extracted from the systematic review
    to compare the findings between similar studies on AI applications in orthopaedic
    surgery. The systematic review methodology followed in this study is based on
    the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses)
    guidelines outlined by Moher et al. (2015). The organization of this section is
    summarized as follows. The research questions are first highlighted to elaborate
    on the motivation of this study. Then, the article search strategy and the number
    of related articles in different databases are summarized. The inclusion and exclusion
    criteria of the search are discussed in the last section. 3.1. Research questions
    This study aims to examine the research articles related to the application of
    AI during pre-operative, intra-operative and post-operative phases in orthopaedic
    surgery. As such, our research questions that focus on the AI applications crossing
    the three phases of surgery and the corresponding motivations for investigations
    are summarized in Table 1. Table 1. Research questions. Research Questions Motivation
    RQ1: How have the research trends in the main applications of AI in orthopaedic
    surgery evolved? Identify the specific surgical procedures within orthopaedics
    where AI has been applied. Examine the progression and emerging patterns in AI
    applications across various orthopaedic surgeries RQ2: What are the outcomes of
    AI-assisted surgery? Assess the outcomes of AI-assisted surgery in preoperative,
    intraoperative, and postoperative phases RQ3: How does the efficiency of AI-assisted
    surgery compare with conventional surgery? Determine how AI-assisted surgery can
    perform more effectively compared with conventional surgery. RQ4: How do the outcomes
    of AI-assisted surgery compare with conventional surgery? Understand whether AI-assisted
    surgery can provide better postsurgical outcomes to the patients than the conventional
    approach. 3.2. Database search strategy and selection We searched articles on
    the application of AI in Orthopaedic surgery from four databases namely, i) Web
    of science ii) IEEE Xplore iii) PubMed and iv) ScienceDirect. Search terms included
    “implant” or “prosthesis” with “surgery” and combined with “artificial intelligence”
    or “deep learning” or “machine learning”. Boolean operators (AND, OR) are used
    to generate various combinations of search queries for a narrower retrieval. Search
    syntax that generates the most relevant results was used. Furthermore, only search
    results related to the application of AI in implant surgery or prosthesis were
    considered. The articles were selected based on publications from January 2003
    to December 2023 to cover the past 20 years of relevant literature. This time
    frame was chosen to capture the comprehensive and most relevant and recent advancements
    in AI applications in orthopaedic surgery. 264 articles were found during the
    initial search of the four databases. Fig. 2 shows the number of relevant articles
    returned by the search queries from each of the databases. Download : Download

    of search results across databases. 3.3. Inclusion and exclusion criteria To focus
    our review on the most relevant studies, we established clear inclusion and exclusion
    criteria. We included studies on limb prostheses, specifically targeting upper
    and lower extremity prostheses, and excluded research on craniofacial prostheses.
    To encompass a comprehensive range of Orthopaedic domains, we included keywords
    such as “hip”, “knee”, “shoulder”, “ankle”, “hand”, “foot” and general procedure
    (“arthroplasty”). Furthermore, the types of surgery included are TKR, TKA, TSA,
    THA, and THR, as well as TJR and its revision surgery. Search terms such as (“implant”
    OR “prosthesis”) AND (“surgery”) AND “artificial intelligence” OR “deep learning”
    OR “machine learning”) were used for each database. However, the syntax of the
    queries used differs as per the convention of a specific database. The search
    results were further refined by excluding articles that are irrelevant to the
    chosen research topic. Table 2 gives a detailed summary of the search queries
    and results returned by each database. The following three-stage screening was
    used based on predefined eligibility criteria to filter out irrelevant studies.
    i. Identification: Initial articles were assessed for relevance to AI in Orthopaedic
    surgery, excluding unrelated fields. ii. Screening: Duplicate studies and those
    in irrelevant fields, such as ear or dental studies, were removed. iii. Eligibility:
    Articles were further screened to exclude studies on non-limb prostheses, like
    valve prostheses. Table 2. Search results obtained using selected keywords. Database

    3) 24 14 20 7 65 Included studies 16 8 12 5 41 For instance, research articles
    whose themes are not aligned with the underlying topic were filtered out during
    the first stage. As a result, 151 articles were excluded, retaining a corpus of
    113 articles. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
    (PRISMA) guideline was used to screen out irrelevant articles based on exclusion
    criteria which led to the selection of a corpus of 41 research articles as shown
    in Fig. 3. This was achieved through a three-stage screening process, each with
    specific exclusion criteria, as follows. Download : Download high-res image (396KB)

    based on PRISMA. 3.4. Data extraction and statistical analysiss Once the final
    set of articles was determined, we proceeded with the data extraction and statistical
    analysis. For the meta-analysis, weight calculations were performed using the
    inverse variance method (Borenstein et al., 2021). This approach assigns weight
    to each study based on the precision of its effect estimate, which is inversely
    proportional to the study''s variance. Studies with lower variance (and thus higher
    precision) are given more weight, as they provide more reliable estimates of the
    effect size. Thus, it can minimize the overall variance of the pooled effect estimate.
    The weight of each study is computed using Equation (1) using the inverse variance
    method (Doi et al., 2015). (1) where is the weight of the ith study and is the
    variance of its effect estimate. In the case of a random-effects model, the formula
    is adjusted to include an estimate of the between-study variance as presented
    in Equation (2). (2) The overall pooled effect size and its 95% confidence interval
    were then calculated, with the size of each study represented graphically by a
    box proportional to its assigned weight. We use Reference Manager v5.4 software
    for the meta-analysis and statistical synthesis. After the weight computation
    and overall synthesis of the effect sizes, the results of the meta-analysis are
    visualized using a forest plot. A forest plot is chosen as it allows for easy
    comparison across studies. For the assessment of diagnostic test accuracy, sensitivity,
    and specificity, the following formulas (Equations (3), (4), (5))) were applied
    (Campbell et al., 2015): (3) (4) (5) The sensitivity metric measures the ability
    of a diagnostic test to correctly identify a particular case or disease. Whereas
    the specificity metric measures the ability of a diagnostic test to correctly
    identify subjects without a case or disease. On the other hand, accuracy measures
    the overall correctness of the test (i.e., the test''s ability to correctly identify
    both cases and non-cases). 4. Results The following results illustrate the findings
    based on each research question. To better illustrate the results, the selected
    research articles were classified into three main groups: i) prediction of surgical
    outcome (preoperative), ii) diagnosis and classification (intraoperative) and
    iii) post-surgery analysis and patient satisfaction (postoperative). A systematic
    review approach is used to address the research questions on the main applications
    of AI in orthopaedic surgery and the outcomes of AI-assisted surgery. The findings
    are summarized in the table format. The meta-analysis is then used to address
    the other research questions quantitatively that determine the efficiency and
    performance of AI-assisted surgery compared with traditional surgery. 4.1. RQ1:
    how have the research trends in the main applications of AI in orthopaedic surgery
    evolved? To understand the progression of AI in orthopaedic surgery, we categorize
    its applications into three distinct surgical phases: preoperative, intraoperative,
    and postoperative (Table 3). Recent trends, as illustrated in Fig. 4, show that
    around 61% of the papers were published in the last 5 years, while around 39%
    of the papers were published in the preceding years. Despite the recent surge
    in AI-related research in orthopaedic surgery, less than 20% of papers published
    in the past five years have delved into robot-assisted surgery. This suggests
    that, while interest in AI applications has grown, the integration of robotics
    has not been a primary area of focus in recent studies. Table 3. Classification

    Examining the AI applications by surgical procedure provides additional insights
    into the areas of focus across the reviewed studies. Of the AI applications in
    the reviewed studies, Knee, and Hip surgeries account for about 55%, and 24.5%
    of the cases, respectively (Fig. 5). Download : Download high-res image (327KB)

    by the focus on surgical procedures. 4.1.1. Application in surgical outcome prediction
    Being able to accurately anticipate surgical outcomes is valuable for surgical
    planning, patient follow-up, counselling, and resource allocation. The review
    showed that AI has been widely implemented in the prediction of orthopaedic surgical
    outcomes. Multiple studies applied machine learning methods to forecast complications,
    revisions, pain, function, kinematics, and other outcomes after procedures like
    knee and shoulder arthroplasty. For instance, Callahan et al. (2019) used deep
    learning to predict hip replacement complications and revisions from electronic
    health records, achieving high accuracy. Kumar et al. (2020), predicted shoulder
    arthroplasty outcomes like range of motion and PROMS scores within 10–20 points
    of actual values. Other studies predicted surgical site infections, severe postoperative
    pain, walking limitations, and need for revisions following knee and hip surgeries.
    Area under the ROC Curve (AUC) ranged from 0.7 to 0.9 across studies, demonstrating
    promising capabilities of AI prediction.s. 4.1.2. Application in diagnosis and
    classification The application of AI shows promises for assisting with diagnosis
    and classification tasks in orthopaedic surgery using medical images. In this
    regard, several studies have developed AI systems that can accurately analyze
    radiographs and assist with clinical decision-making. Bier et al. et al. (2018),
    demonstrated a CNN model that could detect anatomical landmarks in pelvic X-rays,
    achieving a 5.6 mm mean error with synthetic images and successfully generalizing
    to real clinical pelvic X-rays. Additional research has shown deep learning can
    accurately identify implant designs and components in hip and knee radiographs.
    Borjali et al. (2020), developed a CNN model, specifically designed to identify
    total hip replacement prosthesis designs from plain radiographs. They demonstrated
    remarkable precision with 100% accuracy in classifying three common hip implant
    designs. Similarly, Kang et al. (2020) utilized a CNN to recognize implants, attaining
    over 99% accuracy in identifying hip arthroplasty components from X-ray images.
    Studies have also proven the viability of AI for fracture detection, with Olczak
    et al. (2017), developing a system comparable to human radiologists. They evaluated
    five deep learning networks on their ability to classify features such as fractures
    in extremities radiographs. They found the best-performing network achieved an
    83% fracture detection accuracy rate, on par with human radiologists. Beyond implants
    and fractures, Shah et al. (2020), illustrated how deep learning could diagnose
    prosthetic loosening from preoperative hip and knee images. They proposed a CNN-based
    approach to diagnose prosthetic loosening from hip and knee preoperative radiographs
    and accomplished an 88% accuracy rate. 4.1.3. Application in robot-assisted surgery
    The use of robotic systems for joint replacement procedures like total hip and
    knee arthroplasty shows the potential to improve the technical accuracy of surgery.
    Multiple studies have tested robotic platforms and found benefits in the precision
    of implant positioning and alignment compared to conventional manual techniques.
    For instance, Honl et al. (2003), and Kayani et al. (2019), showed that robot-assisted
    surgery resulted in better implant positioning and restored leg length equality
    closer to the plan. Other benefits of robot assistance reported in the studies
    included reduced variance in leg length fewer outliers in mechanical axis alignment
    (Nakamura et al., 2009), and better gap balance between flexion and extension
    (Song et al., 2013). However, tradeoffs exist such that robotic procedures take
    longer operative time in most studies (Honl et al., 2003). 4.2. RQ2: what are
    the outcomes of AI-assisted surgery? We conducted a meta-analysis of previous
    studies to determine the outcomes of AI-assisted surgery in preoperative, intraoperative,
    and postoperative phases. To predict the surgical outcomes in the preoperative
    phase, metrics such as accuracy (Beam and Kohane, 2018), and AUC (Devana et al.,
    2022) were used. Table 4 summarizes the outcomes of preoperative prediction as
    reported in studies. The meta-analysis showed machine learning approaches achieved
    high accuracy, with studies reporting precision up to 96.3% and AUC up to 0.75.
    Similarly, Callahan et al. (2019) implemented LSTM to predict complications and
    subsequent revisions in hip replacement surgeries achieving 96.3% precision. These
    findings underscore the potential of AI to enhance surgical planning and outcome
    predictions during the preoperative stage. Table 4. Outcomes in the preoperative

    4.3. RQ3: how does the efficiency of AI-assisted surgery compare with conventional
    surgery? In this section, the efficiency of AI-assisted surgery is compared with
    the conventional approaches. The efficiency is determined in terms of surgical
    time and complexity based on the number of complications. Among the different
    applications of AI to Orthopaedic surgery, robotic-assisted surgery was believed
    to provide better performance than conventional surgery leading to improvement
    in the accuracy of implant positioning. To further verify the improvement quantitatively,
    the meta-analysis was used to compare the time required for surgical operations
    and the degree of complications as the performance metrics. Oppositely, the conventional
    surgical approach took a shorter time than the AI-assisted approach in terms of
    surgical time, while there was no significant difference in terms of complication
    rate. Further investigation results are illustrated as follows. 4.3.1. Surgical
    time Several studies have compared the operative times of robot-assisted joint
    replacement surgeries, such as total hip and knee arthroplasty, with conventional
    approaches. For instance, studies by Cobb et al. (2006), and Domb et al. (2015)
    revealed slightly longer surgery times with a robot-assisted approach. However,
    in both cases, the differences in surgical times were not statistically significant.
    In contrast, Honl et al. (2003), and Kayani et al. (2019), found a more pronounced
    increase with robotic THA procedures. Honl et al. (2003), reported an additional
    25 min on average (107 min vs 82 min, p < 0.001) while Kayani et al. (2019), reported
    an increment by an average of 20 min compared to conventional jig-based TKA (p
    = 0.010). Lim et al. (2015), also noted a similar 25-min increase for robotic
    THA over manual rasping (103 min vs 78 min, p = 0.012). For a more comprehensive
    analysis, a meta-analysis of twelve randomized control trials was conducted to
    compare the surgical times of robot-assisted and conventional surgeries. Due to
    the high heterogeneity (I2 > 50%) between study results, we used the random effects
    model for the meta‐analysis. The forest plot in Fig. 6 illustrates the comparison
    of the surgical time. In the forest plot, a horizontal line that cut through the
    square for each study indicates the study''s 95% confidence interval. Studies
    with wider confidence intervals, indicative of less precision, contribute less
    to the overall meta-analysis result. Thus, they are represented by smaller squares.
    Conversely, studies with narrower confidence intervals were depicted by larger
    squares, highlighting their greater influence on the meta-analysis. Accordingly,
    the meta-analysis result shows shorter surgical time was required for conventional
    surgery compared with robot-assisted surgery with 95% CI [7.16–17.08] and p <
    0.00001. Download : Download high-res image (552KB) Download : Download full-size

    surgery. 4.3.2. Postoperative complications Evaluating the safety and efficacy
    of robot-assisted surgery, particularly in the context of postoperative complications,
    is crucial to its adoption in clinical practice. To investigate postoperative
    complications, we conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing
    robot-assisted versus conventional orthopaedic surgery. Ten studies were included
    that compared total hip, knee, or partial knee replacement using either robot-assisted
    or manual techniques and reported postoperative complication rates. For instance,
    Cobb et al. (2006), and Hansen et al. (2014) reported a slight increase in postoperative
    complications with robotic surgery compared to manual. Conversely, Lim et al.
    (2015), McCallum and Tokish (2016), and Bolam et al. (2022), reported minimal
    complications with robotic surgery. Other studies found no significant differences
    in postoperative complications between robotic and conventional surgeries (Kayani
    et al., 2019), (Song et al., 2013), (Guo et al., 2022). For the meta-analysis,
    we used the fixed effect model since the heterogeneity among the results of the
    studies was not significant (I2 < 50%). The results showed no statistical difference
    between the two approaches in terms of the number of complications with 95% CI
    [−0.03‐0.03] and p = 0.22, as shown in Fig. 7. The forest plot (Fig. 4) illustrates
    the risk differences from the included studies and the pooled effect. While a
    few studies reported slightly higher pain with robotic procedures, there were
    no significant differences in complications when compared to conventional procedures.

    RQ4: how do the outcomes and qualities of AI-assisted surgery compare with conventional
    surgery? We investigated whether AI-assisted surgery can provide better postsurgical
    outcomes to patients than the conventional approach. The outcomes of the robot-assisted
    and conventional surgeries were compared to determine any differences in efficacy.
    Performance metrics such as the knee society score (KSS), Western Ontario and
    McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), and range of motion (ROM)
    were used to assess the outcomes of each approach. 4.4.1. Knee society score (KSS)
    The KSS score is a commonly used scoring system used to evaluate the functional
    capacity and pain level of patients who have undergone knee surgery (Kang et al.,
    2020), (Cho et al., 2018). We examined several studies that used KSS a measure
    to evaluate the functional capacity and pain levels of patients post-knee surgery.
    Marchand et al. (2017), Schmitt et al. (2011) and Decking et al. (2023) observed
    no significant intergroup differences in postoperative KSS between robotic arm-assisted
    and manual total knee arthroplasty (TKA). This finding was consistent with results
    reported by Song et al. (2013), Ollivier et al. (2019) and Costales et al. (2020)
    and Scaturro et al. (2023). Although Mahoney et al. (2022) reported qualitatively
    greater KSS functional scores in the robotic-arm assisted TKA (RATKA) group compared
    to the conventional group, these differences were not statistically significant.
    Pang (Pang et al., 2011) showed statistically better KSS functional scores at
    6 months post-op compared to the conventional group. However, at 2 years post-operation,
    the difference in KSS functional scores between the computer-assisted and conventional
    groups was no longer statistically significant. Spencer et al. (2007) reported
    similar results at 2 years post-operation. A meta-analysis was also conducted
    to aggregate the data from studies comparing the Knee Society Score (KSS) outcomes
    of robot-assisted versus conventional knee surgery. We used the random effects
    model for the meta‐analysis since significant heterogeneity (I2 > 50%) among the
    study''s results was observed. Fig. 8 shows the Forest Plot which summarizes the
    KSS scores of robot-assisted knee surgery as reported in multiple studies. Each
    study is denoted by a point estimate and confidence interval, illustrating the
    individual and pooled effects. The result of the meta-analysis shows no significant
    difference (p = 0.14) in KSS scores between robot-assisted and conventional knee
    surgery. Download : Download high-res image (650KB) Download : Download full-size

    4.4.2. WOMAC index The WOMAC index is a widely used scorings system that measures
    the outcomes of a knee surgery along three dimensions: pain, stiffness, and physical
    function. The stiffness dimension measures the patient''s ability to move their
    knee without experiencing pain whereas the physical function measures the ability
    of a patient to carry out daily activities such as walking (Olczak et al., 2017)
    (Lacko et al., 2018). To assess the effectiveness of robot-assisted knee surgery
    compared to conventional methods, a between-group comparison was undertaken using
    the WOMAC Index Score across 12 trials (Fig. 9). Study results showed significant
    heterogeneity between with I2 > 50%. As a result, We used the random effects model
    for the meta‐analysis. Download : Download high-res image (615KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 9. Comparison of WOMAC score for outcomes of a knee surgery.
    Included studies reported several aspects of postoperative functional outcomes
    as measured by the WOMAC index. For instance, Cobb et al. (2006), reported no
    significant difference in WOMAC scores for pain, stiffness, and physical function
    between the two groups (p = 0.06). Similarly, in a study by Lim et al. (2015),
    no significant differences were found in postoperative WOMAC scores at 24 months
    (p = 0.301). Wong et al. (2019b), supported these findings, with no significant
    difference in functional outcomes, including WOMAC, between robotic-arm-assisted
    and conventional unicompartmental knee replacement. Moreover, Yang et al. (2017)
    in their 10-year follow-up study, did not detect significant differences in WOMAC
    scores between robotic TKA and conventional TKA (p = 0.12). Marchand et al. (2019),
    (Marchand et al., 2017), Seon et al. (2007) and Song et al. (2011) found similar
    results. Thus, the results of meta-analysis suggest that that there are no significant
    differences in terms of the WOMAC Index between the control group and the experimental
    group, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of [−2.10‐0.80] and a P-value of 0.38
    (Fig. 9). 4.4.3. The range of motion (ROM) score The ROM is another commonly used
    scoring system used to evaluate the degree of movements patients who have undergone
    knee surgery can attain (Pua et al., 2019). A comparison of 12 studies which have
    compared postoperative ROM in robot-assisted and conventional surgery was conducted.
    Multiple studies with long-term follow-up have found that robot-assisted knee
    surgery achieves comparable postoperative ROM results to conventional techniques
    (Cho et al., 2018), (Song et al., 2013), (Kim et al., 2020), (Jeon et al., 2019),
    (Yang et al., 2017), (Cip et al., 2018), (Liow et al., 2017), (Cho et al., 2019)
    (Park and Lee, 2007). Both surgical approaches demonstrated good ROM recovery,
    with final flexion and extension that were not statistically different. We used
    the random effects model for the meta‐analysis since significant heterogeneity
    with I2 > 50% was observed between the empirical results of the studies The result
    shows no significant differences in the ROM index between the control group and
    that of the experimental group (95% CI [−2.16 to 0.84], p = 0.39) (see Fig. 10).
    The results suggest that robot-assisted surgery has not yet shown definitive ROM
    advantages over conventional surgery based on current evidence. Download : Download

    of AI to transform orthopaedic surgery has been recognized in the past two decades.
    The review and meta-analysis demonstrated promising applications including the
    prediction of surgical outcomes in the preoperative phase, improved accuracy in
    diagnostic processes, and the facilitation of robot-assisted surgical procedures.
    The findings show that machine learning models were mostly used for the prediction
    of surgical outcomes in the preoperative stage while deep learning models were
    used for the diagnoses and classification of surgical operations. Several studies
    have used machine learning models and reported high accuracy in forecasting complications,
    revisions, pain, function, and other metrics (Callahan et al., 2019) (Devana et
    al., 2022), (El-Galaly et al., 2020). Some studies have also demonstrated AI''s
    potential for assisting diagnosis and classification reporting promising accuracy
    in analyzing radiographs to identify anatomy, and implants using medical images
    (Bier et al. et al., 2018), (Borjali et al., 2020), (Kang et al., 2020) (Honl
    et al., 2003), (Kayani et al., 2019), (Nakamura et al., 2009). The results suggest
    that AI has the potential to aid clinicians'' diagnostic capabilities if validated
    on additional real-world datasets. Although robot-assisted surgery was demonstrated
    to improve implant positioning and alignment in several studies, a meta-analysis
    of surgical times revealed longer times for robot-assisted surgery. This could
    be because surgeons may require substantial training to become proficient with
    robot-assisted surgery, as it is a relatively new technology. In addition, the
    technical difficulty of calibrating the robotic system can also contribute to
    a longer surgical time for robot-assisted surgery. A meta-analysis of the number
    of postoperative complications reveals no significant difference between conventional
    and robot-assisted surgery. This could be because different types of surgery operations
    often require a different level of skills on the part of surgeons, which may lead
    to inconsistent postoperative complications. The meta-analysis also showed no
    significant improvements for robot-assisted surgery in the postoperative stage
    for clinical outcome scores like WOMAC, KSS, and ROM (Kayani et al., 2019), (Song
    et al., 2013). However, continued monitoring is needed as the technology continues
    to evolve (Lim et al., 2015). The review and meta-analysis reported in this study
    have certain limitations. Firstly, this study considered a small number of studies
    (41 articles) which have met the inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis. The
    small sample size can have a bias on the statistical efficacy of the meta-analysis.
    Thus, more high-quality research studies are still needed to improve the overall
    evidence on outcomes of AI-assisted orthopaedic surgery and patient satisfaction.
    Secondly, in the current study, we have utilized expert judgment to evaluate the
    credibility of each study and to determine its suitability for inclusion. We gave
    appropriate weight to the findings from studies with robust methodologies during
    the synthesis of our meta-analysis results. Findings from robust studies were
    given precedence over those with questionable methods. However, incorporating
    a more standardized quality rating system would further enhance the results of
    the meta-analysis. To this end, future research will benefit from structured quality
    assessment protocols such as the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE)
    guidelines and the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool (Zeng et al., 2015) for a more rigorous
    and systematic evaluation of evidence quality. These approaches will help categorize
    the quality of studies and assess the risk of bias, thereby improving the reliability
    and credibility of study findings. Thirdly, future studies should focus on raising
    patients’ awareness of the potential benefits of the technology. Due to a lack
    of understanding of the potential benefits it brings, public awareness of the
    AI application is still low. As a result, the rollout of AI-assisted Orthopaedic
    surgery can be hindered. Therefore, future studies should investigate factors
    related to patient satisfaction. 6. Conclusion The application of AI spans multiple
    stages of surgical care, from preoperative planning to intraoperative navigation
    and diagnosis to postoperative monitoring. This study presented a systematic review
    and meta-analysis to investigate the role of AI in orthopaedic surgery and compare
    its efficacy with conventional surgery. Our findings indicate that AI has the
    potential to significantly improve surgical planning and outcomes, with high accuracy
    reported in predictive models and diagnostic classifications using medical imaging.
    However, while AI and robotic techniques show promise for improving orthopaedic
    surgery, definitive long-term clinical benefits over traditional surgical methods
    have yet to be proven. Furthermore, although current evidence does not suggest
    increased postoperative complications with robot-assisted surgery, continued monitoring
    is required as the technology evolves. The insights gained from this study are
    vital for informing clinical decision-making and to guide future research directions.
    The orthopaedic field must continue to investigate the potential impacts of AI
    to ensure tangible improvements in patient outcomes. Funding This research was

    Machining operations play a pivotal role in the manufacture of final components,
    whose outcome, depending on the machining conditions and strategies, can significantly
    influence the material’s functional performances [1]. On the other hand, their
    cost also counts a high proportion of the total manufacturing price. These machining
    outcomes and their cost, however, are mainly determined by the machinability of
    the materials. That is, with different materials, their inherent properties can
    influence the difficulty that the materials can be machined, and eventually yield
    different machining cost as well as surface integrity [2]. Hence, the materials
    machinability normally is one of the key factors that drive the final selection
    of cutting parameters, tools, and coolant applications. Furthermore, as more and
    more harsh application environments are required, new materials are being developed,
    which always accompanied with low machinability, namely difficult-to-cut materials.
    The high surface integrity requirement for these applications, on the other hand,
    drives the need of developing new machining technologies to address their low
    machinability [3,4]. Efforts have been made by both the academia and industry
    to investigate the relationships among the machinability, machining cost, machining
    outcome and their effect on product’s functional performance. The formal evaluation
    of machinability can be traced back to the earliest efforts of F.W. Taylor in
    the late 19th century. In his 1906 work ‘On the Art of Cutting Metals’ Taylor
    lays out the principles of parameter variation in order to obtain force and wear
    coefficients for empirical power law relationships [5]. Based on this simple,
    yet effective semi-empirical approach, subsequent work in the 20th century significantly
    expanded the approach towards comparing the relative machinability of different
    metal alloys, most commonly in terms of readily measured variables such as cutting
    forces, chip form, and tool wear/life. The early well-documented work can be tracked
    back to 1951 when Woldman and Gibbons published a well-known book on the machinability
    and machining operations of different metal alloys [6]. Thereby the machinability
    was surmised as the characteristics of metals such as hardness, strength, ductility,
    grain size, microstructure, and their chemical composition, upon their influence
    on the tool wear, chip formation, ease to cut and surface finish [6], [7], [8],
    [9]. In 1960 s Boulger et. al., also studied the machinability of a range of engineering
    materials such steels alloys [10], nickel and cobalt alloys [11] whereby their
    machinability has been well documented. The book by Mills and Redford in 1983
    [12] provides a range of practical machinability test whereby these machinability
    tests were subdivided into two basic categories: those which do not require a
    machining process to take place, and those which do. It implicates that in most
    cases there is no indication of the magnitude machinability because the measure
    of machinability does not correlate a predictable scale. An early paper by Fang
    and Jawahir (1994) also shows the deficiencies of current machinability criteria
    and emphasizing the need for total machining performance [13]. From Scopus search
    of the key word “machinability”, it can be seen that there is an increasing number
    of publications every year (>9000 up to now), as shown in Fig. 1, boosting up
    from 21-century. It is obvious much of the current practices in machinability
    are based on some of the major machinability criteria established and practiced
    for decades. Though many different researches/practices have been conducted to
    evaluate the machinability, most of them are addressing particular materials with
    different machining outcomes, and up to now, there is no complete and unanimously
    accepted definition of machinability concept existing, and so are the evaluation
    methods [14]. This is because, unlike most material properties, there is no generally
    accepted parameter used for the measurement of machinability [12]. Download :

    for assessment of cutting tools (IMPACT) To revisit the machinability and addresses
    the actual machining performance by a “machining system” (cutting tool; machine
    tool; and work material), professor Jawahir proposed a project for Collaborative
    Working Group (CWG), titled as “Integrated Machining Performance for Assessment
    of Cutting Tools (IMPACT)”. In this project, we aim to develop active research
    collaboration among academic researchers, cutting tool manufacturers and manufacturing
    organizations thus to uncover the machining “DNA” of cutting tools. Therein we
    developed five different research topics including the machinability evaluation,
    modelling of cutting tool performance, cutting tool engineered design, smart tooling
    and AI-based machining optimisation. This paper is one of the outcomes from CIRP
    CWG IMPACT project on conducting an extensive study to learn interacting machinability
    parameters to evaluate the overall (total) machining performance, i.e., topic
    A, contributed by a large number of CIRP and non-CIRP members who actively participated
    in the collaborative research activities of the CWG. 2. Concept and evaluation
    methods of machinability The concept of machinability is a generalized framework
    that attempts to quantify the response of a workpiece material to mechanical cutting,
    i.e., chip removal and surface generation. Traditionally, machinability was considered
    as a unique property of the work material, similar to mechanical properties such
    as yield strength and toughness. While there are some obvious correlations between
    a given work material’s yield strength, thermal conductivity, and propensity for
    strain hardening, any observed machining performance is a complex phenomenon that
    arises from the combined performance of a total machining system, such as workpiece
    and tool materials, process parameters, machine tool and fixture, as illustrated
    in Fig. 2. There are obvious limitations to improvements in machinability that
    can be obtained for a given workpiece material through optimization of cutting
    conditions. In practice, this means that even with careful optimization, the machinability
    of an easy-to-cut material, such as aluminium alloys, will be greater than that
    of a difficult-to-cut material, such as nickel-based superalloys. Nevertheless,
    machinability for a given material can be greatly influenced by factors such as
    the rigidity of the machining setup, tool coatings and cutting speed. Therefore,
    in addition to basic material properties, machinability necessarily includes the
    influence of factors related to the process parameters, including cooling/lubricating
    strategies, as well as the properties of the machine tool, fixture, and cutting
    tool. Download : Download high-res image (581KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Overview of Current State and Future Direction in Machinability
    Research [15], [16], [17], [18]. Fundamentally, the study of machinability attempts
    to quantify factors that influence machining performance, such as cutting mechanisms,
    and temperatures, in terms of process outputs, such as tool wear and life, forces,
    and quality metrics (e.g., surface finish and accuracy). For example, a machinability
    study may compare the relative performance of a number of different cutting tools
    or process parameters (feeds and speeds) to determine the tool-life and surface
    finish response against some baseline, such as a previously developed machining
    operation. Based on machinability data, optimization of machining performance
    can be pursued within the ‘machinability envelope’ of a given workpiece material.
    As there are many potential optimization objectives (metal removal, surface integrity,
    tool-life, etc.) and process parameters, such as cutting speed, feed, depth of
    cut, tool geometry and coating [19], coolants, tool holders, etc., a machinability
    evaluation effort will often yield a meaningful improvement in process performance.
    For this reason, the systematic and data-driven machinability approach has been
    the foundation for improved machining process performance in industry for over
    100 years. A variety of standards have been formulated to allow for relative comparison
    of the machinability of different workpiece materials. These include the widely
    used ISO 3865:1993 (single-point turning) [20] and ISO 8688–1/2:1989 (milling)
    [21] standards, as well as the simpler American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI)
    machinability rating {Institute, 1960 #4422}, which compares the relative tool-life
    (i.e., Taylor plot cutting speed) and surface finish in turning of various metals
    compared against a 100% baseline of AISI/SAE B1112 free machining carbon steel.
    Using the AISI standard, cast aluminium will exhibit a relative machinability
    of 450%, while the superalloy Hastelloy X only achieves a 19% machinability rating.
    Researchers realized early on that in general, a higher yield strength along greater
    ductility and strain hardening behaviour will reduce the machinability of a given
    alloy. In other words, Hastelloy X is expected to have much lower relative machinability
    compared to cast aluminium based on material properties alone. This reduced machinability
    generally exhibits itself in the form of increased cutting forces, less desirable
    chip form (e.g., continuous chips) and higher cutting temperatures, i.e., increased
    tool-wear at a given cutting speed. The latter behaviour of reduced tool-life
    due to increased thermo-mechanical loads on the cutting speed is typically regarded
    as one of the hallmarks of the concept of machinability, which attempts to generalize
    the ease with which a given material can be cut. Nevertheless, it should be noted
    that machinability is not a fundamental material property, but rather a complex
    assembly of specific behaviours (e.g., forces, temperatures, chip form, surface
    integrity, etc.) of the total machining system. When cutting a given material
    at increasing cutting speeds, there will be increased thermo-mechanical loads
    on the cutting tool. As increased cutting speeds are often the most efficient
    method of improve the overall machining performance, there is an ever-increasing
    need for improved cooling and lubrication. Consequently, studying the influence
    of coolants/lubricants on machinability has become a well-established means for
    improving machinability and today’s widespread use of cooling lubricants can be
    explained directly by the powerful impact of such metalworking fluids on improving
    machinability. Likewise, increasing use of super hard cutting tool materials and
    coatings, which offer improved ‘hot hardness’ to cut at ever increasing speeds,
    is motivated by the incentive to cut at more aggressive speeds and feeds, which
    offer greater profits and throughput. In some cases, dry or near-dry cutting may
    become possible with certain cutting tool materials and coatings, albeit with
    some negative influence on the workpiece material’s surface integrity due to the
    increased thermal loads on the machined surface. Overall, the key challenge associated
    with defining machinability primarily in terms of the response of the workpiece
    material is the fact that the total machining performance for a given cutting
    operation will always depend on the total machining system, i.e., the workpiece,
    cutting tool, coolant/lubricant, and machine tool, as shown in Fig. 2. Thus, comparison
    between machinability data sets is often difficult or impossible, as any change
    in the total machining system will substantially change the metrics used to define
    machinability (e.g., forces, chip form, tool-life, etc.). Researchers have long
    realized this, but even the most careful attempts to maintain consistency between
    different machinability studies (e.g., using the same machine tool/setup, coolant,
    etc.) are limited by a constant need to evaluate new tool geometries, coatings,
    coolants/lubricants, and machine tool and setup configurations. In this manuscript,
    we will attempt to provide an overview of the various approaches and metrics used
    to evaluate machinability. Our focus will be to provide a comprehensive overview,
    while also looking towards a more comprehensive approach to evaluating the total
    machining performance, particularly of cutting tools and their various design
    features (micro/edge geometry, chip breaker geometry, macro geometry, tool material,
    coatings, etc.). 3. Tool performance to evaluate machinability Tool wear and tool
    life are the most widely spread used criteria for the evaluation of the machinability,
    because they deliver measurable, quantitative information regarding the resistance
    of the material against machining. Even though, as already shown, machinability
    is a system variable of the machining process and a large number of factors could
    play a role, the relative comparability of tool wear under identical boundary
    conditions with a single variable (one factor at a time) is an established method
    for assessing the material-related machinability of different materials or, for
    example, the machinability of one material under different cutting values. The
    machinability of materials with different cutting materials can also be evaluated
    on the basis of wear and/or tool life. The latter term is often equated with wear,
    but tool life can also be dependent on other factors than tool wear, so that an
    explanation of the term follows first. 3.1. Introduction – What is tool life?
    Tool wear is defined as a continuous loss of material on the tool leading to a
    change in micro- and macro-shape. Due to the extensive thermomechanical and tribological
    load in the chip formation zone tool wear is a result of several superimposed
    mechanisms like abrasion, adhesion, diffusion and tribochemical reactions. In
    addition to these four mechanisms, which are commonly addressed in the literature
    of machining processes, the tribological science defines surface fatigue as a
    further wear mechanism [22] This results in different forms of wear like flank
    wear, notch wear, crater wear [23], oxidation [24], crack formation [25], plastic
    deformation [26] and build up layer/edges [27] occurring on the tool surfaces
    which are in contact with the workpiece or the chip. The most frequently characterized
    wear parameters are the width of flank wear land and the crater wear depth on
    the rake face [28]. Based on the identified tool wear, an analysis of the tool
    life can be performed by defining a quantitative limit value for the wear parameters.
    As soon as the wear parameter is exceeded, the tool life ends. The wear parameter
    can also be characterized by a quality feature on the workpiece side, such as
    the diameter or roundness (in turning or drilling) or the surface quality [29],
    as well as a process parameter like a force or the spindle power [30]. Furthermore,
    few researchers developed a mathematical model based on machining mechanics and
    dynamics to predict cutting forces to estimate surface integrity, which is highly
    dependent on progressive tool wear [31,32]. Similarly Shekhar et al. proposed
    tool tip dynamics for the machining process [33]. Kumar et al., [34] introducing
    rolling motion at the tool tip via a rotating roller establishes rolling-sliding
    contact, reducing chip thickness and plastic strain versus fixed sharp or blunt
    edges. Generally, the tool wear progression has normally three stages, namely,
    initial, stable, and severe wear, which eventually leads to the end of tool life.
    Low machinability of a material normally leads to high tool wear rates and thus
    low tool life. Therefore, using tool life for machinability evaluation became
    one of the most common practices in both academia and industry. 3.2. Tool life
    as an indicator for machinability Davim identifies tool life as the most important
    indicator for machinability [35]. This motivates to compare the tool life of diverse
    studies. However, this is complicated due to several factors. First of all, there
    are various variables that can be used to characterize tool life: the main time
    in which the tool was used for cutting [36], the cutting path that could be reached
    before the tool life criterion was exceeded [37], the number of cuts for interrupted
    cutting [38], the number of bore holes [39] or the volume of the removed material
    [24]. Mills and Redford developed a concept to get a comparable measurand for
    the tool life as an indicator for machinability by introducing the 60-minute tool
    life cutting speed. They tried to correlate such value to different properties
    of the machined material like chemical composition, microstructure or physical
    properties [40]. With this investigation they were not able to find a good definition
    of wear dependent machinability and concluded that the investigational effort
    is quite high. Therefore, they changed their basic idea and conducted accelerated
    wear tests, with which they tried to define the machinability as a property of
    the workpiece material by rapidly wearing tools through very high cutting speeds
    and using the resulting wear as a measure of machinability. This concept is very
    weak because it does not take the cutting conditions into account and uses parameters
    above the working area of the tools and is therefore not transferable to practical
    applications [35]. Based on a similar idea, Wang et al. developed a criterion
    especially for super alloys: the cutting speed at which the tool failure mode
    changes from uniform tool wear to sudden tool breakage [41,42]. As an alternative
    concept for machinability characterisation, Liu et al. introduced the tool life
    reliability, which is a quantity to describe how large the probability of the
    tool failure is after a certain cutting length. An exemplary course of the tool
    life reliability can be seen in Fig. 3. This approach might be suitable for making
    tool life investigations more comparable but requires a great effort in terms
    of experimental design and evaluation [23]. Download : Download high-res image

    life reliability as a function of the tool life time [2]. Moreover, the different
    types of wear forms and quantities to characterise them which are used throughout
    the literature make it difficult to compare investigations regarding the tool
    life-based machinability evaluation. Beside the most frequently used quantities
    to characterise wear like flank wear land width and the crater wear depth, the
    length of notch wear [43], the tool diameter of rotationally symmetric tools [44],
    the cutting edge radius and the weight loss of the tool is used to characterize
    tool wear [45]. It can be assumed that the tool life assessment is different when
    looking at flank wear than when analysing crater wear on the rake face. Some studies
    even use the tool life only as a qualitative factor for machinability by comparing
    photographs of the tools [46]. Another aspect when using the tool wear and tool
    life as an indicator for machinability that needs to be taken into account is
    the level of the tool life criterion. For the same material this value can differ
    significantly. Dadgari et al. defined flank wear land width VB = 37.5 µm as the
    tool life criterion when micro-milling Ti6Al4V with a tool diameter of dt = 1 mm
    and an axial depth of cut ap = 0.1 mm [45]. Bouzakis et al. used a larger tool
    and a 20 times higher axial depth of cut ap = 2 mm and defined VB = 150 µm as
    the tool life criterion for milling the same material [38]. According to the larger
    tool, the tool life criterion was increased. However, it does not increase to
    the same extent as the size of the axial depth of cut is enlarged from one case
    to the other. While the latter was increased twentyfold, the tool life criterion
    was only increased fourfold. The choice of a suitable value for the tool life
    criterion therefore depends not only on the dimensions of the tool and the uncut
    chip cross-section but also on various factors such as the tolerances of the workpiece
    quality and is difficult to compare from case to case. Due to the large number
    of possibilities for selecting the boundary conditions for tool life investigations
    to evaluate machinability, comparability of different studies is limited. Within
    individual test series, however, tool wear or tool life offers a sensitive and
    validly evaluable criterion for comparing the machinability of different materials.
    Thus, Abouridouane et al. could demonstrate, that even alloys from one single
    group of materials can significantly differ in their machinability, like shown
    in Fig. 4a). For this purpose, the machinability of three different widely used
    ferritic-pearlitic steels was investigated by comparing the flank wear in twist
    drilling experiments. Compared to 27MnCr5, drilling of C60 lead to 43% higher
    flank wear after the same number of bored holes [47]. Based on a similar research
    hypothesis, Lalbondre et al. used standardized tool-life tests referring to ISO
    3685:1993(E), in which they compared the machinability of the bearing steels AISI
    51,100 and AISI 52,100 [48]. Even though the two alloys have a quiet similar chemical
    composition, the tool life for the same cutting speed in case of AISI 52100 only
    extents to approximately the half of AISI 51100 [49]. Even the content of a single
    alloying element can lead to relevant and nonlinear impact on the machinability
    of a material, like Geng et al. descript with the results of a machinability evaluation
    of 4Cr16Mo depending on the copper content within the alloy. They could show,
    that the flank wear is in general lower for the same cutting conditions, if copper
    is added to the alloy. But, this effect is not linear and even reverses when the
    copper content is increased from 1.4 wt% to 1.9 wt% [50]. Finally, the details
    of heat treatments can result in significant differences of the machinability.
    Hoseiny et al. investigated the influence of the martensitic packet size on the
    machinability of hardened steels, which depends on the heat treatment. The results
    show a general trend, that finer packet sizes lead to a longer tool life due to
    reduced mechanical loads on the tool. When the cutting speed is increased, the
    differences in tool life for the different states of heat treatment decrease,
    since the temperature in the cutting zone enlarges and consequently the tool properties
    become the more important influencing factor on the wear induced machinability
    of the materials [51]. Songmene et al. demonstrated that such significant influence
    of material properties on the tool life related machinability of steels can be
    compensated by the process conditions. Like shown in Fig. 4b), the differences
    in tool life of four tool steels which arise in dry milling, are nearly not measurable
    when conducting wet milling with the same parameters [48]. In addition, Magalhães
    et al. [52] investigated on dry turning AISI 1045 steel revealed feed as the governing
    factor influencing surface roughness, with cutting speed having minimal impact.
    Flank wear progression above 0.1 mm however accentuated roughness twofold. While
    micro-hardness reduced slightly, the alloy microstructure showed no detectable
    defects or cracks even after 35 min of machining at 275 m/min. Hence, dry steel
    turning with cermet inserts proves viable for tool life and surface quality sustainment.

    in a single group of materials [47], (b) influence of fluid application in machinability
    [48], (c) comparing machinability of steel with aerospace alloys [38]. Corresponding
    differences within a group of materials also occur in other classes of materials.
    Nayyar et al. compared the machinability indicated by the tool life for different
    graphitic cast iron grades for different continuous machining processes. This
    study showed that while the machining of Compacted Graphite Iron and Spheroidal
    Graphite Iron materials led to edge chipping on the tools after less than ten
    minutes of use, the Pearlitic Flake Graphite Iron did not lead to any significant
    tool wear even after 20 min [53]. Also in case of aerospace alloys the tool wear
    behaviour of different alloys can significantly differ. In this context, Parida
    and Maity fundamentally compared the machinability indicated based on different
    tool life criterions of three different nickel base alloys for room temperature
    and hot machining. With the help of flame heating, the authors set different initial
    workpiece temperatures of T = 300 °C and T = 600 °C. For all investigated materials
    the chip-tool contact length was significantly enlarged by the increasing temperature,
    which lead to an increase in tool life. This effect differs for the three alloys.
    While the temperature raise from T = 300 °C to T = 600 °C results in nearly a
    doubling of the tool life for Inconel 625 und Inconel 718, the effect for Monel
    400 is negligible [45]. Olovsjö and Nyborg were able to identify a similar relationship
    when comparing different nickel-based alloys with varying grain sizes. As shown
    in Fig. 5a), the resulting tool wear when machining these materials under the
    same boundary conditions can be more than doubled by changing the microstructure
    [27]. In case of titanium alloys, also the route of material production shows
    impact on the tool wear behaviour: Sun et al. compared the machinability of forged
    and powder metallurgical (PM) Ti6Al4V based on the flank wear and the crater wear
    behaviour. Independently from the cutting speed, the PM material entails lower
    tool wear and thus higher tool life. This circumstance is attributed in particular
    to voids located on the underside of the chip, which reduce adhesive wear and
    tool temperatures, resulting in longer tool life overall [54]. Download : Download

    machinability of aerospace alloys: (a) tool wear can be more than doubled by changing
    the materials microstructure [27], (b) tool wear changes at varying cutting speed
    [55]. Especially for machining aerospace alloys, the machinability in form of
    tool life is very sensitive to the cutting speed and the resulting tool temperatures.
    Therefore, this factor has often be taken into account in machinability evaluation
    experiments. So Armendia et al. (see Fig. 5b) referred to the flank wear as an
    indicator for machinability when comparing the two titanium alloys Ti54M and Ti6Al4V
    for a varying cutting speed. While the wear of both materials were very similar
    for cutting speeds of vc = 60 … 80 m/min, it drastically increased for Ti6Al4V
    and only slightly for Ti54M at a cutting speed of vc = 90 m/min [55]. In course
    of a production cost calculation, Priarone et al. investigated the tool life as
    a function of the cutting speed for Ti6Al4V and Ti-48Al-2Cr-2 Nb. The tool life
    range, which could be realised for Ti6Al4V for cutting speeds in the order of
    vc = 100 m/min could only be reached for Ti-48Al-2Cr-2 Nb, if the cutting speed
    lied below vc = 40 m/min [56]. Carvalho did investigations on similar interactions
    for two engine valve steels in the course of a machinability evaluation, where
    the tool life in form of removed material before reaching a certain criterion
    for flank wear was used. The results illustrate, that not only the absolute value
    of removed material for each single alloy varies depending on the cutting conditions
    like rake angle, cutting speed and cutting fluid distribution, but also the difference
    between the two materials does. These studies prove the strong influence of the
    cutting speed on the machinability of hard-to-machine materials [57]. All above
    discussed studies illustrate, that machinability evaluations even within one single
    group of materials is important for the targeted planning of cutting processes.
    Beside this, researchers have conducted tool life-based machinability evaluations
    to compare totally different workpiece materials. Klocke et al. conducted experiments
    on the machinability of 42CrMo4 +QT and Ti6Al4V depending on different positioning
    strategies of coolant nozzles. They identified significant differences for the
    two workpiece materials. First, machining of 42CrMo4 +QT resulted in vast notch
    wear, which did not appear for Ti6Al4V. Moreover, the cooling nozzle orientation,
    which resulted in the highest notch wear when machining the steel material, lead
    to the lowest tool wear in case of the titanium alloys. This illustrates the complex
    interactions of different influencing factors on the machinability analysed by
    evaluating tool wear behaviour [58]. In a similar approach Nath et al. investigated
    the tool life as a factor for the machinability for a stainless steel and two
    nickel-base alloys with the help of milling experiments. Depending on the cutting
    conditions, cutting the stainless steel leads to 7–10 times higher tool life compared
    to the superalloys. The authors elaborate that this does not mean, that the cutting
    values cannot be higher by the same factor, since wear does not increase linearly
    with uncut chip thickness and cutting speed [59]. Different materials therefore
    differ not only fundamentally in terms of machinability, but also in the way certain
    influencing factors change it. In the context of comparing the machinability of
    different types of materials, fiber composites should also be mentioned, as these
    can be made from diverse materials. Fig. 6 shows two examples of how much the
    machinability of composites varies depending on matrix alloy and reinforcement
    properties under the same boundary conditions with respect to the machining process
    [60]. Download : Download high-res image (302KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 6. Tool life related machinability of composite materials [60]. While
    the studies discussed illustrate that tool life is fundamentally a well-suited
    parameter to characterize the machinability of a material and should always be
    considered in comparative studies and process planning due to its sensitivity
    to the material properties, the results of these studies have also shown that
    the tool life is subject to a large number of influences. The choice of boundary
    conditions for a study has already been discussed. In the next chapter, it will
    be discussed in detail that the tool life and thus the machinability are by no
    means pure material properties and that they are subject to a multitude of technological
    influences. 3.3. Challenges in tool life based machinability evaluation The most
    common description of the machinability evaluated by tool wear is the Taylor equation.
    It calculates the tool life Tc as a function of the cutting speed vc scaled by
    a factor C (1) [5]. (1) Although this describes the tool life exclusively as a
    function of the cutting speed and all other influences are averaged in the scaling
    factor, it is still frequently used today. In fact, the validity was never proofed
    for state of the art tool materials like carbide and cutting speeds higher than
    25 m/min [35]. In the last decades of research on tool wear behaviour in machining,
    many factors which significantly influence tool wear and life have been identified
    and investigated. For example, Basset et al. illustrated how the uncut chip thickness,
    the cutting speed, a tool coating and a preparation of the cutting edge affect
    the tool life when machining AISI1045. Within this investigation the tool life
    varies between less than one minute and more than 20 min [37]. This multitude
    of influencing factors brings with it the necessity of an extended tool life-machinability
    consideration. In order to be able to develop such a consideration, the broad
    field of influencing factors presented in the literature is briefly discussed
    below. Due to the large number of publications on this topic, no comprehensive
    coverage can be claimed. Rather, the aim is to highlight the most important influencing
    factors on the basis of a selection of high-quality references. 3.3.1. Influence
    of workpiece properties on machinability As discussed in the previous chapter,
    in the classical definition of machinability, the workpiece strength is the central
    quantity which is considered to compare different cases [28]. On side of the workpiece
    properties there are a plenty of other factors which influence tool wear and tool
    life and thus the machinability. One important factor is the microstructure of
    the material. Machinability is for example determined by grain size [27], composition
    of the inclusions [61] and changes in the microstructure, which are induced by
    the cutting process [62], like conversion of austenite to martensite when cutting
    austempered ductile iron [63]. Moreover, the thermal properties of the materials
    have a significant influence on the machinability [64]. Beside the mechanical
    and thermal properties of the workpiece material, the chemical behaviour is of
    central importance for the tool wear. Thus, it is a major obstacle to productivity
    that tool wear in machining of ferrous materials with diamond tools leads to thousands
    times higher wear rates compared to machining of other material groups with comparable
    strength [65]. The reason is chemical wear due to the affinity of the diamond
    to iron [66]. A suitable choice of orientation of the diamond in relation to the
    direction of loading during machining can enlarge the machinability of ferrous
    and single crystal SiC materials in precision diamond turning [67,68]. In the
    tool life-based machinability analysis of advanced materials such as composites,
    additional influencing factors like matrix alloy [60], type of reinforcing material
    [69], reinforcement volume fraction [70] and particle size of reinforcement [71]
    must be taken into account. Fig. 7 summarizes the workpiece-related properties,
    which influence the tool life-based machinability evaluation. Download : Download

    of the workpiece influencing the tool life as an indicator for machinability [27],
    [72], [73]. Contrary to the historical definition of machinability, it is obvious
    that tool life as a tool-related target value depends essentially on the properties
    of the tool. First of all, the choice of tool material has a major influence on
    tool wear. Not only if high speed steel (HSS), which only stands a few millimetres
    of cutting path when machining titanium [74], and polycrystalline diamond (PCD),
    which is the hardest known substance, is compared. Even inside a single group
    of cutting materials like cemented carbide, the tool life can differ up to ten
    times under completely identical boundary conditions [35]. 3.3.2. Influence of
    cutting-edge treatment on machinability Moreover, the tool coating has a significant
    impact on the wear behaviour of the tool. On one hand the type of coating [75]
    and its wear related properties like the temperature dependent critical impact
    force [76] fundamentally influence the tool wear and thus the machinability. On
    the other hand it is remarkable that also the coating application process [76],
    the detailed structure of multi-layer systems [77] and texturing of coatings [78]
    as well as the pre- and post-treatment of the tools and layers [79,80] influence
    the tool life in a considerable manner as well. In addition to the substrate and
    coating properties, the cutting edge micro shape has a significant influence on
    the wear behaviour and tool life and therefore on the machinability. As a general
    correlation it can be claimed that compared to a sharp tool a rounded cutting
    edge has an enlarged tool life which is justified by the higher mechanical stability
    and the more uniform temperature distribution [81]. In addition to the size of
    the rounding, its orientation [82] and a local adjustment of the rounding´s size
    [83] also affects the wear behaviour of the tools. Similar to the positive influence
    of coatings on the machinability, the intensity of the cutting edge shape-effect
    on tool life depends not only on the final shape, but also on the preparation
    history [38]. Another method of cutting edge treatment proposed by Cristian et
    al. [52] utilizes drag finishing, where SiC and Al2O3 abrasive mixes demonstrate
    that factors like plunge depth and drag time critically govern edge rounding levels.
    Meanwhile, positioning angle and depth impact uniformity across broaching tool
    teeth. In summary, drag finishing enhances broaching performance through predictable
    edge tuning superior to traditional blasting processes, with notable surface roughness
    improvements. To further enhance stability in robot-assisted machining, Guo et
    al. [84]designed an innovative milling cutter that regulates the contact force
    between the robot and workpiece to sustain stability during the milling process.

    measured by the tool life, are compiled in Fig. 8. Download : Download high-res

    the tool life as an indicator for machinability [24], [36], [80], [82], [83],
    [85], [86]. 3.3.3. Influence of cutting fluid on machinability Beside the workpiece
    and the tool, the properties of the process significantly influence the tool life
    of cutting tools as an indicator for machinability. These influences are mainly
    based on the thermomechanical load spectrum, which depends on the process parameters.
    The cutting values like the cutting speed and the uncut chip cross-section [87]
    are the most important influencing variables and at the same time a measure of
    the economic efficiency of the process. Moreover, the cooling-lubrication concept
    fundamentally determines the machinability. While dry machining has become the
    state of the art for many materials [88], the use of cutting fluids is indispensable
    to reach an acceptable machinability when machining of difficult-to-cut aerospace
    alloys [64]. In this case sustainable cooling-lubrication concepts like minimum
    quantity lubrication (MQL) quickly reach their limits and cannot provide sufficient
    machinability. Accordingly, energy- and cost-intensive cooling concepts such as
    flood cooling, high-pressure cooling or cryogenic cooling are necessary when machining
    difficult-to-machine materials in order to keep tool wear controllable and thus
    enable economical machining [89]. Such cooling concepts can be extended by process
    control strategies like discontinuous drilling [90] or vibration cutting [91,92],
    which improve the cooling performance. It is noteworthy that the influence of
    the cooling lubricant concept depends on the evaluated wear parameter. Machai
    and Biermann, for example, were able to show that CO2 cooling compared to an emulsion
    can significantly reduce the flank wear during the turning of Ti-10 V-2Fe-3Al,
    but that notch wear is even completely prevented [43]. Pereira et al. [93] paired
    cryogenic cooling with MQL (CryoMQL) to enhance the machinability of difficult-to-cut
    alloys like AISI 304. Based on the experiments results of CryoMQL improved cutting
    tool life and enables higher cutting speeds in comparison to dry machining. CryoMQL
    also improved surface finish and forces relative to standalone cooling or MQL
    alternatives. In addition, Pereira et al. [94,95] proposed an innovative nozzle
    which delivers a hybrid cooling system, which combines CO2 cryogenic and MQL.
    The main objective of MQL+CO2 machining is to minimize or eliminate mineral oil
    emulsions, creating an eco-friendly and cost-effective process, which achieves
    machining performance over wet machining. Given the effectiveness and environmental
    benefits, MQL+CO2 systems have strong potential for hard-to-machine aerospace
    titanium alloys and hardened bearing steels [94,95]. Further, cryogenic cooling
    with MQL lubrication using CO2 as an internal coolant improved tool life when
    milling Inconel 718 compared to conventional emulsion coolants, demonstrating
    technical and environmental benefits [96]. How appropriate cooling strategies
    are used to increase tool life and thus improve machinability is detailed in section
    7.1. Another basic approach to increase tool life and improve machinability by
    modifying the process is the targeted heating of the workpiece material. However,
    such an approach requires proper calibration with regard to the workpiece temperatures.
    If these are set too high, the additional thermal load on the tool can lead to
    an increase in wear compared to conventional machining without external heating
    [97]. Fig. 9 illustrates the different influences of the process properties on
    the tool-life measured machinability. Download : Download high-res image (625KB)

    In summary, the discussion of machinability with regard to the tool clearly shows
    the complex and superimposed causes of tool wear and how differently sensitive
    tool life reacts to individual influencing variables, depending on the other boundary
    conditions. The multitude of correlations discussed in this section reveals that
    tool life as an indicator of machinability requires a holistic view of the machining
    process. This approach must include the influences of the workpiece properties,
    the tool properties as well as the process parameters in order to obtain a reliable
    assessment of the tool life. In particular, this also means that in comparative
    studies on tool life within single publications or across the boundaries of several
    papers, the documentation and presentation of all relevant boundary conditions
    is of central importance. In the sense of comparability of the investigation results,
    the parameters for quantifying the tool life as well as the tool life criteria
    must also be selected on the basis of scientific considerations. 4. Cutting force
    and temperature to evaluate machinability Cutting force and temperature, as direct
    process outcomes in machining, are also widely used as the criteria for the evaluation
    of the machinability. In general, the more difficult to machine of the material,
    the higher cutting force and temperature will be generated in machining process.
    However, as they are also significantly influenced by the complex interactions
    between the tool-workpieces, e.g., cutting parameters and fluid usage, evaluating
    the materials machinability based on cutting force and temperatures has to be
    considered under particular circumstance. 4.1. Cutting force and torque for machinability
    evaluation Machining processes can lead to high process forces, which can limit
    the machinability. The origin of process forces can be described based on the
    shear zones of the cutting process (Fig. 10, Fig. 11, Fig. 12). In the primary
    shear zone, the actual separation process of the chip takes place. Thus, process
    forces arise to overcome the shear strength of the material. The chip that slides
    along the rake face (secondary shear zone), leads to additional friction forces.
    Moreover, elastic-plastic deformations occur on the tertiary shear zone at the
    flank face and the cutting edge rounding, which lead to ploughing forces. Download

    When it comes to the evaluation of machinability, the cutting forces are one of
    the most common mechanical criterions in a qualitative [102] and quantitative
    [14], [103], [104] way. The correlation between cutting forces and machinability
    has been investigated in many cases, for example by comparing the machinability
    of different steels. Thereby, a higher process force is associated with a reduced
    machinability. Another mechanical parameter, which is used to evaluate machinability,
    is the spindle torque [105,106]. In general, a high correlation between spindle
    torque and process forces exists [105]. The torque is therefore a suitable alternative
    value for assessing machinability. However, the underlying reasons for limits
    in machinability due to mechanical loads / cutting forces can be diverse. For
    example, the machinability can be limited by machine limits [107], high stresses
    on the cutting tool [108] or unfavourable loads due to the chip formation process
    [109]. Thus, a more differentiated view on cutting forces to evaluate machinability
    is necessary. In the following, three aspects of process forces that limit the
    machinability are discussed in more detail. First, the relation between local
    loads and machinability is discussed. Thereafter, the influence of the overall
    process forces is evaluated. Finally, the impact of dynamic cutting forces on
    machinability is presented. The overall process force depends on a high number
    of factors, e.g. process parameters, material, tool geometry, and can be modelled
    as the result of uncut chip width b, uncut chip thickness h and empirical values
    (e.g. specific cutting force Kc1.1 and exponent mc). One of the most common process
    force models is the model by Kienzle [110]. The cutting force can be calculated
    as (2) The relationship of the cutting force model shows that an increase of feed
    f and depth of cut ap leads to an increased cutting force. The specific cutting
    force Kc1.1 are, however, known from literature for most materials and therefore
    can give a good initial estimation to assess the general workability of different
    materials. The specific cutting force can be used as rough estimation of the local
    loads. Therefore, specific forces were already used in several publications to
    assess the machinability of different materials, e.g. titanium [104], cooper [111]
    or tungsten carbide [112]. For a more differentiated view on tool wear, the stresses
    acting on cutting tool can be utilized. Cutting edge failure occurs when the local
    stresses exceed the strength of the tool material [108]. Consequently, higher
    stresses reduce the machinability. The stresses on the cutting edge are thereby
    mainly influenced by the workpiece material and the cutting edge rounding, Fig.
    10 [108]. In general, a higher tensile strength of the workpiece material and
    a lower cutting edge rounding increase the tangential stresses and thus lead to
    a reduced machinability. The determination of local stresses is thereby associated
    with a high experimental effort. Early attempts to determine the local stress
    distribution was to use photoelastic tool material [113,114]. However, the results
    are not quantitatively transferable to other tool materials. Further experimental
    methods to identify local stresses are the split tool [115,116] and the reduced
    contact length [117,118], which both require an extensive tool preparation. In
    addition to the relationship between process forces and shape of the uncut chip
    shown before, the process forces are also dependent on the cutting speed. For
    increasing cutting speeds, a decrease in cutting force is found [119], [120],
    [121], which is attributed to changing tribological conditions and thermal softening
    effects. Amor and Suter also indicate changing chip formation with increasing
    cutting speeds [119], [120], [121]. Based on the comparison of the different materials
    in Fig. 12, it can be said that high process forces are often related with hard-to-cut
    materials. Nevertheless, the reduction of process forces due to high cutting speeds
    as indicated in Fig. 11 is unusable in most cases since the thermal loads increase.
    Due to machine tool limits, the process forces can limit machining performance
    and machinability [122]. In heavy machining operations, the power limit and torque
    of the spindle, which are the result of the cutting forces, are the main limitation
    in productivity [107]. Furthermore, high process forces can lead to tool extraction
    [123]. However, those limitations are based on limits of the machine tool and
    not the cutting process itself. Another important aspect when evaluating process
    forces in terms of machinability is the dynamic behaviour of the cutting forces.
    When built-up edges occur, the process forces in general decreases. Nevertheless,
    due to the dynamic load on the cutting wedge and the poor surface finish, the
    machinability can be classified worse [124]. Negative effects on machinability
    are also known by segmented chip formation due to the high fluctuation on cutting
    forces [125] and specific cutting forces [109]. These considerations are currently
    not taken into account when evaluating machinability based on the process forces.
    Finally, it can be said that the overall cutting force is especially associated
    with machine tool limitations. For a tool wear related evaluation, local parameters,
    e.g. local stresses or specific cutting forces are more suitable to assess the
    machinability. However, dynamic chip formation effects, e.g. built-up edges and
    segmented chip formation, strongly influence machinability and cutting forces
    and are currently not considered when evaluating the process forces in terms of
    machinability. 4.2. Cutting temperature for machinability evaluation The heat,
    generated during cutting operations, affects the chip formation mechanics, the
    contact friction, the tool wear mechanisms, the tool life, the surface finish
    and integrity as well as the machined tolerances. Therefore, the knowledge of
    the heat partition and the temperature distribution in machining is an important
    issue to evaluate machinability. In geometrically defined machining, the biggest
    proportion of the introduced mechanical power is converted into thermal energy.
    According to Schmidt and Shaw, a smaller proportion of the mechanical energy results
    in structure transformation of the workpiece material [126,127]. Also, Bedekar
    et al. reported phase transformation and grain refinement next to thermal energy
    in hard-turning [128]. Temperature measurement in metal cutting has been studied
    with a wide variety of techniques [129]. However, measuring cutting temperatures
    accurately during machining operations is challenging due to the small size of
    deformation zones. Temperatures decrease rapidly within a small distance from
    the cutting tool edge, hence obtaining reliable data is difficult. In this regard,
    various empirical, numerical and analytical modelling approaches have been developed
    to predict the cutting temperatures at different shear zones [130], [131], [132],
    [133]. In general, the same as cutting force, heat sources in the contact zone
    of tool workpiece and chip are classified in a primary, a secondary and a tertiary
    shear zone [134]. These average shears of the total induced heat and the heat
    dissipation according to Kumar and Ajay [135], Shaw [127] Komanduri [136] are
    summarised in Fig. 12. Although the cutting heat distributions in chip, cutting
    tool and workpiece have not come to a consensus, a large amount of total cutting
    heat flowing into chips has been recognized as a main reason leading to a relative
    low temperature on workpiece surface. Due to the adjacent heat source of the primary
    shear zone, a large portion of the heat of approx. 70 - 90% is dissipated through
    the chips, while approximately 10 to 30% go into the workpiece and the tool [126,127,135].
    Vieregge has shown that the exact distribution of the heat quantity depends on
    the process variables, the manufacturing process as well as the tool-workpiece
    combination and thus cannot be generalised [137]. The results of Abrao and Aspinwall
    suggest that the overall temperature increases with the cutting speed, feed rate,
    depth of cut, and tool wear, and an increase in the thermal conductivity of the
    tool material causes an elevation in the temperature of the cutting tool and a
    reduction in the temperature of the chip when cutting hardened bearing steel [138].
    For low conductivity materials that means more heat is transferred into the tool
    and less into the workpiece or chip [136], [139], [140]. This is also shown in
    the thermographic measurements from Armendia et al. in an orthogonal process during
    machining of Ti-6Al-4 V compared to 42CrMoS4 [141]. Comparable results are also
    given by the calorimetric measurements by Schmidt, in which the heat distribution
    between chip, tool and workpiece is significantly dependent on the thermal conductivity
    of the material pairings and the cutting speed [126]. These schematic dependency
    of the thermal properties of the workpiece material is shown in Fig. 13. First,
    it can be seen that measured temperatures in the cutting zone significantly vary
    over the cutting speed. Secondly, it can be seen that materials with low capacity
    to take up heat e.g. TiAl6V4, lead to high temperatures in the cutting zone, whereas
    materials like the aluminium alloy AlCu4PbMgMn lead to moderate temperatures even
    at high cutting speeds and therefore high induced thermal energies into the material.
    These high portion of heat induced into workpiece and chip enables the dissipation
    of thermal energy from the direct machining zone and therefore limit wear phenomena
    and thermal induced material changes like oxidation or thermal induced residual
    stresses. Download : Download high-res image (85KB) Download : Download full-size

    speed after [108], [125], [138], [142], [143], [144]. For the classification of
    machinability mostly wear and cutting forces are used. Most studies rely on a
    supporting role of temperature measurements. The temperature is often used only
    for materials that result in high thermal wear. For example, Kikuchi used overall
    temperature directly to assess machinability [145]. The study investigated the
    machinability of two commercial titanium alloys (Ti–6Al–4 V and Ti–6Al–7 Nb) and
    free-cutting brass using the cutting temperature. The metals were slotted using
    carbide square end mills under four cutting conditions. The cutting temperatures
    of Ti–6Al–4 V and Ti–6Al–7 Nb were significantly higher than that free-cutting
    brass resulting in lower machinability. This result coincided with the relationship
    of the magnitude of the cutting forces measured in a previous study as well as
    with the tool life indicating a better machinability for low temperature conditions
    [146]. Eric and Nedic introduced a machinability index to evaluate machinability
    based on investigations on artificial thermocouples when machining steel of various
    hardness. The machinability index is defined as quotient of the measured temperature
    of the reference material to the material investigated in percent [147]. This
    index enables the investigation of the influence of technological parameters like
    machining regime, tool material, cutting geometry, hard layers etc. on cutting
    temperature and can be used to determine and compare the machinability of materials
    [148]. Even though there are only few studies that evaluate the machinability
    based on cutting temperature, there are a lot of investigations that correlate
    the cutting temperature with challenging cutting conditions and tool wear. Ueda
    et al. investigated the temperature on the rake face of a chamfered CBN cutting
    tool used on hardened steels of various compositions and hardness [143]. There
    findings indicate that an increase in material hardness leads to significant increase
    in temperature accompanied by a doubling of the flank wear and cutting forces
    when turning AISI1045. This is supported by investigations of Mozammel and Nikhilshowing
    the material hardness influences cutting temperature for dry and wet cutting conditions,
    due to an increased restraining force caused by the increased material hardness
    [149]. This means that the higher hardness leads to higher temperatures and a
    reduced machinability. Various studies have shown that in particular an increase
    of the cutting speed during machining has a great influence on the increase of
    the deformation rate and the converted power, leading to increased temperatures
    [150], [151]. In most cases, this changes the material behaviour in the shear
    zone and leads to an often unfavourable change in chip formation [152], [153],
    [154], e.g. a segmented chip formation. It can be summarized, that temperature
    is a limiting factor for cutting speed in many materials, leading to increased
    tool wear and thus tool failure [129]. The main reason for these problems is that
    the temperature increases asymptotically with cutting speed approaching the workpiece
    material melting temperature [155]. High temperatures also favour the progress
    of chemical and diffusive wear on the cutting tool [156]. Temperature increase
    accompanying with tool wear can also influence the workpiece quality, which is
    commonly used to evaluate machinability. With increasing tool wear, the friction
    between the workpiece surface and the tool flank increases and the heat generated
    in this area becomes more pronounced. As a result, the total cutting energy increases
    and the temperature of cutting edge rises [157]. Consequently, the influence of
    the temperature on the surface layer of the workpiece becomes significant. The
    temperature is closely related to the integrity of workpiece surface such as residual
    stress, hardness, and surface roughness [158], [159], [160], [161], [162]. Umbrello
    reported white layer formation shaped by thermally induced stresses when machining
    [163]. This effect is more dominant in case of machining low conductivity materials
    like Ti6Al4V. For this kind of materials, the temperature distribution is more
    concentrated in a narrow area near the tool tip [141]. Therefore, the temperature
    in the cutting zone can limit the part quality for difficult to cut materials.
    Tanaka el. Al. showed that a low conductivity of the cutting tool as well as high
    wear leads to increased temperatures on the cutting edge and therefore a reduced
    surface integrity. This highlights the critical role of temperature regulation
    during machining operations. Besides the numerous negative effects of cutting
    temperatures on machinability, for materials with low heat penetration coefficients,
    the tendency to thermal softening and therefore a reduction in process forces
    can be achieved [121]. In this context, the temperature can be used to evaluate
    the thermal softening and thus the machinability of specific materials to optimise
    cutting conditions. This effect is used among others in high-speed machining,
    as well as thermal assisted machining which will be commended in section 7. 4.3.
    Combination of cutting force and temperature for machinability evaluation In principle,
    high temperatures are a factor that have negative influence on machinability and
    can be used to evaluate machinability. However, because of the complex measurement
    technology and the positive effects of temperature due to the thermal softening
    effect, for example in hot machining, it is more common to use cutting forces
    and wear for the evaluation of machinability [164]. In addition, the temperature
    itself is not directly of economic relevance, but influences relevant factors
    like tool wear and surface quality. Therefore, to increase productivity and reduce
    wear, coolants are excessively used, to be able to machine at higher cutting speeds
    and consequently higher thermal loads [165]. As temperature and cutting forces
    are mostly used in combination to evaluate machinability, those dependencies are
    summarised in Fig. 14. In this way, it is possible to indirect connect the impact
    of workpiece material properties on machinability by observing cutting force and
    temperatures. Download : Download high-res image (107KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 14. Material classification according to machinability [108,142,143].
    It can be seen that the resulting temperature at the cutting zone depends on the
    thermal effusivity of the machined materials. Consequently, titanium alloys and
    Inconel 718 have a low ability to dissipate heat from the contact zone by the
    chips in comparison to AISI 1045 or aluminium alloys. Here, the capability of
    the material to take up heat leads to lower temperatures in the contact zone and
    reduce thermal induced wear phenomena. For materials with low heat penetration
    coefficients, thermal induced wear rates result in increasing wear of the cutting
    edge in form of flank and crater wear. In addition to the thermal properties,
    most materials with low thermal conductivity also have high tensile strengths.
    As also shown in in Fig. 13 and summarised in Fig. 14, high tensile strength leads
    to high stress values on the cutting edge in machining of those materials. Therefore,
    the general machinability of materials can be classified by evaluating temperature
    and cutting forces. On the one hand, good machinability for materials with high
    thermal conductivity and lower tensile strength, which lead to low cutting forces
    and lower temperatures in the machining process, are classified by slow wear rates,
    indicated by the green zone in the Fig. 14. On the other hand, difficult to machine
    materials like TiAl6V4 with high tensile strength and low thermal conductivity,
    lead to high thermomechanical loads and therefore increased wear rates, which
    influence the workpiece surface properties. These materials are in the red zone
    in the Fig. 14. 5. Influence of chip form and breakability on material machinability
    5.1. Influence of chip formation mechanisms on material machinability: principles
    Every machining process is based on the separation of chips from the workpiece
    (Fig. 15a). The cutting edge penetrates the material and shears it over the ‘primary
    shear zone’. When the maximum shear stress of the material is reached, it begins
    to flow. The emerging chip is deformed elastically and plastically, and it flows
    off over the rake face of the cutting edge: this area of deformation is called
    the ‘secondary zone’. The ‘tertiary zone’ describes the friction area between
    the flank face of the tool and the new surface [166], [167], [168], [169]. The
    existence of a chip can be divided in chip formation and flow, chip breakage,
    and chip disposal [170,171]. Overall, chips with different properties result.
    The type of chip formation strongly depends on the material properties. Nevertheless,
    it can change while varying process parameters, lubrication/cooling conditions,
    cutting tool material and geometry[168,172]. The properties of the chip have a
    significant influence on the machinability criteria, such as tool wear, cutting
    force and surface quality/integrity[166]. Download : Download high-res image (539KB)

    and breakability, according to [170], [173]. (pictures are adapted from [167,168,174]).
    The chips can be classified by their microscopic structure related to the type
    of chip formation or their appearance, which means the chip shape [166], [168],
    [169], [170]70,172]. According to Fig. 15b, the four types of chip formation are
    the continuous chip (1), the lamellar chip (2), the segmented chip (3) and the
    discontinuous chip (4), where the segmented chip can be considered as a special
    case of the lamellar chip. Continuous chips result under steady conditions when
    cutting ductile materials like pure copper (i.e., when the degree of deformation
    in the share plane is ε0 < εB). The material is evenly deformed under uniform
    friction conditions. In contrast, lamellar chip formation occurs when εB < ε0
    < εF or the present friction conditions between the tool and the emerging chip
    change fast (stick-slip effect). Lamellar chips are characterized by the appearance
    of areas with locally enhanced structural deformations which are defined as ‘(adiabatic)
    shear bands’ [168,175,176]. Shear bands are formed as a result of thermo-plastic
    instability. Under certain conditions, thermal softening dominates over mechanical
    hardening and the originally uniform deformation is suddenly concentrated in a
    small area [177], [178], [179], [180]. This happens during machining of high-strength
    materials with good deformability, especially when high cutting speeds are applied
    [175,176]. Segmented chip formation occurs under comparable conditions when the
    shear strength of the material is exceeded, following chip segments are detached
    and fusing again (εF < ε0). Segmented chip formation further appears as a result
    of deformation induced embrittlement of the microstructure. Discontinuous chips
    form when no plastic deformation takes place before fracture which happens mostly
    when cutting brittle materials like cast iron or titanium aluminides [168,181].
    Machinability is strictly correlated to the chip shape and chip formation mechanism,
    as detailed in Section 5.2 for the most common workpiece materials. Moreover,
    in the industrial practice, chips are usually classified on the basis of their
    macroscopic shape [172,174]. One possible classification of the chip form is shown
    in Fig. 16. To achieve reliable machining processes with high levels of productivity,
    chip control is mandatory. It includes efficient breaking and effective removal
    of the chips. The chip shape determines how effectively the chips can be evacuated
    from the cutting zone and out of the working area of the machine tool. Unfavorable
    chip forms lead to unplanned interruptions of machining processes for manual chip
    removal by the machine operator, which inhibits the automation and subsequent
    digitalization of processes. Lack of chip control can further lead to degradation
    of part quality, as well as rapid tool wear and catastrophic tool failure [170].
    In addition, estimating the temperature generated during machining in the tool
    and formed chip is very essential in order to eliminate progressive tool wear
    and obtain good surface integrity [182]. Download : Download high-res image (142KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 16. Chip shapes according to [168]. Three
    causes of chip breakage can be distinguished based on the stage of chip existence
    at which breakage occurs, as shown in Fig. 15c. A primary chip breakage happens
    in the stage of chip formation due to low ductility of the machined material.
    Chip breakage in the chip flow stage is specified as secondary chip breakage when
    it is caused by low fracture resistance of the chip. Tertiary chip breakage is
    induced by collisions of the chip with the tool, workpiece or other external objects
    [174]. The handling of the chips during disposal can be evaluated by means of
    the chip volume ratio RZ. This value represents the ratio of the bulk chip volume
    to the removed material volume. Long ribbon chips lead to high ratios of RZ > 100,
    small chip segments show ratios of RZ < 10 [183]. How the chip curls when is no
    longer in contact with the rake face depends on multiple conditions of the cutting
    process [171]. 5.1.1. Qualitative Metrics Chip morphology has long served as a
    valuable qualitative indicator for machinists to gauge the performance of cutting
    processes, especially for steels. Decades before quantitative sensors, experienced
    operators intuitively inferred the machining state from visual and tactile chip
    characteristics. In addition to chip morphology, monitoring chip color provides
    valuable real-time assessment of cutting temperatures, as color directly indicates
    heat generation during shear and friction, influenced by parameters like speed,
    feed, depth of cut, and workpiece thermal properties [184]Color gradients from
    blue/purple to yellow/brown signify rising temperatures from oxidative reactions.
    By comparing chip colors to established thermal ranges, operators can prevent
    defects like tool wear or metallurgical changes. Strategically selecting conditions
    to control temperature, aided by the visual feedback of chip color patterns, is
    thus critical for maintaining surface integrity. Taylor’s tool life model relates
    cutting variables to wear rates (see equation 3) [185]. Taylor’s pioneering tool-life
    tests linked incipient tool failure to a transition from continuous to discontinuous
    steel chips. Integrating such quantitative prediction models with expanded chip
    colour databases can enable adaptive control of speeds for optimal tool life.
    Beyond temperature, colour also signals issues like built up edge from adhered
    work material. (3) Where is the exponent related to the tool and work pieces;
    is the feed per tooth; and are the exponents depends on what materials for the
    tool and work pieces; is the depth of cutting, and is the constant. The color
    spectrum follows principles of metal oxidation - blue and purple chips indicate
    temperatures up to 500 °C from high speeds and loads. Balancing heat input by
    adjusting conditions based on colour is thus key for machining quality surfaces.
    The chip colours blue and purple shades warn of undesirable effects like work
    hardening or crack initiation on the cutting tool. Colour gradients hence serve
    as early indicators of unsuitable conditions before visible tool damage. Prompt
    parametric corrections can thus improve process performance. Korkut et al. [186]
    demonstrate how feed rate, cutting speed, and depth of cut influence cutting temperatures.
    Slower thick blue chips imply higher forces and poor evacuation. Optimised machining
    hence produces efficient thin chips. Other studies by Cook, Wright, and Armarego
    established that steel chips turn bluish or straw-colored at low speeds due to
    strain hardening and improper heat dissipation. Bright yellow chips indicate suitable
    25–100 m/min speeds for medium carbon steels. Higher speeds produce darker yellow
    to brown chips associated with excessive temperatures softening the material.
    The inclusion of interactive colour-feed matrices into existing tool life models
    would facilitate automated adaptive control for optimal parameters. Overall, chip
    colour provides a visual metric to gauge temperature, identify improper conditions,
    adapt speeds, prevent tool damage, and maintain surface finish and accuracy [187].
    Problems like inadequate coolant or lubrication also manifest as color changes
    in steel chips. Flood cooling is critical for regulating interface temperature
    and flushing away hot debris. Insufficient coolant flow rates directly contribute
    to thermally dominant machining where chips and workpiece surface turn blue due
    to temper colors. Similarly, low lubrication deprives the cutting zone of critical
    boundary layer protection, accelerating tool wear, and temperature rise. This
    manifests again as blued chips with oxidized segmented edges, signaling dysfunctional
    lubrication. Overall, qualitative analysis via physical chip examination forewarns
    operators about suboptimal speeds, cooling, or lubrication well before quantitative
    sensor detection or product inspection. However, qualitative reliability depends
    heavily on consistent operator background and experiences for accurate inference.
    Enabling automated quantitative monitoring of chip traits like color, shape, and
    surface textures can potentially boost the value of morphological analysis. An
    overview concerning the correlation between chip morphology, breakability and
    machinability of the main material groups of engineering interest is given in
    Table 1, and further detailed in the following. The order of the sub-sections
    is based on the typically-occurring types of chip formation, from continuous to
    discontinuous, according to Fig. 15b. Table 1. Effects of chip formation on machinability

    mechanisms strongly depend on chip groove geometry, cross section of the (un)deformed

    is usually limited by the intended use of the workpiece to be produced[168]. Chip
    shape varies largely depending on process conditions and microstructure resulting
    from the heat treatment[168] One possibility to improve machining is to carry
    out the roughing operation before the material is quenched and tempered[168].
    Chip shape depends more on microstructure (heat treatment) than on alloy content[168]

    Hardened Steel (> 50 HRC) Mostly segmented (saw tooth) chips are formed[198],
    [199], [200], [201] Material hardly deformable due to martensitic structure[198],
    [199], [200] High dynamic stresses on cutting tool can induce surface crumbling
    and formation of cracks in cutting tool[198], [199], [200], [201] Material separation
    begins with formation of cracks on the surface of the workpiece → segment pushed
    out between rake face and crack → next crack develops before material gap is closed
    → segments remain connected[198] High levels of mechanical and thermal load on
    workpiece surface[198], [199], [200], [201] Strain hardening → induces residual
    compressive stress, which grows further below surface with increasing flank wear
    on cutting edge[198], [199], [200], [201] Titanium alloys Lamellar chips are typically
    expected when machining under conventional cutting conditions [168] Alternation
    of compression and sliding phenomena in the shear zone during chip formation results
    in mechanical and thermal alternate load to the cutting tool[168] Stress state
    can lead to tool fatigue and tool failure due to the formation of cracks and fractures
    of the cutting tool edges, coupled with evident negative effects in terms of part
    surface quality[168]. Extent of load is related mainly with the choice of process
    parameters and cutting conditions. Chip breakage by applying targeted high-pressure-cutting

    Chip separation is oriented towards lowest resistance in the material→ graphite

    Influence of chip formation mechanisms on material machinability: case studies
    5.2.1. Copper alloys Copper and its alloys are frequently used for applications
    in electronic, automotive and sanitary industry. In these cost-sensitive markets,
    a high degree of automatization is favored in machining. Therefore, chip evacuation
    is critical. Different materials are included in the group of Copper alloys, which
    are characterized by a copper content of at least 50%. Overall, the machinability
    is affected by their chemical composition, heat treatment, and primary shaping
    processes. Klocke (see [168], and references therein) has proposed the following
    categorization in three groups with respect to their machinability: • Group 1:
    Alloys with the addition of elements as lead, sulfur, selenium and tellurium to
    improve chip fracture/breakage: this group is likely the most machinable. • Group
    2: Alloys with zinc, tin, nickel, aluminium and silicon, without chip-breaking
    additives (among others: copper/tin/zinc and copper/nickel/zinc alloys): the machinability
    might vary significantly as a function of the amounts of alloying elements. Usually,
    acceptable chip forms are obtained; • Group 3: Pure copper and copper alloys with
    zinc (i.e., brass), tin, nickel and aluminium appear to be moderately to poorly
    machinable. In particular, brass and pure copper show a high chip compression,
    which affects the tribology at the interface between chip and tool rake face,
    resulting in high mechanical stresses on the cutting edge; The content of lead
    in brass alloys will be drastically reduced in the near future due to changes
    in legislation, shifting the needs of these industries from group 1 to group 3
    [224], [225], [226], [227]. Therefore, intensive research is performed regarding
    the development of low-leaded materials with improved machinability, especially
    regarding chip formation [188]. The brass alloy CuZn21Si3P uses Silicon as a substitute
    for lead and has gained some relevance in industrial applications today. Alloyed
    in brass, Silicon forms the highly brittle intermetallic κ- and γ- phases which
    provides segmented chip formation in machining. Other materials utilize so-called
    micro-alloys with traces of Indium in heterogeneous brass alloys to provide improved
    chip breakage in machining [188], [190]. Bismuth has very similar properties regarding
    machinability as lead while being harmless to the human body. Its broad industrial
    utilization as a chip-breaking alloy is prevented by its high cost and the deterioration
    of CuZnBi-alloys under continuous load [188]. 5.2.2. Aluminium alloys The chip
    morphology and chip formation mechanisms are key parameters for the machinability
    assessment of aluminum alloys, particularly when large amounts of chips have to
    be removed at high MRRs. The chip form can be influenced by the alloy composition,
    heat treatment and process kinematics. Due to the described effects of very long
    chips on machinability in combination with the frequently very high material removal
    rates in aluminium machining, the process conditions should be optimized with
    regard to chip breakage. The influence of cutting conditions on chip formation
    has been investigated in recent research studies. Orthogonal cutting tests performed
    on the 6061-T6 aluminum alloy under a wide range of cutting speed (100–1900 m/min)
    and feed (0.06–0.15 mm/rev) produced different kind of chips [228]. When increasing
    the cutting speed, the shear slip distance and shear angle increased, while chip
    thickness, friction angle, length of shear plane, tool-chip contact length and
    first deformation zone width decreased [229], [230]. The increase of tool-chip
    contact length was noticed when increasing cutting depth and feed rate in high-speed
    dry milling of A6061 [231]. With regard to the 7050-T7451 alloy, both cutting
    speed and feed rate are factors affecting the transition from continuous to segmented
    chip, which was observed for high cutting speed (2000–2500 m/min) in the feed
    rate of 0.05–0.20 mm/tooth [232]. Further, Guo et al. [233] investigated high-speed
    grinding of Al/SiCp metal matrix composites shows improved surface quality and
    reduced subsurface damage compared to low-speed grinding due to grain refinement
    mechanisms in the Al matrix and increased ductility of SiC particles, which reduces
    property discrepancies between the heterogeneous constituents. Moreover, chip
    formation, breaking and removal appears to be a challenging issue when drilling
    multi-layered material structures (e.g., aluminium and titanium stacks), because
    of the different material properties [234]. 5.2.3. Steel materials Steel materials
    cover a wide range of material properties due to the variety of formable alloys,
    metallographic constituents and different applicable heat treatments. Table 1
    shows an overview of the influences of chip formation and morphology on machinability
    for different steel materials. Due to the adjustable properties, it is often possible
    to achieve favorable chip formation through an adapted design of the material.
    When machining steel materials in the uninterrupted cut, the focus is more on
    the macroscopic chip shape than the chip formation mechanism when evaluating machinability.
    Steel components are often produced automatically and in large quantities. Therefore,
    reliable chip breaking and chip evacuation are a basic prerequisite for efficient
    machining [168]. Nevertheless, many research works have been carried out on the
    influence of the chip formation mechanism on machinability. Hoppe [176] showed
    that the chip formation mechanism influences the resultant force when machining
    the heat-treatable steel ALSI1045. The force components changed with the cutting
    speed, which was caused by differences in chip formation, the temperature in the
    cutting zone and the material properties at high strain rates. An increased cutting
    speed transferred the type of chip formation from continuous to segmented chip
    formation and lead to a decreased resultant force. As the mechanisms that lead
    to reduction of the resultant force did not change when the type of chip formation
    changed, the chip formation mechanism was excluded as the cause for the force
    reduction at this point. With a further increase of the cutting speed to 3000 m/min,
    the resultant force raised up back to values which were measured at low cutting
    speeds. Mechanisms like adiabatic shearing or melting of areas in the chip or
    at its bottom, which cause instabilities, gained significance. The remaining material
    of the lamella has to carry the load. The material is deformed slightly but fast
    in this area, which leads to high strength as a result of its strain sensitivity.
    Therefore, the strain sensitivity was identified as a reason for the increased
    resultant force. 5.2.4. Titanium alloys When machining titanium alloys, both the
    chip formation mechanism and the resulting chip shape are reasons for the poor
    machinability of the material. Due to the material properties of low thermal conductivity
    and high strength, a distinct lamellar chip formation occurs and long chips result
    in an uninterrupted cut (see Table 1). Chip shape and size are significantly affected
    by the choice of process parameters and, more in general, cutting conditions.
    In dry and cryogenic Ti-6Al-4 V turning, increasing depth of cut and decreasing
    feed rate reduced chip thickness, distance between serrations and tool-chip contact
    length, while increasing chip length and shear band angle. Moreover, the degree
    of chip segmentation and dominant deformation modes and amount are affected by
    the extent of tool wear, due to the change in tool geometry and the increase in
    cutting temperature. Dry turning of Ti-6Al-4 V with worn tools is characterized
    by severe friction between the rake face and chip, significant plastic deformation
    and shear on the machined surface in the chip [235]. When milling, a full characterization
    of the complex three-dimensional chip morphology, possibly including the analysis
    of microstructural and mechanical behavior of machined chips, can be performed
    through multi-view approaches [236]. Further, Pouliquen et al. [237] found that
    α phase fraction controls forces and chip morphology in machining titanium alloy
    Ti5553. Lower α fractions facilitate continuous chip flow while higher levels
    promote shear localization and serrated chips. Denkena et al. [238] showed oxygen
    reduction minimizes Ti-6Al-4 V chip segmentation by mitigating oxidation and enabling
    continuous chips. Li et al. [239] used simulation to elucidate segmentation dependence
    on parameters in Ti-6Al-4 V turning. Lv et al. [240] experimentally studied adiabatic
    shear in milling Ti40. Additively manufactured titanium alloys pose machining
    challenges with morphology variations relative to wrought alloys [241], [242],
    [243], [244]. Feed rate plays an essential role governing chip shape in different
    processes. Fracture behavior and hardness primarily influence machinability of
    AM vs wrought Ti-alloys. Optimizing cutting conditions is key to improve surface
    integrity of AM Ti-alloys. 5.2.5. Nickel-based alloys Due to their excellence
    corrosion resistance and high temperature strength, aero-engine components are
    often manufactured from nickel-based super alloys. A particularly common alloy
    is Inconel 718 (NiCr19NbMo). The characteristics of the mostly lamellar or segmented
    chip formation during machining the material are one main reason for its classification
    as difficult-to-cut, see Table 1. Therefore, the chip formation mechanisms and
    machinability of nickel-based alloys have been addressed in numerous research
    papers and reviews [64], [207], [208], [210], [245], [246]. As shown in Fig. 17a,
    the segmentation intensifies with increasing cutting speed until individual chip
    segments result[204]. During the accumulation of the chip lamella a transverse
    material flow results, Fig. 17b [205]. The type of chip formation leads to a high
    alternating thermal and mechanical stress on the cutting tool. As a result, fatigue
    and crack development phenomena follow [247]. The combination of the material’s
    tendency to work harden and the formation of lamellar chips leads to the formation
    of a sharp, hard sawtooth-shaped chip edge which causes abrasive wear on the cutting
    tool when the chip flows off [168,210]. These interactions lead to the formation
    of severe notch wear during turning of Inconel 718 with ceramic, CBN or solid
    carbide tools. Additionally, the chips flow laterally in emerging notches and
    intensify the wear development by mechanical snagging with the cutting tool material
    particles. Furthermore, the dynamic load on the cutting edge as a result of the
    lamellar chip formation contributes to the fact that milling of Inconel 718 is
    subject to strong restrictions with regard to the cutting parameters [168,207].

    Fig. 17. Chip formation of Inconel 718 according to [204], [205]. By changing
    the cutting conditions, the macroscopic chip shape differs significantly. With
    increasing cutting speed, chip compression decreases, which influences the resulting
    chip shape. Pawade and Joshi [206] showed a transition from long snarled to spiral
    chips by increasing the cutting speed from 125 m/min to 475 m/min during turning
    of Inconel 718. Similarly, strong changes in chip shape occurred with the variation
    of the feed rate, the depth of cut or cutting edge rounding. Thermal effects further
    affect the resulting chip form when the feed rate is varied, as the feed rate
    determines how much heat can be dissipated by the chip into the environment. Process
    conditions, which resulted in spiral chips, lead to lower surface roughness than
    processes which emerged snarled ribbon chips. 5.2.6. Grey Cast Iron Cast iron
    materials are iron-carbon alloys with a carbon content of more than 2.06%. They
    are divided into grey and white cast iron, related to the color of their fractured
    surfaces. The carbon in grey cast iron is present in the form of graphite. Referring
    to the shape of the graphite particles a subdivision into three groups is common:
    lamellar graphite (GJL), vermicular graphite (GJV) or spheroidal graphite (GJS).
    Cast iron with lamellar graphite is the most frequently produced group [168].
    The basic structure of the materials is ferritic-pearlitic or purely pearlitic.
    By specific heat treatment, more ductile austenitic-ferritic microstructures with
    increased strength can be achieved [248]. Ausferritic cast iron with lamellar
    graphite (AGI) and with spheroidal graphite (ADI) belong to this group. Cast iron
    generally has good machinability. However, the characteristics of the chip formation
    process depend strongly on the graphite shape and the structure of the surrounding
    matrix [213], [215], [217], [219]. The shape of short chips, as is typical in
    cast machining, is basically favorable for machinability (see Fig. 15). However,
    the segmented or discontinuous chip formation mechanisms present certain challenges.
    Graphite lamellae with a size in the range of the chip thickness are relevant
    for the discontinuous chip formation when machining GJL [213]. Micro cracking
    is induced near the graphite lamellae due to stress concentration. The chip separation
    is oriented towards the lowest resistance in the material, which is the graphite
    lamellae [218]. Entire lamellae can slide off [215]. As a result, the material
    may be partially separated in the workpiece surface, which leads to surface damages
    and high surface roughness [215], [218]. If irregular fracture occurs, the tool
    moves over a free space until the separation of the next chip fragment is induced
    [217]. By adjusting the cutting conditions, a transition of the chip formation
    from discontinuous to segmented chip formation can be achieved [213]. The chip
    formation characteristics for machining GJL, GJS, GJV, ADI and AGI (here labelled
    according to the normative references) are listed in Table 1. Chip formation during
    the machining of cast materials is dominated by the shape of the graphite inclusions
    and affects the machinability of the materials. The significantly better surface
    quality that can be achieved when machining GJS than GJL, for example, is attributed
    to chip formation. To evaluate the machinability of grey cast iron and to determine
    the influence of the chip formation mechanism on the machinability, the matrix
    structure has to be taken into account. 5.2.7. Titanium aluminides The issues
    related to the complex machinability of titanium alloys are exacerbated when it
    comes to titanium aluminides, which are heat resistant intermetallic alloys that
    have been identified as potential candidates to substitute nickel-based superalloys
    in some aerospace applications. The material properties lead to the formation
    of discontinuous and segmented chips [168]. Angular, needle-shaped chip lamellae
    are often formed [222] (see Table 1). Moreover, it has to be highlighted that,
    differences in machinability outcomes can be traced back to the different chemical
    composition (thus, to the different microstructures) of the titanium aluminides
    [249], [250], or to the manufacturing route for workpiece production (as for the
    latter, additive manufacturing has been exploited [251]). Some of the effects
    of the lubrication/cooling conditions on chip morphology (and, thus, on machinability
    results) have been experimentally highlighted in turning tests performed on a
    45–2-2 XD alloy under dry cutting, conventional flood cooling, high pressure lubricant
    supply, cryogenic cooling with liquid nitrogen and MQL. With respect to dry machining,
    a chip size reduction was noticed when applying MQL and conventional flood cooling.
    In comparison to wet cutting, the chips obtained with LN2 showed an increase in
    length and curvature radius. The increase in chip breaking due to the increase
    of the lubricant supply pressure (already discussed for Ti-6Al-4 V) was confirmed
    [203]. 5.3. Analysis of chip formation mechanisms and open challenges The experimental
    approaches described in the literature typically involve the chip collection,
    cold mounting in epoxy resin, polishing and etching to reveal the geometric features
    and microstructures. Chips are then examined by using optical microscopes and/or
    scanning electron microscopes (eventually by exploiting XPS or TKD analyses),
    depending on the level of detail of the assessment. Some research studies are
    specifically focused on the chip morphology and chip formation mechanisms are
    intended to propose multi-view approaches to characterize 2D and/or 3D chip morphology
    [236]. Some others aim to correlate chip morphology with one or more metrics pertaining
    to the machinability assessment (tool wear, cutting forces, surface roughness,
    et cetera), or to define the correlation between chip morphology and the variation
    of the cutting process parameters. In general, literature lacks holistic approaches
    including chip morphology within multi-objective analyses toward a full machinability
    characterization. An empirical method used in industrial practice is the preparation
    of chip shape diagrams for selected combinations of materials and tools, as shown
    in Fig. 18. The diagrams show whether chip breaking is achieved depending on the
    feed rate and cutting speed [157], [252], [253], [254], [255]. There are different
    methods to influence chip shape and fracture. Most of them are based on an increased
    deformation of the chip to induce chip breakage. This is achieved by the use of
    tools with chip breaking geometries, adapted tool feeds or targeted high-pressure
    cutting fluid supply as discussed in Section 7. The prediction of chip geometry
    parameters and chip breakage is complex and the conditions of the cutting process
    as well as the properties of the tool and the machined material must be taken
    into account [157], [172], [256]. Since chip control has a great influence on
    machinability, empirical and analytical models to predict chip formation and breakage
    are continuously developed [171], [257], [258], [259], [260], [261]. Modern approaches
    enable the measurement of the strain and strain rate fields directly in the shear
    zone using digital image correlation and high-resolution cameras and thus the
    analysis of chip formation with high spatial resolution [262], [263]. Download

    Chip form diagram according to [174]. 6. The relationship between surface integrity
    and machinability 6.1. Machinability and surface integrity The machining process
    often result in the creation of new surfaces that manifest as a new surface state
    known as surface integrity. Surface integrity is defined as the condition of a
    freshly exposed surface/subsurface of a component after a manufacturing operation.
    Surface integrity can have many different attributes such as roughness, residual
    stress, severely plastically deformed layers, tribofilms, and textures/preferred
    orientations. Machining is a primarily shearing process during which the finished
    surface/subsurface undergoes severe plastic deformation. This deformation is a
    thermo-mechanical behaviour. During the metal cutting process, the power consumed
    is converted into heat. Heat generation occurs at the shear plane and the chip-tool
    interface. Almost 90% of the heat is conducted away by the chip and coolant; the
    rest of it is conducted into the workpiece material. With gradual tool wear, a
    new surface is formed that results in additional friction. Thus, new surface results
    in additional friction. The tool wear not only increases the interface temperature
    but also affects the physical properties such as roughness and size tolerances
    and sometimes results in surface damage (metallurgical defects) in the materials.
    The strain-induced during the machining process manifests as dislocations near
    the surface resulting in nanoscale subgrains [264], [265]. The thickness of the
    severe plastic deformation zone could range from a few hundred nanometers to a
    few microns. The induced strain also gives rise to residual stresses. These are
    generally recognised as surface integrity, which can be used as a factor to evaluate
    the machinability of different materials, especially when it comes to difficult-to-cut
    materials, e.g., nickel/titanium-based superalloys. In addition, Axinte et al.
    [266] conducted a detailed literature review which analysed sub-surface plastic
    deformation post-machining using in-situ micro-pillar compression testing. Microscopic
    indentation and compression of superficial layers elucidated micro-scale material
    reactions such as plastic deformation and material removal mechanisms. Lower tool
    life, plus higher cutting temperatures and forces are the indicators of poor machinability.
    Consequently, all these factors adversely affect surface integrity. Lower tool
    life results in higher temperatures that can cause surface damage, tensile residual
    stresses, and softening. Higher tool wear also results in higher roughness and
    geometric issues such as roundness error and size variation. Hard particles such
    as metal carbides and oxide inclusions reduce machinability but soft inclusions
    like sulfides are intentionally added to improve machinability. Poor machinability
    drastically increases machining costs by reducing tool life and generating surface
    damages metallurgical defects, tensile residual stresses, and geometric errors.
    This damage worsens with continued tool wear. Thus, the dynamic nature of the
    machining process creates ever-challenging aspects for surface integrity that
    have been a great topic of commercial and academic interest for the past century.
    Since cutting temperature, cutting forces, and material microstructure underpin
    machinability as well as surface integrity, this section evaluates the influence
    of these fundamental factors on both characteristics. The data discussed in the
    first three sections cover three case studies performed at The Timken Company
    R&D laboratories supplemented by the latest studies available in the literature.
    6.2. Influence of machinability on surface integrity For the past few decades,
    researchers have been conducting detailed and systematic studies on machining
    and surface integrity. In 2013, Jawahir et al. [267] conducted a collaborative
    work group study on surface integrity. Most recently, in 2021, Liao et al. [268]
    published a comprehensive and systematic study that included a wide spectrum of
    advanced characterization techniques such as transmission electron microscopy
    (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission Kikuchi diffraction (TKD),
    electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), precision electron diffraction (PED),
    glancing angle X-ray diffraction (GAXRD), atom probe tomography, neutron diffraction,
    synchrotron diffraction, and so on. The study encompassed the fundamental mechanisms
    of different material removal techniques and their effect on surface integrity.
    As a follow-up, La Monaca et al. [269] published a review paper on the effect
    of surface integrity on the service life of a component. Both review papers covered
    the whole gamut of research that has been performed over recent years. Among these,
    the qualified surface integrity factors for machinability evaluation included
    surface roughness, the thickness of the white layer, plastic deformation, and
    residual stress, (please refer to the example given in Fig. 19). The choice of
    a suitable value for the surface integrity criterion therefore depends not only
    on the materials properties but also on various cutting conditions such as tool
    wear, cutting speed, and coolant applications. Among the parameters, the cutting
    speed has a major influence on the material deformation at the machined surface
    (see Fig. 19a). As the cutting speed increases from 50 m/min to 140 m/min, the
    thickness of the deformation layer also increases, as evidenced by the kernel
    average misorientation (KAM) images in Fig. 9a [268], similarly Ren et al., [270]
    observed similar results. Even though the cutting conditions might be identical,
    the surface integrity of different materials is difficult to compare from case
    to case. Because of the large number of possibilities for selecting the boundary
    conditions for tool life studies designed to evaluate machinability, the comparability
    of different studies is limited. Furthermore, the surface integrity is also highly
    influenced by the type of machining process. For example, when machining Inconel
    718 using different methods such as conventional milling, laser assisted milling,
    and water jet cutting, the surface roughness is observed to be the lowest for
    water jet cutting (see Fig. 19b). This is because water jet cutting utilizes a
    narrowly focused, precisely controlled high-pressure abrasive water stream to
    smoothly erode through materials without any mechanical contact, frictional heat,
    or material deformation that would roughen the cutting surfaces, which is typically
    observed in conventional milling or laser assisted milling [268]. In addition
    to surface roughness, the residual stress generation in the workpiece is also
    affected by changes in cutting tool properties. From Fig. 19c, the residual stress
    is highest at the surface of the metal and decreases with depth, because the surface
    of the metal is subjected to the greatest amount of plastic deformation and rapid
    cooling during machining. Moreover, the residual stress is also higher when machining
    with conventional cutting tools rather than with PCBN cutting tools under aggressive
    cutting conditions, which many industries need to meet their production rates.
    This is because conventional cutting tools generate more heat and cause more plastic
    deformation than PCBN cutting tools [271]. Within individual test series, however,
    surface integrity offers a sensitive and validly evaluable criterion for comparing
    the machinability of similar/or same types of materials (but of different composition/using
    different heat treatments). Download : Download high-res image (508KB) Download

    under different cutting speeds [268]; (b) surface roughness for indicating machinability
    under different cutting tools and parameters [268]; (c) Residual Stress profiles
    for different cutting scenario measured in the hoop direction [271]. One fundamental
    viewpoint, states that the interface temperature, mechanical load, and the material
    microstructure, that dominate a material’s machinability, play an influential
    role in microstructural issues of its surface integrity. While the influence of
    cutting force and temperature has been extensively discussed in previous sections,
    in this section we will focus on the influence of the material microstructure
    and properties by taking examples from difficult-to-cut materials, e.g. hardened
    steels and superalloys. In the case of hardened steel, microstructural features
    such as carbides, retained austenite, and martensite lath can influence surface
    integrity. Previous studies on machining focused on improvements in tool life
    or controlling the surface damage, and systematic studies on the influence of
    material microstructure on surface integrity are few and far between. Recent studies
    [272] have shown that subtle variations, such as carbide size and distribution,
    affect grindability which in turn has an impact on geometrical aspects such as
    roundness error. Similarly, Hoier et al. [273] found batch-to-batch variation
    in the grindability of medium carbon steel. The authors attributed higher wheel
    wear (lower machinability) to a higher fraction of hard inclusions. The higher
    wheel wear further affects surface integrity reflecting the variations in the
    residual stresses. Hua et al. [274] conducted hard turning trials on 52100 hardened
    steel with different hardness levels (55HRc and 62HRc) using the same cutting
    parameters. The authors found a significant difference in the residual stress
    pattern. The sample with higher hardness showed a higher magnitude of compressive
    stress. The authors attributed the increase in the compressive stress to the balancing
    act of higher tensile stresses behind the cutting tool. Although the authors did
    not comment on the machinability aspect, it is known that higher hardness results
    in lower machinability because the cutting tool creates abrasive wear. Another
    approach to improve surface integrity of the workpiece involves using a drag finishing
    method on the broaching tool edges. This enables superior control over key parameters
    including rounding radius, material removal rate, reproducibility, and surface
    finish. The microstructure and properties of mechanically performant superalloys,
    (e.g., nickel-based alloys, which are developed for higher working temperatures)
    can lead to a significant decrease in their machinability and thereby to reduced
    lower surface integrity. The primary influence of Ni-based microstructures comes
    from their precipitations, (γ’ phases), which can significantly affect their machinability
    when cutting with parameters that produce different cutting temperatures. This
    leads to strengthening/softening effects on the workpiece. It has been revealed
    that the increase of the γ’ fraction significantly decreases grain plastic deformation
    under aggressive cutting parameters including higher cutting temperatures, due
    to the consequent reduced softening effect [275]. There is plenty of research
    on surface integrity after machining, but systematic studies investigating the
    effect of machinability (or material microstructure) on surface integrity are
    rare. Therefore, targeted experiments were designed at The Timken Company as well
    as from some recent works of literature to understand the effects of machinability
    on surface integrity for bearing steel grades. Those experiments are presented
    here in the form of three case studies. 6.2.1. Case Study I: Effect of retained
    austenite on machinability and surface integrity on 52100 steel Hard turning trials
    were conducted on 52100 steel tubes of dimensions 90 mm (OD), 65 mm (ID), and
    75 mm length. The percentage of retained austenite was varied by hardening at
    different austenitising temperatures. Although the final microstructures consisted
    of different vol% retained austenite (6.7%, 11.7%, and 30% RA) as shown in the
    inset Fig. 20 micrographs, hardness was maintained between 60 and 62HRc. The steel
    tubes were machined using identical cutting conditions for 20 min. Five repetitions
    for each microstructure variation were conducted. Download : Download high-res

    wear on 52100 bearing steels (inset respective microstructures). Tool wear, retained
    austenite, and roughness values were recorded. Results indicate that tool wear
    dramatically decreases with the increase in the retained austenite (Fig. 20).
    The decrease in the tool wear could be due to the dissolution and size reduction
    of e and q carbides at higher austenitization temperatures. The decrease in the
    tool wear also indicated an improvement in the surface roughness. In-situ neutron
    diffraction studies [276] on uniaxial tensile testing on through hardened bearing
    steels have shown that austenite has lower yield strength compared to martensite.
    Therefore, the lower strength of austenite also correlated with the improvement
    in the tool life. Residual stress investigations provide further insights into
    the influence of machinability on surface integrity. As shown in Fig. 21, retained
    austenite strongly influences the residual stress pattern. The maximum compressive
    residual stress (CRS) decreases progressively with an increase in the %RA. The
    increase in the maximum CRS with increases in the retained austenite is most likely
    due to transformation-induced plasticity. The strain-induced martensitic transformation
    of austenite is a thermo-mechanical process. The transformation of austenite to
    martensite is expansive, which leads to compressive residual stresses. Download

    Effect of %RA on residual stresses after hard machining of 52100 steel. Under
    loading conditions, this transformation occurs at the Md temperature [277]. Similar
    to Hertzian stresses, the maximum shear stress from machining also occurs at the
    subsurface, which correlates with the maximum CRS at the subsurface. No such effect
    is observed at the surface. This could be because the surface tensile stresses
    are influenced by the high temperature during the cutting operation or the stresses
    from the heat treatment. From this study, it is evident that increases in the
    retained austenite improve machinability by decreasing tool wear and improving
    surface roughness and also maximum compressive residual stress. 6.2.2. Case Study
    II: Effect of material chemistry (M50 vs. 52100) on machinability and surface
    integrity AISI 52100 is a commonly used bearing steel, while M50 is a specialty
    steel used in aerospace bearing applications. M50 steel has high wear resistance
    and high-temperature dimensional stability due to its high alloying content from
    Cr, Mo, and V additions. Bearing rings from both grades of steels were hardened,
    tempered, and machined using identical cutting parameters. Its high alloying content
    gives M50 steel composition of hard alloy carbides (Fig. 22) making it slightly
    harder (62HRc) than 52100 (60HRc). The abrasive action of the hard carbides results
    in high insert wear and reduced machinability. The residual stress profile on
    through hardened 52100 and M50 steels is shown in Fig. 23. As seen in the figure,
    both steel grades exhibited compressive residual stress at the surface until a
    depth of 100 µm. Download : Download high-res image (537KB) Download : Download

    full-size image Fig. 23. Effect of material chemistry on residual stress. Given
    the high ductility (due to its higher alloy content) and higher strength, it is
    not surprising to see that the M50 steel exhibited the highest surface compressive
    stress compared to the 52100 material. This is supported by the previous observation
    [274] that higher hardness materials show a higher magnitude of CRS. Thus, this
    example suggests that, under certain conditions, machinability and CRS could be
    in an inverse relationship with each other. The exact mechanism behind this phenomenon
    is unknown, so detailed TEM and XRD analyses need to be performed for a better
    understanding of grain size, aspect ratio, and dislocation pinning. 6.2.3. Case
    Study III: Effect of RA on machinability and surface integrity in carburized steel
    The effect of material microstructure on machinability and surface integrity was
    further investigated by Bedekar et al. [278] The author varied the retained austenite
    in SAE 8620 carburized steel followed by hard machining using an identical set
    of parameters. The retained austenite in the case microstructure was maintained
    at 8% and 30% respectively. Advanced characterization techniques such as TEM (transmission
    electron microscopy), GAXRD (glancing angle X-ray diffraction), and nanoindentation
    were employed. The authors observed that white layers developed at much earlier
    stages (100 mm flank wear) on samples with 8% RA, which was not the case for 30%
    RA. The delay in the formation of white layers in the 30% RA sample indicates
    that higher machinability microstructures generate lower cutting temperatures
    thereby extending the insert life. TEM investigations found that the subgrain
    size of the 30% RA samples was comparable to that of the 8%RA (Fig. 24, Fig. 25)
    due to the identical machining parameters. Download : Download high-res image

    and 30%RA carburized AISI 8620 steel. The residual stress patterns (Fig. 24) showed
    that the surface residual stress for the 30% RA sample was slightly tensile while
    the sample with 8% RA showed compressive residual stress. This agrees with the
    previous observations on 52100 bearing steel (Fig. 21 [274]). The total depth
    of compressive residual stress in 30% RA was shallower than the 8% RA which is
    also consistent with the previous observations (Fig. 21 and [274]). The magnitude
    of maximum CRS for both groups of samples was comparable. This might be due to
    the higher carbon in the solution on the carburized steel that stabilized the
    retained austenite and restricted the TRIP transformation. The observations in
    this study are consistent with Case Study I showing that higher %RA enables better
    machinability, reduces the propensity for white layer development, and produces
    compressive residual stresses, thus demonstrating that microstructural constituents
    play a pivotal role in machinability, which ultimately influences surface integrity.
    6.2.4. Case Study IV: Influence of machinability on surface integrity in nickel-based
    superalloy Nickel-based superalloys, such as Inconel 718, Waspaloy and Udimet
    720Li, and RR1000, are notoriously low-machinability materials, because of their
    low thermal conductivity, the tendency for strain hardening, and high strength
    at elevated temperatures. This leads to poor surface integrity from a variety
    of surface/subsurface damage such as material drag, cracking, and severe plastic
    deformation layers (SPD) when these materials are machined with inappropriate
    parameters or tool conditions. These anomalies can have a detrimental effect on
    the fatigue performance of safety-critical components during their operational
    life. Thus, industrial surface quality standards specify that severe plastic deformations
    and/or thermally abused layers on the part surfaces are not acceptable. Due to
    the specific material properties of nickel-based superalloys, the cutting conditions
    (e.g. applied cutting tool material, wear condition, and cutting speeds that can
    yield different cutting temperatures and stress) can cause them to differ significantly
    in their machinability and eventually influence the surface integrity. According
    to Rachid [14], the high cutting temperature and stress from the tool wear and
    high cutting speed maps lead to recrystallised areas on the near surface of the
    machined layers, as shown in Fig. 26. In particular, the increase in subsurface
    deformation with tool wear and cutting speed is noticeable in the strain contouring
    maps. This low machinability leads to the high tensile residual stress in the
    near surface when the cutting tool is worn, especially for CBN cutting tools under
    high cutting speed, as a result of the substantial increase in cutting temperature
    and severe strain work hardening in the SPD layers [279]. Download : Download

    maps obtained from EBSD measurements and surface residual stress show that the
    machinability of Nickel-based superalloy can be significantly influenced by the
    cutting conditions and yield poor surface integrity. Moreover, while a great variety
    of Ni-based superalloys are available, their machinability is are different and
    lead to various sensitivities to machining operations when SPD layers are generated.
    An in-depth metallurgical and mechanical analysis via abusive drilling operations
    [280] of the machinability and surface integrity of four different Ni-based superalloys,
    (Alloy 718, Waspaloy, Alloy 720Li, and RR1000) has been studied. It was found
    that alloy 720Li and RR 1000 are reported to have better mechanical performances
    at higher operating temperatures, they seem to be more sensitive to abusive drilling
    conditions, as evidenced by the thicker severe plastic deformation layers and
    higher tensile residual stresses observed in Fig. 27. It is concluded that while
    more mechanically performant alloys have been developed for higher temperatures,
    these combinations of properties are likely to lead to a decrease in their machinability.
    This eventually leads to a reduced tolerance to intense heat and mechanical loads
    that could develop when inadequate machining conditions are present and consequently
    yield poorer surface integrity [280]. Download : Download high-res image (773KB)

    EBSD inverse pole figure, and strain contouring of deformed areas in the near
    machined surface of different alloys show that more mechanically performant alloys
    lead to low machinability [280]. 7. Methods to enhance machinability In principle,
    machinability has always played a role in the machining of any material. Therefore,
    many methods have been developed over the years to enable and continuously improve
    the machinability of new materials. One of the most obvious but nevertheless not
    always optimally used method with regard to machinability is represented by different
    cooling strategies. Further potential can be exploited by means of thermally assisted
    hybrid machining processes as well as optimised cutting tool design. In the following
    three subchapters, different concepts for improving machinability will be presented
    and evaluated. 7.1. Coolant strategies Effective coolant delivery is critical
    when machining difficult-to-cut materials like nickel and titanium aerospace alloys
    to control temperature rise at the cutting zone, reduce tool wear, and sustain
    surface finish and integrity. Hence, a wide variety of cooling and lubrication
    strategies are used to improve the machinability [100]. In addition to classic
    cooling-lubricant emulsions, there are synthetic cooling-lubricant solutions as
    well as the use of pure/natural oils. Furthermore, there are concepts in which
    fluids are largely dispensed with, such as high-pressure coolant, cryogenic cooling
    and MQL. The key techniques aim to provide cooling as well as lubrication effects
    to overcome the challenges posed by elevated temperatures and friction when machining
    nickel and titanium alloys. Integrating these diverse strategies facilitates uninterrupted
    and efficient machining of difficult-to-machine aerospace materials [281]. Hence,
    these approaches seek to fulfil the main objectives of a cooling strategy, which
    are “lubrication”, “cooling” and “chip removal” [88]. Accordingly, the concepts
    can be classified as shown in Fig. 28, in which the different concepts are compared
    in terms of their performance with respect to the main objectives [88], [282].
    To a large extent, the main tasks determine the machinability of a cutting process,
    which includes cutting forces, tool-wear and tool-life, surface roughness and
    surface integrity, chip formation and chip control, and part accuracy [283], [284],
    [285]. The better the influence of the cooling lubrication strategy on machinability
    is understood, the more specifically machinability can be improved for a specific
    task. Download : Download high-res image (320KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 28. Evaluation of the different cooling and lubrication strategies
    with regard to the main objectives chip removal, cooling, and lubrication [88],
    [282]. Water-miscible coolants are used at high process temperatures and cutting
    speeds with simultaneously low tool-pressures. Lubricating oils are mainly used
    at high contact pressures between rake face and chip surface, such as those encountered
    in different machining process. Both concepts are highly effective in terms of
    cooling, chip removal and lubrication, which is why they are standard in industry.
    As sustainable production is becoming increasingly important, the elimination
    of cooling fluids is desirable, resulting in insufficient cooling and lubricating,
    and thus in a deteriorated machinability (shortened tool life, due to wear mechanisms
    or breakage [286,287] and increase of process forces [288], [289], [290]). These
    effects can be attributed to the lack of lubrication of the cutting area [291].
    At the same time, complex machining operations, such as gear skiving, can show
    an opposite trend in terms of wear behaviour when using compressed air instead
    of using pure oil as flood cooling [292]. The same behaviour can be observed in
    the comparison between dry machining and flood cooling in terms of surface roughness
    [286,293]. The results for A390 alloy, AISI 4340 as well as 6061 aluminium alloy
    show that the surface quality of the produced technical surface, by means of surface
    roughness, is of a higher quality when using cooling lubricants in the machining
    process. This contrasts with the studies on complementary machining, where the
    use of cooling lubricant results in a higher surface roughness compared to dry
    process operation [294]. In machining operations that are significantly characterized
    by high friction, MQL can improve machinability. MQL uses compressed air to introduce
    very small quantities of oil particles into the cutting area to maximize heat
    dissipation while providing requisite chip evacuation and lubrication. With MQL,
    the consumption of cooling fluid is reduced by an efficient application of oil
    mist via tool-internal channels or external nozzles. Though cooling effects are
    moderate, the oil prevents pressure welding of chips and reduces friction [281].
    The oil mist flow rate usually is lower than 50 ml/h [88]. The effectiveness of
    MQL relies on the extent to which the oil reaches the cutting zone. This is not
    only influenced by number and position of nozzles [295,296], but also by the oil
    spray characteristic [297]. Among which, Lacalle et al. [298] investigation of
    the effect of spray cutting fluids in high speed milling, stated that the reduction
    of the quantity of cutting oil in the machining process, in relation to conventional
    emulsion coolants that leads to lower machining costs. Further, in milling, MQL
    can reach lower process forces and longer tool lives than dry machining [299].
    For turning, lower process forces [286,300], longer tool lives [286,301] and lower
    surface roughness [301,[302] were reported compared to dry cutting. Furthermore,
    for difficult-to-machine materials, MQL eliminated built-up edge related failures,
    thereby significantly improving surface finish and surface integrity [281]. Pereira
    et al. [303] evaluated alternative environmentally friendly oils including high
    oleic sunflower oil, sunflower oil, castor oil and ECO-350 recycled oil for MQL
    machining of Inconel 718, high oleic sunflower oil improved tool life by 15% compared
    to industrial canola oil, while achieving similar environmental impact. In addition
    to the environmental concern, it must be mentioned, that the process parameters
    of MQL, also in comparison to dry machining and flood cooling, have influence
    [295]. For drilling, similar process forces and tool lives were reported, compared
    to flood cooling [304] or even higher tool lives and a lower surface roughness
    [305]. Regarding machining temperatures flood cooling usually perform better than
    MQL, while MQL often reaches comparable machining forces and tool lives as well
    as lower roughness values. For processes where primarily high temperatures occur,
    the use of cryogenic cooling can significantly improve machinability. Cryogenic
    cooling, usually employing liquid nitrogen, limits temperature rise by chilling
    the cutting zone. The cryogenic delivery reduced cutting temperatures by 300 °C
    during silicon nitride machining - well below the tool material''s softening point,
    which enables improved tool life and surface quality [281]. Optimising the orientations
    of cryogenic nozzles might maximize heat extraction during the machining process.
    However it must be noticed that pure CO2 lacks lubricating properties, which may
    lead to undesirable surface qualities for workpiece materials which lead to adhesion,
    e.g. Inconel 718 [306]. Studies on the combination of cryogenic cooling and MQL
    with external supply nozzles show that the additional use of oil leads to longer
    tool life for difficult to cut materials and to an improvement of the surface
    roughness [307,308]. The combination of nitrogen and MQL as a cooling strategy
    has high requirements for the process parameters and is therefore considered in
    more detail in the following section 7.2 “Hybrid machining”. Due to its lower
    temperature, LN2 has a higher cooling potential than CO2 snow (−196 °C vs. −78.5 °C).
    LN2 was successfully used to reduce tool wear compared to dry machining [309]
    and flood cooling. The lubrication effect of LN2 is not proven clearly: Compared
    to dry conditions, the friction coefficient decreased in [310], didn’t change
    in [311] and slightly increased in due to LN2 application. Consequently, the reported
    tool wear reduction mainly relies on the lower process temperatures. A challenge
    in LN2 cooling is, that the medium tends to evaporate within the supply lines
    [312,313], which drastically lowers the heat transfer and thus the cooling ability
    [282]. Counteractions are the insulation of tools and supply lines. As a reliable
    solution to this issue, the usage of a sub-cooler was proposed and successfully
    tested for orthogonal turning [314]. Another promising approach are so-called
    sub-zero metalworking fluids which are applied at liquid state, but at temperatures
    well below 0 °C. This novel cooling approach combines low supply temperatures
    with beneficial lubrication effects, offering a high potential for an effective
    cooling capacity [315,316]. The application of sub-zero metalworking fluids has
    so far been investigated for turning [317,318] and milling [319]. In comparison
    to conventional flood cooling and cryogenic cooling strategies, the application
    of sub-zero metalworking fluids resulted in less tool wear when turning 42CrMo4
    [320] and Ti-6Al-4 V [315]. This reduction of tool wear is attributed to the high
    cooling capacities in superposition with beneficial lubrication effects which
    efficiently decreases the occurring thermal loads. A promoted cooling capacity
    was also observed during hard turning of 100Cr6 [321,322]. Better surface qualities
    were achieved due to beneficial lubrication effects of the liquid sub-zero metalworking
    fluid [323]. The high-pressure coolant systems directed at the tool-chip interface
    penetrate into the chip removal zone even during high-speed machining. In Inconel
    718, the hydraulic wedge effect reduces frictional heat between the tool and workpiece,
    lowering thermal gradients, and enhances chip segmentation - transitions from
    long continuous to smaller C-type chips were observed with increasing pressure
    of the coolant system [281]. Regarding, the cutting type for carbide tools, such
    optimised high-pressure coolant delivery improved tool life. However, high-pressure
    impacts compromised ceramic tool integrity, which accelerates notching and fracture.
    Hence pressure limits should balance tool life and reliability based on tool material.
    While flood cooling media successfully removes chips from the tool and the workpiece,
    this remains a challenge for dry cutting, MQL and cryogenic cooling [324], which
    can lead to poorer machinability. When regarding finishing operations the part
    accuracy is of large importance. Flood cooling performs best because of its high
    thermal capacity and the high heat transfer between the part and the liquid oil
    or emulsion [325]. For dry and MQL cutting the accuracy is impaired due to the
    thermal extension of tool and workpiece. To conclude, the previously presented
    coolant strategies in machining are to be classified in Table 2. These are to
    be compared with each other in relation to the main mechanisms. A solid circle
    represents the greatest potential to improve machinability for the respective
    main mechanism in comparison with the other concepts. Table 2. Performance of
    cooling concepts in terms of machinability. 7.2. Hybrid machining The concept
    of hybrid machining has emerged as a strategy to improve the machinability through
    targeted introduction of energy sources and tools, such as lasers and ultrasonic
    vibrations. Commonly observed improvements realized in hybrid machining performance
    include reduced forces, improved chip form, and lower tool-wear [326,327]. For
    example, thermally assisted hybrid machining (e.g., via lasers or induction heating,
    or via high-speed dry cutting) may reduce cutting forces by promoting thermal
    softening of the workpiece material. A recent review on the topic of laser assisted
    machining of hard and brittle materials by You et al. [328] highlights the positive
    abilities of thermal softening to reduce cracks and other types of mechanical
    damage, while also discussing the need for careful pre-heating and control of
    laser power to avoid thermal damage. Generally speaking, thermal effects in machining
    typically result from increased cutting speeds or due to additional heat sources.
    Such effects will reduce process forces, yet result in thermal damage to the surface
    layer in the form of tensile residual stresses and undesirable/brittle phase transformations
    [329,330]. The process shows especially high potential in cutting ceramics and
    hardened steel [146,331]. Pujana et al. [332] studied ultrasonic vibration during
    Ti6Al4V drilling reduced feed forces and increased process temperatures compared
    to conventional drilling. Thus, by introducing heat in the cutting zone, the machinability
    of materials can be favoured. All mechanical machining (cutting) is fundamentally
    a thermomechanical process and the material response of workpiece materials during
    cutting will be broadly governed by competition between thermal softening and
    strain/strain-rate hardening. In vibration-assisted machining, the tool/workpiece
    engagement is controlled and modulated to improve chip breaking and avoid undesirable
    tribological and chip formation regimes, such as built up edge and other material
    flow stagnation phenomena in the vicinity of the cutting edge. A recent review
    by Yang et al. [333] illustrates how tool life and machinability of materials
    with high strain hardening and low chip breakability can be greatly increased
    through ultrasonic vibration-assisted machining [334]. Consequently, vibration-assisted
    machining has seen numerous beneficial applications in optics and semiconductor
    applications, as well as in biomedical science and aerospace manufacturing. However,
    it should be noted that ‘good vibrations’ to improve machinability require careful
    study of the process physics and control over the amplitude and frequency of vibrations,
    as excessive vibrations may result in fatigue and damage to the workpiece material,
    as was observed in vibration-assisted grinding of ceramics [326,335]. 7.3. Specific
    cutting tool design Cutting tools are one of the key players determining machinability
    of engineering materials [336]. Commonly used cutting tool materials are high
    speed steel, tungsten carbide (WC), cermets, ceramics, polycrystalline cubic boron
    nitride (PCBN), polycrystalline diamond (PCD) [337]. Although cutting tool material,
    cutting edge shape and condition is of importance in terms of machining performance
    [81], cutting tool geometry also plays major role to enhance machining performance.
    Typical cutting tools are used in the machining industry for various operations
    including turning, milling, drilling, etc. Specific cutting tools with novel design
    are offer significant competition to generic cutting tool geometries for performing
    specific tasks and needs in machining process of advanced engineering materials
    such as composite, stainless steel, and aerospace alloys, etc. [64], [338], [339].
    As discussed in previous sections, the advanced materials, including stainless
    steels, Ni- and Ti-based alloys that generally have low thermal conductivity,
    strain hardened response and low chip breakability, can have very low machinability
    [64]. These result in some well-acknowledged difficulties faced during chip removal
    process. Concerning cutting tools, although cutting edge shape and the cutting
    edge conditions are of great importance for improving machining performance [81],
    various macro level approaches have been utilized to resolve/reduce problems including
    developing new cutting tools or modifying the standard cutting tools depending
    on the requirement of process [83]. For instance, Oezkaya et al. [83] proposed
    flank face modification to enhance performance of cutting tools in drilling Inconel
    718 alloy to increase tool life. Poulachon et al. [340] studied that controlling
    progressive flank wear of PCBN cutting tools is critical for ensuring part quality
    in hard turning of alloy steels. A generalized model built on key influences like
    cutting parameters, tool microstructure and work material hardness enables reliable
    prediction of tool wear rates for optimised performance. Besides, texturing the
    cutting tools is another common approach to enhance machinability of advanced
    engineering materials. Surface texture increases the area of heat dissipation
    in between the tool and cutting fluid or ambient air and thereby reduce the temperature
    of machining, adhesion, cutting forces, and friction at the contact interface
    [341]. This will contribute reducing or eliminating applied cutting fluid [341,342].
    Many scientific works have been published in the literature to show the effectiveness
    of textured cutting tools on machinability of various materials [343] including
    steels [78], [344], Inconel alloys [345], Ti alloys [346] and carbon fiber reinforced
    plastics (CFRP) [347] during turning process [348], milling process [349], drilling
    process [350] and grinding processes [351]. The performance of textured cutting
    tools depends on some critical parameters such as groove dimensions including
    depth, width, diameter [344,352]. Besides, textured area, texture orientation,
    the surface of cutting tools texture generated, etc. [353]. Liao et al. [354]
    proposed novel concept on texturing tool through macro and micro channels on the
    rake face of cutting tools as depicted in Fig. 29. The contribution of this novel
    concept on machinability can be summarized as reduced friction coefficient, forces,
    shear energy, and chip breakability. Some researchers preferred to utilize micro
    holes instead of micro channels. For instance, Rao et al. [355] tested the performance
    of micro-hole patterns on the rake and flank face of PCD cutting tool. They reported
    that PCD tools with micro-hole patterns are capable of reducing cutting temperature,
    tool wear and surface roughness by approximately 30%, 50% and 40%, respectively.
    In addition to micro-channels, some industries are manufacturing spindles with
    integrated micro channels, where a high pressure of almost 200 bars can be utilized
    to pump the coolant while machining hard-to-cut materials. Download : Download

    CIRP’s Collaborative Working Group on integrated machining performance for assessment
    of cutting tools (IMPACT). It provides an assessment of current state-of-the-art
    development in machinability evaluation and relevant knowledge for maximizing
    machining performance in the context of metal machining. While there is no complete
    and unanimously accepted definition of machinability concept existing, in this
    paper an in-depth analysis of tool performance, cutting force and temperature,
    chip form and breakability, surface integrity has been conducted to understand
    the current best-practices in machinability evaluation. It is expected that the
    fundamental knowledge obtained from the in-depth analysis of machinability evaluation
    should open new possibilities for the research community to develop better practice
    to improve machining performance. The main conclusions of this review are as follows:
    (1) The correlations of machinability with regard to the tool reveals that tool
    life as an indicator of machinability requires a holistic view of the machining
    process. This approach must include the influences of the workpiece properties,
    the tool properties as well as the process parameters in order to obtain a reliable
    assessment of the tool life. In the sense of comparability of the investigation
    results, the parameters for quantifying the tool life as well as the tool life
    criteria must also be selected on the basis of scientific considerations. (2)
    Cutting forces and process temperatures are mostly used in combination to evaluate
    the machinability. In general, the more difficult to machine of the material,
    the higher cutting force and temperature will be generated in machining process.
    However, as they are also significantly influenced by the complex interactions
    between the tool-workpieces, evaluating the materials machinability based on cutting
    force and temperatures has to be considered under particular circumstance. (3)
    Every machining process is based on the separation of chips from the workpiece,
    and machinability is strictly related to the chip shape and chip formation mechanism.
    The lack of chip control generally implies negative effects on part quality and
    tool wear/tool failure. The complex correlation between tool, workpiece material,
    process parameters, chip morphology, breakability and machinability has been analyzed,
    together with the most common methods used in the industrial practice to manage
    and affect chip shape and fracture. (4) Machinability can be effectively influenced
    by the metallurgical conditions (e.g., microstructure, chemistry, residual stress)
    of the materials and can significantly influence the surface integrity. Using
    limited variables such as material chemistry, retained austenite, and heat treatment
    technique, it was found that surface integrity aspects such as residual stresses,
    subgrain size, and retained austenite show trends in machinability. The data suggests
    that under laboratory conditions, it is possible to get cues about machinability
    from surface integrity. (5) Apart from materials properties, machinability is
    mainly influenced by the cutting tool performance, cutting force and temperature,
    chip form and breakability as well as surface integrity. Hence, the machinability
    can be improved by the (i) optimised coolant strategies, e.g., MQL for high friction
    cutting and cryogenic cooling for high temperature cutting; (ii) hybrid machining,
    e.g., thermally assisted hybrid machining to soften the workpiece material reduce
    the cutting force; (iii) specific cutting design, e.g., texturing the cutting
    tools or other modifications of the tool flank/rake surface. The major challenges
    in machinability for the future include the standardization of machinability evaluation
    and quantification methods of different materials for comprehensive industrial
    practice and application. On the other hand, gathering a good deal of industrial
    and laboratorial data to form a digitalized database for a wide range of engineering
    materials will also benefit the future globalized knowledge share for the community.
    Apart from that, how to optimize the machining performance of the total machining
    system based on these data is also one of the channelings that needs to be addressed.
    This will also be discussed in other topic groups (i.e., Topic B-E) of CIRP CWG

  description: Occupational accidents are one of the main problems in production system
    especially in metal sector. The aim of this study is to develop a predictive framework
    using machine learning (ML) to identify the causes of fatalities and amputations
    in the metal sector based on occupational accident data collected by the Turkish
    Ministry of Labor and Social Security (MLSS) from 2013 to 2018. Researchers have
    used a variety of strategies to investigate factors and create effective prediction
    frameworks for lowering occupational accidents. We used random forest (RF), k-nearest
    neighbour (KNN), gradient boosting method (GBM) and recursive partitioning and
    regression trees (RPART) to predict accident causes and consequence. Accuracy,
    precision, recall and f-score is used to measure the performance of ML frameworks.
    For model validation 10-fold cross validation method was used which increased
    the accuracy of the frameworks considerably. We extracted important factors which
    affected the causes of accident at metal sector using feature importance. Analysis
    proved RF as the best performing framework with highest classification results
    with 0.9172 accuracy, 0.9618 precision, 0.9518 recall and 0.9568 f-score using
    all features as compared to other techniques classification of occupational accident
    severity. To implement preventive controls and interventions in a more targeted
    way, it is recommended to use the predictive RF algorithm in the analysis of occupational
    accidents. With these studies, preventive measures can be taken by predicting
    occupational accidents that may occur in the future.

    According to research conducted by the International Labour Organization (ILO);
    nearly two million people die every year due to occupational accidents. In addition,
    every year 374 million occupational accidents and occupational diseases take place
    and although they do not result in death, many of them cause temporary disability
    (Safety, 2023). Therefore, occupational safety is essential to prevent or reduce
    the risk of injury, illness, and death in the workplace. Occupational accidents
    are one of the main problems in today''s production system and modern society
    especially in metal sector (Fuentes-Bargues, 2022, Kifle, 2014, Nazaripour, 2018).
    The metal sector has 3 % share of the Gross National Product, 2 % share of the
    total employment in the industrial sectors and 12 % share of the total exports
    in Turkey. With this aspect, the metal sector ranks 3rd among the sectors that
    export the most (Gulluoglu and Gulluoglu, 2019). In 2016, approximately 10 people
    out of every 100,000 employees lost their lives in Turkey as same as metal industry.
    This shows that the number of death cases in the sector is similar to Turkey in
    general (SGK, 2017). Therefore, metal industry urgently needs to reduce fatalities.
    Number of fatal occupational accident which occurred in metal sector of Turkey
    are shown in Fig. 1. Download : Download high-res image (135KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. Fatal Occupational Accidents of Metal Sector (2013–2019)
    (SGK, SGK İstatistik Yıllıkları, SGK, Editor., 2017). Investigation of occupational
    accidents is essential to determine and understand the causes of accidents in
    order to be able to prevent accidents with similar root causes (Anyfantis, 2021,
    Shao, 2019, Salguero-Caparros et al., 2015, Lindberg et al., 2010). Also, Goh
    and Ubeynarayana (Goh and Ubeynarayana, 2017) noted that past accidents could
    serve as a basis for preventing future accidents. So, it is important to classify
    and predict reasons and types of occupational accidents to reduce and avoid accidents.
    In this work, we built a model to classify and predict the causes of occupational
    accidents using ML frameworks such as RF, KNN, GBM and RPART. 2. Literature review
    2.1. Occupational accidents in metal sector In this section we describe previous
    research on occupational accidents that occur in metal sector. Firstly, in a study
    by Yağımlı et al. (Yagimli and İZcİ, 2017), it is stated that the metal sector
    was one of the sectors with the highest number of occupational accidents, as it
    covered a dense production area, working in shifts with full automation, and frequent
    malfunctions and technical errors due to intensive working with machines. In another
    study conducted on metal workers, the percentage distribution of the causes of
    work accidents was as follows: insufficient use of personal protective equipment:
    44 %, carelessness: 38 %, and personal reasons, not taking safety precautions
    in machines and benches: 18 %. In this study, it was revealed that occupational
    accidents were mostly caused by the lack of use of personal protective equipment
    and inadequate vocational training (Gulhan et al., 2012). In a study conducted
    among metal industry workers in Norway, it was determined that making use of eye
    protection compulsory against eye injuries greatly contributed to the prevention
    of eye injuries (Bull, 2008). Fuentes-Bargues et. al. (Fuentes-Bargues, 2022)
    stated that location, employee characteristic, deviation, days of absence, time
    of day and injury were related to accident severity with a 95 % confidence level
    in the Spanish metal sector. When the causes of work accidents were examined,
    they determined that the loss of control of the machines and slip and fall accidents
    had more serious consequences. Kifle et. al. (Kifle, 2014) found that there was
    notable correlation between occupational accidents and work stress, personal protective
    equipment (PPEs), education level of employee, night shift and alcohol consumption
    during day time. Therefore, occupational accidents could be reduced by increasing
    awareness through trainings, providing PPEs, and making sure they were used and
    establishing industry safety programs. Shirali et. al. (Shirali, 2018) conducted
    a study to determine the effectiveness of a range of safety costs, such as safety
    performance indicators, productivity and quality, in five steel companies. They
    used data envelopment analysis method, which was utilized to calculate the impact
    of safety expenses. They discovered that the effective decision-making units were
    associated with businesses that give safety and health systems more credit and
    attention and take safety cost elements into account when determining costs under
    greater project hazard and safety culture levels. 2.2. ML in metal sector We describe
    previous research on ML frameworks for occupational accidents in this section.
    The latest studies on forecasting technologies carried out with the current data
    reveal that the accidents were rather empirical and did not take place in a random
    manner. Studies also declared that in order to be able to prevent accidents, carrying
    out quantitative research was a necessity. (Tixier, 2016). In this regard, some
    studies used ML to predict patterns of occupational accidents from accident dataset
    for preventing accidents. ML frameworks have been used for different purposes
    in different industries. For example, in traffic accident analysis, ML has been
    widely used for predicting potential risks (Yan et al., 2005, Yannis, 2010, Gregoriades
    and Mouskos, 2013, Karacasu et al., 2014, Usman et al., 2016, Nishimoto, 2017,
    Wang, 2019, Meng and Weng, 2011, Weng et al., 2012). Although there has been a
    lot of work done on the same approach in industries such as mining (He, 2010,
    Rivas, 2011, Sanmiquel et al., 2015, Palei and Das, 2009), construction (Goh and
    Ubeynarayana, 2017, Tixier, 2016, Chiang et al., 2018, Alizadeh et al., 2015,
    Amiri, 2016, Park, 2018, Yi, 2016, Ghodrati, 2018, Sakhakarmi et al., 2019, Ayhan
    and Tokdemir, 2019, Persona, 2006, Matías, 2008, Mistikoglu, 2015, Leu and Chang,
    2013, Jana, 2019, Jahangiri et al., 2019), aviation (Li, 2003, Bazargan and Guzhva,
    2011, Yeoum and Lee, 2013), there is still very little research on how to use
    ML in the field of occupational safety in metal (Yagimli and İZcİ, 2017) industry.
    Research on accident prevention using the national database has been attempted
    in various fields. For example Choi et al (Yagimli and İZcİ, 2017) used ML frameworks
    for predicting the potential risk of fatal accidents. They used Korea’s national
    dataset at construction sites. Logistic regression, decision tree, RF, and AdaBoost
    analyses were used and compared as ML frameworks. Yan et al. (Yan et al., 2005)
    examined accident characteristics by using Florida traffic accident data. They
    used multiple logistic regression of accident inducers and victims'' data. Nishimoto
    et al. (Nishimoto, 2017) used national traffic accident data for constructing
    an algorithm for collision notification system by using logistic regression model.
    Karacasu et al. (Karacasu et al., 2014) used ML framework as logistic regression
    and discriminative analysis of national traffic accidents for determining damages
    from accidents in the Eskişehir, Turkey. Different ML frameworks such as support
    vector machine (SVM) (Goh and Ubeynarayana, 2017, Rivas, 2011, Sakhakarmi et al.,
    2019, Matías, 2008, Sánchez, 2011, Aci and Ozden, 2018, Zhang, 2018), decision
    tree (DT) (Weng et al., 2012, Rivas, 2011, Sanmiquel et al., 2015, Matías, 2008,
    Aci and Ozden, 2018, Zhang, 2018, Karlaftis and Golias, 2002, Jeong, 2018, Mafi
    et al., 2018), Bayesian Network (BN) (Rivas, 2011, Sanmiquel et al., 2015, Matías,
    2008, Leu and Chang, 2013), KNN (Goh and Ubeynarayana, 2017, Aci and Ozden, 2018,
    Zhang, 2018, Mafi et al., 2018), classification and regression tree (CART) (Amiri,
    2016, Persona, 2006, Bevilacqua et al., 2008, Cheng, 2012), RF (Tixier, 2016,
    Zhang, 2018, Mafi et al., 2018, Kang and Ryu, 2019, Brown, 2016, Siddiqui et al.,
    2012, Wang, 2015, Shanthi and Ramani, 2012, Jiang et al., 2019, Umer, et al.,
    2020, Tang, 2019), GBM (Jeong, 2018, Jiang et al., 2019, Umer, et al., 2020, Tang,
    2019, Bridgelall and Tolliver, 2021), RPART (Tang and Donnell, 2019) have been
    used in previous studies. In some studies, frameworks were compared with each
    other (Goh and Ubeynarayana, 2017, Tixier, 2016, Wang, 2019, Rivas, 2011, Matías,
    2008, Sánchez, 2011, Aci and Ozden, 2018, Zhang, 2018, Jeong, 2018, Mafi et al.,
    2018, Jiang et al., 2019, Umer, et al., 2020, Tang, 2019). Mafi et al. (Mafi et
    al., 2018) used a cost-sensitive data mining model to examine how injury severity
    varied among drivers of different ages and genders by using Miami’s data. They
    used C4.5 Decision Tree, instance-based (IB), and RF machine-learning frameworks.
    Each framework considered choices of driver, vehicle, road, environment and accident
    parameters to determine whether they affected driver injury severity. They found
    that, for four groups of drivers, RF fared better in cost-sensitive models than
    C4.5 and IB models in forecasting the severity of driver injuries. Tixier et al.
    (Tixier, 2016)utilized a system for forecasting construction injuries that made
    use of stochastic gradient tree boosting and RF ML algorithms. They analysed an
    unstructured dataset of injury reports, and by using text mining tools, they discovered
    many safety implications of injuries. In addition, text mining was used by Goh
    and Ubeynarayana (2017) (Goh and Ubeynarayana, 2017) to classify unstructured
    construction accident data. ML frameworks such as RF, KNN, naïve bayes (NB), logistic
    regression (LR) and SVM are compared. They found that SVM produced the best performance
    compared to the other ML frameworks used. Umer et al. (Umer, et al., 2020) created
    collision severity prediction models using data from 49 states and on 3.5 million
    national accidents that happened between February 2016 and June 2020. Logistic
    Logit Regression and Stochastic Gradient Descent, RF, AdaBoost Classifier, GBM,
    and Extra Tree Classifier were used as ML model. Accuracy, precision, recall,
    and F-score were used to compare the performances of the models. They found that
    RF produced the best performance among all. As a similar study, in order to forecast
    crash injury severity, Jiang et al. (Jiang et al., 2019) created five models based
    on 308,641 road crashes that happened in the State of Washington, USA, between
    2011 and 2015. They used RF, Multinomial Logistic Regression, Neural Networks,
    GBM and AdaBoost as a ML model. Model performances were assessed using F1 score,
    which is based on recall and precision. GGM performed the best among the models,
    while Multinomial Logistic Regression was found to be the worst. Lee et al. (Lee,
    2020) used RF, artificial neural network and DT algorithms to predict the severity
    of traffic accidents during rainy seasons. They used three data sets: road data,
    precipitation data, and nine years of traffic accident data on the Naebu highway
    in Seoul, Korea. As a result of the study, the RF algorithm showed higher performance
    than other algorithms. Chen, M. M. and Chen M. C. (Chen and Chen, 2020) used logistic
    regression, CART and RF algorithms to explore interrelated factors to reduce the
    damage caused by road accidents. They used 18 data parameters from each accident
    from Taiwan''s highway traffic accident investigation reports from 2015 to 2019,
    including severity and 17 associated factors, to investigate associated factors
    and create efficient prediction algorithms. As a result of the study, the RF algorithm
    showed higher performance than other algorithms with an accuracy value of 0.7338.
    Considering all the studies mentioned above, this study will be a pioneer since
    there is no study on ML modeling applied specifically in the metal sector. 3.
    Research data and method Occupational accidents and occupational diseases must
    be reported to Socia Security Institution (SSI) with a declaration in Turkey.
    Data of occupational accidents are collected and published by SSI in Turkey. We
    used accident data (only the ones resulting in fatalities and amputations) collected
    by the MLSS through The Occupational Health And Safety Information Management
    System which is receiving data from SSI (ÇSGB, 0000). Due to the availability
    of data at the time of the study in 2018, this analysis only considered the six
    years from 2013 to 2018. There are total of 1542 occupational accidents resulting
    in amputation and fatality between 2013 and 2018. 397 of them are fatal occupational
    accidents and 1145 of them are occupational accident with amputations. As of 2013,
    MLSS started to receive the occupational accident notification by electronically,
    and occupational accident data started to be collected according to European Statistics
    on Accidents at Work methodology (ESAW). Since accidents were reported with the
    ESAW, the variables which are determined by this methodology were used in this
    study as shown in Table 1. In this study, the explanations of occupational accidents
    that cause amputations or death were examined and the causes of the accident were
    assessed as the first and second causes. In addition, if a machine was being used
    when the accident took place, and this was stated in the accident description,
    this information was added to machine section of the accident. In addition to
    the ESAW parameters, causes of the accident parameters were also used in ML modelling.
    Details of the accident information are reported by employers. For this reason,
    under-reporting of accidents and incorrect entry of some data are among the limitations
    of this study. In this study only 20 input variables was used for ML modelling
    and showed in Table 1. Table 1. Variables for statistics on occupational accidents
    (Commission and Commission, 2012). Variables Description Victims condition Amputation
    or death Cause of accident Described in Table 2 2nd cause of accident Described
    in Table 2 (if theresi two rcauses) Date of accident (Year) Date of the accident
    Date of accident (Month) Date of accident (date) Machine Machine information (If
    it is a machine-induced accident) Workstation Coded with ESAW variables (“Not
    specified, Usual workstation or within the usual local unit of work, Occasional
    or mobile workstation or in a journey on behalf of the employer or Other workstation”)
    Deviation 2-digit ESAW classification (“last event differing from the norm and
    leading to the accident.” (Commission and Commission, 2012) Type of injury 3-digit

    Age of the victim when the work accident occurred Total experience of victim in
    business The time elapsed from the day the employee started his/her business life
    to the date of the accident is shown on a yearly basis. Total experience at the
    workplace where the accident occurred The time elapsed from the day the employee
    started to the workplace where the accident occurred to the date of the accident,
    is shown on a yearly basis. By analysing the explanations of the occupational
    accidents that have been entered into the system, the causes of the accidents
    were primarily classified according to the sources of hazard as in Table 2. Table
    2. Causes of accidents classification. Cause of accident Examples Chemical Factors
    Storage and usage of chemicals, etc., Biological Factors infectious diseases,
    personal hygiene, kitchen hygiene, diseases, etc., Mechanical Factors use of machines
    and benches, use of hand tools etc. Electrical Factors Usage of electrical sockets
    and cables, fuse boxes and electrical panels, grounding of the installation, working
    with electrical equipment, etc. Human Factors Disobeying traffic rules, not using
    PPE, Unsafe use of work equipment, employee''s work in unauthorized jobs, etc.
    Ergonomic Factors Load lifting-carrying, push–pull movements, inappropriate body

    to the factory or elsewhere, material handling, loading operations Permit to Work
    Systems Working at height or alone, maintenance and repair works, log-out-tag-out
    systems, etc. General Factors Floors, paths, stairs, railings, order and cleanliness,
    warning and warning signs, etc. Other Factors In this study, we set causes of
    the occupational accidents and victim’s condition as output variables and others
    are input variable. The causes of occupational accident were classified into 11
    types as shown in Table 2. KNN, RF was chosen for ML framework, because they are
    the most frequently used methods in the ML field, and they showed best performance
    with respect to others. On the other hand, GBM was chosen because it is efficient
    and performs well on large data sets such as the one in this study. RPART was
    chosen because it is simple to visualize, can handle a variety of variables (including
    numeric, category, and others), and considers nonlinear relationships in the data.
    Since GBM and RPART are not applied much in the literature, it is important to
    compare the performance of GBM and RPART to the other two methods when applied
    to a data set such as in this study. We followed the following methodology also
    summarized in Fig. 2: 1- Prior research and accident data gathered by the MLSS
    were evaluated. 2- The data distribution of variables was described. 3- Pre-processing
    and cleaning of the dataset''s data was done, and then frameworks for RF, KNN,
    GBM and RPART were used to identify the accidents resulting in amputations and
    fatality. 4- K-fold cross validation was used for performance verification. 5-
    Comparisons were made between the ML-derived predictive frameworks. 6- Process
    by which the employees in the field of occupational health and safety and public
    officials in this field can classify the cause and result of serious accidents
    using a predictive framework was suggested. Download : Download high-res image

    of prediction framework for accidents After pre-processing the data, ML was performed
    using RF, GBM, RPART and KNN. k-fold cross validation (10-fold cross-validation)
    was used for model validation and to minimize overfitting. In this process, we
    randomly selected 80 % of the accident data for training of ML framework which
    has been used for parameter testing and training and the remaining 20 % of the
    dataset used for validation. This %20 of the dataset has been used for evaluating
    the predictive accuracy of the ML framework fitted. This was repeated 50 times.
    Then, algorithm performances were compared, and the best performing framework
    was identified. ML process is given in Fig. 3. Download : Download high-res image
    (174KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. ML process. 4.1. Random forest
    (RF) RF was created by Breiman and it uses many decision trees for classification.
    RF combines tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of an independently
    sampled random vector, and all trees in the forest have the same distribution
    (Breiman, 2001, Zhen, 2023). RF is one of the most used framework in the field
    of ML (Tixier, 2016, Zhang, 2018, Mafi et al., 2018, Kang and Ryu, 2019, Brown,
    2016, Siddiqui et al., 2012, Wang, 2015, Shanthi and Ramani, 2012, Jiang et al.,
    2019, Umer, et al., 2020, Tang, 2019). RF model shows best performance on accuracy
    and minimizing over-fitting with respect to other ML frameworks. RF is reliable
    and handles large data sets with complicated interconnections effectively (Andriyas
    and McKee, 2013, Strobl, 2008). RF is faster than bagging or boosting and useful
    for estimation of variable importance (Breiman, 2001). The RF technique uses specified
    variables to divide at each decision tree and bagging node together with a randomly
    subsetting procedure to create distinct decision trees. The Bagging algorithm
    is used to generate training data for each tree by sampling a number of samples
    equal to the sample number in the source dataset (Zhen, 2023). See Fig. 4 for
    a summary of the RF model. Download : Download high-res image (128KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 4. RF Model. Many random classifiers (trees) produce
    individual classification choices that are bundled in RF. This occurs when the
    tree “votes” for that class by providing a categorization. RF selects the classification
    with the most votes among all the trees (which was comprised of n classification
    trees). As a result, predictions become more precise compared to a single tree
    classifier. Each tree in RF is constructed using replacements and bootstrapped
    samples, which correspond to roughly 63 % of the observations from the original
    data set. This leaves about one-third of the cases, which are known as oob (out-of-bag)
    data (Cutler, 2007). When the studies in the literature were examined, the machines
    of the most successful methods in the field of ML were seen to be; KNN, Decision
    Trees, RF, and Support Vector Machines (Santos et al., 2022). KNN and RF were
    chosen in this study due to their high performance. 4.2. K-nearest neighbour (KNN)
    KNN is a non-parametric statistical model that can be applied to tasks involving
    regression or classification (Cover and Hart, 1967). It is an estimation method
    that classifies a studied observation by looking at the k closest observations.
    In other words, it makes a forecasting by sampling k neighbours that are close
    to the value of the response given the computed distances between that value and
    other known observations. After getting the value of the k neighbours, the predicted
    value of the response variable is calculated. KNN has the advantage of making
    no assumptions about the functional form of the data. On the other hand, KNN is
    being sensitive to the local structure of the data (Iranitalab and Khattak, 2017).
    4.3. Gradient boosting machine (GBM) GBM is a boosting approach for regression
    and classification problems that uses regression trees as base learners. The base
    learners were used to iteratively train a classifier for a classification problem
    using the negative gradient of a differentiable loss function. Based on the training
    data, the classifier was predicted to reduce the loss function (Tang, 2019, Friedman,
    2000, Natekin and Knoll, 2013). An evaluation of a model''s performance is done
    using the loss function. Mostly, performance improves with decreasing loss function.
    With its ability to handle intricate non-linear function dependencies, the GBM
    was a strong and effective tool for solving regression problems (Natekin and Knoll,
    2013, Konstantinov and Utkin, 2021). This method was chosen in this study because
    GBM has efficient and good performance on large datasets; inherently supports
    missing values. 4.4. Recursive partitioning and regression trees (RPART) Recursive
    partitioning is the key algorithm for the nonparametric statistical approach to
    classification and regression trees. Recursive partitioning is the method for
    building a decision tree step-by-step by dividing or not splitting each node into
    two daughter nodes (Breiman, et al., 1984, Izenman, 2008). Recursive-partitioning
    regression is the name given to a technique that creates regression trees similarly
    to how classification trees are built. In a classification tree, a terminal node''s
    class is determined by the class that commands a majority (or a plurality in the
    case of two classes) of all the observations in that node, with ties being resolved
    randomly. The output variable in a regression tree is specified to have a constant
    value at the terminal node. The tree can therefore be thought of as an r-dimensional
    histogram estimate of the regression surface, where r is the quantity of input
    variables (Izenman, 2008). A regression tree is a ML model that divides a database
    as evenly as possible using conditions that predict the values of the dependent
    variable from the independent variables or predictors. Such divisions are represented
    by nodes or terminal nodes of the tree. Terminal nodes divide a larger database
    set into two subsets with similar properties. Each created node is referred to
    as a child node (or branch of the tree), one for each portioned collection of
    data, and each decision is represented by a parent node. A branch can result in
    either a new node, in which case the procedure is repeated, or a terminal, which
    exhibits the mean of the response variable for the group chosen through all of
    the prior decisions (Lewis, 2000). This approach was chosen because it is simple
    to visualize, can handle a variety of variables (including numerical, category,
    and others), and considers nonlinear relationships in the data. 4.5. K-fold cross-validation
    Cross-validation is an important tool that is typically employed for performance
    assessment in ML frameworks. The goal of the K-fold cross-validation is to evaluate
    the model by dividing the sample into K groups and treating each group as a validation
    sample (or testing data set) (Li, 2023). In this paper, we used 10-fold cross-validation
    to choose a good parameter for the ML frameworks. This is meaning that 10 data
    partition schemes were used to framework the same set of input data (Vu, 2022).
    K-fold cross validation is one of the mostly used validation method in recent
    modelling studies (Li, 2023, Vu, 2022, Azadi and Karimi-Jashni, 2016). For example,
    Garre et al.are used 10-fold cross validation for minimize data over fitting.
    They used ML frameworks such as RF, GBM, regression tree, bagged tree, elastic
    net etc. Their result showed that GBM had better performance by using 10-fold-cross-validation
    (Garre et al., 2020). 4.6. Feature importance and factor analysis It is necessary
    to extract feature importance to evaluate the model and analyse the components
    influencing causes of occupational accidents. The RF employs a bagging technique
    that increases predictability by fitting several decision trees, however it is
    challenging to comprehend the model. However, the feature importance values can
    be used to interpret the RF model. The feature importance values are relative
    in the RF. They are not meaningful in terms of numbers. By eliminating the unneeded
    input variables, the model''s accuracy is improved, and computation time is decreased.
    Feature importance values are used to rank the input variables that affect the
    target variable. The developer of RF model, namely Breiman suggested two feature
    importance metrics for ranking: Gini importance using the “mean-decrease-impurity”
    and permutation importance using the “mean-decrease-accuracy.” (Altmann, 2010).
    Recursive feature elimination (RFE) is an effective alternative to evaluate feature
    importance and perform feature selection (Guyon, 2002). Many ML techniques for
    feature selection are empowered by RFE technique (Breiman, 2001, Friedman, 2000,
    Freund and Schapire, 1996). Optimal feature subsets are selected by RFE. It enhances
    the performance of classification by ranking through many features based on some
    specific ML frameworks (Li et al., 2022). RFE is an effective and efficient technique
    for reducing model complexity by removing irrelevant inputs. Recursive feature
    selection (RFE) method was applied in this study. 4.7. Performance classification
    of ML modelling The predictive performance of a classifier in binary classification
    is typically assessed using four statistics: true positives (TP), which represented
    the number of positively predicted objects that were actually observed, false
    negatives (FN), which represented the number of positively predicted objects that
    were actually observed, false positives (FP), which represented the number of
    incorrectly predicted negative objects, and true negatives (TN), which represented
    the number of positively predicted objects that were actually observed (Gu et
    al., 2009). Accuracy, precision, recall, and f-score are used for the performance
    classification. The accuracy is defined as: (1) How many of the predicted positive
    samples are true is measured by the precision. When reducing the number of false
    positives (FP) is the goal, it is utilized as a performance indicator and it describes
    how accurate the prediction was. The recall measures how many of the total positive
    samples are classified as true positive (TP), rather than false negative (FN),
    where the total positive samples are the sum of these values (TP + FN). The recall
    is used as a performance indicator when all positive samples need to be identified.
    It is important to avoid false negatives. (Kang and Ryu, 2019, Fränti and Mariescu-Istodor,
    2023, Luo, 2023). They are calculated as: (2) (3) The performance is a trade-off
    between the precision and recall. Recall is increased by lowering the selection
    threshold, which can provide more predictions at the expense of precision. The
    performance can be unified into a single value called f-score (Fränti and Mariescu-Istodor,
    2023, Luo, 2023): Accuracy, precision, recall, and f-score are the most used measure
    for comparison of performance of ML (Umer, et al., 2020, Gu et al., 2009, Fränti
    and Mariescu-Istodor, 2023, Wang and Kim, 2019, AlMamlook, et al., 2019, Mokoatle
    et al., 2019, Arhin and Gatiba, 2019). So, in this study, accuracy is used for
    predicting the performance of ML. 5. Results and discussion 5.1. Distribution
    of occupational accidents In this study, 1542 occupational accident data resulting
    in amputation (1145) and fatality (3 9 7) between the years 2013–2018 were used
    in ML modelling for forecasting causes and result of the accident. Distribution
    of the causes of occupational accidents are shown in Table 3. Table 3. Distrubition

    Other Factors 4 0.35 10 2.52 14 0.91 Machines and hand tools are used a lot in
    the metal sector. For this reason, it was an expected result that the work accident
    caused by the machines would be excessive. 5.2. Feature importance and factor
    analysis In this study, the RFE method was applied for the feature importance
    selection. 10 variables which gives higher rate for feature selectin is given
    in Table 4. Table 4. Feature Importance. Empty Cell Feature Importance 1 2nd cause
    of accident %27 2 Days lost %16 3 Deviation %12 4 Machine %11 5 Part of body injured
    %9 6 Type of injury %5 7 Mode of Injury %4 8 Age %1 9 Total experience at the
    workplace where the accident occurred %0,8 10 Total experience of victim in business
    %0,74 11 Others %13,46 Among 20 variables, the RF algorithm was reapplied by using
    variables whose effect on the result was over 5 % (2nd cause of accident, Days
    lost, Deviation, Machine, Part of body injured) and the obtained accuracy value
    is not change. The effect of these five inputs on the total value is 75 %, which
    is a very high average. For this reason, since the algorithm has already reached
    the best accuracy value by using all inputs, so RFE made no change in the accuracy.
    For this reason, the RFE method was not applied to other ML frameworks. When the
    above table is examined, it is observed that the secondary cause, which is not
    an item of the ESAW methodology, was one of the most important factors. This showed
    us that addition of some extra information to ESAW methodology while making predictions
    about the future in a national dataset. It showed that entering the root causes
    of accidents as an input was quite important. From the resulting feature importances,
    the variables “date of accident” and “educational station of employees” were found
    to have little to no impact on the cause of occupational accident reason. Factors
    influencing accidents were analysed using the frequency of factors belonging to
    high-level input variables derived from functional importance via the permutation
    method. 5.3. Result and comparison of ML frameworks The purpose of this paper
    is forecasting causes of occupational accidents with using ML frameworks such
    as GBM, KNN, RF and RPART Another purpose of this study was to estimate the causes
    and consequences of accidents by using national occupational accident data, and
    to provide data for the policies to be created according to these results. Using
    the same ML methods, companies can also make predictions with their own accident
    data and take preventive measures according to the results. Input variables that
    had the most impact on the estimation results were also determined. In our study,
    we used all available features of the dataset as input for the RF in the first
    phase without using 10-fold cross validation. In this situation accuracy of RF
    was found as 0,8760. While in the second phase of study, we used 10-fold cross
    validation for all ML frameworks. It was determined that the application of the
    10-fold cross validation led to an increase (%4,7 increase) in the RF accuracy
    value. Each ML algorithm’ accuracy results are summarized in Table 5. Table 5.
    Comparison of prediction performance with respect to accuracy. RF GBM RPART KNN
    Precision, recall and f-score results of ML algorithm’ are summarized in Table
    6. Table 6. Comparison of prediction performance of ML algorithm. ML Framework

    Out of the four kinds of ML frameworks performed, the RF and GBM analysis presented
    the highest prediction rate applicable to the field, with a performance of 0.9172
    and 0,9073 accuracy value respectively. Variables selected in each method were
    completely same. When the results were examined, it was seen that RF was the most
    suitable ML method for complex datasets which has many inputs in the dataset,
    and which collects occupational accident data with ESAW methodology. This finding
    has been seen in most studies in the literature. Santos et al. researched the
    literature evaluation of the approaches used in injury severity modelling for
    traffic accidents (Santos et al., 2022). They discovered that RF was the algorithm
    that produced the best results similar to our study. The RF model was used in
    29 percent of the articles they researched. In 70 % of these, the RF model showed
    the highest success rate. For example, Kang et al. (Kang and Ryu, 2019) found
    the accuracy score of the RF algorithm in the construction industry in Korea to
    be 0.713. Poh et al (Poh et al., 2018) found that the RF algorithm provided the
    best prediction performance with an accuracy of 0.78. Chen et al. (Chen and Chen,
    2020) showed that the RF algorithm outperformed other algorithms with an accuracy
    value of 0.7338. In general, based on the summary of the results, when the primary
    focus was the overall performance of the frameworks in predicting occupational
    accident severity, RF achieved highest results. Significant features, can be easily
    determined by using RF. Using 10-fold cross validation for ML frameworks significantly
    improve accuracy. There are 234 features regarding occupational accident dataset
    to measure cause and consequences of the accident. By considering 10 important
    variables identified by RF the prediction process of accident severity. can be
    improved significantly Performances of ML frameworks were compared using all features
    as input. Tree based ensembles showed better performance to predict cause of accident
    due to their better ability to learn non-linear solutions and to scale well on
    large datasets. Government and companies should pay more attention to the 10 most
    important features affecting cause of accident shown in Table 5. 6. Conclusion
    In this study (ML) is used to identify the causes of fatalities and amputations
    in the metal sector based on occupational accident data of metal sector collected
    by the MLSS from 2013 to 2018. Although machine learning algorithms are frequently
    used and successful in different sectors, they are not widely used in the metal
    industry. Our work will be one of the few examples in this sector. We conducted
    the comparison of tree-based ensemble models (RF, KNN.GBM) and ensemble of regression
    algorithms (RPART) to measure severity of occupational accidents. We also identified
    10 significant features by RF which were almost half of all available features
    (Table 4) of the dataset. The comparison ML frameworks indicated that the overall
    performance of the RF model was better than the others because of its high accuracy.
    10-fold cross validation increased accuracy of ML models. To implement preventive
    controls and interventions in a more targeted way, it is recommended to use the
    predictive RF algorithm in the analysis of work accidents in public institutions.
    In our study, it is thought that when a value that is not included in the data
    set is entered in the RF algorithm, it can also be used on live data because the
    prediction rate is high. For future research, we will collect data and develop
    models to predict causes of occupational accident and consequences in real-time
    for reducing occupational accidents. Different ML frameworks such as SVM, DT,
    BN and CART will be used in future research. In this study, only fatal accidents
    and amputations were evaluated. Prediction studies can be carried out by evaluating
    all future occupational accidents independently. In future studies, all occupational
    accidents can be used for ML. CRediT authorship contribution statement Ekin Karakaya

    The growing scarcity of freshwater is one of the main challenges to food security
    and sustainability, where agriculture annually consumes the most water [1]. For
    this purpose, precision agriculture (PA) has achieved significant progress in
    water management and crop production using technological advances in software
    and hardware [2]. Precision irrigation (PI) is the sustainable management of water
    resources, which involves the application of water to the crop to meet specific
    plant water demands in space and time, while avoiding excessive or insufficient
    irrigation and minimizing adverse environmental impacts [3]. In PA, the Variable
    Rate Application (VRA) is the assignment of agricultural inputs in a site-specific
    manner. The correct application of the variable rate needs the specific plant
    requirements, the precise position and the characteristics of the environment
    where the input will be applied. There are two strategies for VRA: Map-based and
    sensor-based. In Map-Based VRA, the prescription map is generated and loaded into
    a computer inside the machinery before it performs its activities on the field
    [4]. Sensor-Based VRA is the technology that integrates sensors for automatically
    detecting the value of specific parameters in the plants or the soil in real-time
    and for deciding which kind and quantity of agricultural input should be applied
    [5]. VRA technologies apply water, fertilizer, herbicide and other chemicals for
    weeds and disease control and seed selection in sowing [6]. The purpose of those
    technologies is to save water, fertilizers and chemicals, increase potential yields
    and the protection of the environment [7]. The variable rate irrigation (VRI)
    technology provides the ability to site-specifically apply water in the field
    to achieve potential water savings [8]; this enables the incorporation of water
    in the soil according to the temporal and spatial soil characteristics and plant
    demand at different growth stages [9]. The VRI technology aims to apply the right
    amount of water at the right time, in the right place of the field, reducing water
    waste and improving water use efficiency (WUE), which is the ratio between biomass
    produced to the rate of transpiration [10], [6]. The effectiveness of VRI depends
    on the delineation of management zones, irrigation infrastructure, crop type,
    weather conditions and field properties such as topography, soil texture and soil
    water retention curves; that influence soil water content and crop irrigation
    prescriptions [11]. Therefore, understanding these factors can provide a basis
    to achieve improvements in crop water productivity and the environment [12]. In
    VRI, water requirements are applied at different rates to appropriately match
    field variability using individual management zones and their real needs instead
    of a homogeneous input application on the field [13]. A management zone is a field
    area with similar attributes in soil and topography. According to the definition
    of management zones, several parameters are considered as crop and soil properties,
    sensor-based information, field attributes, management practices and yield maps
    [14]. The information about irrigation prescriptions in the management zones is
    linked with automatic site-specific irrigation systems using dynamic prescription
    maps [15]. However, these maps can be challenging because the spatiotemporal variations
    on a field are affected by biotic factors such as plant diseases and pest infestation,
    and abiotic factors such as water stress, cold, drought, soil and water salinity
    [16]. The development process for an irrigation prescription map aims to fill
    the spatially variable soil–water profile and use software available with VRI
    hardware, yield, elevation or electrical conductivity maps through precision agriculture
    software or soil–water balance approaches from satellite imagery or wireless sensor
    networks [17]. Additionally, these maps use soil water measurements, soil water
    balance calculations or plant stress-based methods for defining irrigation amounts
    and timing. Volumetric water content (VWC) sensors, soil water profile measurements
    by a neutron probe and soil matric potential (SMP) sensors are the most used technologies
    for irrigation scheduling based on soil water measurements [18]. The magnitude
    of soil water content (SWC) varies with time and location, but the pattern of
    spatial variability usually remains similar [19]. Scheduling using soil water
    balance allows estimating soil–water depletion with good performance through the
    reference evapotranspiration multiplied by the corresponding crop coefficient
    [20]. In addition, process-based and statistical/machine-learning models can determine
    irrigation amounts using soil water balance [21]. These models consider factors
    like data availability, scalability, quantification of plant water stress, model
    uncertainties and constraints, and participation and motivation of producers [22].
    Some plant-based irrigation scheduling strategies use dendrometers [23], sap flow
    sensors [24] or canopy temperature measurements [25], among others. Canopy temperature
    is used for irrigation management because it indirectly indicates plant water
    stress through canopy energy balance. Water stress arises when the quantity of
    water in plant leaves restricts photosynthesis and respiration. In water-stressed
    conditions, transpiration decreases, causing more energy to be converted to sensible
    heat at the canopy surface compared to non-water-stressed conditions. It causes
    plant canopy temperatures to rise above what would occur without water shortages
    [22]. Remote and proximal sensing technologies such as infrared sensors (IRT)
    and near-infrared and thermal imaging measure canopy temperatures. With canopy
    temperature and weather data, it is possible to provide information about environmental,
    soil and crop conditions for VRI and the development of dynamic irrigation prescription
    maps [26]. Canopy temperature can be measured using radiometers filtered to the
    thermal infrared wavelengths , making them non-contact infrared thermometers.
    These devices can measure an area ranging from a few to several according to the
    platform, typically categorized as ground-based, aircraft, or satellite. Ground-based
    platforms can be stationary or moving, with sensors handheld, portable, or on
    moving machinery like center pivots. Moving platforms offer more spatial coverage
    with fewer sensors but trade-off frequency, usually measuring at a single time
    of day at many locations, while stationary devices provide continuous measurements
    at one field location [27]. Satellite remote sensing includes constraints associated
    with the spatial and temporal resolution and the cost and durability of sensors
    and associated components required for wireless data transmission. The Unmanned
    Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer several advantages for canopy temperature measurements,
    including a spatial resolution of several meters, a repeat frequency of no more
    than a few days, and a short interval from field measurement to data availability,
    typically just a few minutes. These advantages complement the essential requirements
    of reasonable instrument cost, precision, accuracy, and the ability to cover a
    significant field area. However, regulatory barriers exist for flying UAVs in
    certain regions [28]. Questions have arisen regarding the economic viability of
    utilizing UAV platforms for thermal imaging due to the cost and the extensive
    post-processing needed to generate reliably accurate thermometric images of a
    field [29]. Ground-based sensors, such as canopy temperature measured by stationary
    IRTs offer advantages over satellite and aircraft thermal imagers for agricultural
    use, including simplicity, lower cost, lower power consumption, and, most importantly,
    higher accuracy [30]. Achieving adequate field coverage needs a relatively large
    number of sensors, which would depend on factors such as field slope, soil variability,
    crop profitability, and sensor cost. The main types of algorithms used in irrigation
    management with IRTs are water stress indices and time–temperature thresholds
    (TTT) [27]. The crop water stress index (CWSI) and integrated CWSI (iCWSI) provide
    irrigation trigger information through the cooling effect due to plant transpiration
    based on the normalized function of vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and temperature
    difference between canopy and air [22]. The biologically identified optimal temperature
    interactive console (BIOTIC, [31]) is the fundamental principle for the definition
    of the TTT. The crop canopy temperature is measured using IRT sensors and compared
    with a crop-specific temperature threshold value [32]. The daily total amount
    is increased by one minute for each minute that the canopy temperature is higher
    than the temperature threshold. If this total daily value exceeds the time threshold
    at the end of the day, an irrigation amount is scheduled for the next day, corresponding
    to the daily crop evapotranspiration [36]. Other constraints are established for
    the addition of minutes to the daily total value in the TTT calculations, the
    net radiation must be greater than [33] and minutes are not added if the wet-bulb
    temperature is greater than the threshold temperature minus , because relative
    humidity can limit cooling by evaporation. [34] found equation (1), to determine
    the wet-bulb temperature using relative humidity and air temperature values. (1)
    The TTT plant stress-based method is easily automated in the field, installing
    IRT sensors in fixed locations. When sensors are not stationary, canopy temperatures
    are modelled according to sensors in a reference location using equation (2) [35].
    (2) where is the calculated canopy temperature at the remote location (°C)and
    is the predawn canopy temperature (°C). is the canopy temperature at the remote
    location on the center pivot, at any daylight time measured by the IRT sensor
    (°C) and is the reference canopy temperature at the same interval as (°C), is
    the measured reference temperature at the same time as when the remote temperature
    measurement was taken (°C). For adjusting canopy temperature values, [36] advise
    to use an adjusted equation for temperatures detected by the IRT sensor ( ) using
    the sensor body temperature ( ) as in equation (3). (3) The CWSI uses the variation
    in canopy temperature as a function of water deficits and meteorological conditions
    [18]. It relates the difference in the crop canopy temperature measured using
    IRT sensors to the air temperature as a function of relative humidity [37]. The
    water stress index uses this temperature difference according to an upper and
    lower temperature baseline. Under the same prevailing environmental conditions,
    the upper and lower baseline temperatures determine the non-transpiring and fully
    transpiring crop temperatures [38]. The CWSI is a dimensionless value in a range
    between 0 and 1. A well-watered crop corresponds to 0, and a severely water-stressed
    cultivation corresponds to 1 [37]. The concept was extended to moving IRTs aboard
    center pivots, resulting in crop yield and water use efficiency comparable to
    or greater than manual irrigation scheduling using soil water profile measurements
    with a neutron probe [39]. Several studies have focused on developing ground-based
    remote sensing systems for center pivots, including algorithms [40], wireless
    sensor networks [27], low-cost wireless IRT networks [41], and software to generate
    site-specific prescription maps based on weather, plant, and soil water information,
    with a graphical user interface (GUI) and geographic information system (GIS)
    tools, enabling site-specific irrigation scheduling for variable-rate irrigation
    (VRI) center pivot systems [42], [43]. Irrigation scheduling methods based on
    IRT sensors have been applied to corn [44], grain sorghum [45], soybean [25],
    hibiscus potted plants [46], apple trees [47], [48], Indian mustard [49] and cotton
    [50] crops. In [28], IRT sensors were implemented in a center-pivot irrigation
    system to calculate crop evapotranspiration (ETc). These sensors use a two-source
    energy balance (TSEB) model and provide a reduction of errors in ETc and crop
    water stress calculations by partitioning surface temperature into soil and canopy
    components. [51] applied the TTT method to a center-pivot irrigation system with
    infrared thermocouples and a global positioning system mounted on the center pivot
    for a soybean crop. Irrigation prescriptions were defined with the data analysis
    after midnight to determine the next-day strategy. Irrigation was applied in only
    one direction using special nozzles. The sensors corrected the canopy temperatures
    on the center pivot using soil IRT sensors obtaining the correction equation (4).
    (4) [50] used canopy temperature sensors on the center pivot for obtaining the
    Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) by equation (5). (5) where is the crop temperature,
    is the average temperature of a wet reference and is obtained adding to the maximum
    dry bulb temperature recorded for the specific field day. [15] demonstrated the
    advantage of IRT sensors mounted on a center pivot with a global positioning system
    to provide spatial and temporal crop water status at the field scale. While most
    precision irrigation technology is too expensive and complex for average farmers,
    methods involving IRTs may become more appealing due to their lower costs and
    simplicity. This technology has the potential to simplify management while increasing
    yields and reducing water-related waste, making it an attractive option for producers
    [35]. IRTs on center pivots and irrigation scheduling algorithms have resulted
    in crop yields and water productivity equal to or greater than those achieved
    with soil water measurements and a field-calibrated neutron probe. Combining stationary
    IRT measurements with moving IRT arrays enhances the effectiveness of irrigation
    scheduling algorithms. Stationary measurements offer time series data while moving
    arrays provide spatially distributed data [52], [30]. Wireless data transmission
    is now accessible for IRTs, eliminating the need for cumbersome wiring and enhancing
    the ease of deploying IRTs in various settings [53], [54]. Furthermore, researchers
    use extensive datasets with canopy temperature and corresponding weather information.
    These datasets, in conjunction with machine learning, artificial neural networks
    and deep learning techniques, are being employed alongside energy balance models
    to estimate thermal stress indices and facilitate irrigation scheduling [55],
    [56]. Employing infrared thermocouples (IRTCs) on self-propelled irrigation systems
    such as center pivots present several challenges: - Estimating daily canopy temperature
    dynamics from a single measurement at each field location is challenging due to
    the uncertainty associated with the timing of these measurements [35]. - It requires
    automatic data collection and analysis to control the irrigation system based
    on the canopy temperature data [35]. - If a self-propelled irrigation system is
    in motion, it has made an irrigation decision based on prescription maps unless
    it acquires data moving without irrigating [35]. - The misalignment of the IRTCs
    over the rows occurs as the pivot moves around the field [35]. - The time–temperature
    threshold (TTT) and crop water stress indexes are canopy temperature-based algorithms
    that do not distinguish between soil and canopy temperature. This lack of distinction,
    even though differences can exceed 30 °C, can affect the apparent surface temperature,
    particularly during partial canopy cover. Consequently, instances of unnecessary
    irrigation events occurring early in the season, before full canopy cover, have
    been reported [45], [28]. - Concerns have arisen that the deflection of moving
    irrigation systems and other factors may degrade moving IRT measurements relative
    to stationary IRT measurements [30]. - Specialized hardware and software systems
    exist for defining irrigation prescription maps based on weather, plant, and soil
    water information. This software incorporates site-specific irrigation scheduling
    methods and automates the data collection and processing obtained from sensing
    systems. However, it only defines static irrigation prescription maps and does
    not facilitate real-time water application in the field [43]. - Calculation methods
    typically employ the empirical upper and lower limits of the temperature difference
    between canopy and air to estimate CWSI and iCWSI based on the standardized temperature
    difference. This approach introduces irreducible uncertainty and error [22]. -
    Existing precision irrigation tools often have inadequate user interfaces, making
    them difficult to use and resulting in a poor user experience [57]. Additionally,
    low accuracy characterizes these tools, leading to the reluctance of producers
    to adopt them [58]. - Most current precision irrigation decision-support systems
    assume that producers strictly adhere to the recommended irrigation decisions
    for each event without allowing any flexibility in the irrigation timing [22].
    - The increasing adoption of infrared thermometers (IRT) for crop irrigation management
    has contributed to the growth of surface temperature datasets. This trend emphasizes
    the need to develop data quality assurance and control (QA/QC) procedures like
    those used for agricultural weather station data [53]. - In-situ sensors currently
    available in markets are typically expensive or not cost-effective enough for
    widespread adoption. Furthermore, they often require installation and removal
    before and after the growing season for row crops, resulting in additional labor
    costs [59], [22]. According to the references consulted, there is a wide range
    of research opportunities and challenges in the commercial implementation of this
    technology. Further studies are needed to determine how to integrate the information
    acquired from IRT sensors and automatic irrigation application systems to prescribe
    and apply the site-specific irrigation needs in real-time during the growing season,
    using soil and crop characteristics under different environments [15], [6]. Currently,
    systems acquire data from the field and generate irrigation prescription maps
    before the irrigation procedure (static maps). This study aims to develop an innovative
    system for mapping real-time canopy temperature and defining prescriptions using
    IRT sensors on a center pivot and GPS data while the center pivot moves on the
    field. The proposed system consists of hardware and software developments whose
    final goal is to provide farm managers with accurate and frequently updated information
    about crop irrigation requirements. This paper shows only the real-time canopy
    temperature system. The prescription mechanism and the proposed system comparison
    with others will be reported in other publications. 2. Materials and methods The
    study was conducted from the Farm Services Unit of E.V. Smith Research Center
    in Shorter, Auburn University, Alabama, USA (32° 26′ 15″ N, 85° 54′ 57″ W, and
    32 masl), during the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons. The field experiences a subtropical
    humid (Cfa) climate, with average low and high temperatures of and , respectively,
    and an annual rainfall of (https://awis.aumesonet.com/). The same corn hybrid
    (Dekalb DKC62-08, Bayer Corp., Whippany, N.J.) was planted in both years. In 2018,
    the corn was planted in concentric rows, while in 2019, it was planted in straight
    rows at a row spacing of and a population density of [60]. Soil texture, bulk
    density, and soil water retention curves (SWRC) were determined at five points
    within the experimental area. These properties were measured at soil depths of
    , , and at each location. The percentage by mass of sand, clay, and silt was determined
    by a commercial soil laboratory (Water Agricultural Laboratories, Camilla, Ga.).
    Saturated undisturbed soil cores were analyzed using a hydraulic property analyzer
    (HYPROP 2, Meter Group, Pullman, Wash.) to establish the relationship between
    soil matric potential and volumetric soil water content (VWC) [61]. The soil matric
    potential of saturated undisturbed cores, measured with the hydraulic property
    analyzer, ranged from 0 to 0.08 MPa. Additionally, a dew point hygrometer (WP4C
    PotentiaMeter, Meter Group) was employed to determine the VWC versus soil matric
    potential relationship at 0.63, 1.5, and 3.3 MPa using disturbed soil samples.
    The data from both instruments were processed using HYPROP-FIT software (ver.
    4.1.0.0, Meter Group, https://library.metergroup.com/Manuals/UMS/HYPROP-FIT_Manual.pdf)
    to generate soil water retention curves (SWRCs) based on the traditional unconstrained
    van Genuchten model [62]. The volumetric soil water content (VWC) at field capacity
    (FC) was determined for all locations, while the permanent wilting point (PWP)
    was established at a soil matric potential of 1.5 MPa. Soil bulk density was calculated
    by dividing the weight of dry soil (oven-dried at 105 °C until reaching a constant
    weight) by its volume, using undisturbed soil cores. The experiment took place
    in a field irrigated by a seven-span, half-circle center pivot irrigation system
    covering 30 ha. The system (model 7000, Valmont Industries, Valley, Neb.) had
    a lateral length of 434 m and operated with a flow rate of 181.7 cubic meters
    per hour, with a line pressure at the pivot point of 0.241 MPa. Equipped with
    a middle-elevation spray application (MESA) sprinkler package, the system included
    pressure regulators rated at 0.103 MPa. It was retrofitted with a variable-rate
    irrigation (VRI) system featuring solenoid valves to control water application
    over each half span. Each half span, approximately 31 m in length, represented
    a grid of 2° arc, allowing for the prescription of a single irrigation rate for
    the group of sprinklers within each half span. The experiment utilized full and
    limited irrigation treatments, designated as T100 (100 % soil water replenishment
    to field capacity), T66 (66 % replenishment of T100), and T33 (33 % replenishment
    of T100). A randomized complete block design was implemented with three treatments
    and four replications in 2018 (12 plots) and six replications in 2019 (18 plots).
    Soil water content (VWC) in the root zone was measured using a time domain reflectometer
    (TDR-315L, Acclima, Meridian, Ida.) and a capacitance-type soil water sensor (ECH2O
    EC-5, Meter Group) at three depths. In 2018, sensors were installed from 21 May
    to 30 August, while in 2019, they were installed from 23 April to 5 August. For
    the T100 treatments, VWC changes (except for replication 1 in 2018) were monitored
    using TDR-315L and EC-5 sensors at 0.15, 0.3, and 0.6 m soil depths. The T66 and
    T33 treatments were assessed using only EC-5 sensors at the same soil depths as
    the T100 treatments. Dataloggers (Aquatrac, AgSense, Valmont Industries, Inc.,
    Huron, S.D., and model Em50, Meter Group) recorded VWC values at 30-minute intervals.
    Aquatrac dataloggers were used for TDR-315L sensors, while Em50 dataloggers were
    used for EC-5 sensors. Data collection began on 21 May 2018 and 28 April 2019.
    Irrigation rates were determined using VWC data from TDR-315L sensors in the T100
    treatment to replenish soil water to field capacity (FC) at a depth of 0.6 m.
    When soil water depletion from any T100 treatment reached 50 % of plant-available
    water (PAW), irrigation was applied to all treatments. The irrigation rate for
    each block was calculated based on the T100 treatment. For T66 and T33 treatments,
    irrigation rates were 66 % and 33 % of the T100 rate, respectively. Soil water
    depletion (SWD) was calculated by summing the depletion at each soil layer using
    data from four TDR-315L sensors in 2018 and three TDR-315L sensors in 2019. The
    irrigation prescription map was generated using Valley VRI (model 8.55, Valmont
    Industries, Valley, Neb.) and uploaded remotely to the Valley Pro2 panel located
    at the pivot point. Canopy temperature data were recorded using wireless IRT sensors
    (SapIP-IRT, Dynamax, Houston, Tex.) installed on a stationary mast in each experimental
    plot. IRT data collection began on May 13, 2018, and May 7, 2019, corresponding
    to the V7 vegetative growth stage. IRTs were installed 1 m above the canopy in
    the same crop row and 1.5 m from soil water sensors. Each IRT sensor targets the
    crop row throughout the growing season. Additionally, twelve IRT sensors (SapIP-IRT,
    Dynamax, Houston, Tex.) were installed on span 2 in 2018 and on span 7 in 2019,
    collecting data while the center pivot was moving. Dynamax IRT sensors were calibrated
    by the company before the experiments. IRT location accuracy was determined using
    a real-time kinematic (RTK) 297 Trimble GPS (Trimble Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA).
    The design principle follows the concept of a wireless sensor network (WSN) [63].
    The system has a set of IRT sensors installed on a center pivot, a global positioning
    system node (GPS), which communicates with a central or main station using a Zigbee
    protocol (IEEE 802.15.4). The central station uses an embedded computer (EC).
    The CE is responsible for data acquisition from the IRT sensors and performing
    water stress indices, storing the information in a database, configuring the capture
    modules, and interacting with the user through a graphic user interface (GUI).
    Irrigation prescriptions with IRT sensors measurements on the center pivot were
    modeled using the machine learning models NARX (Nonlinear Autoregressive Network
    with Exogenous Inputs) and LSTM (Long short-term memory), adjusting the best hyperparameters
    and using as inputs the air temperature and relative humidity, canopy temperature
    of sensors on stationary masts, canopy temperature of sensors installed aboard
    the central pivot and as output the corresponding irrigation prescription. This
    procedure is not the scope of this article, and details will be explained in forthcoming
    publications. The proposed system design for canopy temperature monitoring and
    water balance estimation in a center pivot involves hardware and software integration
    and communication components. This section describes the electronic devices required
    to satisfy the requirements defined in the research. First, the hardware for the
    IRT system, the GPS system and the embedded computer are presented, with a justification
    of their suitability and an exposition of their main features. Then, is discussed
    the methodological aspects of the software development process. Finally, are introduced
    the underlying mapping algorithms of canopy temperature. 2.1. Hardware components
    description Wireless sensor node architecture includes twelve SapIP-IRT Infrared
    Leaf Temperature (Dynamax, Inc., Houston, TX), equipped with an XBee RF module
    (Digi International, Minnetonka, Minn.). The SapIP-IRT has a highly accurate reading
    of , is very stable over time, and has a signal window and field of view (FOV).
    For a one-meter-wide target, the IRT must place three meters above the item or
    surface to measure (20 degrees FOV). Zigbee specifications are and a range of
    with a omnidirectional antenna - (high gain), rechargeable batteries, typical
    current of . The maximum battery voltage during charging is , and the minimum

    sensors, GPS receiver and server in the center pivot. The wireless GPS node in
    the center pivot end-tower uses a raspberry pi zero board, a solar panel, a 12
    V battery and a Garmin GLO GPS. GLO can receive position information from the
    GPS and the GLONASS satellite constellations, allowing it to connect to up to
    24 more satellites than devices that rely on GPS alone. The GLO GPS locks on satellites
    approximately 20 percent faster and remain connected even at high speed. GLO updates
    its position information ten times per second with WAAS, an accuracy of 3 m and
    12 h of battery life. The 12 IRT sensors mounted onto the center pivot acquire
    crop canopy temperature. Sensors and GPS node transmit temperature and geolocation
    data to the central station, that is, a small computer Raspberry Pi3 (Raspberry-Pi®
    Foundation North America, Inc) at the pivot point with Zigbee 2.4 GHz protocol
    and an algorithm developed in the Python programming platform (Python Software
    Foundation, version 3, Netherlands) for managing and visualizing data, and defining
    irrigation prescription. 2.2. Software development process According to [50],
    for an IRT sensor located on the pivot, the cover surface can be approximated
    as an elliptical footprint with the vertical axis (Fig. 2). The equation used
    to calculate the area and characteristics of that elliptical footprint was defined
    using Fig. 3. This figure shows the geometrical dimensions of the cover surface
    pattern. The parameters defined are : horizontal distance from the pivot lateral
    to the ellipse starting point, : horizontal distance from the pivot lateral to
    the point with the highest temperature value acquired by the IRT sensor, horizontal
    distance from the pivot lateral to the ellipse center and : the horizontal distance
    from the pivot lateral to the ellipse endpoint. , and represent the optical path
    length from the IRT sensor to , and , respectively. is the angle between the vertical

    angle to the of FOV, mounted on a pivot lateral ( above the ground), (in the horizontal
    plane) from the edge of a treatment plot, will have a resolution of approximately
    of crop surface and with FOV approximately of crop surface. Fig. 4 specifies the

    the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84). These coordinates where stored in three
    variables: , and These locations were converted to Universal Transverse Mercator

    the UTM coordinates, equations (19), (20). (19) (20) To calculate the distance

    battery voltage, target IR temperature degrees Celsius resolution), and sensor
    body temperature. For example, the frame: corresponds to sensor 305, reading of
    canopy temperature. The algorithm uses a list of IRT serial numbers with codes
    of the 12 sensors installed on the pivot. This list contains 12 strings, equation
    (22). (22) Additionally, the code uses a dictionary with 12 key-value pairs. The
    keys correspond to the 12 serial numbers and a list of values acquired by 12 IRT

    Mapping Tool supports the system configuration (sensors, GPS node data acquisition
    and other parameters), data processing and map visualization. The design principles
    for the Infrared Mapping Tool in real-time were that it should provide the most
    accurate and site-specific information we could offer the irrigation manager with
    the selected technology. In addition, the Infrared Mapping Tool requires minimum
    user input, is very easy to manage and provides ready-to-use data output to irrigation
    prescriptions in real-time. The Infrared Mapping Tool can operate with Raspbian
    or Windows operative systems. This tool records data in plain text format (.txt)
    inside its memory block and in an external pen drive and generates a shape file
    with the information in real-time from the sensors and their locations. The system
    uses a VNC (Virtual Network Computing) connection for monitoring remotely using
    WIFI communication protocols, and data is sent to a server for processing after
    the acquisition if there is an internet connection. The central station uses a
    Raspberry Pi with a 3.2 in. touch screen. After the initial setup, the user interacts
    with the Main Screen (Fig. 7). If the system configuration does not need modifications,

    role in achieving the sustainability of food production and ensuring regional
    water security [64]. Producers rely on personal experience and weather data to
    determine when and how much to irrigate using center pivot systems. A survey found
    that over 75 % of U.S. irrigation scheduling methods rely on rules of thumb like
    crop calendars and neighbor practices, while less than 25 % use science or technology-based
    approaches [65]. According to the recent advances, challenges and opportunities
    of precision irrigation described by [22], the most important topics are data
    availability and scalability, quantification of plant water stress, model uncertainties
    and constraints, and the participation of producers and motivation. Table 2 shows
    the challenges and contributions of the proposed system in this research. Table

    The developed system significantly enhances precision irrigation practices by
    enabling real-time water application according to crop water demand. This information
    allows for optimal irrigation precise determination timing and amounts across
    the field. Unlike conventional infrared thermography (IRT) sensor systems on center
    pivots, which generate static water need maps [42], [43], our system offers dynamic,
    real-time irrigation prescriptions with application in dynamic variable-rate technologies
    that adjust irrigation rates based on the changing conditions within the field.
    These prescriptions are vital because they consider the spatial and temporal variations
    in crop growth, crop water status, and soil water availability throughout the
    growing season. This capability represents a significant advancement in precision
    irrigation technology. The adoption of precision irrigation tools depends on their
    accuracy and user-friendly interfaces [57]. Our system provides an intuitive interface
    and dynamic decision-making, empowering farmers with the capability to make informed
    decisions about when to start or stop irrigation. Swift updates based on soil
    and plant conditions are crucial if irrigation is postponed [22], and real-time
    mapping eliminates the need for acquiring new data for the entire field and generating
    new prescription maps. Additional calibrations beyond the manufacturer''s factory
    settings were not applied to Dynamax IRT sensors (Dynamax, Inc., Houston, TX).
    A study conducted in a controlled temperature chamber showed that root mean squared
    errors between factory-calibrated IRT brightness and black-body temperatures (ranging
    from 15 °C to 55 °C) were mostly within 0.75 °C, while ambient temperatures in
    the chamber were varied from 15 °C to 45 °C. However, the temperature differences
    between the target and ambient temperatures in the controlled chamber (up to 40
    °C) were much larger than those typically encountered in field conditions (10)°C).
    Field testing using a lysimeter indicated that post-factory calibration versus
    factory calibration had minimal impact on calculated crop evapotranspiration [66].
    This suggests that an additional post-factory, sensor-specific calibration would
    have little justification over using only factory-calibrated temperatures in the
    field. Moreover, conducting a post-factory calibration over a range of ambient
    and target temperatures would necessitate a blackbody surface and chamber with
    variable temperature control, equipment that is rarely available [53]. Therefore,
    IRT data that solely rely on factory calibration are more likely to be suitable
    for practical applications in this project. The ZigBee Remote Control protocol
    offers several significant advantages over other systems. It provides low-power
    transmission, robustness, high security, and high scalability, with the ability
    to support high node density. Additionally, it leverages wireless control and
    sensor networks in IoT applications [67]. In wireless communication systems deployed
    in agricultural fields, security and privacy are crucial to ensure data confidentiality.
    Zigbee addresses these concerns by employing the 128-bit advanced encryption standard
    (AES) [68]. The AES algorithm encrypts the data and verifies data integrity using
    a message authentication code generated by encrypting the IEEE MAC frame. Xbee
    modules use the AES-CTR mode for encrypting the payload. Compared to IEEE 802.15.4,
    Zigbee adds two extra security layers to the network and application layers, utilizing
    AES 128-bit encryption. The distributed security model is limited to routers and
    end devices. If a router detects a powered-up existing network, it can join the
    secured network; otherwise, it can form a distributed secured network and assign
    network keys to newly joined routers and end devices. While this model is simple,
    it does not offer the highest level of security. We use the centralized security
    model, which is more complex and secure than the distributed model. The network
    coordinator is responsible for authenticating and validating each device attempting
    to join the network [69]. While these encryptions enhance security, they limit
    the delay in network communications (latency), the speed at which data is transmitted
    (throughput), link quality, power consumption and longevity of the network. However,
    the increased energy consumption for encryption is recommended in agricultural
    IoT applications [70]. Security measures implementation can significantly enhance
    the security of Zigbee networks. Nevertheless, like any technology, the effectiveness
    of security measures depends on how they are implemented and maintained [71].
    Without adequate security configurations, Xbee devices are vulnerable. These devices
    are built with a preconfigured global link key, making them susceptible to man-in-the-middle
    attacks. The equipment in IRT sensors and central station should be placed in
    protective enclosures to prevent damage from insects, rodents, and weather conditions.
    These enclosures must be both weatherproof and tamper-resistant. Environmental
    sealing can protect against moisture and dust, which can negatively impact the
    performance of electronic components. Adequate ventilation may also be necessary
    to prevent overheating. It is recommended to use reliable power sources, such
    as solar panels or batteries, to ensure the continuous operation of the electronic
    system. Backup power sources may be required in the event of power outages. Dynamax
    IRT sensors offer remote monitoring capabilities, enabling the tracking of the
    electronic system''s performance and the detection of any issues related to the
    power system. Regular inspection and maintenance of the electronic system are
    crucial to ensure optimal performance. This includes checking for signs of damage,
    cleaning components, and replacing worn-out parts. Preventive maintenance was
    conducted monthly, while general corrective maintenance and functional tests were
    performed whenever the sensors were installed on the central pivot, and the routers
    and central station were placed in the field. To prevent damage from rodents,
    all exposed cables near the soil were covered with flexible metal tubes. The scalability
    in the developed systems depends on the transceiver devices used in the wireless
    sensor network. ZigBee networks offer several benefits, particularly in large-scale
    deployments, due to their energy efficiency and flexibility. [72] refers to Zigbee
    networks as personal area networks (PANs) and states that each network has a unique
    PAN identifier (PAN ID) shared among all devices in the network. Zigbee devices
    can join a network by either being preconfigured with a PAN ID or by discovering
    nearby networks and selecting a PAN ID to join. Zigbee defines three device types:
    coordinator, router, and end-device [73]. In Zigbee networks, there should be
    only one Coordinator node per network, serving as the controller responsible for
    selecting the network channel, organizing the network, and synchronizing the wireless
    sensor network. The coordinator selects the channel, PAN ID, security policy,
    and stack profile for the network. It initiates the network, selects the channel
    and PAN ID (64-bit and 16-bit), and manages other functions that define, secure,
    and maintain the network. Routers are responsible for maintaining the infrastructure
    of the ZigBee network. These nodes do not gather data or start the message transmission
    but only transmit data from router to router or from the end devices to the coordinator.
    These devices cannot sleep and must always remain powered on. Finally, end-devices
    do not route. They are responsible for gathering data and delivering it to the
    nearby router or coordinator. The scalability of the proposed system in this paper
    does not have restrictions by communication infrastructure because designers have
    made all ZigBee nodes small, lightweight, and energy-efficient, allowing the connection
    of up to 65,535 nodes [74]. Dynamax utilizes the IRT SALH data logger system,
    housed in a weatherproof enclosure, which can link to repeaters to collect data
    from up to 25 wireless IRT sensors and three routers [75]. In this research, we
    designed and implemented a datalogger that allows the connection of more IRT sensors,
    integrating one coordinator, multiple end-devices and routers, leveraging the
    capabilities of ZigBee technology and improving system scalability. Table 3 lists
    the required hardware for implementing the wireless sensor, GPS, and central station
    nodes, along with their current costs. The number of wireless sensor nodes used
    depends on the central pivot size, and a span can accommodate several IRT sensors.
    Based on the current design and the study field characteristics, the cost of implementing
    the entire hardware in the center pivot with twelve SapIP-IRT Infrared Leaf Temperature
    (Dynamax, Inc., Houston, TX) nodes is US$8,964.32. We implemented this hardware
    to ensure the system performs correctly. One key focus of future work is reducing
    implementation costs and optimizing modules'' energy consumption. Table 3. Costs

    1461.11 According to the University of Georgia’s crop production budget [76],
    a center pivot irrigation system can consume diesel and electricity per every

    373.36 313.22 195.05 Reviewing the current procedure for canopy sensors on central
    pivot systems reveals the need to move the pivot across the field, acquire data
    along its path, generate irrigation prescription maps, and adjust pivot movement
    for irrigation based on these prescriptions [42], [43]. Additionally, any incidental
    rain or operational problems with the central pivot that render the system inoperable
    for hours or days render the initial prescription obsolete, necessitating new
    routes for new prescriptions. The system proposed in this research addresses these
    challenges. Moreover, by eliminating field steps required for generating irrigation
    maps, the operating costs of the center pivot are reduced respect to Table 4.
    It is important to note that the values presented in Table 4 do not include these
    data acquisition processes, which contribute to higher implementation and operation
    costs when using the conventional mapping method with IRT sensors on the center
    pivot. 4. Conclusions The proposed technology contributes to agricultural irrigation
    management through its cost-effective implementation and capabilities of mapping
    crop canopy temperatures using a wireless network of infrared thermometers on
    a center pivot. It incorporates Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) with scalability
    options, IoT capabilities, and web data availability. The technology enables precise
    plant water stress quantification based on canopy temperature and soil water content,
    facilitating real-time irrigation prescriptions while the center pivot is in motion
    on the field. Canopy temperature sensors do not require additional calibration,
    guaranteeing highly accurate readings of +/- 0.5 °C. Enhancing the GPS receiver
    accuracy is imperative because it guarantees the determination of the sensor''s
    position on the center pivot. GLO2 GPS can receive position information from GPS
    and GLONASS satellite constellations, can use 24 extra satellites to lock approximately
    20 % faster and remain connected even at high speed but with an accuracy of 3
    m. To enhance the GPS module, we can use receivers with Differential Global Positioning
    System (DGPS) as Real-time kinematic positioning (RTK) or augmentation systems
    such as Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) in U.S.A. or European Geostationary
    Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) in Europe. NARX and LSTM neural network models
    were trained to predict irrigation prescriptions using ambient temperature, relative
    humidity, and plant cover temperature as input data. These temperatures were measured
    by the sensors installed on the ground and aboard the central pivot. The irrigation
    prescription was used as output data. They achieved RMSE values ranging from 0.56
    mm to 4.18 mm in RMSE. Additionally, the correlation coefficient values exceeded
    0.8, indicating that the models effectively tracked the irrigation prescription
    behavior using canopy temperature sensors. Several research activities are proposed
    as future work. Exploring LoRaWAN technologies can enhance transmission distances,
    thus improving the efficiency and reach of sensor networks. Additionally, efforts
    to reduce the costs of sensors and data acquisition systems can continue, making
    these technologies more accessible to farmers. Another promising area is the development
    of algorithms for fusing data from ground, drone, and satellite sources, which
    could significantly enhance spatial resolution in irrigation management. Furthermore,
    research focusing on refining irrigation prescription models in diverse environments
    and improving irrigation amount calculations based on soil water demand and plant
    physiological regulations is essential. Finally, researchers must develop models
    that consider the effects of measurements in soil rows and crop plants. This research

  description: The sustainable development goals (SDGs) of the United Nations seek
    to promote an agriculture sector that can lead change on both a local and global
    scale. By helping farmers to produce more food sustainably, Internet of Things
    (IoT)-based agriculture management solutions are significantly contributing to
    the achievement of these SDGs. By 2050, the world's population is expected to
    reach 9.7 billion, necessitating a 60% increase in food production efficiency
    and security in order to meet the growing population's demands. Smart farming
    powered by the IoT and utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning
    (ML) algorithms is becoming a viable and sustainable method for increasing agricultural
    productivity and reducing environmental impact. The newest research and development
    initiatives in IoT-based smart farming are summarized in this comprehensive review
    article, along with how they might change the agricultural sector. The study gives
    a general overview of the machine abilities that smart farming is supported by,
    including perception, reasoning and learning, communication, task planning and
    execution, and systems integration. The use of robots and unmanned aerial vehicles
    (UAVs) in diverse agricultural contexts is also demonstrated in the paper, indicating
    the potential for improved productivity and diminished environmental effect. The
    report concludes by highlighting the significance of utilizing wireless communication
    LoraWan technology in the creation of smart systems that can further enable sustainable
    agriculture management.

    development goals (SDGs) that aim to create impactful agriculture industry. Artificial
    intelligence (AI) and Internet of things (IoT)-based smart farming technologies
    are transforming the agriculture industry from seedling cultivation to food processing.
    The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of UN projects that by 2050, the world’s
    population will further increase by 2 billion, putting more stress on agricultural
    land and food production (Colizzi et al., 2020). AI-based IoT and machine learning
    technologies are being developed to improve agricultural productivity and reduce
    waste (Navarro et al., 2020, Kakamoukas et al., 2021, Mahbub, 2020). Moreover,
    smart farming technologies use digital tools to improve agriculture efficiency,
    productivity, and sustainability. The growth of smart farming drives the development
    of the digital economy through new market opportunities, increased transparency,
    and addressing challenges, such as, climate change. Smart farming combines AI
    and IoT with the conventional farming techniques to improve agriculture efficiency
    and productivity through data-driven decisions. It is the key component of Agriculture
    4.0, the fourth agriculture revolution, promoting smart cultivation and crop management
    (Javaid et al., 2022, Monteleone et al., 2020;20:7091., Singh and Yogi, 2022,
    Torky and Hassanein, 2020, Navarro et al., 2020). Additionally, the second UN
    Sustainable Development Goal (SDG-2) of eradicating hunger can be accomplished
    with the help of the integration of AI and IoT technology in the agriculture sector.
    In addition to increasing agricultural output and efficiency, AI-based IoT farming
    can give farmers useful insights and decision-making tools that are based on current
    data. AI systems, for example, may assess information from sensors and other field
    equipment to maximise fertilisation and irrigation, reducing waste and ultimately
    improving crop quality. Furthermore, IoT-enabled monitoring tools can help with
    the early detection of diseases and pests, allowing farmers to respond right away
    and minimise damage to their crops. Another way that AI and IoT may help SDG-2
    is by promoting sustainable agriculture to minimise hunger. For instance, AI systems
    may instruct farmers to use electricity, water, and fertilizer efficiently, reducing
    their environmental effect and protecting natural resources. IoT sensors can also
    be used to gather data on how climate change is affecting crops and monitor the
    condition of the soil, allowing farmers to adapt their practices and increase
    crop resilience. Moreover, through enhancing supply chain management and distribution
    networks, AI and IoT can also be crucial in minimising food waste and enhancing
    food security. For instance, AI algorithms can assist in balancing supply and
    demand, lowering food waste throughout the supply chain and enhancing access to
    wholesome food (Maraveas et al., 2022). Researchers and agriculturists are working
    towards achieving the goal of a sustainable farming by developing smart systems.
    These systems utilize advanced technologies, like, AI and IoT to gather and analyze
    data, enabling informed decisions about farming practices. The aim is to improve
    agricultural productivity and optimize crop management while promoting smart farming
    through sustainable practices (Kumar and Sharma, 2020, Lohchab et al., 2018, Igri
    et al., 2022), intelliegent techniques (Hsu et al., 2020, Miloudi et al., 2019,
    Chen and Yeh, 2020) and predictive tools for the smart farming based on AI and
    IoT to ensure precision agriculture (Ehiakpor et al., 2021, Akinyi, 2022, Martin
    et al., 2020, Mahbub, 2020, Javaid et al., 2022). AI and IoT-based smart farming
    can greatly contribute to the stability and diversity of ecological functions
    that support food production and other agricultural ecosystems. The use of these
    technologies can lead to improved decision-making and optimized farming procedures
    and practices that result in a more sustainable and efficient use of resources.
    This leads to a much healthier and more resilient agricultural ecosystem, which
    is essential for long-term food production and the preservation of the natural
    environment (Sharma et al., 2022). Though, may be, the IoT and AI-based smart
    farming could also be considered a risky investment because it might lead the
    business towards a tight profit margin or sometimes may cause uncertain yields.
    However, agriculture plays a significant role in the global economy, contributing
    approximately 3 % to the gross domestic product (GDP) worldwide. However, in Least
    Developed Countries (LDCs), the agricultural sector can have a much larger impact,
    accounting for up to 60 % of their national GDP, as reported by the FAO and World
    Bank data (Beckman and Countryman, 2021, Havemann et al., 2020). The world''s
    population is growing and so is the demand for food. By 2050, food production
    must increase by 70 % to meet this demand, which require improving existing agricultural
    practices and the introduction of technology to increase productivity and food
    security (Khan et al., 2021, Monteleone et al., 2020;20:7091.). The Food and FAO
    defines Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) as a set of guidelines for producing
    safe and healthy food, and non-food agricultural products in a more sustainable
    manner. GAP encompasses all aspects of agricultural production, from on-farm procedures
    to post-production processes, and considers the ecosocial, and environmental impact
    of agriculture on earth. The goal of GAP is to ensure that agricultural products
    are of high quality and meet food safety standards while being produced in a way
    that is economically, socially, and environmentally sustainable (Leong et al.,
    2020, Pham et al., 2021, Singh and Yogi, 2022). IoT techniques are transforming
    in agriculture on a large scale with a focus on three main areas of development;
    namely, wireless network engineering and applications, device design, and security
    challenges. AI is increasingly being used in agriculture and many other institutions
    and nations have adopted AI and IoT strategies and policies for better analysis,
    predictions and performance. Despite the significant amount of research on AI-based
    IoT smart farming, there is still a need for further reseach in this area (Lee
    et al., 2021, Yazdinejad et al., 2021, Bwambale et al., 2022). According to research
    reported in (AlMetwally et al., 2020), smart farming uses technology to monitor
    and manage crop production. IoT links remote devices, like robots and sensors
    to track changes in soil characteristics, soil moisture, climate, and other factors.
    This allows for automatic data-driven decision making. Due to the IoT basded techniques,
    smart farming is now possible in urban areas, such as, on building roofs and in
    indoor environment. Effective data management is crucial for the successful smart
    farming in both urban and rural areas. Irrigation is an important part of agriculture,
    especially in areas where the yearly rainfall is below 500 mm. Irrigation has
    been used for thousands of years in these regions such as, in most parts of the
    Africa, Asia, and the America to support crops. In (Podder et al., 2021;82:104025.,
    Doshi and Patel, 2019, Singh et al., 2022, Singh and Sivaram, 2022, Maraveas et
    al., 2022, Kumar and Sharma, 2020, Lohchab et al., 2018, Igri et al., 2022) multiple
    systems are proposed for managing smart agriculture farming that monitor essential
    parameters, such as temperature, humidity, and soil moisture for improved efficiency
    and productivity. By collecting and analyzing data on these parameters, farmers
    can make more informed decisions about their farming practices and procedures.
    The proposals are based on the potential for technology to revolutionize traditional
    farming practices, optimize resource use, and lead to higher crop yields and better
    environmental outcomes. The authors'' focus on essential parameters and their
    potential to provide a comprehensive understanding of the farming environment
    make their study an important contribution to the literature on smart agriculture,
    though further research is needed to validate their effectiveness. The aim of
    this article is to provide a comprehensive overview of the latest advancements
    in smart agricultural management and highlight the benefits and potential of AI
    and IoT technologies in the achievement of sustainability. Proper agriculture
    management and sustainability can be effectively attained through the implementation
    of smart farming techniques and approaches, alongside continuous advancements
    in this field. The review focuses on the use of IoT-based agriculture management
    techniques for sustainable farming with the utilization of robots and UAVs for
    real-time monitoring, control, and automation. The importance of LoRaWAN technology
    for wireless communications in smart agricultural management is also discussed.
    Additionally, various aspects of farming, such as, crop field data analysis and
    application utilization is also explored. The objective is to provide insights
    into the latest technologies and innovations that can help food producers to increase
    their yield and efficiency. By utilizing smart farming technologies, stakeholders
    in the agriculture sector can make informed decisions about technology investments,
    leading to improve food production while considering environmental sustainability.
    The integration of AI and IoT in agriculture shows great potential for enhancing
    production monitoring and sensing capabilities. This includes optimizing crop
    selection, determining the most suitable growing seasons, efficient resource utilization,
    monitoring animal behavior, tracking crop growth, and managing food processing.
    Moreover, AI-based machine learning algorithms offer improved data analysis capabilities
    and enable the prediction of favorable agricultural practices (Sanaeifar et al.,
    2023). Fig. 1 represent a concise overview of the research, illustrating the transition
    from traditional agriculture to smart farming techniques and ultimately, the attainment
    of sustainability in farming. Download : Download high-res image (339KB) Download

    techniques and approaches Smart farming is a modern and efficient approach to
    farming that leverages technology to optimize crop production and improve yields.
    By utilizing advanced techniques such as, data analysis and targeted inputs, farmers
    are able to increase efficiency and reduce waste. The result is a more sustainable
    and profitable agricultural industry that can better meet the demands of a growing
    global population (Martos et al., 2021, Podder et al., 2021;82:104025.). An Internet
    of Things (IoT) based precision agriculture smart farm looks at using technology
    to gather data to better manage what is happening on the farm, and of course,
    those things that can get spread across other curriculum areas, in terms of Maths,
    Biology, and Science. Therefore, it entails learning more about the activities
    taking place on the agricultural farm. Thus, observing the flora, fauna, and microclimates
    throughout the entire educational institution. Thus, it deployed a variety of
    sensors to collect data and information and compile it in one location so farmers
    could review the data and see what was happening on the farm, minute by minute
    (Tagarakis et al., 2021, Doshi and Patel, 2019). Smart agriculture farming is
    the future of farming, utilizing advanced technologies to enhance efficiency and
    maximize yields, while minimizing the environmental impact of agriculture. It
    plays a vital role in achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals
    (UN SDGs) of ending hunger, achieving food security and improved nutrition, and
    promoting sustainable agriculture. Smart farming techniques, such as variable
    rate fertilization, precision planting, and precision irrigation, enable farmers
    to precisely target inputs to particular fields, reducing waste and conserving
    resources, leading to higher yields and improved soil health. The data collected
    through smart agriculture provides valuable insights, enabling farmers to make
    informed decisions, resulting in improved nutritional outcomes. Adopting smart
    agriculture practices helps ensure a sustainable future for farming operations
    and provides food security and improved nutrition for people globally. AI and
    IoT based smart farming use advanced technology to improve agriculture practices.
    In order to track changes in the environmental factors both within and outside
    the farm, as well as the nutrition supply to the crops, sensors and monitoring
    equipment have been installed. AI algorithms then analyse the data to generate
    decisions and manage different farm systems. For instance, the system can automatically
    open or close windows to control temperature and provide the crops with the essential
    nutrition. (Andrianto et al., 2021). As seen in Fig. 2, it can also be carried
    out autonomously or remotely. Download : Download high-res image (180KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Smart agriculture system. Furthermore, smart
    farming increases productivity by allowing farmers to react rapidly and effectively
    to changes in the weather. Smart farms can produce up to 30 % more and produce
    food of a higher calibre than conventional farms. Through the use of sensors and
    data analysis, farmers are able to adjust to sudden changes like rain, wind, or
    temperature swings by receiving timely messages on their phones. Smart farming
    methods lead to more productive and efficient agricultural practises. (Zamora-Izquierdo
    et al., 2019, Moysiadis et al., 2021, Shahab et al., 2020, Hsu et al., 2020, Miloudi
    et al., 2019). 1.2. Vertical Farming: Benefits and challenges Vertical farming
    involves stacking layers of crops in a controlled environment in order to maximise
    the use of the finite amount of land and water resources. Fig. 3 illustrates how
    vertical farms'' controlled environments allow for the optimization of growth
    conditions, resulting in higher yields and higher-quality produce. Additionally,
    vertical farming helps to reduce the demand for transportation while increasing
    access to locally grown food. A more sustainable way to produce food is through
    the use of hydroponic and aeroponic systems used in vertical farming. Numerous
    benefits exist for this innovative approach to farming in terms of productivity,
    output, and sustainability (SharathKumar et al., 2020). The vertical farming system
    is a much more productive and resource-conserving method of agriculture than traditional
    open-field farming. Research indicates that compared to conventional agricultural
    practises, vertical farming consumes about 95 % less water and other resources.
    This decrease in water and other resources leads to significantly more environmentally
    friendly farming. The controlled environment means that less pesticides and other
    chemicals are required to safeguard the crops in vertical farming than in typical
    agricultural systems. This indicates that crops produced in vertical farms are
    not only more productive but also safer to eat (Ayambire et al., 2019, Avgoustaki
    and Xydis, 2020, Pham et al., 2021). Download : Download high-res image (228KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Vertical farming (Santini et al.,
    2021). Urban vertical farming, as an innovative approach, significantly contributes
    to achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by optimizing resource utilization
    and expediting the transition to a circular economy through its multifaceted advantages
    (Pakseresht et al., 2023, Oh and Lu, 2023). Additionally, by making fresh, wholesome
    food accessible in metropolitan areas and lowering the need for transportation,
    it can support societal objectives. By using fewer resources and producing less
    waste than conventional farming techniques, vertical farming also contributes
    to reducing the effects of climate change (Carotti et al., 2023). Additionally,
    it offers a chance for recycling urban organic waste, lessening its environmental
    impact even more. The SDGs can be achieved and a more sustainable future can be
    created using a crucial strategy called vertical farming. 1.3. IoT integration
    in agriculture The Internet of Things (IoT) comprises internet-connected, computer-based
    devices that facilitate autonomous communication (El-Ghamry et al., 2023), leading
    to enhanced automation and seamless data interchange among diverse devices over
    a network (Nakip et al., 2019). This transformative technology is poised to revolutionize
    multiple sectors, with the number of IoT devices projected to grow from approximately
    39 billion in 2025 to 50 billion in 2030 (Karie et al., 2020, Behm et al., 2019).
    Applications of IoT span various domains, including industry, transport, telehealth,
    agriculture, and domestic settings, as illustrated in Fig. 4 and detailed in Table
    1, which categorizes IoT applications into home services, community services,
    transport industry, and large-scale applications, each with specialized sub-categories

    in agriculture. 1.3.1. IoT sensors for environmental monitoring A sensor captures
    physical phenomena like temperature or pressure, converting the data into an electrical
    signal that, to be meaningful, necessitates integration into an electronic system
    capable of interpretation and utilization (Yin et al., 2021). Within the domain
    of smart farming, sensors function as specialized instruments designed to provide
    accurate and real-time information pertaining to crops and agricultural environments,
    measuring parameters such as light intensity, temperature, humidity, and soil
    moisture. Subsequently, these sensors transmit the collected data wirelessly to
    a central system for in-depth analysis. The primary objective of smart sensors
    in smart farming is to empower farmers with actionable knowledge and insights,
    facilitating informed decision-making to maximize operational efficiency and yield
    optimization. The integration of these sensors holds the potential to significantly
    improve crop planning and management, thereby contributing to the development
    of a more profitable and sustainable farming sector (García et al., 2020). The

    Application areas of smart sensors. IoT technologies facilitate the establishment
    of an interlinked network comprising intelligent devices, sensors, and machinery
    that acquire, transmit, and process real-time data. This information is subsequently
    utilized to make informed decisions concerning crop management, enhancing overall
    efficiency in agricultural practices (Singh et al., 2022). IoT-based devices are
    capable of retrieving soil-related metrics such as temperature, moisture, and
    pH values, transferring the data from the fields to an online cloud platform.
    The cloud platform processes this information to derive actionable insights, which
    are then relayed back to the devices. These devices, in turn, execute automated
    activities such as irrigation, harvesting, and pest control (Phasinam et al.,
    2022, Bhatnagar and Chandra, 2020, Pathak et al., 2019). This information can
    then be used to optimize various aspects of agriculture, such as irrigation, fertilization,
    and crop management. With IoT, farmers can make data-driven decisions to increase
    yields and reduce waste, leading to a more sustainable and profitable agriculture
    industry (Farooq et al., 2019). IoT is also used for smart irrigation quality
    of water, seepage, usage and treatment, water distribution units, and managing
    agricultural wastes (Debauche et al., 2021, Singh and Sivaram, 2022). The application
    of IoT in agriculture for several kinds of environmental monitoring is mentioned
    in Table 2. Table 2. IoT applications in environmental monitoring. Environment

    Adenugba et al., 2019) (Jiang, 2019) (Jain and Awasthi, 2019) (Jawad et al., 2018)
    The IoT and other cutting-edge technologies are used in smart agriculture to enhance
    crop management and raise yields. Several researches reported the application
    of IoT in agriculture listed in Table 2 emphasise the importance of implementing
    smart farming tools for crop monitoring (Mgomezulu et al., 2023). These solutions
    are adaptable and may be used in a variety of settings, including greenhouses,
    orchards, agricultural fields, and more. They provide vital environmental information
    including temperature, humidity, and brightness. One of the most important steps
    towards feeding the expanding population and maintaining food security is investing
    in IoT technologies for smart farming (Tyczewska et al., 2023). IoT-enabled smart
    farming offers a preventative method of disease management. Farmers now have access
    to a lot of data that can help them identify and stop diseases before they become
    a problem. This data includes temperature, humidity, and even photographs of the
    crops. Utilising various technology and practices that support sustainable agriculture
    is crucial to achieving sustainable agricultural goals. Integrating IoT and AI
    technologies is one such strategy that can improve farming practises by supplying
    insightful information and data. For instance, smart farming''s proactive disease
    control strategy can shield crops from damage, boosting output and resource effectiveness
    (Periakaruppan et al., 2023). Similarly, managing power consumption of IoT devices
    can promote energy efficiency and extend battery life, reducing the environmental
    impact (Iqbal et al., 2023). Precise water management using weather and data patterns
    can optimize resource utilization and enhance crop growth, leading to sustainable
    and successful farming practices. (Lee et al., 2021). 1.3.2. IoT based smart irrigation
    Systems: Enhancing water efficiency The improvement of water management practices
    can greatly progress the lives of people globally by promoting a sustainable water
    supply and agriculture (Kumar et al., 2022). This can result in a more sustainable
    future, with positive effects on the environment, economy, and society. In short,
    addressing the issue of water management can lead to a better future for all (El-Beltagi
    et al., 2022). Effective water resource management is essential for sustainable
    agriculture and profitable farming. It involves a comprehensive approach to water
    resource utilization from planning to monitoring. Adopting water resource management
    systems can revolutionize agriculture and secure a sustainable future for communities
    and businesses (Xiang et al., 2021). Smart irrigation relies on sensors that provide
    valuable data and analytics on irrigation system to help farmers and agronomists
    make informed decisions and optimize their agri-business operations. The sensors-based
    smart irrigation system consists of various components interconnected by services
    and interfaces, including data players and sensors, as illustrated in Fig. 8.
    Farmers and agronomists can access an integrative analysis of meteorological and
    sensor data through user-friendly web applications that provide recommendations
    for optimal fieldwork (Stein, 2021, Mohapatra, 2022, Almalki et al., 2021, Miloudi
    et al., 2019, Pham et al., 2021, Lee et al., 2021, Yazdinejad et al., 2021, Bwambale
    et al., 2022). Download : Download high-res image (385KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 8. Smart irrigation system (Obaideen et al., 2022). The use
    of IoT-based smart irrigation systems has the potential to completely change how
    we approach farming. These systems can accurately monitor soil moisture levels,
    weather conditions and water usage, ensuring that crops receive the optimal amount
    of water. This leads to increased yield and efficiency, reducing waste and preserving
    precious water resources. The smart irrigation system not only benefits the farmers
    and the environment but also the consumers by providing fresher, better quality
    produce. So, it''s time to embrace the technology and make the switch to smart
    irrigation. For better understanding a brief comparison between the traditional
    and smart irrigation is performed in Table 3. The traditional approach involves
    manual operation with methods like, flooding and watering cans. While smart irrigation
    utilizes automated systems and IoT technology for real-time monitoring and control,
    using techniques like moisture sensors and wireless communication. Table 3. Irrigation
    types for farming. Irrigation Type Description Techniques References Traditional

    Weather Station, IoT Platforms, Actuators, Wireless Communications (Ramli and
    Jabbar, 2022) 1.3.3. Real-time soil monitoring for precision fertilization A cutting-edge
    approach in agriculture combines precision fertilization with real-time soil monitoring.
    This method involves continuously measuring basic parameters such as pH, supplement
    levels, and dampness by monitoring soil conditions (Swetha et al., 2022, Pal et
    al., 2022). Precision fertilization ensures the optimal application of fertilizers
    tailored to the specific needs of crops by using this real-time data. This approved
    method reduces excessive fertilizer use, improves crop yield and quality, and
    limits natural effects. A sustainable and effective agricultural practice is best
    exemplified by the combination of precision fertilization and real-time soil monitoring
    (Rotundo et al., 2022). 1.4. IoT-based livestock monitoring Smart Livestock Farming
    is the use of technology and data-driven approaches to optimize the production
    and management of livestock. There are several types of smart livestock farming,
    including precision livestock farming, automated feeding systems, wearable technology
    for livestock monitoring, and remote herd management (Sittón-Candanedo and Prieto,
    1239). 1.4.1. Cattle farming Cattle farming is an important economic sector in
    many countries, and it also provides necessary greenhouse gases that are essential
    for the environment (Alonso et al., 2020). However, most farmers still rely on
    traditional farming methods where cattle monitoring and management are done manually
    by farm workers. As the number of animals on a farm rises, this system is not
    scaleable and can be difficult. (Taneja et al., 2019). For large-scale farms with
    a bigger animal population, the traditional techniques of raising cattle require
    the use of manpower for animal management and monitoring, which can be costly.
    For farms with 100–500 animals, it is not cost-effective to employ two competent
    workers to manage 20 animals, for instance (Ile et al., 2023). Additionally, this
    results in inadequate management of animal health and feed, which lowers yield
    and degrades animal health. Modern farming methods have been created to solve
    this difficulty and produce an autonomous system for keeping track of the wellbeing
    and diet of animals utilising cutting-edge technology. Fig. 9 shows how effective
    such a system could be (Krueger et al., 2020). Download : Download high-res image
    (401KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 9. Animal monitoring system (Neethirajan
    and Kemp, 2021). The IoT can drastically reduce the amount of labour required
    in cow ranching to track and monitor each animal. It is essential for the health
    and performance of cattle to live in an environment that is suitable for them.
    Animal health is significantly influenced by the environment. (Neethirajan and
    Kemp, 2021, da Rosa et al., 2020, Hempel et al., 2019). Cattle health is significantly
    impacted by the two essential factors of humidity and temperature. Different cattle
    species can withstand different environmental conditions in different parts of
    the world (Płoneczka-Janeczko et al., 2023). To solve this problem, an Internet
    of Things (IoT)-based dairy farm might be built, allowing for remote control of
    the farm''s environmental conditions using a smartphone application and an internet
    connection. With the use of this technology, farmers can keep an eye on and manage
    the barn''s temperature, humidity, and ventilation levels, assuring the best possible
    living conditions for the animals. IoT-based sensors can also be deployed to keep
    track of each animal''s health, spot any aberrant behaviour, and promptly notify
    the farmer. This enables the early detection and treatment of any medical problems
    (Lovarelli et al., 2020). Beyond temperature and humidity, there are other significant
    factors that impact cattle. Additionally, rumination needs to be closely monitored
    because it directly affects the health of cattle. Cattle ruminate for nine to
    ten hours a day to aid in the proper digestion of their food. If they begin to
    feel sick, they stop ruminating. Therefore, monitoring rumination can be essential
    to monitoring cattle health. To locate tiny micro accelerations, one uses an acceleration
    sensor (Beauchemin, 2018). The data collected is then processed using machine
    learning algorithms to classify the activity and rumination time of the cattle
    (Shen et al., 2020). Technology adoption in farming is becoming a requirement
    rather than an option. Given the growing demand for sustainable farming, it is
    essential to use cutting-edge strategies to increase farming productivity while
    preserving the environment. One of the best examples of sustainable farming practises
    is the usage of AI and IoT cloud databases in cattle ranching. Cattle management
    decisions can be well-informed using the information gathered from the farm environment
    and cattle bodies, leading to lower costs, higher yields, and better animal health
    (Wang et al., 2023). Additionally, the usage of cloud databases encourages environmental
    friendliness by minimising the carbon footprint by lowering the quantity of physical
    hardware required in farming. Consequently, implementing AI and IoT in cow farming
    is a step towards sustainable farming, and it''s the way to go in the 21st century.
    1.4.2. Poultry farming Poultry refers to domesticated birds raised by humans for
    their eggs, meat, or feathers. As the global population continues to increase,
    the demand for poultry products is expected to rise (Dumont et al., 2020). Three
    key activities are included in smart poultry management systems: sensing and monitoring,
    assessment and decision-making, and intervention. The systems collect information
    about the chickens and their surroundings using sensors and monitoring equipment
    (Beam et al., 2023). To determine the health, happiness, and production of the
    chickens, this data is analysed and evaluated. Finally, the system steps in to
    ensure the best possible conditions for the chickens by making adjustments to
    the environment, giving medication, or giving them food (Astill et al., 2020).
    To maintain a sustainable food supply, the poultry farming business is embracing
    intelligent AI and IoT-based solutions (Castillo-Díaz et al., 2023). These technologies
    are being used by chicken breeders to increase productivity and efficiency due
    to the surge in worldwide poultry consumption (Astill et al., 2020, Xue et al.,
    2023). The affordability of animal protein provided by poultry farming is one
    of the primary factors contributing to its increasing popularity (Wahyono and
    Utami, 2018). According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),
    the average person in the United States consumed 277.7 eggs in 2018. Globally,
    the production of eggs has been on the rise, with nearly 74 million metric tons
    of eggs produced in 2016, which is almost double the amount produced in 1990 (Conway,
    2018). The use of advanced technology has become increasingly prevalent in the
    poultry farming industry. Fig. 10 provides an overview of the technological advancements
    in poultry production systems, both current and future. The diagram depicts the
    various stages of technical advancements in poultry farming, starting from conventional
    cages and progressing to advanced and controlled smart systems based on AI and
    IoT. Each stage is accompanied by technological features that have been developed
    over time to enhance productivity and ensure welfare, production, reproduction,
    and product yields while minimizing the environmental impact and maintaining good
    health. The industry has transitioned from small-scale distributed procedures
    to extensive concentrated facilities in various forms with the help of precision-based
    livestock farming and smart poultry farming. These intelligent systems, primarily
    run by smart machines, consider food safety, labor costs, and animal welfare,
    resulting in sustainable and efficient poultry farming practices (Mallinger et
    al., 2023). Conventional cage systems (CC), enriched colony systems (EC), and
    aviary systems (AV) are some of the common housing systems utilized at different
    stages of poultry farming (Ren et al., 2020). Download : Download high-res image

    2. Advances in smart farming technologies The agriculture sector has been altered
    by advances in smart farming technologies, which have provided creative answers
    for more sustainability and efficiency. These technologies, which range from AI-powered
    analytics to precision agriculture techniques, enable farmers to make data-driven
    decisions and increase crop yields (Karunathilake et al., 2023). The monitoring
    and administration of agricultural operations are further improved by the integration
    of IoT smart devices and sensors, resulting in more efficient and sustainable
    farming methods. 2.1. Hyper-personalized agriculture A state-of-the-art approach
    to farming is addressed by hyper-personalized agriculture, which makes use of
    cutting edge technologies for precise customization. This framework uses historical
    data and results from that specific area to carefully customise factors like nutrient
    dosing, irrigation schedules, and pest control to the unique requirements of each
    crop. The integration of data from various sources, such as sensors, weather reports,
    and soil analyses, allows for this level of customization. Enhancing and increasing
    crop yields while minimising asset use is the goal. This innovative approach has
    the potential to replace conventional farming methods with more effective, sustainable,
    and tailored farming methods in the future (Daraojimba et al., 2023, Gurumurthy
    et al., 2022). 2.2. Ecosystem-friendly farming Ecosystem-friendly farming is a
    sustainable farming approach designed to reduce reliance on fertilizers and pesticides,
    thereby improving soil health and minimising environmental impact. With this approach,
    ranchers adopt practices that promote biological equilibrium and biodiversity
    by integrating with regular ecosystems. Ecosystem-friendly farming reduces pollution
    in the environment and preserves the resilience of entire ecosystems by minimising
    the use of artificially created substances. This strategy encourages the use of
    regular pest control methods in conjunction with one another, such as presenting
    beneficial pests or employing sidekick establishing techniques, to reduce the
    need for harmful pesticides. (Xu et al., 2022). This farming method also improves
    soil health by reducing the use of synthetic fertilizers. In order to typically
    increase soil richness, it supports the use of natural matter, cover yields, and
    harvest pivot. A versatile and practical rural environment is cultivated by solid
    soils, which also contribute to improved water management, decreased disintegration,
    and increased supplement content. Generally speaking, ecosystem-friendly farming
    represents a holistic and sustainable vision for agriculture, one that prioritises
    long-term environmental stewardship and soil health while also taking into account
    the delicate balance of nature (Mahankale, 2023). 2.3. Software apps for smart
    farming Smart farming apps aim to make the life of farmers more efficient and
    productive. These apps turn the farmer''s mobile phone into a mobile crop manager
    by providing information and tools for crop management. The apps can diagnose
    and treat crops, offering practical solutions for common problems. Farmers from
    various locations and backgrounds can access the information offered by the apps
    because it is frequently translated into multiple languages. The apps provide
    farmers with the knowledge they need to make informed decisions and maximise crop
    productivity by giving a wide range of information on various crops. Smart farming
    apps can increase agriculture''s effectiveness, production, and profitability
    while also enhancing the quality of life for farmers (Francis et al., 2023). These
    apps can be downloaded from the app store on smart phone. Table 4 summarizes various
    software applications in smart farming, showcasing their purposes and key features
    for enhancing soil analysis, field data management, pest control, crop mapping,
    custom app creation, and real-time orchard monitoring. Table 4. Application softwares
    for smart farming. Software Application Purpose Key Features Reference Soil Analysis
    Allows farmers to monitor soil characteristics for better crop planning Monitors
    mineralogy, soil texture, and depth (Patil and Khairnar, 2022) Farm Manager Helps
    farmers manage and track field data for planting and spraying Views, monitors,
    and edits all field data, including crop, planting, and spraying conditions (Park
    and Park, 2021) Pest Management Offers smart pest solutions by gathering and sharing
    pest information Gathers pest existence information and employs a crowd-sourcing
    approach, sending images and position data to other agriculturalists (Karar et
    al., 2022) Agrippa Helps agronomists map fields and track crop growth Creates
    electronic maps of fields, tracks crops, and locates objects in the farm area
    (Saba et al., 2017) ThingSpeak Enables farmers to create custom apps for field
    and crop monitoring Allows for creation of customized apps and data transfer to
    MATLAB R2019a for analysis (Penchalaiah et al., 2020) Semios Provides real-time
    monitoring of orchard pests, frost, bugs, and irrigation Offers real-time event
    notifications and network coverage for orchard monitoring (Verma et al., 2022)
    2.4. Drones and robotics in agriculture A drone is an unmanned aircraft operated
    either autonomously by onboard computers or by a remote pilot. In precision agriculture,
    drones are increasingly used for various purposes, such as crop mapping, monitoring,
    and spraying (Kleinschroth et al., 2022). Drones provide farmers with a unique
    perspective of their fields, equipped with various sensors, such as thermal, multi-spectral,
    or RGB (Red Green Blue) cameras. The high-resolution thermal sensor on a drone
    can provide farmers with real-time data on their crops, even in the middle of
    the night. This allows farmers to count their cattle and monitor their crops,
    making informed decisions and optimizing their farming operations. As a result,
    drones have become an invaluable tool in precision agriculture, enabling farmers
    to gather crucial information that would otherwise be difficult or impossible
    to obtain (Agudo et al., 2018, Hafeez et al., 2022, Shahab et al., 2020). Agricultural
    drones equipped with cameras are changing the game in sustainable farming. They
    provide real-time information, optimize operations, reduce costs, and promote
    sustainability. Automation of tasks frees farmers'' time to increase yields while
    reducing environmental impact. Flying robots like the VoloDrone provide real-time
    updates on harvesting progress. Spraying drones are cost-effective and efficient
    for pesticide and fertilizer spraying (Li et al., 2023). These technologies are
    essential for sustainable farming, protecting the environment and promoting a
    healthier food system. (Pakseresht et al., 2023)Tractica analysts estimated the
    current market size of drones to be 141,4000 units, with a total value of $5.3
    billion, as illustrated in Fig. 11. It is expected that revenue and sales of drones
    will continue to increase significantly by 2025. Download : Download high-res
    image (67KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 11. Drones market trend
    with time (Ryan Manuel, n.d.). Farmers have various mapping options at their disposal,
    including RGB maps that display regular color information and thermal maps that
    provide accurate temperature readings. Additionally, multi-spectral mapping is
    available to farmers, which offers insights into the health of their crops (Mattivi
    et al., 2021, SharathKumar et al., 2020). Drones can also be used for seed spreading,
    which is a fast and efficient method. In fact, it is considered one of the most
    effective ways to incorporate drones into farming operations (Hema and Sharma,
    2021, Ayambire et al., 2019). Drones represent the future of farming and one of
    their most useful features is spot spraying. With drone technology, farmers can
    efficiently spot spray their fields, without the need to blanket the entire field
    with chemicals, as in the case of traditional crop dusters (Ahmed et al., 2021,
    Avgoustaki and Xydis, 2020). While drones are not replacing traditional crop dusters,
    they can be a valuable addition to farming operations, especially when it comes
    to accessing tight spaces. However, there are many legal requirements to consider
    before purchasing a drone for spraying on a farm, and farmers must obtain legal
    approvals before using them (Alqarni et al., 2022, Santini et al., 2021). Fig.
    12 demonstrates the various applications of using drones in smart farming like
    harvesting, spraying, mapping and sensing. Download : Download high-res image
    (258KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 12. Application of drones in
    agriculture sector (Kim et al., 2019). Agricultural mapping or land surveying
    drones are small computer-controlled aircraft outfitted with cameras to give farmers
    comprehensive information about their crops (Guo et al., 2019). The specific domain
    of land surveying and drone mapping has changed the agriculture industry (Dileep
    et al., 2020). For a land surveying project, surveyors are used to carrying heavy
    ground devices, such as, total stations to the field for measuring terrain depth,
    this may involve walking in dense vegetation or climbing up hills (Akpoti et al.,
    2019). Now, the ability to use drones for mapping the fieldwork of servers can
    be far more efficient and safer than before. Using drones to survey agricultural
    land took a few minutes with a camera to capture the data while the traditional
    methods could take many hours at a higher cost (Kulbacki et al., 2018). To learn
    the working of drones, understanding photogrammetry is necessary, it is the art
    and science of taking measurements from photographs (Elkhrachy, 2021). Triangulation
    is the fundamental idea behind photogrammetry (He et al., 2018). By taking pictures
    from at least two different places, lines of sight can be drawn from each camera
    to the object. In the photogrammetry processing software (Honarmand and Shahriari,
    2021), these lines of sight are mathematically intercepted to produce three-dimensional
    coordinates of the points of interest. For smart farmers, agricultural robot-drones
    automate slow, monotonous, and repetitive tasks, allowing them to concentrate
    more on increasing overall yields (Krishnan et al., 2020). Harvesting and picking
    weeds are two of agriculture''s most common uses for robot-drones (Oliveira et
    al., 2021). The most advanced drones when we need them to travel control centers
    send technicians with a fleet of pickers. After a short setup robot-drones select
    pick and box only ripe fruit ready for market (Nayyar et al., 2020). With robot-drones
    working day and night the applications provide real-time updates on the harvesting''s
    progress, duration, quantity picked, and price. Robot-drones are our future. A
    typical example of robot-drones for harvesting is VoloDrone. The VoloDrone, manufactured
    by the logistics company Schenker and the German VoloCopter, can transport goods
    weighing 150 to 200 kg. VoloDrone is a drone powered entirely by electricity that
    has a range of approximately 40 kg and can carry a payload of up to 200 kg. In
    traditional farming pesticide spraying on steep and mountainous fields is being
    treated with workers wearing 20 kg or more backpacks that walked through spraying
    the fields with all the chemicals all around them. Spraying drone is the innovation
    for the next generation of precision agriculture for agriculture fields built
    for pesticide and fertilizer spraying with a capacity of many liters (Klauser
    and Pauschinger, 2021). It is twice as cost-effective as using a helicopter and
    50 times faster than manually spraying (Fang et al., 2021). Following Table 5
    provides an overview of the tasks and applications of agricultural drones and
    robots in modern farming practices: Table 5. Drones and robots for sustainable
    farming. Task Description Reference Agricultural mapping or land surveying drones
    Small computer-controlled aircraft outfitted with cameras to give farmers comprehensive
    information about their crops. The use of drones for mapping has changed the agriculture
    industry. (Guo et al., 2019, Dileep et al., 2020, Akpoti et al., 2019, Kulbacki
    et al., 2018, Elkhrachy, 2021, He et al., 2018) Automation of slow, monotonous,
    and repetitive tasks Agricultural drones and robots are used to automate slow,
    monotonous, and repetitive tasks. The most common uses for robots in agriculture
    are harvesting and picking weeds. (Krishnan et al., 2020, Oliveira et al., 2021,
    Nayyar et al., 2020)  Harvesting and picking weeds with robots Harvesting and
    picking weeds are two of agriculture''s most common uses for robots. With real-time
    data and analytics tools at their disposal, farmers can make informed decisions,
    optimize their operations, and reduce costs while promoting sustainability. (Oliveira
    et al., 2021) Flying robots for harvesting Flying robots or drones select pick
    and box only ripe fruit ready for market. With flying robots working day and night,
    the applications provide real-time updates on the harvesting''s progress, duration,
    quantity picked, and price. A typical example of flying robots for harvesting
    is VoloDrone. (Nayyar et al., 2020, Klauser and Pauschinger, 2021) Pesticide and
    fertilizer spraying with drones Spraying drones are the innovation for the next
    generation of precision agriculture for agriculture fields built for pesticide
    and fertilizer spraying with a capacity of many liters. It is twice as cost-effective
    as using a helicopter and 50 times faster than manually spraying. (Klauser and
    Pauschinger, 2021, Fang et al., 2021)  2.5. Cloud-based data analytics for smart
    decision-making In modern agriculture, the availability of precise and complete
    data is crucial for optimal productivity. Luckily, the rise of AI-based smart
    farming platforms has provided farmers with an efficient solution for managing
    and analyzing agricultural data (Mendes et al., 2022). By using machine learning
    algorithms and user-friendly interfaces, these platforms enable farmers to gain
    valuable insights and make data-driven decisions. Utilizing images from Sentinel
    and Landsat satellites, agronomic parameters, soil moisture data, historic yield
    datasets, weather data, and evidence on soil types, these platforms apply AI and
    machine learning-trained models to transform inputs into logical analytics stored
    in the online cloud. This results in a comprehensive dataset that provides information
    on water stress, vegetation growth, nitrogen concentration, field productivity,
    and other factors that impact crop growth. Fig. 13 depicts the process flow of
    these smart farming platforms (Wang et al., 2022, Bahrami et al., 2021, Tagarakis
    et al., 2021). Download : Download high-res image (566KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 13. AgroSupportAnalytics Architecture and Components (Munir
    et al., 2022). Cloud computing in precision farming enables farmers to manage
    yield forecasting, weather monitoring, real-time data gathering, remote monitoring,
    and finances calculations, leading to increased production, water management,
    and precise farm and field evaluation. This helps farmers grow their margins and
    make investments to be more sustainable and profitable, making cloud computing
    based agriculture a reasonable way to achieve smart farming. Improving soil health,
    water conservation, and climate resilience in agriculture can lead to lower costs
    and higher yields and price premiums for crops or livestock, demonstrating the
    cycle between profitability and sustainability in natural resource industries
    (Sittón-Candanedo and Prieto, 2020, Parente et al., 2019). Using cloud-based technical
    practices in smart farming can increase profit and sustainability while reducing
    upfront costs and knowledge barriers. Researchers identified that back office
    tasks, such as paperwork, financial analysis, and decision-making, were often
    challenging for farmers, hindering their progress. Cloud computing platforms can
    simplify these tasks, saving farmers time and money (Paraforos and Griepentrog,
    2021, Moysiadis et al., 2021). Cloud platforms have revolutionized the way businesses
    store, process, and manage data, including data generated by IoT devices. They
    are a crucial part of many IoT systems because they offer scalable, adaptable,
    and affordable methods for managing huge amounts of data (Castillejo et al., 2020,
    Zerihun et al., 2022, Jagatheesan and Janaki, 2022, Qaisar et al., 2023). Here

    LoRaWAN technology Smart precision agriculture systems, which rely on advanced
    technologies like sensors, drones, and AI, require uninterrupted access to the
    internet for optimal performance. However, in rural areas of developing nations,
    this requirement often goes unfulfilled, leading to slower internet speeds and
    potential disruptions in data transmission. These interruptions can negatively
    impact decision-making and overall crop management, ultimately affecting yields
    and quality. Therefore, ensuring reliable and stable internet connectivity is
    critical for the success of smart precision agriculture systems, particularly
    in rural areas of developing nations (Philip and Williams, 2019). LoRaWAN technology
    typically operates within the frequency range of 862 MHz to 928 MHz, providing
    low-power, long-range connectivity for IoT devices, such as smart farming sensors.
    With low-power consumption, it enables extended battery life for these devices
    while transmitting data over long distances, independent of slow internet speeds
    or connectivity disruptions. This allows for precise decision-making, resulting
    in improved crop yields and quality. By incorporating LoRaWAN technology into
    farming practices, crop management can be optimized, resulting in increased profitability
    (Almuhaya et al., 2022, Oh and Lu, 2023). Following is comparison of LoRaWAN with
    other popular wireless communication technologies in Table 7: Table 7. Comparison
    of LoRaWAN with others wireless communication technologies. Technology Frequency
    Range Range Battery Life Data Rate Cost Security Interoperability LoRaWAN 862

    Encryption Interoperable with Standards The main idea is to have some sort of
    device that periodically needs to send data over a long distance for a given amount
    of battery power, whatever gateway is nearest to these devices. In contrast to
    other connectivity technologies like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth etc. LoRaWAN uses little
    power and devices supporting this technology are typically able to run on battery
    for months and years. If we add the fact that Lora hardware and sensors are relatively
    inexpensive one can easily understand why the adoption of LoRaWAN-based solutions
    has increased over the past years. LoRaWAN is a wonderful wireless technology
    that can work without the internet (Kuntke et al., 2021, Carotti et al., 2023).
    If the gateways are available far from the agriculture field area and near some
    urban areas having internet connection facilities, data from the fields can be
    gathered easily using LoRaWAN wireless technology to upload on the internet through
    a gateway. The gateway can further send this received data over some cloud to
    process and make suitable decision-making in crop activity management (Ojo et
    al., 2021, El-Ghamry et al., 2023). In the article (Codeluppi et al., 2020, Nakip
    et al., 2019), the author proposed an architecture LoRaFarm using Long Range wireless
    communication technology (LoRaWAN). LoRaWAN is a remarkable wireless communication
    technology that has been utilized in the architecture of LoRaFarm to improve the
    supervision of smart farms. The architecture of LoRaFarm is designed to provide
    a high degree of customization for farmers, permitting them to tailor the system
    to their specific needs. The efficacy of this architecture is demonstrated in
    Fig. 14, which depicts the seamless integration of LoRaWAN technology into the
    smart farming infrastructure. With LoRaWAN, farmers can access real-time data
    and take informed decisions, leading to increased efficiency and profitability.

    considerations for smart devices A critical advancement required in the agriculture
    sector is the efficient management of power consumption in smart devices. The
    major common requirement for almost all IoT device modules is power consumption
    and extensive battery life (Callebaut et al., 2021). In IoT-based smart systems,
    power is a critical constraint, and to reduce power consumption in smart devices
    different mechanisms are being used (Sanislav et al., 2021). The stored data of
    IoT clouds provide the optimal values for the power and device conditions. This
    section is about technical solutions to the power constraint issue of smart devices
    and how to ensure maximum battery life with a look at design choices and power-saving
    features. Charging the IoT device several times a week is not what people consider
    low-power battery-operated devices, it is a hardware design of low-power devices
    and the main burden of achieving low-power savings devices is on the designer
    (Rajaiyan et al., 2022). The performance of a smart IoT device can be optimized
    by selecting the right module and component mix, while considering power savings
    and network support requirements. Careful configuration of the module''s features
    and behavior is also necessary to maximize battery life, which is impacted by
    data speed and traffic. Faster data speeds and higher data transmission requirements
    consume more battery power. Therefore, it is essential to understand the latency
    of battery life to improve device performance (Sarker et al., 2020). Power issues
    are a significant challenge for IoT devices due to their wireless transmission
    and network low efficiency. These devices need to be highly energy-efficient to
    ensure that they can operate for extended periods without recharging or replacing
    the battery. Here are some power issues and solutions with different technologies
    for IoT devices: 2.7.1. Battery’s life Most IoT devices run on batteries that
    have a limited lifespan, and they need to be replaced or recharged regularly (Callebaut
    et al., 2021). A solution to this is to use energy harvesting technologies, such
    as, solar, thermal, or kinetic energy harvesters to generate energy for the device
    (Iqbal et al., 2021). This reduces the need for frequent battery replacements
    and increases the lifespan of the device. 2.7.2. Power consumption IoT devices
    frequently consume a lot of electricity, which might reduce battery life (Rajaiyan
    et al., 2022). Using low-power microcontrollers and wireless technologies like
    Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) or Zigbee is one way. These innovations use a lot less
    energy than conventional Wi-Fi or cellular communication, which prolongs the life
    of the device''s battery. In (Doshi and Patel, 2019), authors suggested an Internet
    of Things (IoT)-based smart farming system that makes use of sensors and an ESP32
    NodeMCU to identify and stop agricultural diseases while also giving vital environmental
    data, including temperature, humidity, and soil moisture. The system can run for
    up to 15 days with a 6000 mAh power bank and efficient power usage estimations,
    extending the power bank''s lifespan and enabling more reliable crop monitoring
    and management. 2.7.2.1. Energy efficiency To enable prolonged operation without
    recharging or battery replacement, IoT devices must be extremely energy-efficient
    (Rana et al., 2021). Artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms can
    be used to optimise the device''s power usage as a solution to this problem. These
    algorithms are able to spot patterns in the energy use of the gadget and modify
    its operations accordingly. 2.7.3. Power management Power management is critical
    to ensure that the device is not draining power when it is not in use. One solution
    is to use sleep modes, where the device enters a low-power state when it is not
    in use. This helps to conserve battery life and ensure that the device is always
    ready to operate when needed (Iqbal et al., 2021). 2.7.4. Wireless charging Wireless
    charging is a convenient solution to the battery life issue for IoT devices. This
    technology allows the device to charge wirelessly, eliminating the need for regular
    battery replacements or recharging. This technology is becoming more widely available
    and can be integrated into IoT devices (La Rosa et al., 2019). 2.7.5. Energy harvesting
    using natural resources for powering smart devices Natural resources, such as
    wind, agriculture machines vibrations, temperature gradients, and sunlight can
    be used to produce useful energy. Energy harvesting reduces the dependence on
    batteries and wires by utilizing the energy present around the device, which brings
    many benefits like enabling new applications and features and reducing costs (Izhar
    and Khan, 2023.). Power can be harvested from temperature gradients, movement
    vibrations, radio frequency signals, and solar light, as depicted in Fig. 15.

    these power issues with the solutions offered by different technologies, IoT devices
    can improve their performance, reduce energy consumption, and prolong battery
    life. The Table 8 below summarizes the power issues that can affect IoT devices,
    along with various solutions using different technologies to address them. Table

    the management of the agricultural supply chain is being transformed by blockchain
    technology. It enables consistent tracking of agricultural products from farms
    to table by offering a transparent and unchangeable record. This invention increases
    accountability, decreases deception, and ensures the authenticity of food products.
    The adoption of blockchain technology in intelligent agriculture marks a significant
    advancement towards a more secure and stable supply chain management landscape
    (Jamil et al., 2022). 3. Sustainability in smart farming Smart farming techniques
    and approaches along with their ongoing advancements, are instrumental in achieving
    effective agriculture management and sustainability. These innovations optimize
    resource utilization, enhance productivity, and contribute to eco-friendly practices.
    Boosting the economies of developing nations can play a crucial role in addressing
    the issue of poverty that the world is currently facing. Since most of these countries''
    economies are based on agriculture, it becomes imperative to focus on resource
    efficiency in agriculture to ensure sustainable development and poverty reduction.
    The global population currently exceeds seven billion, and according to estimates
    from the World Food Program (WFP), 768 million people suffered from chronic hunger
    in 2020 as shown in Fig. 16, with the number expected to rise to 828 million in
    2022 (Sniatala et al., 2022). Additionally, over 155 million people, equivalent
    to 2 % of the world''s population, experienced severe hunger in 2022 and required
    urgent assistance (Wudil et al., 2022). Download : Download high-res image (52KB)

    et al., 2022). The following Table 9, presents a discussion on the role of IoT-based
    smart farming in achieving the SDGs. Table 9. Smart farming in the SDGs perspective.
    S. No SDGs IoT-based Smart Farming role to the SDGs References 1 No Poverty Smart
    farming technologies can empower rural communities to improve their financial
    well-being and reduce poverty through efficient use of resources and increased
    productivity. (Goel et al., 2021, Tripathi et al., 2022, Bhattacharya and Sachdev,
    xxxx) 2 End Hunger The use of smart technologies can help increase agricultural
    productivity and improve food security, ultimately contributing to the goal of
    ending hunger. (Musa and Basir, 2021, Chigwada et al., 2022:e01398., Suhail et
    al., 2021) 3 Good Health and Well-being Smart farming can reduce the use of harmful
    pesticides, improving the health and well-being of both farmers and consumers.
    (Adamides et al., 2020, Mohamed et al., 2021) 6 Clean Water and Sanitation Smart
    irrigation techniques can help ensure the efficient use of water resources, providing
    access to clean water and contributing to better crop yields. (Suhail et al.,
    2021) 7 Affordable and Clean Energy IoT-based smart farming can be powered by
    renewable energy sources such as solar and wind, reducing reliance on fossil fuels
    and contributing to the goal of clean and affordable energy for all. (Al-Ali et
    al., 2019, Lin et al., 2021, Liu et al., 2018) 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth
    The adoption of smart agricultural technologies using AI and IoT can create new
    job opportunities and contribute to economic growth in rural areas. (Yoon et al.,
    2018, Senthil Kumar et al., 2021) 9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure IoT-based
    smart farming represents a new frontier for innovation in agriculture and can
    contribute to sustainable industrialization. (Martos et al., 2021) 11 Sustainable
    Cities and Communities By encouraging the more effective use of resources and
    minimising waste, smart water management systems and productive vertical farming
    can aid in the development of sustainable cities and communities. (Singh et al.,
    2022, Santini et al., 2021, Le Roux et al., 2018) 12 Responsible Consumption and
    Production AI-based IoT precision agriculture can help ensure responsible resource
    management and reduce waste, particularly with respect to water consumption. (Patil
    and Khairnar, 2022, Lahlou et al., 2023) 13 Climate Action Smart farming techniques
    can help mitigate the impacts of climate change by enhancing agricultural yields
    and improving water management. (Stein, 2021, Diez et al., 2022) 14 Life Below
    Water Compared to conventional irrigation systems, IoT-based precision agriculture
    uses less water, helping to protect life below water. (Bwambale et al., 2022,
    Singh et al., 2022, Le Roux et al., 2018) 15 Life on Land In order to protect
    life on land, smart farming has the ability to boost food production, enhance
    food quality, and lessen agriculture''s negative environmental effects. (Javaid
    et al., 2022, Poudel et al., 2020) We can strive towards reaching the UN SDGs
    by putting IoT-based smart farming technology into practise. Smart farming has
    the ability to revolutionise the agricultural industry and provide a more sustainable
    future for all, from decreasing poverty to battling climate change. The aforementioned
    chart outlines some of the major areas where IoT-based smart farming can have
    an impact, such as enhancing food security, fostering renewable energy, and guaranteeing
    responsible resource management. We can create a more durable and just world for
    future generations if we use the power of smart farming. The UN SDGs can be achieved
    with the help of IoT-based smart farming technology, especially in the area of
    sustainable farming. Smart farming can assist us in addressing some of the most
    serious issues confronting our world today, such as poverty and climate change,
    by improving resource efficiency, reducing waste, and increasing output (Alam,
    2023). As we look towards a more sustainable future, it is essential that we continue
    to invest in smart farming and other innovative solutions that can help us build
    a more resilient and equitable world for all. 4. Findings and discussion Smart
    farming practices can positively impact several aspects aligned with UN’s SDGs,
    including poverty reduction, improved food production, health enhancement through
    nutritious crops, efficient water use, renewable energy implementation, job creation,
    technological progress, and environmental responsibility. However, SDGs like Quality
    Education, Gender Equality, Reduced Inequality, Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions,
    and Partnerships for the Goals require broader socio-economic and educational
    actions beyond the smart farming. While smart farming contributes to sustainable
    development, its scope is limited in addressing complex societal issues beyond
    agriculture. IoT-based smart farming has enormous potential to help achieve the
    SDGs, but there are several challenges that need to be addressed for successful
    implementation. A comprehensive review of various research endeavors concerning
    the attainment of SDGs, as outlined in Table 9, reveals that 12 out of 17 SDGs
    can be realized through effective management of agricultural systems. These attainable
    SDGs are listed in Fig. 17, while Fig. 18 presents a comparative graph showcasing
    the achievable and unachievable SDGs. Download : Download high-res image (512KB)

    Fig. 18. Graph of achievable vs unachievable SDGs. The comparison graph illustrates
    the findings of the sustainability study in Section 4, showing that 12 of the
    17 SDGs are reachable through effective agricultural practises. The very diverse
    nature of data in smart farming, which can vary dependent on criteria including
    data type, format, and purpose, is one of the major challenges. Farmers that need
    to incorporate data from various sources into their smart farming networks have
    a hurdle as a result. Standardization of protocols across devices and technology
    providers is required to solve this problem. Farmers also encounter difficulties
    with implementation due to the absence of modern communication networks and services
    in rural areas. In order to enable the adoption of IoT-based smart farming solutions,
    this limitation necessitates investments in the development of rural infrastructure
    (Alex et al., 2023). Additionally, farmers'' lack of technological expertise has
    a significant impact on the adoption of IoT and AI approaches in the field. The
    necessity for capacity-building and training programmes to give farmers the abilities
    they need to implement and sustain smart farming technologies is highlighted by
    this gap. Finally, a cloud computing system is necessary to store and analyse
    enormous amounts of data simultaneously. However, the computing capacity of IoT
    devices is often low, making it difficult to integrate all the functionalities
    into a single chip or system. IoT solutions that effectively employ resources
    and scale to support a large number of devices simultaneously must be created
    in order to address this issue. In conclusion, while IoT-based smart farming offers
    significant potential to help achieve sustainable development goals, it is critical
    to address the challenges highlighted in this discussion. By working towards standardization
    of protocols, investing in rural infrastructure development, providing technical
    training and capacity building, and developing scalable IoT solutions, we can
    overcome these challenges and ensure the successful implementation of smart farming
    technologies. 5. Future recommendations The challenges facing the global food
    system are significant, and sustainable development indicators fall short in numerous
    areas. However, IoT-based agriculture management techniques for sustainable farming
    highlights the potential of AI and IoT to revolutionize sustainability in the
    agricultural sector. Sustainable development and industry need not be at odds
    with one another, and the transformative power of AI and IoT-based smart farming
    technology can prioritize food and nutrition security while reversing environmental
    degradation and adapting to climate change. Widespread adoption of these technologies
    is essential to build a more resilient, equitable, and sustainable world for generations
    to come. As researchers, we recognize the urgency of this global transition and
    promote the adoption of new technologies for a more sustainable future. 5.1. Impact
    of smart farming on sustainability The adoption of AI and IoT in smart farming
    technologies has the potential to completely transform agricultural sustainability.
    These strategies can also help with climate change adaptation and reversing environmental
    degradation by placing a high priority on food and nutrition security (Koutridi
    and Christopoulou, 2023). Adopting smart farming practises can result in more
    effective resource usage, less environmental impact, and improved agricultural
    sustainability. 5.2. Key challenges and opportunities for implementation Despite
    the positive effects that smart farming has the potential to provide, there are
    obstacles to implementation. High initial expenses, a lack of technological availability
    in rural locations, and the requirement for specialised expertise are a few examples.
    To overcome these obstacles, it is necessary to invest in infrastructure, capacity-building
    initiatives, and legislative support that will encourage the wider use of smart
    agricultural technologies (Zhao et al., 2023). 5.3. Recommendations for future
    smart farming initiatives To fully realize the potential of smart farming, it
    is essential to promote research and development in AI and IoT-based technologies.
    Collaboration between governments, private sectors, and research institutions
    can facilitate knowledge sharing and innovation in the agricultural sector. Additionally,
    offering incentives and financial support to farmers for adopting smart farming
    practices can accelerate the transition to a more sustainable and technologically
    advanced agriculture industry. By fostering a supportive ecosystem for smart farming,
    we can create a brighter and more sustainable future for agriculture and global
    food security. 6. Conclusions Traditional farming practices are incapable of coping
    with the today''s food production and its quality and security requirement due
    to the exponential population explosion of the world, especially Pakistan. To
    address this challenge, researchers have been delving into the usage of intillegent
    techniques transforming into the modern IoT-based farming practices as predicted,
    automated, efficient and sustainable solution. IoT-based agriculture management
    techniques hold immense promise for advancing sustainability in agriculture farming
    due to its wide range of sensing and monitoring applications. This review article
    emphasizes their alignment with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), such as
    poverty reduction, food production enhancement, efficient resource utilization,
    renewable energy adoption, job creation, and environmental responsibility. However,
    challenges such as data heterogeneity, rural infrastructure limitations, and the
    need for farmer technical literacy must be addressed through standardization,
    infrastructure development, and capacity-building creativities. AI and IoT''s
    integration can transform agricultural sustainability, prioritizing food security,
    reversing environmental degradation, and adapting to climate change. Widespread
    technology implementation is pivotal for fostering a resilient, equitable, and
    sustainable agricultural future. CRediT authorship contribution statement Hammad

    and prototypesSecurity 1. Introduction The emerging 5G network is expected to
    bring instantaneous connectivity to billions of Internet of Things (IoT) devices,
    in turn enabling the digital transformation of Industry 4.0 for companies, customers,
    and investors. According to a recent study [1], 85 percent of IoT platforms will
    contain some form of digital twinning by 2025, driving projections of market growth
    from $3.1 billion today to $48.2 Billion in the next five years. A digital twin
    (DT) is a virtual model or representation of a physical object, a process, or
    a system, synchronized and updated from real-time data, at a specific frequency
    and fidelity [2]. The concept of twins was initially introduced by the United
    States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Apollo program in
    the 1970s, where virtual replicas of space vehicles on Earth were built to mirror
    the condition of the equipment during the mission [3]. Then, the concept of DT
    was introduced by John Vickers and Michael Grieves [4] in the Product Lifecycle
    Management (PLM) as a virtual instance (twin) of a physical system [5]. Presently,
    the concept of DT is used in a wide variety of domains, such as manufacturing
    [6], healthcare [7], smart cities [8], smart agriculture [9], smart grids [10],
    and mechanical engineering [11], to enhance the performance, enable proactive
    maintenance to extend the physical system’s life [12], enhanced productivity,
    and faster innovation with reduced costs [13]. Typically, DT systems are generated
    and then synchronized using bidirectional data flows between the real-world physical
    components and their virtual replica counterparts [14]. Furthermore, a DT can
    enable continuous prototyping and testing on-demand without interruption, thereby
    assuring and self-optimizing use cases, such as 5G network and beyond [15], [16].
    In IoT use cases, it creates virtual replicas of IoT devices in various application
    scenarios [17] and maintains a device twin for every connected device. Despite
    the promise of DT, existing work on DT focuses primarily on the modeling perspective
    [18], [19] and pays less attention to simplifying the control and management of
    industrial IoT networks. Additionally, technology adopters report several barriers
    to this digital transformation including prohibitive complexity with network deployments,
    security risks, and need for new business models and practices. Security and privacy
    are the main concerns for sharing IoT data among distributed DT infrastructures
    [20]. In particular, data in theDT Network (DTN) is fed back between the physical
    object and the virtual model, thus making the virtual model vulnerable to cybersecurity
    attacks [21]. Defending against such attacks is critical for scenarios like remote
    robot surgery, intelligent transportation systems, and federated EU-US airport
    operations [22]. Similarly, DT require continuous interaction between real-world
    objects and their virtual representation in real-time and with reliable two-way
    communications [23]. However, due to the dynamic behavior and frequent changes
    in the network environment, it becomes challenging to ensure stringent reliability,
    low latency, and real-time requirements over the future wireless broadband 5G
    and 6G networks [24]. Research on DTs for 5G networks and beyond is still in its
    infancy, and the current implementations focus on limited and specific scenarios,
    such as network optimization, in which DTs act as a simple network simulation
    tool to solve the operation and maintenance problems. Yet, DTs could be considered
    an indispensable part of the entire lifecycle of the physical network in the future,
    serving more important issues in future networks beyond 5G, such as in network
    planning, construction, maintenance, optimization, automation, orchestration,
    etc. Additionally, since different standardization bodies are developing various
    DT standards, it is more challenging to define a more unified reference architecture
    of DTs. For example, Tao et al. [13] proposed a five-dimensional framework of
    DTs that involves physical entities and represents a virtual entity, service,
    twin data, and the connection between various components. ISO [25] is developing
    a standard for a DT manufacturing system; the Digital Twin Consortium (DTC) is
    drafting a DT architecture that embodies the entire domain of devices and processes
    [26]; the Digital Twin Web Association (DTWA) is defining the concept of Web of
    Digital Twins (WoDT) [27] to exploit service-oriented architectures to build digital
    twins document specification for the web of things; and the Building Digital Twin
    Association (BDTA) is promoting another DT architecture in the construction sector.
    In spite of the promising benefits of DT that are analyzed in few survey reports,
    none of them focus on articulating the fragmented international standards and
    dealing with the diversity of software implementations. Rather, existing surveys
    mainly review DT from the modeling perspective and focus on physical objects and
    their virtual twins, while reference architectures and networks which provide
    communication support for DT, are often missing. For instance, Schleich et al.
    [28] surveyed the recent advances in DT and its enabling technologies and showcased
    different use cases across the product lifecycle involving the design, manufacturing,
    use, and recycling phases. Likewise, Lim et al. [29] analyze the state-of-the-art
    of DT approaches in smart manufacturing and Product Life Management (PLM), and
    highlight tools and models used for creating DT for PLM engineering. Similarly,
    Wu et al. [2] surveyed recent advances in DT Network deployment in different application
    domains. Regardless of how a DT is defined, the literature provides very little
    insights into its deployment in future IoT applications with the forthcoming 5G
    network. Moreover, the discussion about the challenges, prospects, and trends
    in future networks have not been investigated either. Finally, there are no studies
    to understand and fill the gap between a company’s awareness of the DT and their
    current levels of adoption. To address these limitations, this paper makes the
    following contributions: • We present findings based on a comprehensive literature
    survey on DTs in IoT and 5G scenarios, comprising both research projects and tooling;
    • We discuss standardization efforts in the realm of DTs ; • We describe a number
    of use cases, explaining how DTs can help these use cases; • We present open research
    challenges, trends, and prospects; and • Finally, we present details of our project
    called Hyper-5G that is addressing some of these challenges. The organization
    of this paper is as follows: Section 2 provides a deep introduction to the DTs
    concept and discusses its properties. In Section 3, we delve into diverse DTs
    standardization, specifications, and describe their different reference architectures.
    Section 4 delves into available open source and commercial software implementations
    of DT tools to enable the future digitalized industry. We present in Section 5
    recent projects that have been initiated to facilitate the integration of DT in
    real-world applications. Section 6 describes diverse use cases and how DT can
    serve various applications. Section 7 discusses open challenging issues that still
    represent barriers towards large-scale adoption of DT. Section 8 articulates key
    research directions towards enhancing the digital twin lifecycle towards removing
    organizational, technical and technological barriers and increase its acceptance
    level in many industries. Finally, Section 9 provides concluding remarks describing
    potential future directions in this realm. 2. Overview of the digital twin concept
    The concept of DT is poised to make drastic changes in the future of industrial
    IoT environments. This section delves into the central concept of digital twins
    and discusses its main properties. 2.1. Understanding the key concepts of the
    digital twin The purpose of a DT is to build effective communication between the
    physical world and the information world. This means using a large amount of data
    collected effectively from the physical world to create a virtual representation
    of the physical world. In this section, we delve into its key concepts. 2.1.1.
    Types of digital twins There are different types of digital twins, depending primarily
    on the use cases and real-world scenarios in which they are used. We will describe
    different use cases in Section 6. Shyam et al. [30] identify four types of digital
    twins as follows: • Discrete versus Composite: The scope and scale of the DT depend
    on the use case in which it will be used. One type of DT known as Component/Part
    Twins is one where the DT represents the model of an individual part of the production
    system. For example, more complex systems will involve multiple DT instances and
    aggregates that will be assembled and composed together to form the whole DT representation.
    Conversely, small-scale systems may involve a single/atomic DT instance to represent
    the physical assets in the DT, which is therefore called a discrete DT. Hence,
    a discrete DT is a lower level of abstraction of more complex systems, i.e., systems
    of systems or composite DTs. • Product versus Facility: This type of DT is also
    known as Asset Twins. It represents a manufactured product, which encapsulates
    the exact manufacturing conditions of each final product, such as a pump, gas
    turbine, electric motor, etc. The main objective of this type is to monitor the
    use of a specific asset or entity, which may involve information about its failure
    and real-time operations. The facility DT revolves around manufacturing or production,
    which consists of the union of different individual assets, e.g., an assembly
    of unique product twins. • Simulation versus Operational: In the early stages
    of a product life cycle, a DT often focuses on modeling and simulation scenarios
    before the asset begins to be processed. Next, once the asset is made available
    in the physical real-world system, the focus is more on the operational and maintenance
    challenges. Comparable to DevOps (Development and Operations), this type is considered
    Simulation and Operational (SimOps) DT; thus, the simulation is more project-oriented.
    At the same time, the operations involve the entity’s operation and maintenance
    life cycle. • Analytics-versus Physics-based: This model uses historical and real-time
    data for representing an entity and predicting its current and future states,
    either based on empirical/analytic models or physics-based algorithms. The former
    use artificial intelligence techniques (e.g., statistics) to predict the behavior
    of an asset using available historical data. The latter makes use of physical
    laws (e.g., fluid dynamics, atomic, molecular, and optical), material properties
    (size, shape, the density of the particles, tensile strength, compressive resistance,
    elasticity, grain, and their intrinsic mechanical properties), etc. to generate
    insights to allow predicting the behavior of an asset or a product. Similarly,
    Alves et al. [31] have introduced typology of different types of Digital Twins
    for smart farming. For example, imaginary DT represent objects that imagined by
    designers but has not been created in physical world. Monitoring DT are connected
    to physical objects or processes in near real-time to supervise its operations
    and condition in the surrounding environment. Predictive DT use mathematical and
    statistical modeling to forecast the future states and behavior of physical objects.
    Prescriptive DT use artificial intelligence to provide corrective and preventive
    actions to help the physical process in decision-making. Autonomous DT does not
    need human intervention to feed decisions to the physical system, but autonomous
    provides fully control of the system behavior. Finally, Recollection DT stores
    large amounts of variant data and extract significant value from it for providing
    the traceability of products and keep a historical record. However, these types
    remain conceptual, as they can be implemented as part of the main DT, e.g., they
    can be considered as small instances of the main DT. 2.1.2. Characteristics of
    a DT Since DT has been applied to different use cases and since each use case
    generates its own DT characteristics [32], [33], [34], there are no generic characteristics
    that can be applied to all scenarios. In this section, we will discuss, without
    loss of generally, the main characteristics that a DT should possess. These properties
    are described in Table 1. A key characteristic of any DT is the presence of network
    connectivity. This is needed since the physical object and its virtual replica
    communicate to exchange the physical twin status and changes along the lifecycle,
    and share context representation about their surrounding dynamic environment.
    Thus, the networking interfaces/devices should guarantee seamless connection,
    synchronization, and continuous data stream exchange, either using direct point-to-point
    communication, or even indirectly, through brokers, proxies, gateways, or cloud-based
    connections. Table 1. Key characteristics of a DT. Characteristics Description
    Network connectivity It involves both the connection from the physical to a virtual
    environment and the connection from the twin to the physical world. Physical entity/asset
    An asset, an object, an entity, a process or a product that exists in the real
    physical world. Physical environment The real world environment in which the physical
    entity exists, such as a factory, construction, hospital, manufacture, smart city,
    etc. Virtual entity The virtual replica of the physical entity, i.e., the DT prototype
    and its instances when synchronized with their physical replica Virtual environment
    A virtual representation of the physical environment, which may involve Unity
    3D, AR/VR, and metaverse tools. Synchronization The virtual replica (object, system,
    or process) should be synchronized with the real world so that any change in the
    physical world should be reflected in its digital representation, which feeds
    back insights into the reverse direction. Twinning Rate As the physical and twin
    worlds should be synchronized, they should therefore agree on the frequency with
    which data is exchanged, i.e., the rate with which synchronization occurs. State
    The current behavior or values of all parameters that define a state (or multiple
    states) of either the real-world or virtual entity/environment. Physical Process
    The process in the real-world environment within which the physical entity engages
    changes or impacts the behavior of the physical twin. Virtual Process The virtual
    process (e.g., analytics, computational techniques, etc.) employed in the virtual
    twin that will change or impact the state of the virtual replica. Fidelity The
    accuracy of the DT model to describe the physical assets, no matter how complex
    the physics or geometry are. Fidelity can be assessed when considering the frequency
    of the model updates. Parameters Includes all kinds of information, meta-data,
    and processes exchanged between the physical entities and their twins, e.g., temperature,
    production scores, and processes. 2.1.3. Data and models The DT exists in the
    virtual environment in a digital format, i.e., represented in different data sources
    and models (e.g., file structures like JSON and XML that hold DT meta data) that
    transform data into DT information for various applications. The DT data can present
    itself in the following forms: • Time Series Data: Time series insights are used
    to collect and analyze historical data about physical assets and perform data
    analytics (e.g., regression) on them [35]. They also provide timestamped temporal
    and real-time data that can be stored in time series, as well as NoSQL databases
    that can be used to synchronize the physical assets with their twins. • Master
    Data: Typically, those data are stored in enterprise data stores (e.g., Enterprise
    Resource Planning (ERP), Enterprise Asset Management (EAM)). For example, physical
    assets comprise multiple sensors capable of gathering ERP real-time data and transmitting
    operational status [36]. DT requires an Enterprise Knowledge Graph [37]. The latter
    comprises concepts and instances defined using ontologies and computational agents
    to ensure that Master Data Management (MDM) represents generic data of physical
    objects belonging to organizations, such as clients, providers, products, and
    locations, through distinct layers. • Transactional Data: Operational, transactional
    data represent the next frontier in Digital Process Twins. It describes the virtual
    representation of an actual business process, which in turn describes the accurate
    model of the business process and the real-time status data received from the
    process that helps to exert control over the process through adjusting the DT
    . An example of transactional data can be found in Computerized Maintenance Management
    Systems (CMMS), Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES), Business Process Management
    (BPM), and production systems. The DT models can be of the following types: •
    Physics-based Models: This is one of the traditional models used in simulation
    and co-simulation, where multi-physics get real-time data, engineering calculations,
    discrete physics, and where machine learning are integrated with physics-based
    models to investigate several predictive scenarios. The latter are used for predicting
    damaged structures, maintenance planning, uncertainty, operational parameters,
    etc. [38]. • Analytics-based Models: Typically, advanced machine learning algorithms
    and mathematical and statistical models are used in the virtual twin environment
    to predict the current and future of the physical asset. They can also create
    recommendations, operate on analytical data, and extract insights to help predict
    future behavior, simulate different scenarios, and perform other analytics tasks
    [39]. • Visual Models: the recent advances in Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual
    Reality (VR), metaverse, Geographic Information systems (GIS), and Building Information
    Modeling (BIM) makes it possible to integrate visual models (e.g., Unity 3D models,
    Internet of 3D worlds) into the DT [40]. For example, integrating Google Maps
    Street View with the DT can make updates in real-time as objects move and change
    on it continuously. • Discrete Event Simulation (DES) Models: DES models [41]
    can be used to create a full DT of the production and manufacturing process, as
    they abstract the machine group’s behaviors into complex event-driven operations.
    For example, by combining computer-aid modeling method to create higher multi-fidelity
    simulation models provides higher accuracy analysis and rapid decision-making
    in Industrial 4.0. 2.2. Key properties of digital twins In this section, we discuss
    four main properties of DT using which they can be evaluated for their effectiveness.
    These include: (i) representativeness and contextualization; (ii) reflection and
    replication (iii) persistency; and (iv) composability. • Representativeness and
    Contextualization Digital twins represent the physical objects as logical objects
    in specific application context [17]. Indeed, representativeness of a DT refers
    to how effective are the models’ behavioral representation of real-world objects,
    how virtual replicas are built, and how synchronize their states by reasoning
    about events and modifications to the context. Therefore, any DT framework should
    consider the source of data and the surrounding environment in which data are
    collected and to support context-awareness features to understand the context
    of data collection [42]. The representativeness and contextualization in DTs are
    made possible through the simplification and generalization of the models’ behaviors
    • Reflection and Replication DT mirrors the states and the behavior of the real-world
    objects and reflects all the changes that happen in the physical systems, i.e.,
    features, status, data, events, actions, and all the other information characterizing
    the physical object to their virtual replicas. Reproducing the status of the physical
    entities requires reliable communication that reflects any changes to the virtual
    entities at the same rhythm and rate of these changes. Additionally, physical
    objects can be virtualized, instantiated, and replicated several times in a virtualization
    space. The replicated instances should be consistent and synchronized (i.e., time
    and status synchronizations) with the physical one [43]. Replicability is, therefore,
    a desirable property to support the intertwining between real-world space and
    DT replicas. • Persistency As the DT is expected to replicate the physical objects,
    it must always be highly available and provide persistent data in the digital
    system [44]. The availability of DT is provided during the lifecycle of the process,
    i.e., during the design, creation, operation, crashes, maintenance, upgrade, and
    even after the destruction of the physical objects. Hence, the DT should always
    be persistent in all possible scenarios, i.e., virtual objects should be resilient
    and stay available all the time. • Composability The DTs can often aggregate different
    entities to represent more complex systems in the virtual space. This ability
    of grouping together different objects into a single, composed object to perceive
    the changes and behavior of individual objects and the whole system represents
    the composability of digital twin [45]. Digital twins need to take care of complex
    aggregation of physical objects. Table 2. Digital twin standardization efforts.

    concepts DT can be compared to different existing other concepts, e.g., simulations,
    emulations, digital shadows, digital thread, etc. While digital twin itself refers
    to a virtual replicate of the real-world system that receive data from the physical
    system and send decisions to perform closed-loop control, it differs significantly
    from other concepts. In particular, DT can be distinguishable from simulation,
    which attempts to simulate the internal state of an object as close as possible
    to what could happen to an object. DT can be also be differentiated from emulation,
    as an emulation involves an emulator that tries to imitate the external behavior
    of an object as closely as possible. Furthermore, DT can be confused to digital
    shadows, as both offer digital representation of objects and processes. However,
    data flow in digital shadows is a one-way process [46], i.e., data can only go
    from the physical object to the virtual object so that changes in the physical
    world results in changes to the virtual world, but not vice versa. Additionally,
    DT uses the digital thread [47] data to perform custom closed-loop control and
    build on powerful representations for the design, evaluation, and recording of
    the life cycle management of a product or system. The digital thread is considered
    as the framework that connects siloed elements of the DT and provides an integrated
    view of an asset throughout the manufacturing lifecycle. 3. Standardization efforts
    for digital twins Different standardization efforts are undertaken by multiple
    foundations and organizations, such as the International Standards Organization
    (ISO), the Industrial Digital Twins Association (IDTA) and the Digital Twins Consortium
    (DTC). These multiple efforts create some challenges for unifying digital twins
    into systems. In this section, we discuss the current standardization efforts
    in the area of the DT. Table 2 summarizes the list of projects with the same aim.
    3.1. DTC reference architecture The DTC Reference Architecture has been established
    by the Digital Twin Consortium in collaboration with the Object Management Group
    to drive awareness, adoption, security, and interoperability for unifying multivendor
    digital twin ecosystems [48]. It also provides insights towards designing and
    building scalable industrial manufacturing processes by enabling continuous improvement
    in lifecycle management [49], enabling a circular product-based approach and influencing
    policies, standard requirements, and the development of DT technology. The DTC
    group defines standard requirements and use cases. Specifically, it defines the
    reality capture [26] that embodies the entire domain of devices and processes,
    which collects conditions of a physical object or space to provide a faithful
    and transparent representation of real-world conditions in the virtual representation
    of the DT framework. Additionally, the group advocates consistent best-practices
    methodologies, formal methods for digital master, digital twin representation
    and interlinking, and DT maturity model [50]. Furthermore, the DTC group provides
    a library of reference implementations for digital twins, publishing and amplifying
    architectures [51], leveraging frameworks and open-source code implementation
    [52] that help build an extensive, multi-faceted DT ecosystem in large-scale,
    complex environments. The group also introduced a Security Maturity Model [53]
    to identify the appropriate approach to security mechanisms for IoT. The Capabilities
    Periodic Table (CPT) [51], shown in Fig. 1, has been established to elaborate
    a requirements-definition framework that works with any architecture or technology
    and makes it easier to design, deploy, and run digital twins for a wide range
    of industrial purposes. At its core, the architecture uses a Composable Digital
    Twins (CDT) reference model to help with the development of digital applications
    based on composable enterprise architectural patterns. These CDTs focus on developing
    microservice-based orchestration and reusable Packaged Business Capabilities (PBC)
    to support interoperable, multi-technology, and multivendor applications [51].

    Fig. 1. Composable digital twin reference model. The Composable Digital Twin Reference
    Model is a layered architecture that encompasses the following layers: • Composed
    Digital Twins Experiences: PBCs are provided to offer a unique modular composition
    that targets the goals and opportunities offered by the DT, i.e., by combining
    different configurations, real-time data, decision-support tools, data types,
    models, etc., to create reusable business capabilities. • Digital Twins Composition
    Platform: it provides necessary tools for orchestrating, integrating, and composing
    applications based on the necessary use case requirements, which offers a high
    level of agility and flexibility towards fulfilling the business requirements.
    • Packaged Business Capabilities: PBCs can be used in the DT platform to compose
    the DT and offer a certain level of security and trustworthiness across the DT
    orchestration platform. • Data Fabric: it provides the tools, algorithms, and
    mechanisms to enable digitalization, supply services and processes, and bring
    alive the DT, i.e., by ensuring data availability at the right time at the right
    place. 3.2. Industrial digital twin association (IDTA) The Asset Administration
    Shell (AAS) [54], [55], [56] has been introduced by the IDTA as a standardized
    digital asset representation to ensure manufacturing systems’ interoperability.
    Part 1 of the AAS specification [54] defines several protocols to serialize AASs
    in different formats, such as JSON, XML, or AML. AML (Automation ML) [57] is an
    open, vendor-neutral, XML-based, and free data exchange format for industrial
    automation and control systems, defined in the IEC 62714 series. It describes
    how information about assets can be exchanged safely between industrial partners.
    The document describes the metamodel for information of an Asset Administration
    Shell and its submodels, as well as the exchange format for the transport of information
    from one partner in the value chain in an interoperable way. It introduces a comprehensive
    UML model and XMI representation of details of the AAS for mapping suitable technologies
    to be used in different life cycle phases (such as XML and JSON for exchange between
    partners via the .aasx exchange format, AutomationML for the engineering phase,
    OPC UA information models, and RDF for reasoning). The definition of attribute-based
    access control (ABAC) protects system resources from unauthorized access [58].
    The specification includes APIs and interfaces for getting to AAS information
    so that you can view, change, query, and run information and active functionality.
    It also includes the infrastructure for connecting multiple AASs through a registry,
    discovery services, endpoint handling, and other things [Wagner2017]. 3.3. Industry
    IoT consortium (IIC) A reference architecture for DT [59] has been introduced
    by the IIC to integrate many vendors and technologies and help them to manage
    their complexity. Common features have been introduced to fulfill many DT vendors
    requirements, including Document Management, 3D representation, modeling, simulation,
    data modeling, model synchronization, connected analytics, etc. Additionally,
    the IIC introduced practical guidance [60] on digital twins that includes the
    definition, benefits, architectures, and building blocks to implement them. The
    proposed document describes the relationship among DT systems as a level of abstraction
    (e.g., discrete, composite, hierarchical, association, peer-to-peer DT). Fig.
    2 illustrates the DT data, computational models, and service interfaces. Data:
    a DT should contain data about its real-world twin that are required by the models
    to represent and understand the states and behaviors of the real-world twin. In
    many cases, it may consist of data in the full lifecycle of the real-world object,
    in the case of equipment, data during the design phase (specifications, design
    models, production process, and engineering data), production phase (data about
    a worker, production equipment, material and parts, production methods and quality
    assurance data), operation phase (data about installation and configuration, real-time
    and historical state and status, as well as maintenance records) and even end-of-life
    procedural data. It may also contain business data, such as transaction records.

    Fig. 2. Constituents of the IIC’s digital twin. Models: A DT should contain computational
    or analytic models that are required to describe, understand, and predict the
    twins’ operational states and behaviors and models that are used to prescribe
    actions based on business logic and objectives about the corresponding real-world
    object. These models may include physics or chemistry, engineering or simulation
    models, data models based on statistics, machine learning, and Artificial Intelligence
    (AI). It may also include 3-D and augmented reality models to aid human understanding
    of real-world objects’ operational states or behaviors. Service (interface): a
    DT should contain a set of service interfaces for industrial applications or other
    digital twins to access its data and invoke its capabilities. 3.4. Internet engineering
    task force (IETF) IETF has recently introduced a reference architecture for network
    digital twin [61] in which it identifies four key elements to compose a DT network,
    i.e., data, models, interfaces, and mapping, as shown in Fig. 3. First, data are
    collected from the network elements (e.g., physical and virtual equipment, links,
    routers, middleboxes, controllers, NFV functions, etc.). Then they are stored
    inside the data repository to provide timely and accurate data service support
    to build various DT models. The collected information includes configuration data,
    operational state data, topology data, trace data, metric data, and process data.
    Data are also used by the DT platform to represent the states of both physical
    and virtualized network instances and describe their behavior inside the DT .
    Second, data are used to develop a comprehensive representation of the data using
    DT models. Diverse models can be composed, e.g., service models, data models,
    dataset models, or knowledge graphs, to represent a high-level abstraction to
    provide insights and dynamics on how the live physical network operates and infer
    reasoning data that the DT can utilize to serve various network applications.
    Third, interfaces are used to ensure the interoperability of the DT network with
    existing business applications. Standardized southbound and northbound interfaces
    are needed to (i) interface with the physical network infrastructure to provide
    real-time data collection and control on the physical network, and (ii) interface
    between the DT network platform and applications to help in delivering application
    requests to the DT network platform and exposing the various platform capabilities
    to applications. Download : Download high-res image (155KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 3. Key elements of IETF digital twin network. Finally, the
    mapping is needed to establish a real-time interactive relation between the physical
    network and the twin network or between two twin networks. One-to-one (pairing,
    vertical) mapping also helps to keep the physical network and its virtual replicated
    network in sync with continuous flows, give a clear picture of the current situation,
    improve the network’s performance and upkeep, and get the system to behave the
    way you want it to. One-to-many (coupling, horizontal) mapping is also needed
    to synchronize among virtual twin networks with occasional data exchange. Furthermore,
    the mapping enables the (i) repeatability of the experiments, as it offers the
    capacity to replicate network conditions on demand; and (ii) reproducibility by
    enabling replaying successions of events under different controlled variations
    of the network state to validate changes in different use cases, such as network
    optimization and network fault recovery. IETF has introduced a three-layer DT
    reference architecture that encompasses the Application Layer, Digital Twin Layer,
    and Physical Network Layer, as illustrated in Fig. 4. Download : Download high-res
    image (372KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. IETF reference architecture
    of DT network. • Physical Network: it represents network infrastructure (mobile
    access/core network, a transport network, a datacenter, an IP bearer network,
    a backbone, etc.) that span across single or multiple autonomous systems and in
    which all or parts of their equipment exchange data with their virtual replicas
    in the DT instance. Digital Twin Layer: represents the virtual replicas of the
    physical layer and includes three key subsystems: (i) Data Repository subsystem,
    which is responsible for collecting and storing real-time operational and historical
    network data from different networks to build and update various models used by
    the DT; (ii) Service Mapping Models subsystem offers data metamodel instances
    that can be used by the network applications to improve the flexibility, agility,
    and programmability of the network. It includes both basic models (i.e., network
    element models and network topology models) implemented in the DT model, describing
    the basic configurations such as environmental information, operational state,
    link topology, etc. In addition, functional models encompass various data models
    used for different tasks such as network analysis, emulation, diagnosis, prediction,
    quality of service assurance, etc. functional models are constructed and expanded
    by multiple complex dimensions, i.e., by network types (mono, multi, heterogeneous
    domains) or by function types ranging from simple state monitoring and traffic
    analysis to more advanced tasks such as network planning, maintenance, optimization,
    and operation. It is possible to combine multiple models to create a more complete
    and complex data model for more specific application scenarios; and (iii) Digital
    Twin Network Management functions that record the lifecycle of all twin entities’
    transactions, monitor and supervise the execution of individual models, supervise
    the performance and resource consumption of the digital network twin, and visualize
    and control other elements of the network such as topology management, model management,
    and security management. • Application Layer: represents all the network applications,
    such as cognitive management, predictive control, closed-loop management, operations,
    administration, maintenance (OAM), and management and orchestration (MANO) that
    can run on the DT platform. The application communicates with the DT platform
    through open network interfaces using request/response-based or event-based communication
    patterns. 3.5. International organization for standardization The ISO 23247 [25]
    has been investigating a novel standardized framework to support the creation
    of digital twins of observable manufacturing elements that include four domains,
    shown in Fig. 5: physical manufacturing, data collection and device control, digital
    twin representations and user domains. The scope of this framework covers the
    following standards: • ISO 23247-1: Overview and General principles [25]. • ISO
    23247-2: Reference architecture [62]. • ISO 23247-3: Digital representation of
    manufacturing elements [63]. • ISO 23247-4: Information Exchange [64]. Download

    ITU-T recommendations The ITU-TY.3090 [65] recommendation has been initiated by
    the ITU-T to describe the functional and service requirements and the architecture
    for twining the physical network with a DT network. The recommendation identifies
    four key characteristics of DTN: (i) Data is the cornerstone of DTN, is collected
    from the physical network and stored in a single source of truth, the data store
    that can be usable by DTN models; (ii) a mapping of the physical network infrastructure
    into its virtual twin replica; (iii) a model is a virtual abstraction that accurately
    reflects a physical network and can be used to interact with network applications,
    and (iv) open interfaces, southbound interfaces connect physical networks and
    virtual twin networks while northbound interfaces exchange information between
    virtual twin networks and network applications. The ITU recommendation has developed
    a three-layer, three-domain, and double closed-loop architecture as shown in Fig.
    6. It can digitally show the running status and health state. It can perceive
    the network state, efficiently mine valuable network information, and explore
    innovative network applications with friendly immersive interactive interfaces.

    standardization effort [92] has been recently initiated by ETSI recommendation
    to define a reference architecture, communication functionality, and properties
    for smart machine-to-machine communication (SmartM2M). The scope of the ETSI recommendation
    involves the following: • D1 Digital Twins and standardization opportunities in
    ETSI: aims to analyze the major characteristics and architectures of Digital Twins,
    identify their significant functionalities, select the candidate communication
    functionalities for standardization, and collection, identify and define use cases
    for industrial IoT, and identify their potential requirements. • D2 Digital Twins
    communication requirements: based on the previous recommendation D1, they aim
    to elaborate a common definition of Digital Twins’ communication functionality
    and properties and standardize their communication requirements. • D3 Digital
    Twins Functionalities and Reference Architecture: aims at providing a DT reference
    architecture by introducing a guideline for the adoption of Digital Twins in SmartM2M
    industries. • D4 Digital Twins support in oneM2M: aims at mapping the reference
    architecture developed in D3 to the oneM2M architecture and capabilities by clarifying
    the existing functionalities in oneM2M and developing their extensions, and developing
    new functionalities and functional entities to support the Digital Twins concepts.
    Furthermore, Context Information Management API (NGSI-LD) Specification [93] has
    been introduced by ETSI to describe different ways to publish, consume and subscribe
    to context information in multiple scenarios involving context entities, aka “digital
    twins”, that represent real-world assets. NGSI-LD describes how the context information
    can be modeled as attributes of DT entities. 4. Digital twin frameworks and prototypes
    The emergence of the DT has increased the development of software solutions and
    frameworks for creating and maintaining digital twin solutions in different industries.
    Table 3 illustrates state-of-the-art software implementation of digital twin technology.
    We identified the following criteria to evaluate different DT implementations:
    (i) open source or commercial, (ii) scalability, i.e., the ability to support
    an increasing number of remote connections from a physical system; (iii) latency,
    i.e., is minimized latency is obtained by optimizing both the communication and
    the computation; (iv) elasticity, i.e., implements a reactive elasticity between
    the cloud and the edge; (v) mobility, i.e., supports mobile physical systems;
    (vi) robustness, i.e., supports reliability of fidelity; (vii) context-awareness,
    and (viii) geo-distribution, i.e., highly distributed DT through elastic orchestration
    of service containers. 4.1. Eclipse Ditto Eclipse Ditto [66] has been introduced
    as an open-source project under the Eclipse IoT initiative to provide a ready-to-use
    functionality to manage the state of DTs. It offers functionalities to perform
    (i) Device-as-a-Service, by mirroring physical assets/devices, offering a high-level
    web API to access devices remotely and interact with digital twins; (ii) State
    management for digital twins, by enabling event-based notification of state changes
    and offering a single source of truth” for a physical asset; and (iii) Digital
    Twin Management, by providing meta-data and metamodel support to query, search,
    and select specific attributes from both the physical system and the virtual DT
    replicas. To this end, Eclipse Ditto offers a range of RESTful APIs [94] that
    can be used to build backend-less IoT applications and help developers to concentrate
    on the application’s business logic to build an enhanced user experience while
    simplifying the integration of various network protocols, brokers, and messaging
    systems [95]. Eclipse Ditto, combined with Eclipse Vorto (explained next), offer
    a generic and flexible Digital Twin framework. 4.2. Eclipse Vorto Eclipse Vorto1
    [67] has been introduced as an open-source project that provides a language for
    describing models and interfaces for IoT DTs. In IoT scenarios, digital twins
    are models of entities in the physical world, such as a multi-sensor device, a
    smart power plant, and other entities participating in IoT solutions. Modeling
    enables IoT solutions and IoT platforms to provision, use, and configure IoT devices
    and logical entities from multiple sources in a single solution. Eclipse Vorto
    addresses the subject of device abstraction, device description, and device integration.
    Digital twins are described using vortolang, which is a domain-specific language.
    Vortolang is used to describe the entities’ capabilities, IoT platforms and IoT
    solutions that can leverage the semantics of these IoT entities. It uses information
    models to provide abstract descriptions of device properties and features. The
    Vorto repository allows the management and sharing of these information models.
    Device manufacturers can publish information models, and developers can then download
    these information models. Vorto’s code generators make it possible to generate
    platform-specific source code from the information model. As a result, integrating
    a device with a specific platform is easier. The vortolang comprises a set of
    metamodel classes defining the capabilities of digital twins. Two top-level classes:
    Information Model and Function Block, describe a DT, and the capabilities of digital
    twins, respectively. Three metamodel classes describe capabilities: Properties,
    Events, and Operations. An Information Model describes a complete DT, such as
    a physical device, and defines the set of interfaces as Function Blocks implemented
    by the DT. A Function Block describes related capabilities that a DT implements.
    Function Blocks are reusable and can be reused across different Information Models.
    A Function Block is composed of properties, events, and operations. 4.3. Eclipse
    BaSyx Eclipse BaSyx2 project has been initiated as an open-source Industry 4.0
    middleware to support various functionalities and software components and implement
    digital twins that conform to the specification of Asset Administration Shell
    (AAS). BaSyx components include a registry component, persistency providers, and
    several container applications for Industry 4.0 applications [96]. BaSyx implements
    a service-oriented middleware architecture [97]. Eclipse BaSyx proposes the Virtual
    Automation Bus (VAB) architecture to offer end-to-end connectivity between physical
    assets and the DT through many heterogeneous communication protocols, brokers,
    and messaging services [68]. BaSyx also allows performing traditional CRUD (create,
    retrieve, update, delete and invoke) operations while ensuring interoperability
    among heterogeneous protocols and facilitating cross-layer interaction with the
    DT through VAB. 4.4. Nvidia Omniverse Nvidia Omniverse [91] has been introduced
    as a platform for building and operating metaverse applications wherever the digital
    and physical worlds meet. It has been updated to support various features for
    the metaverse, such as 3D internet to connect virtual 3D worlds and be viewed
    through a simulation engine. It offers Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)-based,
    diffusion model-based neural rendering tools and graph execution engines to control
    behavior, motion, and action procedurally. Thus, it makes it the most advanced
    commercial tool to process the kinematics of complex multipart objects for synthetic
    data generation and DT simulations [98]. In particular, Omniverse includes (i)
    the Replicator application, which is used to generate synthetic data to train
    self-driving cars, robots, and all kinds of computer vision models; ii JT Connector
    for the Siemens JT industry-standard language of product lifecycle management;
    (iii) and the interoperability format of CAD systems, like NX, Creo, Catia, and
    Inventor. 4.5. ScaleOut digital twin ScaleOut DT [69] has been seen as a cloud
    and on-premises service that offers a set of tools for building real-time DT models.
    It defines an in-memory data grid that uses the JSON format to serialize instances
    of digital twins. It also provides machine learning and statistical analysis tools
    for spike and trend change detection using unsupervised learning, as well as for
    anomaly detection for sets of numeric values using supervised learning. Additionally,
    ScaleOut provides cloud-hosted stream processing services through its two components,
    i.e., the ScaleOut Digital Twin Builder software toolkit and the ScaleOut Model
    Development Tool. The streaming service connects to data sources using popular
    event hubs, such as Microsoft Azure IoT Hub, Amazon AWS IoT Core, and Azure Kafka,
    and allows connections via an integrated REST messaging service. It offers a user
    interface (UI) to aggregate real-time continuous analytics and report dynamic
    changes in the state of data sources to the UI 4.6. Davra platform Davra3 [70]
    has been introduced as a full-stack open source Industrial IoT (IIoT) platform
    that helps to define, build and prototype digital twins for building single reliable,
    secure and scalable IoT applications. It offers an open library that facilitates
    making secure API calls to the connecting APIs on the DT. To this end, it defines
    a TwinType Object that retrieves the details of an existing twin, add new objects
    to the platform, add or update (key/value pairs), modify or delete a key from
    it, list all attachments of all Twins, etc. 4.7. FIWARE FiwareDT has been introduced
    in [71] to build real-world physical assets that can be represented as a static
    or dynamic digital entity using a Universal Resource Identifier (URI). These assets
    can have several attributes or properties that hold data and relationships that
    bring the Digital Twin entities together. FIWARE Ecosystem allows modeling DT
    data using a catalog of components and smart data models [99]. FIWARE Community
    has developed NGSI RESTful API to simplify access to DT data and NGSI-LD API as
    the data integration API in the Fiware DT architecture through an open-source
    Context Broker component (e.g., Orion-LD, Scorpio, and Stellio) to simplify the
    development of interfaces to integrate with IoT, robotics, and many other third-party
    systems, as well as to support Digital Twin data processing and monitoring and
    data processing engines (e.g., Apache Spark, Apache Flink), monitoring tools (e.g.,
    Grafana), and analysis platforms (e.g., Apache Superset). Additionally, to ensure
    interoperability with existing data models, the FIWARE Foundation has developed
    the Smart Data Models initiative,4 which provides a library of Data Models5 in
    JSON/JSON-LD format compatible with schema.org and NGSIv2/NGSI-LD APIs. 4.8. iTwin
    platform iTwin6 has been expanded to become an open source7 platform for creating,
    querying, modifying, and displaying Infrastructure Digital Twins for any scenario.
    iTwin has been developed using JavaScript to visualize and interact with DT assets
    using web browsers using Bentley cloud services [72], [100]. Additionally, it
    offers iModels API to access and manage DT information and bring DT infrastructure
    with existing servers, silos, politics, and hierarchy, and supports a federated
    data access layer to allow users to query the entire Federated Digital Twin as
    a whole for analytics and insights. iTwin is compatible with existing data format
    specifications (e.g., XML), drawings, documents, and BIM models, allows visualizing
    and analyzing BIM data, reality data, GIS, and IoT data streams in 3D and 4D using
    a web browser, and offers robust tools for viewing, interrogating, and interacting
    with the DT. 4.9. White label digital twin (WLDT) framework The WLDT8 [74] platform
    has been envisioned as an open-source Java-based framework to create Digital Twins
    for IoT applications. It intends to maximize modularity, re-usability, and flexibility
    to effectively mirror smart physical objects in their digital counterparts [101].
    It implements all the features and functionalities of a DT that can run in cloud
    and edge environments, and support a wide range of communication protocols and
    normalized data formats (e.g., CoAP, MQTT, Request/Response, Pub/Sub). The WLDT
    framework supports scalability and extensibility. It allows the creation of a
    modular IoT microservice architecture that easily integrates into the DT network
    through an extensible API. The core layer of the framework, called WLDT Engine,
    allows for defining, handling, and orchestrating the behavior of the twin and
    active modules (denoted as Workers). A Worker can be easily customized through
    a Processing Pipeline layer for processing incoming data or integrating with external
    third party services for data format translation and adaptation. The WLDT framework
    is expected to improve the modularity, re-usability and flexibility of digital
    twins by simplifying twin design and development. 4.10. Fraunhofer advanced asset
    administration shell tools (FA3ST) The FA3ST DT ecosystem9 has been developed
    as an open-source implementation of the AAS specification (including both Part
    1 and Part 2) to support Industry 4.0 [54], [102] applications. It has been augmented
    with a built-in open web service interfaces based on custom AAS model instance
    [103]. FA3ST provides an easy configuration via a JSON file and implements several
    other data formats (e.g., JSON, JSON-LD, XML, AML, RDF, OPC UA NODESET) for the
    AAS environment. It can also interconnect with several communication protocols
    (e.g., pull, pub/sub, MQTT, COAP, and IPv6) and interface and synchronize with
    several 3rd party implementations for the endpoint (e.g., HTTP, OPC UA), such
    as message bus, persistence, and asset connection. Furthermore, FA3ST uses the
    existing implementation of the AAS data model to enable data serialization and
    deserialization. It also offers a hybrid DT by intertwining different DT models
    using stream processing with Apache StreamPipes [104]. 4.11. Cyber–physical systems
    (CPS) twinning The CPS Twinning [76] platform has been conceived as an open-source
    framework for developing, generating, and executing digital twins for cyber–physical
    systems (CPS). CPS twinning uses automation ML (AML) [57] data exchange format
    to generate DT artifacts and automatically generate virtual environments for digital
    twins entirely from the specification. Additionally, the CPS twining framework
    implements another tool called CPS State Replication10 to enable the replication
    mode of CPS Twinning so that digital twin entities follow the states of their
    physical replicas by passively monitoring stimuli. The framework11 offers various
    security modules to support security analysts in monitoring the current state
    of CPS and implement customized security features, such as intrusion detection,
    access control, audit, and accountability. 4.12. XMPro XMPro12 enterprise framework
    has been developed to build real-time applications with fewer efforts at coding.
    It is a business process management (BPM)-based DT platform that consists of three
    main software components: (i) The XMPro App Designer is a low-code visual programming
    UI to create digital twin applications. It offers a visual environment for creating
    customized web pages by dragging blocks from the toolbox, configuring their properties,
    and connect them to diverse data sources; (ii) XMPro Data Stream Designer is a
    low-code integration and orchestration environment to connect real-time IoT data
    with analytics and actions. It provides an intuitive drag-and-drop interface to
    enable the design of stream processing through data pipelines, bring real-time
    data processing to a variety of sources, add and remove external data, and apply
    diverse types of machine learning and data mining algorithms to perform data analytics;
    and (iii) XMPro Connectors, which is an extensible library that includes hundreds
    of connectors for various industrial automation solutions, such as cloud PaaS
    environments, IoT platforms, AI/ML tools, etc. In particular, XMPro Connector
    implements the Azure Digital Twin Connector to interact with the Microsoft Azure
    Digital Twin platform. 4.13. Twinbase Twinbase [105] has been developed as an
    open-source platform for merging, managing and distributing DT documents. It creates
    a single interface to access the systems via an API gateway, called Data Link
    [106], which connects the features of a DT to make physical product data available
    and accessible from a single interface [107]. To this end, it stores metadata
    about the systems in a YAML document and implements a microservices’ architecture
    to offer better scalability, maintainability, and robustness against monolithic
    and single service failures. The API gateway facilitates requests and delivery
    of data and services, and ensures authentication. Twinbase contributes to the
    development of DT Web (DTW) [108], an approach introduced by the Digital Twin
    Web Association (DTWA) to develop, maintain and promote the Digital Twin Web initiative.
    At the core of this initiative is the development of DT document, often written
    in YAML, to combine the advantages of existing standards such as Industry 4.0
    Asset Administration Shell specification, the W3C Web of Things Thing Description
    and Microsoft Digital Twin Definition Language. 4.14. Azure DT Azure Digital Twins
    [109] has been introduced by Microsoft as a cloud-hosted enterprise-grade DT platform
    in the form of a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS). Azure DT is a more generic framework
    that allows the creation of twin graphs based on digital models for diverse use
    cases and scenarios. To this end, Azure DT models are created and defined in a
    JSON-like language called Digital Twins Definition Language (DTDL), which describes
    all data types, entries, states, properties, events, commands, relationships,
    etc., of the physical assets. Azure DT proposes a set of tools13 to define, create,
    and build DT applications. For example, the Azure DT Builder allows the development
    of DT processes more effectively by building and transforming building information
    modeling (BIM) into digital twins. Additionally, Microsoft has adopted the DTDL
    industry ontology to build diverse applications such as smart buildings (e.g.,
    modeling smart buildings using industry standards (like BRICK Schema or W3C Building
    Topology Ontology)), smart cities (i.e., supporting Open gile Smart Cities (OASC)
    and Sirus to provide a DTDL-based ontology for smart cities, starting with ETSI
    CIM NGSI-LD.), energy grids (e.g., monitoring grid assets, outage and impact analysis,
    simulation, and predictive maintenance), etc. In the energy grid, the ontology
    was created and adapted from the Common Information Model (CIM), a global standard
    for energy grid assets management, power system operations modeling, and the physical
    energy commodity market. The Azure Digital Twins Explorer is a visualization tool
    that demonstrates the interaction with a DT graph of a physical building. 4.15.
    AWS digital twin Amazon has been developing the AWS IoT TwinMaker [89] platform
    as a cloud-hosted commercial service to create digital twins of real-world systems,
    such as buildings, factories, industrial equipment, and production lines. Amazon
    IoT TwinMaker supports commonly used IoT protocols such as Message Queuing and
    Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) and low-power,
    long-range wide-area network (LoRaWAN). It can also easily interact with the Amazon
    Sumerian service, which offers capabilities to build 3D modeling and AR/VR interfaces
    to build applications along the lines of a DT. Furthermore, Amazon provides a
    Device Shadow service, which allows the creation of a shadow of a physical device
    and provides its states to the application. Device shadow metadata (i.e., states,
    version, security token, properties, etc.) are stored in JSON file format and
    communication with DT services through RESTful APIs. One example of such a DT
    service is the Hexagon Digital Reality (HxDR) platform, which offers DT capabilities
    for building structures on top of AWS. HxDR creates accurate, real-world digital
    representations of the physical assets (e.g., cities, buildings, structures, and
    landscapes) using data captured from airborne, ground, mobile sensors, etc. Similarly,
    Vertex (Vertex Software Visualization Platform for the Digital Twin) is another
    provider of capabilities for DTs on top of the AWS platform. 4.16. Bosch IoT suite
    The Bosch IoT Suite [90] has been developed as an advanced DT platform to provide
    manufacturing companies with all the needed tools and technologies to build and
    scale their own IoT solutions and to help manage DTs. It offers an open data model
    to enable digital representations of physical devices with unified device APIs
    based on the Eclipse Vorto Information Models. The Bosch IoT Suite14 is built
    on top of Eclipse IoT open-source projects and industry standards. This open approach
    allows customers to enjoy all the benefits of fully managed cloud services while
    avoiding vendor lock-in. As another advantage, partners and customers can influence
    the future development of the Bosch IoT Suite by participating in the underlying
    open-source project communities. Furthermore, the Bosch IoT Suite can integrate
    with AWS and connect to devices using diverse communication protocols (MQTT and
    Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP)) 5. Digital twin-based research projects
    In the past few years, we have seen an increase in research efforts by academia
    and industry for facilitating the transition to DT. We highlight in Table 4 a
    number of these projects, which we will deeply explore in this section. Table

    Radioactive Waste Management 5.1. SPIDER The SPIDER [110] project, which stands
    for cyberSecurity Platform for vIrtualiseD 5G cybEr Range services, aims at developing
    a digital twin to enforce cybersecurity in 5G wireless cellular network [111].
    The project aims at driving a new intelligent evolution to wireless network by
    replicating customized 5G networks and enabling the execution of real-time cyber-exercises
    [112]. The project allows gathering and sharing data between physical and virtualized
    network equipment and developing adaptive operational procedures to predict and
    manage security incidents, complex attacks, and propagated vulnerabilities [21].
    SPIDER project relies on a Service Mapping Model component for creating replicas
    of the 5G network, including User Equipment (UE), RAN and the 5G Core. Moreover,
    SPIDER leverages the Digital Twin Entity Management in the Mouseworld testbed
    [113] to generate network topologies and provision an executable service graph.
    5.2. LEAD LEAD [114] project has been driven by European research teams to create
    DTs of urban logistics networks in six European cities (e.g., Madrid, The Hague,
    Budapest, Lyon, Oslo, and Porto) to evaluate city logistics solutions by reproducing
    digital replicas of complex real-world urban environment, including different
    processes, actors, and their interactions to improve the resilience of the logistics
    chain. The long-term vision of the project is to develop an Open Physical Internet-inspired
    framework for Smart City Logistics that creates the foundations for the future
    European large-scale cities’ network of DTs. The project has been used to deliver
    efficient last-mile logistics and parcel delivery services and operations through
    forecasting and predictions of future states of the entire logistics lifecycle
    [115]. Furthermore, LEAD has been developing a variety of logistics solutions
    for shared, connected, and low-emission logistics operations. LEAD is empowered
    by adaptive agent-based models (ABM) approach that involves modeling, predictive
    analytics and decision-making methods, through the use of historical and real-time
    operational data to build lifecycle-oriented knowledge to develop integrated systems
    of logistics/freight operations in urban, metropolitan and urban areas. 5.3. DUET
    digital twins DUET project [73] has been developed to build an urban DT that creates
    virtual replicas of city environment, by modeling the interactions and the data
    exchange in urban ecosystems to better understand the interrelation between traffic,
    air quality, noise, and other urban factors. DUET project has been used to create
    the so-called T-Cell framework that acts as container for integrating together
    models, data, and simulations in a common environment that emulates real-world
    city ecosystem and helps to monitor and to synchronize the state and behavior
    of the DT with the physical environment [116]. Individual models are mirrored
    and integrated through APIs to form a federation of composable models that can
    be used to perform various analytics-based on both real-time feeds, and historical
    data gathered from IoT devices connected in smart cities’ environments. To this
    end, the DUET project builds large datasets, from both historic and real-time
    data, provides a dashboard to remotely monitor, in closed-loop control procedures,
    the anomalies, and deviations before a disaster strikes. It also builds embedded
    ML and AI functions to better predict different situations [117], such as the
    depreciation of road infrastructure or carbon footprint, thereby transitioning
    to a new age of responsive cities. 5.4. 5G-DIVE The 5G-DIVE [118] project has
    been devoted to the development of 5G connectivity solution that supports distributed
    edge computing use cases, such as deep AI/ML twinning for replica of a robotic
    arm for teleoperation [119], Zero Defect Manufacturing (ZDM), Massive Machine-Type-of
    Communication (mMTC), Drone Collision Avoidance System (DCAS) and Intelligent
    Image Processing for Drones (IIPFD), etc. For example, for robotic arm, the project
    creates a digital replicas of the Niryo One Robotic manipulator and synchronizes
    their movements in different scenarios. It has been used to send continuous stream
    of commands from the DT applications to the robot arm, compares and analyzes joint
    state vectors of both twins. Another use case developed in the project concerns
    the Business Automation Support Stratum (BASS), which is a orchestrator drivers
    different orchestrator frameworks (e.g., K8s and FogO5). First, 5G-DRIVE creates
    a Docker-based lightweight containerized service to deploy IoT applications. Then,
    these containers are migrated inside Kubernetes pods to achieve global. Next,
    the BASS Vertical Service Descriptor was created to deploy the service through
    the BASS. Finally, DT containers are chained to form en end-to-end system that
    involves a Fog Orchestration Manager (FOM) and a Fog Infrastructure Manager (FIM)
    [120]. 5.5. 5GROWTH The 5GROWTH [121] research project, which stands for 5G-enabled
    Growth in Vertical Industries, has been dedicated to empower multiple European
    vertical industries, such as industry 4.0, transportation, and energy with AI
    and DT -driven automated 5G end-to-end solutions [122]. The project has been foreseen
    to optimize the production line in manufacturing industry, improve the service
    delivery and Service Level Agreement (SLA) in 5G virtualized edge network, offload
    edge computation resources through deployment configurations, and support efficient
    data exchange between physical devices and their virtual components [123]. The
    project has been used to reduce the cost of physical connected objects, improving
    real-time operations for edge network, and achieving faster response to environment
    changes across diverse real-time applications such as visualization and remote
    control, that require ultra-low latency and high reliability [124]. 5GROWTH project
    develops a DT as a Service (DTaaS) [125], in which an Edge Robotic DT can be remotely
    controlled, coordinated and monitored while performing different industrial tasks
    in a factory floor, thereby open new opportunities towards the future manufacturing
    systems, by eliminating defective pieces and repetitively performing accurate
    tasks at high-speed [126]. Finally, 5GROWTH develops a protocol stack published
    as open source15 to enable online network resource allocation [127], service provisioning,
    and autonomous and dynamic management of a 5G network infrastructure [128]. 5.6.
    Iot-NGIN IoT-NGIN [129] has been focusing on implementing Meta-Level Digital Twins
    that allows on-usage interpretation and application of data and information and
    delivers improved efficiency and traffic congestions, in human centered twin smart
    cities. IoT-NGIN supports novel digital twins’ functionality to enable high-availability
    and what-if scenarios. It relies on a microservices-oriented architecture to build
    a distributed ledger (i.e., blockchain) to enforce the security (detection of
    network intrusions, detection of fraudulent ML model poisoning activities) and
    trust of federated DT network, manage the entire lifecycle of multi-faced data
    sharing and metadata management based on the ontology meta-level digital twins’
    data interfaces [130]. The meta-level DT layer abstracts the underlying implementation
    details, by providing a unique interface for utilizing decentralized security.
    Such an approach has been seen in other DT projects such as Asset Administration
    Shell (AAS) [54] and the Web of Things (WoT) Thing Description (TD) [131]. Furthermore,
    within the context of IoT-NGIN, digital twins are employed to mimic the behavior
    of connected IoT devices, facilitate the interaction between the physical and
    the virtual twins, in order to increase the service reliability, boost the performance
    of data services provisioning, and increase lifetime trackability and traceability.
    Additionally, IoT-NGIN is expected to use Self-Sovereign Identities (SSI) to control
    of the identity of the physical twins and guaranteeing virtual device identity
    uniqueness in distributed federated DT network. Machine learning services are
    foreseen to deliver the needed abstraction to operate transparently in the physical-digital
    continuum. Finally, the IoT-NGIN project builds a DT models for diverse scenarios,
    e.g., training distributed AI models on traffic flow and parking prediction, event
    detection, crowd management, etc. 5.7. DIGIPREDICT DIGIPREDICT [132] has been
    used to develop a DT to predict the progression of disease in infectious and cardiovascular
    diseases. It deploys edge AI technologies to create digital representation of
    a patient [133] to predict whether COVID-19 patients will develop severe cardiovascular
    complications. the project develops a smart patch with wearable technology for
    collecting a range of medical data and monitor how well the treatment is working.
    5.8. SWAMP project SWAMP [134] has been used to create a DT for smart farming
    [135], by enabling precision irrigation for agriculture [31], optimizing the use
    of water, reducing the energy consumption and improving the quality of crops [136].
    The project aims at reducing the development effort for IoT-based smart farming
    applications, automating smart agriculture platforms by integrating heterogeneous
    technologies such as IoT, Big Data, flying sensors, and Cloud/Fog to predict the
    usage of IoT in smart water management settings 5.9. Hexa-X Hexa-X16 has been
    an immensely successful 6G research project that aims at integrating digital and
    physical worlds with human interaction for a privacy-preserving high-availability
    DTs [137]. It develops a set of use cases including massive network twinning services,
    cooperative robots, human in the loops, telepresence, as well as AI-driven communication
    and computation co-design [138]. Hexa-X develops fully immersive digital twins
    for twinning of the physical sensing/actuators and programmable digital representations.
    Moreover, it helps to flexibly assign heterogeneous resources and dependable network
    services in carrier-grade mobile communication networks beyond 5G, while ensuring
    network slices isolation, privacy-preserving, tightly coupled and seamlessly intertwined
    network, and ensure resilient services. The project extends the concept of DT
    of industrial processes to smart manufacturing, sustainable food production, healthcare,
    ailments of crops and livestock. 5.10. IoTwins IoTwins17 [139] has been used to
    create distributed digital twins for industrial SMEs. It delivers large-scale
    industrial testbeds by leveraging big-data stream processing and combining data
    coming from diverse sources, such as data APIs, embedded sensors in manufacturing,
    maintenance, operations, facility management, and Open Data sources. The project
    goal is to build a reference architecture for distributed and edge-enabled digital
    twins deployed at plant gateways of production plants and processes. Furthermore,
    the project proposes to create hierarchical organization of edge twins for orchestrating
    IoT sensors and actuators in a production locality and cloud twins for performing
    time-consuming and typically off-line parallel simulation, physical simulation,
    on-line and off-line optimization, and deep-learning. 5.11. MeDiTATe MeDiTATe
    [140] has been established as a medical DT as a service for aneurysm prevention
    and treatment, which aims at integrating big data analytics, augmented reality,
    haptic devices, Reduced Order Models (ROM), automated computer aided engineering
    and additive manufacturing in order to implement in silico analysis into clinical
    practice [141]. The project helps to prevent cardiovascular diseases and improve
    clinical practice through the development of software solutions to provide advanced
    training in the healthcare DT domain [142]. Specifically, MeDiTATe proposes to
    develop a healthcare DT pipeline based on reduced order modeling to enable fast
    and interactive evaluation of the hemodynamic parameters of a modified Blalock–Taussig
    shunt to augment pulmonary blood flow in single ventricle lesions [143]. 5.12.
    PREDIS PREDIS [144] has been developing a DT framework including models and methods
    for handling data in radioactive waste management in the nuclear back-end [145].
    The DT framework is used for visualizing, optimizing and supporting work processes
    in decommissioning, performing safety-critical processes under strict qualification
    requirements, dealing with radiological hazards and associated data types, models,
    and sensors in nuclear power plants. Furthermore, PREDIS uses different tools,
    such as geochemical models and chemo-mechanical models, to predict the years-long
    evolution of radioactive waste packages under different scenarios. To this end,
    the project builds an interoperable BIM platform along with 2D and 3D visualization
    of architectural models to demonstrate the viability of waste package management
    and the complexity of involved processes/models. 5.13. Zero-SWARM Zero-SWARM [146]
    has been developing a private 5G network that connects to edge-cloud continuum,
    data analytics, and digital twins to create agile and climate-friendly cyber–physical
    production systems of systems (CPSoS) to address the manufacturing sector in Europe.
    It builds innovative tools18 to improve the reliability of the energy system in
    Europe and make them more resilient to future shocks, improve maintenance operations,
    detect anomalies, forecast demand, etc. Furthermore, Zero-SWARM [147] CPSoS’ architecture,
    specifications, and requirements strive to achieve climate-neutral and digitized
    manufacturing and develop a human-centric, open swarm framework to minimize waste
    and pollution in manufacturing. 6. Digital twin use cases Digital twin use cases
    are applicable across multiple industries and functions, and the number of domains
    that aim to enable DT is growing significantly. We present in Table 5 a summary
    of some DT applications, which we deeply discuss in this section. Table 5. Summary

    attention in several domains, like smart cities [148]. The DT city is expected
    to offer a model of urban planning and construction for future sustainable cities
    by combining metaverse and AI tools to improve urban operational mechanisms and
    simplify urban upgrading. Lehtola et al. [149] have discussed different technologies
    in the DT ecosystem that help city planning and urban development, implement autonomous
    updating of city DTs and build semantic matching with the (BIM) model, geometrical
    matching with the model, and model validation. Bauer et al. [151] have developed
    open-source software components atop of the FIWARE [93] DT ecosystem, which combines
    the lifecycle model for DT with a conceptual model to offer reactive, predictive,
    and forecasting functionalities to extract knowledge to build an urban DT model
    that gathers data from dispersed IoT infrastructure in smart cities. To this end,
    the authors used the ETSI NGSI-LD [71] Information Model and APIs to represent
    IoT entities and their data (e.g., URI, location, properties, sensor information
    or characteristics, etc.) in smart cities. Similarly, Wolf et al. [150] have developed
    a DT platform for smart cities towards enabling accident-free urban life and making
    cities more inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. The authors identified
    different needs of stakeholders involved in an incident response, as well as the
    available data before accidents to process (e.g., topography, buildings, administrative
    borders, existing hazard maps, fire and ambulance services, police, local authorities,
    Environment Agency, NHS bodies, and critical infrastructures such as gas, water,
    etc.). Hence, we argue that DT can accelerate livability, workability, and sustainability,
    by treating city-wide data as an asset, thereby removing barriers, enhancing energy
    efficiency, and reducing the environmental impact, helping in mitigating risks,
    and managing resources more effectively. 6.2. Smart agriculture Nowadays, there
    is significant interest in enabling DTs in smart framing, improving the digitalization
    of agricultural and food production, offering advanced data processing techniques
    in agricultural field [136], [152], [153], [154], [155]. DT for smart farming
    can be designed as a service aggregator that offers farmers have an ergonomic
    and simple plug-and-play interface to query relevant data, support the farmers
    in understanding the change better, propose playful and explainable solutions
    using explainable AI, and help to promote knowledge sharing and collaborative
    and inclusive learning. For example, the authors in [9] proposed a conceptual
    framework for designing and implementing a smart agriculture DT system to plan,
    monitor, control, and optimize farm processes, as illustrated in Fig. 7. The framework
    seamlessly integrates sensing and monitoring, smart analyses, and planning of
    smart farming operations. Besides, it offers different features for crops monitoring,
    predictive maintenance of farming machines, autonomous decision-making and recollection,
    prescriptive management of the entire farming lifecycle. Alves et al. [31] have
    presented a DT solution for smart water management in the agriculture domain,
    which creates a virtual replica of a soil probe to build a DT environment that
    displays its information in a dashboard to help farmers better understand the
    state of their resources and equipment. Likewise, Nasirahmadi et al. [158] have
    announced a DT framework in soil, irrigation, robotics, farm machinery, and food
    post-harvest processing in the agricultural field. The authors proposed including
    emerging technology such as artificial intelligence, big data, simulation, analysis,
    prediction, and IoT to support the future generation of smart farming. For example,
    gathering real-time data for the lands (physical world) and updating its virtual
    twin to provide a straightforward monitoring tool through the DT interfaces for
    evaluating the soil quality and monitoring the moisture, temperature, organic
    matter, and soil pollutants. Furthermore, it also enables the decision-making
    process of smart farming and digital soil mapping, supervising crop health and
    productivity, identifying key soil characteristics, quantifying the trend of agricultural
    soil conditions, evaluating and forecasting plants’ irrigation requirements, supporting
    irrigation and water distribution planning to reduce chemical fertilizer and pesticide
    dosages, improve the underground water, reduce climate degradation and protect
    human health. For instance, soil moisture information can be used to assess irrigation
    efficiency in agricultural fields Download : Download high-res image (409KB) Download

    Digital Twins can accelerate healthcare transformation [159]. The central idea
    is to generate a patient-specific DT from different data sources, including laboratory
    tests, ultrasounds, imaging devices, and genetic tests. It helps to develop digital
    health services that help people assess and treat simple medical conditions using
    AI, i.e., capturing health data in DTs, such as medical history, mood tracker,
    symptom tracker, and auto-capture from fitness equipment and wearable like the
    Apple Watch. That is, the DT can provide baseline first-line information or help
    guide priorities and interactions with physicians to treat more serious or persistent
    conditions [190]. SHENGLI et al. [161] have described the possibility of constructing
    a Human Digital Twin, its architecture, security, and other main issues. The authors
    review the origin of the Digital Twin and present the concept of the Augmented
    Digital Twin (ADT), an extended Digital Twin which is the basis of the Human Digital
    Twin (HDT). The HDT application layer architecture is composed of the following
    layers: • The Data Collection Layer collects data such as Blood Pressure. • These
    data need to be pre-processed and will be gathered to the sink center through
    local area • All data are stored in the Cloud Database, where many mathematical
    digital models, representation, and computing platforms which construct the core
    of the HDT are deployed to provide function interface to the Application Layer.
    • The Application Layer provides healthcare management, disease diagnosis, exercise
    suggestion, diet recommendation. Healthcare DT helps to improve the caregiver
    experience, e.g., helps caregivers capture and find information shared between
    physicians and multiple specialists. A DT can model the patient, then use technologies
    like Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand all the data and cut out
    the noise to summarize what is happening. It saves time and improves the accuracy
    of capturing and presenting information such as specific medications, health conditions,
    and other details that providers need to know in context to make clinical decisions.
    Additionally, DT can help in surgery planning, i.e., improve the planning of surgical
    interventions and evaluate the results afterward. Digital twins help to generate
    the shape of a cuff between the heart and the arteries, helps brain surgeons treat
    aneurysms by using simulations to improve patient safety. It can also improve
    the ability to plan and perform less invasive surgery using catheters to place
    single implants. Hence, individual patient data helps customize simulations that
    run on an integrated DT simulation and therefore the DT simulation results can
    greatly reduce the need for follow-up surgery. 6.4. Smart manufacturing Digital
    twin has been introduced to simply and automate the generation of simulation models
    in smart factories [179], [180], [181], [182]. In the light of the recent advances
    in smart manufacturing, the authors in [183] introduced a framework to capture
    changes in the asset across its life-cycle within a DT from the perspective of
    data architecture. This contributes to research with the ability for synchronization
    between the physical and the digital world to establish closed loops. The developed
    ontology-based approach offers opportunities for model and model-traceability
    to apply model-based systems engineering development approaches for DT solutions.
    The authors in [184] presents a proof of concept cyber–physical production system
    CPPS demonstrator which uses an open-source low-cost microcontroller to enable
    data communication between a V-bending machine and its DT. OPC UA was successfully
    used as a communication protocol, where the microcontroller was established as
    the OPC UA server, while the PC used to run the stress prediction algorithm and
    database was established as the OPC UA Client. Data from the physical process
    was transmitted to the DT, which used data analytics to predict maximum stress
    and strain, giving a deeper insight to the manufacturing process. An information
    dashboard presented the end user with process key performance indicators and DT
    information. AHELEROFF et al. [185] have presented a Digital Twin reference architecture
    and show its application in an industrial case. The authors also introduce Digital
    Twin as a Service (DTaaS) for the digital transformation of unique wetlands with
    considerable advantages, including smart scheduled maintenance, real-time monitoring,
    remote controlling, and predicting functionalities. The findings indicate that
    there is a significant relationship between Digital Twin capabilities as a service
    and mass individualization. Furthermore, the authors present a literature view
    about Industry 4.0, and describe a reference model and a DT architecture, and
    individualization. And how Digital Twin enables monitoring, controlling, and schedule
    maintenance for wetlands as a representative for a massive number of unique and
    dynamic physical assets. The authors in [187] present a modeling framework for
    self-adaptive manufacturing that supports modeling domain-specific cases, describing
    rules for case similarity and case-based reasoning within a modular Digital Twin.
    Automatically configuring Digital Twins based on explicitly modeled domain expertise
    can improve manufacturing times, reduce wastage, and, ultimately, contribute to
    better sustainable manufacturing. Indeed, integrating CBR (Case-Based Reasoning)
    into DTs to make it possible to adapt to new conditions autonomously. The CBR
    cycle is divided into four phases: (1) retrieve the case most similar to the current
    situation; (2) reuse the solution of the most similar case; (3) revise that solution
    if the case differs too much from the current situation; and (4) retain the revised
    case in the knowledge base. Kafkes and al. [188] present continuing work on a
    real-time artificial intelligence (AI) control system for precisely regulating
    the Gradient Magnet Power Supply (GMPS), an important subsystem of the Fermilab
    Booster accelerator complex, by training a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to capture
    its full dynamics. They implement a simple multi-layer perceptron (MLP)19 as a
    policy model. Additionally, they use of a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), which
    are LSTMs are able to learn about previous inputs through the accumulation of
    weights in a hidden global state variable. 6.5. Wireless networking The concept
    of DT network (DTN) [61], [191] has recently emerged as a virtual representation
    of the physical network infrastructure that aims at analyzing, diagnosing, simulating
    and controlling the physical network based on data, model and interface, to achieve
    the real-time interactive mapping between physical network and virtual twin network
    [167]. Specifically, the next-generation (NextG) wireless technologies (e.g.,
    5G-and-Beyond networks) are expected to simplify the deployment of DT at different
    communication layers in order to fulfill the monitoring and control requirements
    of the future IoT applications and services [24]. In this context, Lu et al. [192]
    have introduce the Digital Twin Wireless Networks (DTWN) by incorporating DTs
    into wireless networks, to migrate real-time data processing and computation to
    the edge plane. Then, they propose a blockchain empowered federated learning framework
    running in the DTWN for collaborative computing, which improves the reliability
    and security of the system, and enhances data privacy by formulating an optimization
    problem for edge association and exploit multi-agent reinforcement learning to
    find an optimal solution to the problem. Numerical results on real-world dataset
    show that the proposed scheme yields improved efficiency and reduced cost compared
    to benchmark learning method. Khan and al. [170] argue that in order to enable
    future Internet of Everything (IoE) in the forthcoming 6G network, there is a
    need for novel framework can be used to manage, operate, and optimize the wireless
    network infrastructure and its underlying IoE services. Such a framework should
    be based on DTs, with the support of advanced continuous machine learning and
    optimization techniques, along with edge and cloud computing, network augmentation,
    and privacy and security-related technologies such as blockchain, homomorphic
    encryption, etc. Sun et al. [193] have presented a new vision of Digital Twin
    Edge Networks (DITEN), where DTs of edge servers estimate edge servers’ states
    and DT of the entire MEC system provides training data to minimize the offloading
    latency under the constraints of accumulated consumed service migration cost during
    user mobility. A mobile offloading scheme is proposed based on deep reinforcement
    learning (DRL) in DITEN to minimize the offloading latency under the constraint
    of accumulated consumed service migration cost during user mobility. The formal
    problem of dynamic multi-objective optimization is simplified by using Lyapunov,
    and the simplified problem is solved by deep reinforcement learning. Hexa-X project
    [137], [138] proposed to implement a digital system for the forthcoming 5G and
    6G wireless cellular networks towards supporting future industrial use cases such
    as autonomous and collaborative robots, massive twinning, holographic telepresence.
    Furthermore, Hexa-X proposed to study radio channel characterization and beam
    forming in mm-wave and sub-THz bands. As a part of the future 6G design, Hexa-X
    foresees to develop digital models for air-interface above 100 GHz and the development
    of low-cost, energy-efficient, and high-performance network monitoring, management,
    and orchestration solutions. It envisions seamless unification of the physical,
    digital, and human worlds, by providing fully immersive CPS integration using
    both metaverse and massive DT representations. Besides, the DT approach developed
    in Hexa-X project enable dynamic control of 5G slicing, ensuring that QoS guarantees
    are met for each slice with the respect of the diverse traffic patterns, and ensure
    the resource allocation is achieved for each slice with the respect of SLA agreements.
    It also envisions fair capacity assignment and planning for future 6G infrastructure
    on-the-fly. 6.6. Satellite communication Digital twin has been adopted to build
    satellite network emulator and implement small satellites management system, as
    depicted in Fig. 8, to monitor the health state of wireless links (e.g., delay
    and bandwidth), by retrieving and compiling information, logs and other data collected
    from the satellite segment [194]. For example, Petersen et al. [168], [169] have
    implemented an architecture for a dynamic link network emulator to fuel satellite
    digital in order to increase service availability. Similarly, Zhao et al. [91]
    have implemented an inter-satellite handover scheme to transfer existing users’
    connections from one satellite to another satellite, by reducing frequent disconnection
    and improving the capacity of wireless satellites’ links. The authors implemented
    a genetic algorithm as part of the DT to improve the quality of data delivery,
    reduce the latency and enhance the bandwidth between satellites. Furthermore,
    DT is promising technology to address the requirements of space congestion, as
    it contributes to the reduction of space debris. Specifically, DT helps to develop
    AI-based collision detection and signal interference prediction models to enhance
    collision avoidance and improve tracking methods of satellites, hence helps to
    avoid potential collisions with debris while achieving self-repair, warning against
    cyberattacks, and optimizing the fuel usage. Download : Download high-res image

    industry. 6.7. CyberSecurity As DT becomes more open to different industries stakeholders,
    however, the cybersecurity risks associated with its integration with traditional
    industries are often insufficiently explored. Holmes et al. [195] have surveyed
    different risks related to employing DT into these traditional use cases and studied
    different opportunities to mitigate cyber-security risks. Eckhart et al. [76]
    have proposed a framework to generate virtual environment from specification and
    tested security risks on live systems. The authors developed security modules
    on top of the framework for monitoring security threads and safety rules. Filippo
    et al. [21] have suggested a security testbed to automate offensive tactics using
    Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) solution, simulated defensive and penetration
    test exercises. Dietz et al. [196] have presented a process-based security framework
    to integrate DT security simulations in the security operations center. They used
    DT to simulate a man-in-the-middle attack and assist enterprise security by simulating
    attacks and analyzing the effect on the virtual counterpart. Furthermore, there
    are significant recent research efforts to unlock the potential of cybersecurity
    in DT environments [154], [197], [198], [199], [200], [201], [202]. These efforts
    focus on the design of safety rules at the planning phase, with the aim to predict
    and manage risks. Nonetheless, there is a need for advanced and standardized approaches
    that align with international regulations (e.g., NIS/GDPR Compliance), enable
    continuous cyber risk assessment, allow zero-day simulation and defense, and offer
    cybersecurity forensics. 6.8. Cultural heritage Europe’s cultural heritage strives
    to the diversity and rich mosaic of cultural and creative expressions, rooted
    in its art, architecture, practices, places, objects, artistic expressions, film,
    values, different types of music, economics, literature, and philosophy. The increasing
    need for shaping Europe’s digital future has fueled the need for the digitalization
    of our cultural heritage, thanks to the recent technologies such as Big Data,
    3D digital acquisition devices, 3D laser scanners, AI, 3D and XR. In the light
    of these evolving technologies and due to the complexity of the cultural heritage
    data and of their intrinsic interrelationships, Niccolucci et al. [203] have introduced
    a Heritage Digital Twin (HDT) to digitalize the Heritage Assets (HA). The authors
    proposed a novel ontology model in the frame of the Europeana platform to improve
    the digital transformation of cultural heritage and enhance the design and organization
    of digital space using DT for cultural heritage that models cultural heritage
    assets and their digital information. In parallel, Darwish et al. [204] have suggested
    an Historical BIM (HBIM) powered by Digital Twins for monitoring the deterioration
    of heritage structures, and blockchain for efficient and effective preventive
    conservation. Historical BIM creates a comprehensive and efficient data management
    system that collects data from different IoT sensors to create a high-fidelity
    physical replica of artworks. Likewise, Massafra et al. [205] have proposed new
    tools for managing the workflow of HBIM of Italian modern buildings built between
    the 1920s and 1960s. Their approach carries out information acquisition about
    the building, measures energy intervention, computes construction costs during
    building’s life cycle in order to predict their thermal demand. 7. Open challenges
    The concept of the digital twin is not new. However, despite the benefits in different
    domains, there are several thriving challenges towards its adoption at scale [206],
    [207]. These challenges should be addressed holistically to realize the significant
    advantages of their deployments. This section delves into the open issues that
    slowed down the widespread adoption of digital twin technology. 7.1. Security
    and vulnerability Cybersecurity is a significant challenge that faces the extensive
    adoption of DT [208]. Cyberthreats involving access to confidential data by unauthorized
    bodies pose a severe risk. In particular, scenarios involving multi-parties, data
    ownership, and intellectual properties should be considered. Different authorization
    roles, data accessibility limitations, and responsibilities should be granted
    to only authorized participating stakeholders. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
    should be implemented in the digital twin to restrict network access based on
    a person’s role [209], [210]. Furthermore, security and privacy are the main concerns
    for sharing IoT data among distributed digital twin infrastructures. In particular,
    data in the DT network are fed and backed between the physical object and the
    virtual model, making the virtual model vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks. Such
    attacks are critical for scenarios like remote robot surgery, intelligent transportation
    systems, and federated EU airport operations. Additional risks of data leakage
    arising from data aggregation, i.e., in some scenarios such as smart cities, future
    smart fabrics, healthcare, etc., data coming from different involved parties should
    be merged to improve the decision-making process and achieve connected digital
    twins. However, a significant risk is that data aggregators could be storing all
    shared data in one place, which creates a new and the heightened security risk
    for the digital twin. Besides, as the digital twin needs to synchronize the virtual
    replicas with the physical, real-world system or entities in real-time, data or
    a subset of data should be exchanged between both parties to achieve synchronization,
    which inevitably increases the surface attack and augment the risk of data leakage
    [10]. 7.2. Privacy-preserving Digital twins and the metaverse are envisioned to
    advance the future of healthcare and precision medicine [211]. Healthcare data
    contains sensitive and personal information that could be attractive to many parties.
    Therefore, healthcare systems require access control models to prevent cyber-attackers
    from using sensitive data for financial transactions with third-party providers,
    who may perform data analysis to identify individuals [212]. Digital twins for
    healthcare should ensure privacy and data integrity to protect the data from unauthorized
    access attempts from inside the network so that the system grants access to only
    authorized parties [7]. Conventional cryptographic primitives and access control
    models that empower traditional IoT communication have reached their limitations
    and cannot ensure the protection of health data existing in the healthcare industry,
    specifically when attacks could be intentional. 7.3. Ethics Responsibility, ethics,
    decency, and morality are essential pillars to enhance its innovation in digital
    twin [213]. Therefore, Simone et al. [214] discussed the ethics of digital twins
    in smart agriculture and highlighted the need for data sovereignty regarding data
    aggregation and data analytics on framing data. Similarly, in light of the ethical
    concerns in the healthcare domain, Derrick et al. [215] discussed the ethical
    considerations of psychological effects of the digital twin in the healthcare
    domain. Popa et al. [216] anticipated privacy and socio-ethical issues, especially
    when there is a digital twin connection between the patient and the model is established.
    Braun et al. [217] defined conditions that should be met for digital twins to
    take on an ethically justifiable form of representation, not only for improving
    diagnosis and therapy but also for providing future states of health and illness.
    Braun et al. [218] have elaborated a concise reflection on the ethical challenges
    of DT in healthcare and medicine. The authors suggest that patients should have
    control over their simulated and virtual representation and highlight the ambivalence
    in representation between enabling new modes of freedom and endangering through
    the predictive mode of digital twins. Another vital aspect in ensuring ethical
    digital twins is achieving data transparency and avoiding data bias while providing
    seamless data integration and making predictions. For example, historical data
    used to build virtual models in digital twins should not imply discrimination
    between target freedom rights, especially when human behavioral manipulation is
    involved [215]. Besides, even though digital twins create replicated copies of
    the human body, it should not conflict with human dignity, i.e., treating patients
    as a thing or robots is considered highly inappropriate and unethical. Hence,
    digital twins should not be used to amplify inequality, shorten the lives of some
    people for the benefit of others. 7.4. Scalability and complexity With the increasing
    adoption of the digital twin in large-scale projects like building construction,
    healthcare, automotive, aerospace, railcar design, military, and defense, etc.,
    digital twin networks become significantly complex as they need sophisticated
    data acquisition and storage [219] to design and build relevant models for these
    industries. Both the software and hardware components required to build the DT
    systems become more constrained and complex, e.g., they involve advanced techniques
    such as AR/VR and metaverse . Although significant efforts are to build scalable
    DT solutions [220], [221], they tend to implement specific scenarios in controllable
    areas such as labs and small factories. Therefore, we need efficient and cost-effective
    tools and software models that fit the requirements of different DT domains, ensure
    higher scalability and deal with big data analytics and massive network data processing
    to achieve more accurate models and higher performance in large-scale distributed
    DT scenarios. 7.5. Real-time properties A digital twin is envisioned to replicate
    physical entities to their virtual entities and enable synchronization between
    them to achieve real-time replication. To this end, data should be exchanged among
    potentially wireless and wired network infrastructure, potentially, each has its
    own routing and forwarding protocols, such as wireless cellular networks, Wi-Fi,
    optical metropolitan Ethernet, etc., which should be able to provide the right
    data at the right place and time. These networks, however, offer different Quality
    of Service (QoS) settings, which may impact the service level agreement (SLA),
    i.e., model simulation data could encounter higher latency (around 100 ms) and
    lower bandwidth, which will impact the delivery of real-time information and therefore
    influence the real-time synchronization between the real world and the DT system.
    Additionally, the emergence of new IoT services and applications, such as remote
    robot-assisted surgery [222] pose strict real-time QoS requirements on the underlying
    network. However, given the distributed nature of the digital twin systems and
    the variation of the network delay (e.g., queuing and propagation delays), it
    becomes challenging to keep network digital twins in sync or auto-sync between
    the physical network and digital twin network. Reflecting the changes in the physical
    entities to their virtual replicas in real-time can be even more challenging.
    Similarly, Digital Twins require continuous interaction between real-world objects
    and their virtual representation in real-time and reliable two-way communications.
    However, due to the dynamic behavior and the frequent changing in the network
    environment, it becomes challenging to ensure strict reliability, low latency,
    and real-time requirements over the future wireless broadband 5G/6G network. To
    achieve this goal, it is necessary to provide an efficient network architecture
    that aids in developing many scalable, interoperable and predictable IoT applications.
    This network architecture must be flexible enough to be reprogrammed following
    any change in the digital object. Additionally, we need to simplify the design
    of network digital twins as much as possible, describe and specify QoS and real-time
    requirements of different DT applications, and achieve automated resource allocation
    and orchestration to fulfill the requirements of these applications. 7.6. Interoperability
    and standardization There are several research projects to achieve the different
    visions, perhaps diverging designs, developments, and implementations of a digital
    twin. As described in Section 3, multiple parties have been involved in the standardization
    and design of diverse digital twin architectures. Most of them lack consensus
    when implementing DT systems. Hence, digital twins are harmed by fragmentation
    and heterogeneity since each model is developed from scratch, no common methods,
    models, or mechanisms are considered. There are no open and standardized open
    interfaces to meet the requirements of all digital twin stakeholders, which makes
    it difficult and even impossible to ensure interoperability among different DT
    implementations. However, providing common data standards and interoperability
    can ensure the widespread adoption of DT technologies in various domains. Therefore,
    there is a need to develop novel modeling tools to build models for digital twins
    that draw on several industry schemas. There are several research efforts to build
    a generalized library to create an interoperable implementation of the IoT digital
    twin. For example, Picone et al. [74], [101] introduced WLDT (White Label Digital
    Twins), a general-purpose library for developing different modular DT systems
    for IoT. Similarly, several other solutions [48], [55], [56], [102], [116], [223]
    have been explored to provide a framework to enable modular, adaptable, and interoperable
    software agents for sharing data across the different lifecycle phases; however,
    they tend to provide implementations for specific use cases or DT domains. Furthermore,
    despite the recent efforts achieved by Microsoft towards providing a standardized
    definition language for describing models, devices, entities, objects, etc. in
    digital twin [86], helping to implement vertical use cases and complex modeling
    relationships, however, more efforts are required to develop open vendor-neutral
    DTDL to achieve an accurate representation of the physical environment. Such a
    DTDL should ensure the consistency of DT technical implementations and support
    the heterogeneity of devices and vendors that adopt the DT technology. Hence,
    an open and unified digital twin network system and abstract interfaces are required
    to keep all the expected common functionalities and components to enable cross-industry
    implementations of DT systems and ensure compatibility and interoperability. 7.7.
    High-fidelity data modeling difficulties As many industrial sectors are turning
    to digital twins to improve the operational efficiency and enhance the workflow
    and life cycle of their products, digital twin data modeling should not only focus
    on the accuracy of model functions but also should consider flexibility and the
    expendability of the model to compose and extend future requirements to support
    large-scale and multipurpose applications [17], [224]. Furthermore, digital twins
    can contain different representation models, such as statistical, machine learning,
    geometrical and material, mixed-reality, and virtual-augmented reality augmented
    with physics/data-oriented models, which makes it hard to keep data consistent.
    Digitalized data in DT should be updated in real-time to track every change in
    the physical system, i.e., metamodels involving data about the scheme of the system,
    measured data values and data structure at runtime should be consistent. In this
    context, Wilking et al. [225] proposed a SysML approach for improving digital
    twin data modeling by creating DT behavior using SysML diagrams and generating
    usable code to speed up the implementation of DT applications. The authors proposed
    extending the SysML model with a new XMI file to enable universal utilization
    of all SysML diagrams in DT modeling. Nevertheless, the solution proposes some
    extensions to SysML diagrams. Still, more investigation is needed to ensure the
    feasibility of integrating system models into more generalized “SysML4DigitalTwins”
    to lower the obstacles of Digital Twin design. Hence, we need to rethink how many
    diagrams should be considered to describe fully and model DT systems (i.e., similar
    to the improvements made to UML diagrams) towards providing autonomous digital
    twins with a consistent control loop. UML is also expected to support model-driven
    engineering (MDE) for simplifying the connection between DT and the physical world
    [226], [227], as it enables a bidirectional relationship between the UML models
    of the digital twin [228]. There are diverse research directions that attempt
    to provide the data model for digital twin, based on Automation Markup Language
    (AutomationML) [229] to model DT attributes using machine learning methods [230],
    using stacked auto-encoder (SAE) based model [231], by leveraging the open manufacturing
    platform [232], and many other approaches involving hierarchical functional data
    models. Therefore, we need a more generic modeling model, aka meta-data model,
    that covers the digital twin applications. We can rethink abstracted metamodels
    similar to those the W3C provides for web services. Offering an abstracted level
    of models helps DT capture the system’s salient features, improve its performance,
    refine the granularity configuration, and reduce the need for high-demand computational
    resources. 7.8. Data coherence and model revision Data coherence and model revision
    are key challenging issues to ensuring the high fidelity of data in digital twins.
    Indeed, since DT uses a huge volume of data, e.g., historical data, versioning
    and archiving those data, recent approaches [233], [234] suggest integrating blockchain
    InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for data distribution. Such an approach could
    also be used to power MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) algorithms to alternate
    between previous decision-making protocols, compile historical data to forecast
    future possible states of the systems, and thereby adapt MLOps to anticipate future
    decision-making algorithms. Indeed, machine learning models usually degrade in
    production, i.e., concept drift occurs when changes in the relationship between
    input and output data give rise to deterioration in prediction accuracy and provoke
    unforeseen changes in the predicted statistical properties of the digital twin.
    Digital twin require closed-loop data wrangling and cleaning at scale using Automated
    Machine Learning (AutoML), which in turn will help digital twin to support drift
    monitoring to continuously track the ML model’s performance in production and
    adapt both models and decision-making algorithms according AutoML. We can rethink
    of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) [235] as a tool for providing explanations
    for digital twin models. Recent approaches have shown that XAI can be a powerful
    tool for creating trustworthy, intelligent digital twins in healthcare [236],
    in maintenance, repair, and operations [237], as well as for predicting lane changes
    for vehicles [238] and distributed autonomous mobile robots and Human-in-the-loop
    data integration [239]. In the light of those contributions, we argue that explaining
    predictions, recommendations, and other AI output to users is critical for building
    trust in digital twins [240]. We believe user-level explainability can help to
    find and detect potential issues of DT in production, e.g., global explainability,
    can help to spot how small features in a model can contribute to predicting the
    overall model [241]. 7.9. Unclear access to quality data A digital twin is built
    upon data, giving insight into the system’s past, present, and future status,
    as well as model knowledge and algorithms, to make some facts about the DT systems.
    All these data and models should fit the purpose for which they have been collected
    or designed to ensure that DT applications continue to work correctly and update
    and upgrade to meet the needs they are used for. While recent advances in machine
    learning and artificial intelligence, in general, have provided new solutions
    for data filtering and quality insurance and help to evaluate the fitness of DT.
    For example, AI algorithms usually need cleaned and labeled data to predict the
    future states of physical entities and assets. However, AI solutions have limitations
    that can further complicate the business goals, as they have low interpretability
    and explainability and require additional time to learn patterns. Indeed, given
    the variability and heterogeneity of data that feed the digital twin in different
    manufacturing domains, data modeling poses a significant burden in providing consistent
    models to empower the DT system. Hence, data quality is paramount to prediction
    accuracy [242]. 8. Trends and key research directions in digital twins A digital
    twin is a The wireless research landscape is rapidly evolving to address emerging
    Internet of Everything (IoE) applications such as extended reality flying vehicles,
    brain–computer interaction, etc. In this new context, DT has to address new requirements
    such as self-sustaining wireless systems, proactive online learning-based systems,
    isolation between twins-based services (microservices architecture), device mobility
    Management and DT forensic. In this section, we highlight diverse DT trends and
    research directions. 8.1. Composable digital twins Digital twins are envisioned
    to assemble complex systems such as turbines, wind farms, power grids, and energy
    businesses, which creates additional complexity beyond the physical models to
    support future capabilities such as data services (i.e., including data integration,
    aggregation, and management), semantic labels, trustworthiness, user interfaces,
    intelligence, etc. Hence, new approaches for composing digital and physical elements
    into larger assemblies and models can simplify the design, control, management,
    and operation of the DT [45]. Therefore, composability is key to scaling DTs,
    delivering high-value business capabilities, and providing reusable, interoperable,
    and composable enterprise business. The Digital Twin Consortium recently released
    the Capabilities Periodic Table (CPT) framework [51] to provide an architecture-
    and technology-agnostic solutions for Composable Digital Twins (CDT). The CDT
    framework should be able to deliver service-based orchestration by developing
    modular packaged business capabilities that can develop and adapt the digital
    application to business needs and support large-scale, complex environments [243].
    Therefore, we should identify composability gaps that should be addressed and
    focus on delivering DT capabilities in a model-based approach. Additionally, we
    should envisage a composable- and capability-driven architecture that facilitates
    the composability of DT models and ensure the interoperability among modules,
    thereby driving innovative business future in the next 10 years. 8.2. Cell-based
    microservice Current DT software implementations like Eclipse Ditto [66] use different
    microservice layers (e.g., policies, connectivity, gateway, things, concierge,
    etc.) using Kubernetes-like (e.g., Helm, Docker, OpenShift, etc.) microservices
    through an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) model. While these microservices offer
    a global security approach chained as a single service to mitigate attacks, enable
    modular architecture, and improve network efficiency, they are associated with
    the complexities of the distributed system and a higher chance of failure during
    communication. Cell-Based Microservices [244] are recently envisioned as a promising
    approach to building independently deployable components that can be loaded from
    multiple network locations and repositories at runtime. Unifying and harmonizing
    these components will enable horizontal and vertical scalability and deployment
    independence. Thus, multiple federated IoT application components can run independently
    and be redeployed without restarting IoT applications or interrupting IoT services.
    Therefore, we need to rethink how to develop distributed Cell-Based microservices
    to ensure deployment independence and promise flexibility and autonomy. The sought-after
    goal guarantees modularity and cooperation among distributed federated DT networks.
    8.3. Standardization We discussed in Section 3 diverse standardization efforts
    to implement an architecture for DT. We also highlighted in Section 7.6 the challenging
    interoperability issues that stem from the diversity of DT architectures. Indeed,
    recently, there have been some trends, such as Change2Twin project [245], towards
    providing a common framework that could fit most DT use cases. For example, the
    DT consortium is collaborating with the Industrial Internet Consortium (IIC) to
    concentrate, combine and standardize a single platform and framework that fits
    most DT systems. We argue that we need to rethink the design of new abstracted
    programming interfaces that provide standard ways to communicate with, and control,
    equipment made by different manufacturers. Some enterprises started implementing
    such an API, e.g., mapped, the data infrastructure platform maker, has recently
    launched a new service built on top of the open-source Brick Schema for describing
    physical, logical and virtual assets, similarly to Qualcomm’s Smart Cities Consortium
    and Zyter, the IoT provider, has recently partnered to develop and standardize
    interfaces to enable DTs for diverse domains such as healthcare and smart cities.
    We believe that we will see, shortly, a wave of consortium partnership agreements
    to find new ways to improve efficiency and build better interoperable and standardized
    DT interfaces. 8.4. Dataverse DT can work with metaverse to enable the future
    Industrie 5.0, including the manufacturing industry (e.g., creating virtual copies
    of entire factories and plants to ensure transparent production processes), automobile
    sector (e.g., creating a virtual model of a physically connected vehicle), healthcare
    (e.g., surgery training), etc. The union of both technologies will lead to the
    creation of the dataverse, which will build the data infrastructure to support
    the next generation of DT use cases. We claim that traditional hierarchical DT
    asset structures will disappear and new graph-based solutions, such as those modeled
    with the DTDL approach [86] will appear to facilitate the integration of DT assets
    and better describe their relationships. We also believe that dataverse will offer
    a unique opportunity to build interoperable and high-fidelity DTs that relate
    all data in the virtual world, entities, and objects, thus unfolding in the future.
    8.5. Security We highlighted in Section 7.1 how security and vulnerability pose
    a significant challenge to the large-scale adoption of DTs by major industry sectors.
    Meanwhile, DT bodies such as the Industry IoT Consortium (IIC) are working to
    offer new models and trustworthiness framework that reinforces the security and
    privacy of DTs. Furthermore, the recent advances in blockchain consensus algorithms
    [22], [192], [246] such as the Proof of Authority (PoA), Proof of Ownership (PoO),
    and the merging of the Ethereum blockchain to support the Proof of Stack (PoS),
    which will drive the advances towards providing more secure and inviolable digital
    infrastructure [234]. We claim that the increased development of edge AI, TinyML,
    and local machine learning models and algorithms and the advances in federated
    machine learning will foster the development of DT security solutions and increase
    the awareness of DT security across the DT lifecycle. We believe that the aforementioned
    distributed intelligence approaches will foster the development of new models
    or prototypes that target competitive intelligence attacks. We argue that future
    DT systems will support fully operational competitive intelligence that allows
    them to preserve their trustworthiness and integrity. 9. Conclusion In this paper,
    we have surveyed a wide range of recent and state-of-the-art projects, software
    implementations, and standardization efforts in the realm of digital twins. This
    effort stemmed from the needs of the research community, where we found that most
    researchers call for current digital architectures that need additional research
    efforts to provide a unified framework that can ensure interoperability between
    different industrial applications, allow diverse domains that can benefit from
    DT and ensure secure data dissemination at scale among potentially distributed
    industrial IoT systems. To address the challenge of integrating heterogeneous
    DT systems, researchers have started to focus on redesigning the current DT architecture
    by breaking the tight integration of its capabilities towards integrating various
    methods, models, and processes to simplify data collection, formatting, and transmission.
    As a result, major research projects focus on designing DT applications to support
    specific use cases and applications. However, the next generation of DT will benefit
    not only from the simplicity of the implementation but also from the benefits
    of composability, distributed and federated intelligence, security by design frameworks,
    network slicing, and common standardization, which will have the potential to
    simplify its integration into various industrial use cases. Unfortunately, we
    did not find any comprehensive study of existing techniques, research projects,
    and tools summarized in a single study. To that end, we provide a taxonomy of
    the key challenges and opportunities in a number of different areas, including
    architectural models, security and vulnerability, ethics and data sovereignty,
    scalability, real-time properties, interoperability with heterogeneous connectivity
    protocols, as well as high-fidelity data modeling. We showed that both academia
    and industry are involved in the development of digital twins; however, most of
    the investigations continue to focus on very specific scenarios involving the
    optimization of that product’s lifecycle. We argue that these studies are important,
    but they should only be done in the context of open, standardized APIs that can
    predict future use cases like the metaverse and holographic mixed reality, cellular-connected
    drones, autonomous supply chains, and massive twinning. Although several commercial
    and open-source implementations of DT software exist, they also pose a set of
    challenges that should be addressed, which will require coordinated attention.
    From the research community’s success and wide acceptance, our goal was to present
    these challenges and present current standardization efforts. By no means have
    we presented an exhaustive list of opportunities. We believe there are additional
    challenges and opportunities. Research exists along a broad spectrum, ranging
    from composable DT solutions to be used in the upcoming 5G network and beyond,
    to high-fidelity formal data modeling, knowledge data mapping, and blockchain-based
    security models to improve the trustworthiness of the DT-based solutions. The
    aim of this paper is to put forth these challenges, leading to many more research
    efforts. CRediT authorship contribution statement Akram Hakiri: Conceptualization,

  description: Model Predictive Control (MPC) emerges as a promising solution to address
    the substantial greenhouse gas emissions from the building sector. By employing
    advanced control strategies, such as MPC, for peak energy shifting, there is a
    significant potential to enhance energy efficiency and reduce emissions through
    effective demand response within a smart grid. Although MPC has been the subject
    of extensive research, the practical implementation of cost-effective and easily
    deployable solutions in buildings remains limited. This study proposes a cost-effective
    MPC approach, employing the Internet of Things (IoT) and dynamic pricing. The
    control strategy, developed in MATLAB, is locally deployed on Raspberry Pi hardware
    via WiFi. The proposed MPC was tested in a controlled environment at the University
    of Nottingham, UK, where it regulated a radiator heating device to maintain indoor
    comfort in response to dynamic hourly electricity prices, using real-time indoor
    temperature feedback. The results confirmed the proposed MPC's accuracy in predicting
    indoor temperature responses and controlling indoor temperature within setpoints
    over a typical winter week. Performance analysis further revealed that the proposed
    MPC strategy resulted in a 20% electricity cost reduction compared to a conventional
    control strategy. Additionally, alongside the proposed MPC strategy, a Phase Change
    Material (PCM) wallboard system was integrated into a co-simulation platform.
    The developed PCM wallboard model underwent a verification and validation process,
    utilizing both numerical simulations and experimental data. The results demonstrate
    that the proposed MPC-controlled PCM wallboard system saved 35% on electricity
    cost compared with the original case study room. This study provides valuable
    insights into the development of intelligent localized demand response control
    for the built environment, offering a range of choices for IoT equipment.

    review Greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) drive global warming, leading to global
    initiatives like The Paris Agreement, which aims to limit the increase in global
    temperature to 1.5 °C. Countries, including the UK, are actively working towards
    reducing carbon emissions to achieve a net zero targets by 2050 [1]. The UK''s
    building sector, largely reliant on natural gas for heating, contributes significantly
    to GHG emissions [2]. This dependency not only has environmental implications
    but also financial ones, as the UK ranks among the countries with the highest
    electricity prices globally, largely due to the rising natural gas costs [3].
    To tackle GHG challenges, there''s a growing focus on improving building energy
    efficiency with modern technologies and materials, reducing fossil fuel dependence
    for heating and cooling [4]. 1.1. Economic Model Predictive Control (MPC) for
    heating, ventilation and air-conditioning MPC, an advanced process control method,
    enhances the efficiency of Heating, Ventilation, and Air-conditioning (HVAC) systems.
    By utilizing mathematical models and predictive analytics, MPC optimizes control
    decisions, cutting energy use and emissions. It optimizes energy consumption by
    anticipating future events, rather than reacting to current conditions. This anticipation
    includes adapting to dynamic energy market pricing, where MPC integrates these
    price signals to schedule building heating during periods of lower cost, thereby
    reducing costs and easing grid stress during peak times. Ma et al.''s study [5]
    incorporated dynamic pricing into MPC objectives, creating an economic MPC that
    considered time-of-use rates. They observed a trade-off between precooling the
    building during during off-peak energy use periods and increase in total energy
    consumption. Ultimately, their economic MPC effectively reduced daily energy costs
    through energy shifting. Hu et al.''s study [6] also developed an economic MPC
    method for floor heating in response to dynamic electricity prices to shift peak
    power demand and provide energy flexibility. This approach, involving optimal
    preheating periods, resulted in up to 19% daily electricity cost savings. Similarly,
    Knudsen et al. [7] conducted an experimental study using MPC for heating energy
    shifting, guided by dynamic pricing in a case study building. Their results showed
    a flattened system load, with a 45% increase in usage in low-price periods and
    an 82% reduction during high-price periods. Despite these promising outcomes,
    the broader adoption of MPC technology still faces hurdles due to its cost [8]
    and complexity [7,9]. These challenges highlight the need for the development
    of low-cost MPC solutions to make this technology more accessible and feasible
    for a wider range of applications. 1.2. Structural thermal energy storage and
    Phase Change Materials (PCM) Structural thermal mass, the ability of a building
    to absorb and store heat, significantly contributes to energy efficiency [10].
    MPC optimizes the use of this property by forecasting external temperature changes
    and adjusting internal temperatures. This leverages the building''s thermal storage
    capacity to reduce the need for active heating [6] and cooling [11], leading to
    energy savings. Phase change materials (PCMs) further enhance energy efficiency
    by providing additional thermal storage within the same material volume [12].
    These materials absorb and release thermal energy during phase transitions [13],
    offering opportunities for load shifting, peak demand reduction, and enhanced
    energy efficiency. When MPC systems are integrated with phase change materials
    (PCMs), they can optimize building heating systems efficiently in line with dynamic
    pricing strategies, eliminating the need for traditional methods like adding layers
    to the building envelope. Research, such as Kishore et al.''s study [12], shows
    that incorporating PCMs in the building envelope can significantly influence energy
    load. Their findings indicate that walls with PCM can reduce annual heat gain
    by up to 72% and cut annual heat loss by 38%. Wang et al. [15] further explored
    this by implementing PCM wallboards in lightweight buildings in Shanghai, known
    for its extreme seasonal temperatures. Their simulations assessed the impact of
    PCM wallboards on indoor thermal comfort, revealing substantial improvements in
    comfort levels during both summer and winter. This improvement is attributed to
    the enhanced thermal energy storage of the building''s envelope, achieved without
    increasing its thickness. Qu et al.''s study [16] explored the energy performance
    of PCM wallboards, focusion on their impact on indoor thermal comfort and potential
    building energy savings. They highlighted the potential for up to 34.8% energy
    savings and a reduction in indoor temperature fluctuations, emphasizing the importance
    of selecting PCM wallboards tailored to the local climate for optimal benefits.
    Similarly, Wijesuriya et al. [17] investigated the potential for energy savings
    by incorporating PCMs into building envelopes. Their research, which considered
    a future scenario with about 80% renewable energy sources, suggested that integrating
    PCM in a lightweight residential building in Baltimore, MD, could enhance annual
    load flexibility by up to 33.6%. While there has been notable progress in studying
    MPCs and PCMs separately, their combined use in building heating systems is relatively
    underexplored. The potential for energy savings is significant, as MPCs could
    optimize PCM phase changes in line with dynamic pricing signals and weather forecasts.
    However, this area remains less studied, highlighting a gap in research on their
    integrated application. 1.3. Internet-of-Things (IoT) and MPC The integration
    of the Internet of Things (IoT) into building management systems significantly
    enhances energy efficiency. IoT devices enable real-time energy monitoring and
    control [18], providing data essential for optimizing energy use. They also facilitate
    interaction with dynamic energy pricing systems [19], allowing consumers to adapt
    their energy consumption in response to price changes. This digitalization of
    dynamic pricing, supported by IoT, can feed data into MPC predictive models, enabling
    optimized energy usage based on real-time pricing. Additionally, IoT''s real-time
    monitoring [20] can offer insights into the performance of PCMs [21], improving
    their control and energy-saving potential. Several studies have explored the integration
    of IoT with building information systems. Jeoung et al. [18] used IoT for indoor
    data collection, enhancing Building Management Systems (BMS) with a blockchain
    framework. Huang et al. [22] showed how combining Building Information Modeling
    (BIM) with IoT can improve data processing in the Architecture, Engineering, and
    Construction (AEC) industry. Fredriksson et al. [23] developed an IoT system for
    monitoring construction disturbances, thus improving decision-making and automation
    reliability in building management. Acha et al. [24] discussed how IoT-enabled
    dynamic pricing could encourage energy-efficient behavior, enhancing communication
    between smart grids and users and improving energy monitoring and control in buildings.
    Lastly, Li et al. [25] introduced an event-driven HVAC optimization method that
    activates based on sensor data thresholds, reducing sensor power consumption while
    maintaining effective system performance. The integration of IoT with building
    energy systems has not only expanded the use of cross-domain technologies and
    enhanced interactions between energy producers and consumers but also complements
    MPCs for cost-effective energy management. However, the implementation of MPC
    via IoT devices in buildings comes with several technical challenges: MPC requires
    frequent and computationally intensive optimization, especially in real-time building
    applications where quick response times are essential [26]. The heterogeneous
    nature of IoT devices and their integration with existing building management
    systems pose substantial challenges [27]. Additionally, efficiently managing and
    securing the large volumes of data generated by IoT devices, as well as ensuring
    robustness against data loss or corruption, is crucial [27]. The cost of implementing
    advanced MPC systems with IoT can be prohibitive, and these systems must be scalable
    to accommodate a range of building sizes, from small residential to large commercial
    structures [28]. Finally, maintaining the reliability and robustness of the MPC
    system in the face of uncertainties inherent in building environments, such as
    changes in occupancy or weather conditions, is essential to ensure indoor comfort
    and energy efficiency [29]. Addressing the challenges of implementing MPC via
    IoT in buildings, the present study develops a low-cost MPC solution, implemented
    on affordable hardware, such a Raspberry Pi. This approach allows efficient computation,
    enabling the system to react within seconds. The use of standard IoT protocols
    and hardware addresses integration challenges, enabling deployment on existing
    WiFi networks without the need for specialized infrastructure. The cost-effective
    of the proposed MPC components demonstrates its affordability compared to conventional
    ICT systems for buildings, thus providing a potentially scalable solution adaptable
    to various building sizes and types. The effectiveness of the MPC strategy will
    be validated through experiments in a test room and simulations, highlighting
    its robustness in maintaining indoor temperature control and its capability for
    making effective predictive adjustments to ensure comfort. 1.4. Novelty, aims
    and objectives The novelty of this research lies in its unique exploration of
    the integration of two main elements: MPCs with IoT devices, and MPCs with PCMs.
    While the individual contributions of MPCs, PCMs and IoT devices to enhancing
    energy efficiency are well-documented, our study explores their combined use in
    building heating systems through field experiments. We specifically examine how
    IoT can provide a cost-effective, continuous data stream for MPC''s predictive
    models, aiming to optimize energy usage by effectively incorporating dynamic pricing
    strategies. Presently, there are few field experiments that evaluate the technical
    and energy performance of MPCs in real-world building applications, highlighting
    the significance of our study. Building on this foundation, our research seeks
    to extend beyond the achievements of previous studies, which have demonstrated
    the potential of MPC in various settings. For example, the study by Bünning et
    al. [30] conducted a series of heating and cooling experiments in an occupied
    apartment, embedding the model within an MPC framework. The aim was to minimize
    energy consumption while maintaining occupant comfort, comparing these outcomes
    with those of previous experiments. They demonstrated that predictive control
    leads to energy savings of between 26–49% energy savings compared to the baseline
    controller. Knudsen et al. [7] experimentally tested an MPC for space heating
    in a Living Lab, using data from existing sensors and employing MATLAB for the
    control strategy, which facilitated energy shifts from high- to low-price periods.
    Similarly, Yang et al. [9] implemented an MPC strategy in a SkyLab test facility,
    improving both thermal comfort while also achieving electricity consumption reduction
    of 15.1–20.7%. Široký et al. [31] and Sturzenegger et al. [8] also carried out
    MPC implementation and experiments on a real building, demonstrating enhanced
    energy efficiency by integrating MPC into building''s energy management systems.
    However, these implementations often required integration with existing BMS, leading
    to increased costs and complexity. Among the challenges faced were high power
    consumption due to systems'' heavyweight structure, execution errors, and memory
    fragmentation due to intermittent data exchange [25]. To address these issues,
    we propose a lightweight, compatible MPC control strategy based on peer-to-peer
    data exchange using IoT technologies, aiming for a more efficient and intelligent
    control system. This study also tackles a crucial challenge in the implementation
    of MPC strategies: the occasional unavailability of real-time data from existing
    sensing systems or discrepancies in the timing of control signal retrieval for
    each MPC cycle. To overcome this, we adopt an unsupervised approach that allows
    the MPC to operate autonomously without the need for continuous manual oversight,
    as outlined in [32]. The unsupervised nature of our system is particularly beneficial
    in the context of building energy management. It reduces the uncertainty typically
    associated with control signal implementation, a common issue in traditional,
    supervised control systems. Our approach effectively manage data allocation and
    fusion. This ensures that control signals for the heating system are executed
    accurately and in a timely manner in each MPC cycle, enhancing the overall efficiency
    and reliability of the system. In extending our research, we also focus on integrating
    MPCs with PCMs. While PCMs are known for their thermal energy storage capabilities,
    studies on their integration with building systems and optimization via MPCs are
    still developing. Two studies evaluated the energy cost-saving potential of PCM
    wallboards under an MPC strategy. Yang et al. [14] proposed an MPC framework for
    controlling PCM-wallboard-enhanced heating systems, addressing the nonlinearity
    between PCM''s specific heat capacity and temperature. Their simulation showed
    over 60% savings in heating electricity costs. Gracia et al. [33] simulated the
    energy performance of PCM wallboards under MPC control, incorporating weather
    forecasts. They showed the feasibility of the smart control methodand its capacity
    to improve the thermal benefits of the dynamic PCM system. However, current research
    has not thoroughly explored feedback control in buildings with integrated PCM
    wallboard, highlighting a gap in our understanding of the energy shifting performance
    of intelligently controlled PCM wallboards. There''s a need for further research
    into how MPCs can exploit PCMs'' thermal properties for load shifting and enhancing
    energy efficiency. To address this, our study proposes a PCM simulation based
    on an experimentally validated, unsupervised IoT-based MPC control strategy. This
    study aims to develop a cost-effective MPC system that utilizes IoT devices as
    an economic and continuous data source for its predictive models. To validate
    our research, we''ve designed an MPC in MATLAB, which is deployed on Raspberry
    Pi (RPi) hardware via WiFi, for testing in a dedicated test room at the University
    of Nottingham, Nottingham, a city of UK. This control system is designed to maintain
    indoor comfort by adjusting to the hourly dynamic electricity prices and providing
    real-time temperature feedback. We will also explore integrating this low-cost
    MPC with PCMs, examining how MPCs can effectively utilize PCM wallboards'' thermal
    storage properties (Fig. 1). Finally, to assess the feasibility and energy performance
    of the MPC with PCMs, we will conduct a co-simulation using TRNSYS and MATLAB,
    incorporating our control strategy. Download : Download high-res image (446KB)

    for developing an unsupervised MPC system. The integration of monitoring and IoT
    technologies for data extraction and control strategy implementation is presented.
    Our case study, a test room at the University of Nottingham, UK, will be used
    to evaluate the proposed low-cost MPC strategy. Additionally, we introduce a PCM-wallboard
    platform controlled by a validated MPC strategy, aiming to bridge identified research
    gaps through software co-simulation. The model development involved creating a
    numerical model, adapting it into a TRNSYS model, and then integrating it with
    the MPC model in MATLAB. The PCM''s numerical model was designed to eliminate
    nonlinearity, facilitating easier integration into the MPC. 2.1. Experimental
    test facility The experimental room in this study, denoted as a test pod (as depicted
    in Fig. 2b), is situated at the University Park campus of the University of Nottingham,
    UK. This test pod, constructed predominantly of wood, embodies the principles
    of passive house design, possessing a volumetric capacity of 22 cubic meters,
    an envelope surface area of 48 square meters, and an air leakage rate of 1.7 [34].
    The construction of the walls, 145 mm in thickness, yields an overall U-value
    of 0.51 W/m2K. This rectangular pod, with dimensions measuring 3.15 m in length,
    3.94 m in width, and 2.91 m in height, is oriented in a north-west direction.
    On its south-eastern façade, a double-glazed window of 0.79 square meters has
    been installed. To maintain thermal comfort within the pod, two radiators, each
    with a capacity of 1.5 kW, are utilized (as presented in Fig. 2c). The maximum
    surface allowed temperature of radiators is 65 °C. Within this test pod, a comprehensive
    measurement system is deployed for the purposes of monitoring the indoor temperature,
    logging external meteorological conditions, and recording the energy consumption.

    2. (a) Local weather station, (b) external view of the test pod, and (c) internal
    view of the test pod with the setup of experiment during the development stage.
    An ECOWITT weather station [35] (as shown in Fig. 2a) is situated outside for
    local meteorological data collection. Furthermore, a smart plug was switching
    on and off both radiators rs (illustrated in Fig. 2c). These pieces of equipment
    transfer collected data to a cloud-based server via a WiFi connection. For indoor
    temperature monitoring, we employed a real-time sensor system based on Arduino
    technology. An analog-to-digital converter, the Max 6675 module, is used in conjunction
    with a K-type thermocouple to measure the indoor temperature. The Arduino platform
    then acts as an intermediary, processing the data from the Max 6675 module and
    transmitting them to the serial port of a PC via a USB serial adapter. The precise
    pin connections between the Max 6675 module and the Arduino system are described
    in Section A1. This low-cost, compact, and compatible sensing system has been
    implemented successfully in similar studies [36,37]. The accuracy of the indoor
    temperature measurements, as detailed in Section A2, adheres to the specifications
    provided in the Max 6675 user manual [38]. A Raspberry Pi (RPi) 3 module is utilized
    as the control system for this investigation, chosen for its cost-effectiveness,
    compatibility, and ease of interfacing [39]. In this study, the RPi is tasked
    with transmitting signals to a WiFi-enabled smart plug (see Fig. 2c), facilitated
    by an interfaced add-on board. The RPi receives command instructions from a PC
    via a wireless connection, processing the information into a format that is recognizable
    by the smart plug. A MATLAB engine [40] operating on the PC is used in this study
    for control signal processing and communication with the RPi. Simultaneously,
    MATLAB retrieves real-time indoor temperature data from the sensor system through
    the PC''s serial port, employing the “read” and “serialport” functions. In the
    study, the roles of the PC and Raspberry Pi are distinctly divided between the
    development and operational stages: During development, the PC handles the intensive
    tasks of algorithm development and simulation, leveraging its computational power
    for running complex tasks and optimizing the MPC algorithm. This involved iterative
    processes where the algorithm''s performance was evaluated under various simulated
    conditions to ensure its effectiveness and reliability. The Raspberry Pi, used
    alongside the PC, tests the integration of the MPC algorithm with the hardware,
    ensuring compatibility and efficient performance. For the operational or deployment
    phase of the MPC system, the Raspberry Pi alone is capable of performing the control
    tasks. Its lightweight operating system is ideal for continuous operation, and
    its lower computational load requirements compared to the development phase make
    it well-suited for running the optimized MPC algorithm [41]. It''s crucial to
    emphasize that in future applications of the MPC system, the Raspberry Pi is intended
    to operate standalone, without the need for a continuous connection to a PC. This
    standalone operation enhances the system''s cost-effectiveness and energy efficiency.
    The Raspberry Pi''s compact size and versatility can also contribute to the system''s
    scalability and potential for integration with other building management functions.
    2.2. Experiment arrangement and simulation platform This section provides a description
    of the experiment procedure and simulations conducted in the study, as illustrated
    in Fig. 3. The data collection phase extended over a period of three days, specifically
    from 09.12.2022 to 12.12.2022, with data collected at 5-min intervals. The collected
    data encompassed various parameters, including local weather data, indoor temperature,
    radiator schedule, and power consumption. The primary objective of this data collection
    was for model validation, which is detailed in detail in Section 2.3.1. The weather
    data collected are shown in Section A3. Download : Download high-res image (435KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Flowchart of the proposed method in
    this study. Subsequently, two distinct models were developed to simulate the indoor
    temperature''s response within the test pod. Firstly, a TRNSYS model was constructed,
    and secondly, a numerical model was employed. The initial performance analysis
    involved comparing the experimental MPC conducted over an eight-day period (16.12.2022
    to 23.12.2022) with a simulated TRNSYS on/off controller. This comparison was
    based on indoor thermal comfort and heating energy usage metrics. The on/off controller
    in our building heating system operates based on a simple yet fundamental principle:
    it activates the heating system when indoor temperatures fall below a predefined
    lower setpoint and deactivates it once temperatures exceed an upper setpoint.
    In our study, these setpoints were set at 22 °C for activation and 18 °C for deactivation,
    with a hysteresis mechanism incorporated to prevent short cycling of the heating
    equipment, as referenced in [7]. Compared to conventional heating system controls
    [48], the on/off approach has limitations, such as the potential for overheating
    or overcooling, and does not consider energy shifting for enhanced efficiency
    and thermal comfort, which is a strength of MPC systems. In our research, we used
    the on/off control logic as a baseline, simulated in TRNSYS software. The TRNSYS
    model, including the room and radiator system, was validated against measured
    data. For simulation, the on/off controller was set to regulate the radiators
    purely based on real-time indoor temperature comparisons with the set temperature
    bounds. Weather data collected was fed into the TRNSYS model. By comparing these
    simulation results with our experimental MPC outcomes, we aim to demonstrate the
    improvements brought by integrating MPC into the building heating system control
    strategy. In the following step, the study explored integrating a PCM wallboard
    into the pod''s envelope. The subsequent performance analysis aimed to evaluate
    the potential enhancement in energy performance resulting from integrating the
    PCM wallboard under the proposed MPC strategy. The experimental details pertaining
    to the MPC experiment and the specifics of the TRNSYS simulations are elaborated
    in the subsequent paragraphs. 2.2.1. MPC automation In our unsupervised scheme,
    we employed an MPC strategy to make control decisions for two radiators every
    half an hour. The main objective was to minimize electricity costs while ensuring
    indoor thermal comfort, taking into account dynamic pricing and future weather
    conditions. The detailed MPC algorithm is presented in Section 2.4. To initiate
    the control strategy calculation, the current indoor temperature was first extracted
    and used to correct the predicted indoor temperature within the model integrated
    into the proposed MPC strategy (as depicted in Fig. 4). Concurrently, MATLAB was
    utilized to extract the online 12-h weather forecast data from the official website
    of the UK Met Office [42] through the application of regular expression function
    ‘regexp’ [43]. This allowed us to match the relevant keywords pertaining to weather
    data. Additionally, MATLAB acquired the current electricity price, which was downloaded
    the previous day from an open-access day-ahead electricity wholesale market [44].

    Fig. 4. The proposed MPC strategy employed in the case study room. Considering
    the need for data update preparation, control signal calculation, and the establishment
    of a connection with the remote controller, we employed the “ticking” and “timing”
    function in MATLAB to accurately loop our MPC at the commencement of each half
    an hour. Upon solving the control signal, the MPC constructed either an on or
    off signal by generating a group of 1/0 combinations, which were then transmitted
    to the GPIO pins in the Raspberry Pi (RPi) for effectively controlling the radiators.
    2.2.2. Co-simulation of TRNSYS and MATLAB In this study, we used TRNSYS [45],
    a widely recognized software based on white-box approaches, for the dynamic simulation
    of building behavior. Specifically, we developed a validated TRNSYS model to simulate
    the indoor temperature of the test pod under various scenarios. A comprehensive
    description of the TRNSYS model is provided in Section 2.3. For the control strategy,
    we introduced a Type in TRNSYS, specifically Type 155, to invoke MATLAB at each
    simulation time step in order to generate the control signal. At the end of each
    time step, TRNSYS provided the current room temperature to MATLAB. Subsequently,
    the Kalman filter updated the current error covariance and Kalman filter gain
    by utilizing the indoor temperature information. This information was then used
    to solve the current state for MPC optimization [10]. At the beginning of the
    next time step, TRNSYS would call MATLAB to obtain the recently computed control
    signal. Meanwhile, a step increment was implemented in MATLAB to synchronize the
    time step with TRNSYS. Typically, MPC necessitates a predictive model, constraints,
    and an objective function [31]. In our study, we formulated these components as
    a mixed integer linear programming problem. To achieve this, we utilized the Yalmip
    toolbox, a robust optimization tool designed to model and solve problems occurring
    in systems and control theory, effectively running within the MATLAB environment
    [46]. To solve our mixed integer linear programming problem, we selected the Gurobi
    external solver [47]. By incorporating these tools and techniques, we constructed
    an efficient and effective MPC for our experiment, enabling us to optimize the
    control of the indoor temperature in the test pod under varying conditions and
    scenarios. 2.3. TRNSYS modelling 2.3.1. Original model for test pod with radiators
    In this study, we employed three TRNSYS types to simulate the case study room.
    Type 1231 was utilized to model the radiator, with the inlet water temperature
    set at a constant 65°C and a flow rate typically set to 15 kg/(hm2) [6]. To process
    the weather data collected from the local weather station and transmit it to the
    building model (Type 56), we used Type 9, Type 16, Type 33, and Type 69. Additionally,
    a thermostat (Type 106) was assumed to control the radiator by sensing the indoor
    temperature and applying predefined setpoints. The detailed TRNSYS model is presented
    in Fig. A4 in Section A4. In this section, we present the validation of the original
    pod heating system model. The measured data collected over the first three days
    were utilized to validate two specific scenarios (Fig. 5). The data with the heating
    turned on and turned off were used to validate the TRNSYS room model with the
    radiator system. The validation of the TRNSYS model exhibited a good agreement
    with the measured data collected from the test pod. The root mean square error
    (RMSE) between the TRNSYS simulated data and the measured data was calculated
    to be 0.86 °C, confirming the accuracy and reliability of the simulation results.

    Fig. 5. Comparison between measured data and TRNSYS simulated data. 2.3.2. Test
    pod system with PCM wallboard under UFH system Subsequently, we introduced PCM
    wallboards to the south, east, west, and roof walls, while replacing the original
    radiator system with an underfloor heating (UFH) system. This is motivated by
    several factors. UFH offers enhanced thermal comfort through uniform heat distribution
    and improved energy efficiency due to lower operating temperatures. Lastly, UFH
    complements the use of PCM wallboards effectively, as the even heat distribution
    could promote efficient heat absorption and release from the PCMs, thereby improving
    the overall performance of the integrated system. A heating pump equipped with
    a building with a constant coefficient of performance (COP) of 3 [6] is employed
    to raise the temperature of the inlet water of the UFH system to the desired set-point.
    The energy consumption of the heating system is calculated as follows: (1) where
    is the heating load of a system. is the overall COP of the heat pump. is the power
    demand for the system. The PCM layers are assumed to be added to the walls, except
    for the floor construction and the north wall, which contain heating pipes and
    windows. The PCM layer was mainly located on the interior surface behind a 45
    mm plywood panel, with a thickness of 25 mm (Fig. 6). Four Type 1270s were applied
    in this study to simulate PCM wallboard integration in west, east, south walls
    and roof. We derived additional weather data for Nottingham, UK from Meteonorm
    [49] using TRNSYS Type 109. In our building model (Type 56), an active layer,
    typically utilized to simulate UFH systems, was established with an inlet temperature
    of 45 °C and a flow rate of 15 kg/(hm2). Download : Download high-res image (49KB)

    building wall [45]. For the PCM wallboards, we selected Polyethylene Glycol 600
    due to its advantageous balance of availability, cost, and thermal performance
    [50]. The effective specific heat capacity curve of the selected PCM wallboard
    and the properties of this PCM material are outlined in Section A5. The melting
    temperature of the PCM wallboard used in our study is 22.5 °C [51]. Accordingly,
    we set the temperature bound for calculating the average thermal capacity from
    19 °C to 24 °C. This range was specifically chosen to effectively capture the
    behavior of the PCM during its phase change process. It encompasses the PCM''s
    phase change temperature, ensuring that we accurately represent its thermal storage
    and release characteristics. This selected temperature range is also substantial
    because it correlates with the indoor temperature setpoints targeted for maintaining
    thermal comfort within the building. Furthermore, it aligns with the range of
    temperature fluctuations experienced in the test pod, as observed from our experimental
    data. The TRNSYS simuation model is shown in Section A6. The component in TRNSYS
    used to model the PCM layers (Type 1270) assumes that the temperature of the PCM
    material remains unchanged, with a constant specific heat capacity for its solid
    and liquid states. The theoretical background  of the PCM material in TRNSYS are
    discussed in reference [45]. Solid state (2) Liquid state (3) and are the energy
    going from two sides of the PCM layers, i.e., adjacent wall layers, and are the
    heat capacity of the solid and liquid states. The validation of the TRNSYS Type
    for PCM was conducted using the Polyethylene Glycol 600 experiment from Ahmad
    et al.''s study [50]. By inputting the same weather conditions, the indoor temperature
    obtained from the TRNSYS simulation was compared with their experimental results.
    The detailed wall layers of the test cell are presented in Section A7. The comparison
    of indoor temperatures confirmed a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.73 °C. Moreover,
    when compared with the original test pod, the integration of PCM resulted in a
    reduction of indoor temperature fluctuations from 45 °C to 25 °C. This finding
    is consistent with the validated case study. Further details on the validation
    can be found in Section A7. In addition, the validation of the UFH system in TRNSYS
    was performed by comparing with the results of Hu et al. [6]. We replicated the
    same weather conditions and control strategy in TRNSYS and compared the indoor
    temperature achieved with those reported in their study, showing a maximal error
    of 13.47%. The corresponding figure for this comparison is provided in Section
    A8. 2.4. MPC system 2.4.1. RC representation of models The room under consideration
    can be conceptualized as a collection of first-order systems, where the temperatures
    of indoor air, walls, floor, and ceiling represent the states of these systems.
    The heat transfer between nodes within the room can be characterized using thermal
    capacitance and thermal resistance (RC) concepts [31]. By employing time-series
    governing equations that describe heat transmission between nodes, we can calculate
    the current temperatures of each node. This network of first-order systems can
    be further leveraged for MPC by formulating a state-space model [52]. To accurately
    model the radiator system, we introduced a virtual inlet point in the radiator
    model to account for the hysteresis of the system (Fig. 7a) [53,54]. For the room
    integrated with a PCM wallboard, we applied the average effective specific heat
    capacity method proposed by Yang et al. [14]. Generally, the correlation between
    the effective specific heat capacity and the temperature of the PCM wallboard
    is nonlinear. However, Yang et al. addressed this issue by employing an averaged
    effective specific heat capacity over a common temperature range (e.g., 19–24°C)
    to mitigate the nonlinearity in the PCM numerical model. Fig. 7b shows the schematic

    radiator system and (b) the UFH charging PCM wallboards. The aim of the RC modelling
    is to provide insight into state space models, drawing upon building physics knowledge,
    with a particular emphasis on their applicability for MPC. Then, the system matrix
    would be identified using measured data. The system matrix forms the baseline
    of MPC''s predictive capabilities, offering significant advantages for the integrated
    system due to its lightweight and platform-independent nature [6]. 2.4.2. Optimization
    algorithm The governing equations can then be represented by the states, inputs,
    disturbances and system matrix within the state space (ss) model. (4) A, B are
    system matrices. is the system state. u is the system input. , , . is the process
    noise. In this study, the number of states is 5 ( for original radiator system
    and is 6 ( ) for PCM and UFH system. The number of inputs is 3. The input vector
    includes outdoor temperature , global solar radiation and the inlet fluid temperature
    of the radiators/UFH system . Later, we formed a discrete-time model of the continuous-time
    system for prediction of future states in prediction horizon N (Eq. (4)): (5)
    where, E is white zero mean Gaussian noise. Because of the Kalman filter integration,
    we assume E equals to 0 [6]. k is the current time step. After that, the indoor
    temperature can be extracted from states through Eq. (5) by introducing another
    system matrix C equals to or depending on which system is used. (6) In which y
    represents the final ss system output. Once we developed our state-space (ss)
    model, we proceeded to formulate the MPC strategy by defining the objective function,
    incorporating the identified ss model, and establishing relevant constraints.
    The primary aims of our MPC approach were to minimize heating energy consumption
    while ensuring indoor thermal comfort. To achieve this, we introduced indoor thermal
    comfort as a constraint, penalizing any deviations from the desired comfort levels
    within the objective function. The structure of our objective function was designed
    as quadratic forms, allowing us to appropriately weigh each term. Notably, we
    assigned significant weight to the comfort violation term, underscoring the paramount
    importance of precise comfort control. (7) With the constraints: (8) (9) In this
    study, the prediction horizon N is set to 24 with a time interval of 30 min. We
    use weighting factors q and r to quantify the importance of each term, where represents
    comfort violation, and represents heating energy cost. 3. State space model validation
    To establish the system models, we integrated our understanding of the room''s
    thermal characteristics with a sufficient amount of measured data. For model identification,
    a two-day dataset was utilized, while the data from an additional day was reserved
    for validation purposes. We employed the “ssest” function in MATLAB to identify
    the state-space (ss) model. The validation dataset yielded a percentage fitness
    [40] of 77%, indicating a satisfactory match between the identified model and
    the validation data. Furthermore, we conducted a comparison between the measured
    indoor temperature and the ss model estimated indoor temperature, using the “compare”
    function in MATLAB. As shown in Fig. 8, the results exhibited a RMSE of 0.89 °C,
    confirming the accuracy and reliability of the identified ss model''s predictions.

    Fig. 8. Comparison between the indoor temperature obtained from the ss model and
    measurement. The state-space model employed for the PCM system was trained using
    TRNSYS output data. The training dataset consisted of 1500 data points collected
    at 30-min intervals starting from 1st October. For validation, we used a separate
    dataset containing 1000 data points collected at the same 30-min intervals from
    1st November. To assess the performance of the ss model, we compared the indoor
    temperature predicted by the model with the corresponding TRNSYS output data,
    as depicted in Fig. 9. The value of R-Square [9], which signifies the proportion
    of the variance in the output that can be explained by the inputs in our ss model,
    was found to be 0.792. Moreover, the model demonstrated good accuracy, with 92%
    of the predictions falling within a range of ±1 °C from the actual temperature
    readings. This high level of accuracy and goodness-of-fit in the model''s predictions
    validates its effectiveness in simulating the PCM system''s indoor temperature
    dynamics. Download : Download high-res image (583KB) Download : Download full-size

    This section presents the time-dependent control performance of the IoT-based
    MPC strategy implemented in the case study test pod. We compared the measured
    indoor temperature achieved with the proposed MPC to the simulated indoor temperature
    obtained using the traditional on/off control strategy in TRNSYS. This comparison
    aimed to evaluate the MPC''s effectiveness in achieving energy shifting and optimizing
    low-price energy usage. Additionally, we presented the energy usage performance
    of the PCM system under the low-cost MPC, co-simulated through TRNSYS and MATLAB.
    We compared its performance with that of the PCM system controlled by a conventional
    on/off control strategy. Furthermore, we assessed the hourly energy shifting performance
    and indoor comfort violation under both control strategies to gain insights into
    their respective effectiveness. 4.1. Feasibility and cost-effectiveness of the
    proposed MPC strategy: computation time and resource analysis To assess the feasibility
    of the proposed MPC strategy, we conducted a single loop of the MPC implementation
    in the case study room. Fig. 10 illustrates the computation time for each process
    involved in implementing the proposed MPC. An example of the MATLAB command window
    on a PC with Intel Core i5-10300H 2.5GHz for one control signal implementation
    is provided in Section A9 Fig. A9. The total computation time amounts to approximately
    3.6 s, significantly shorter than both the prediction interval and the control
    interval of 30 min according to the study of Hu et al [6]. This indicates that
    the proposed MPC is well-equipped to meet its objectives. Download : Download
    high-res image (213KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 10. CPU used time
    by MATLAB for each process in the development and testing stage. A more detailed
    evaluation of the CPU time reveals six different computation phases. The first
    two phases have relatively short CPU computation times, averaging 0.16 s. In these
    phases, the calculation process and online data extraction have not yet commenced,
    with only data from the PC''s serial portal being read by the MATLAB engine and
    initialization being performed. In the third phase, the calculation still hasn''t
    started, and the entire CPU usage is dedicated to extracting online weather forecasts
    for the following hours and the day-ahead dynamic price. This phase takes 0.28
    s. Subsequently, after all preparations are completed, the MPC calculates the
    control signal for the next half-hour and sends it via WiFi. These two phases
    together last 3.01 s. Finally, the Kalman filter efficiently corrects the current
    state based on the measured temperature feedback. Based on the measurements, the
    primary CPU usage arises from the calculation and implementation of the control
    signal based on the collected data. Traditionally, data storage in control systems
    faces limitations in capacity, necessitating periodic data saving and resetting
    [27,55]. However, IoT technology offers a solution by enabling data extraction
    and overwriting in each loop, with online data transmission for storage and exchange.
    Moreover, the lightweight nature of the proposed control strategy prevents connection
    loss between elements. Cost is another crucial consideration for widespread adoption
    of IoT-based control systems in the building sector. Typically, intelligent control
    systems come with high capital costs due to the scale of their implementation
    [27]. According to Jáñez et al.''s study [56], the capital cost for typical information
    and communication technologies (ICT) for a single house ranges from £260 to £860,
    depending on the number of devices installed. In our study, the total cost for
    deploying the MPC in the test pod, including development and testing, was £560.
    This cost encompasses both software and hardware components: MATLAB R2017b with
    a Raspberry Pi support package, a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+, a smart plug with an
    add-on board, and an Arduino R3 with a MAX6675 K-Type thermocouple, totalling
    £110. Additionally, a PC costing £450 was essential for developing, testing, and
    optimizing the MPC algorithm using MATLAB, addressing the substantial computational
    demands of the project. It''s noteworthy that our test pod didn''t have a pre-existing
    BMS; it featured a directly controllable heating system suitable for our MPC setup.
    This expenditure represents the financial investment needed for implementing an
    MPC system in a small-scale environment similar to our test pod. Additional costs
    not included in our initial estimate involve BMS integration, which covers software
    integration, system configuration, and hardware interfacing, with costs varying
    based on BMS complexity and integrator rates. Training costs for staff familiarization
    with the MPC system are also noteworthy. Additionally, long-term costs include
    regular software updates and hardware maintenance. These costs can vary greatly
    based on the building''s infrastructure and local service rates. Therefore, our
    provided estimate for the test pod should be considered a general guide, with
    detailed assessments requiring case-specific analysis. Compared to Knudsen et
    al.''s study [7], which integrated MPC into a BMS for a residential building''s
    hydronic radiator system at a cost of around £9000, our system reduces expenses
    by using lightweight components like Raspberry Pi and Arduino boards. Knudsen
    et al. utilized an existing air handling unit, a thermostatic radiator valve,
    a cRIO controller, and PC-based LabVIEW and MATLAB software, as detailed in Fig.
    11. Our approach, while simpler, still allows for the integration of additional
    smart sensors and elements like microcontrollers and OLED screens [27], without
    substantially increasing the overall cost. This makes our system more cost-effective,
    especially compared to typical ICT options that may overlook the costs of integrating
    intelligent control systems [56]. Download : Download high-res image (511KB) Download

    in [7]. Furthermore, we have conducted initial tests on the Raspberry Pi''s standalone
    functionality for our MPC system, showcasing its capability as an independent
    controller in building heating systems. The MPC control logic was transitioned
    from MATLAB to Python, leveraging the cvxpy [57] and numpy [58] packages for optimization
    and numerical operations, respectively, and employing the Big M method [59] for
    control strategy formulation. The Raspberry Pi adeptly managed data handling,
    including receiving temperature inputs and downloading critical real-time data
    like weather forecasts and electricity pricing, essential for responsive MPC decision-making.
    In these initial tests, the Raspberry Pi''s computational time was 5.15 s, slightly
    longer than in the integrated PC setup but still within the viable range for real-time
    control. Acknowledging the need for further optimization, future efforts will
    focus on enhancing the Python MPC implementation, potentially through more efficient
    coding or faster computational libraries. 4.2. Comparative analysis of indoor
    temperature control: conventional vs. MPC To evaluate thermal comfort violations
    in our study, we used the Cross-Validation Root Mean Square Error (CV-RMSE) for
    both the MPC and the conventional on/off controller. CV-RMSE is a key statistical
    measure that quantifies the deviation of the predicted indoor temperature from
    the actual measurements, offering a consistent benchmark for comparing our results
    with other studies [60]. This metric is particularly useful in highlighting significant
    errors over smaller ones, providing insights into the model''s accuracy in maintaining
    stable indoor temperatures within a specified comfort range. The formula for CV-RMSE
    is expressed as follows: (10) In our analysis, the CV-RMSE was found to be 0.6%
    for the on/off controller and 0% for the MPC, specifically considering the lower
    bound of indoor temperature during preheating. These results are evaluated against
    standards like ASHRAE and IPMVP, which define acceptable CV-RMSE boundaries for
    baseline models (20% for ASHRAE [61] and 5% for IPMVP [61]). The 0% CV-RMSE for
    the MPC indicates robust control performance, demonstrating the system''s effectiveness
    in accurately predicting and maintaining desired indoor comfort levels. The passive
    nature of the case study room, with high thermal inertia, results in a stable
    indoor temperature even under the on/off controller. However, the MPC strategy
    effectively avoids comfort violations by making predictions several hours ahead
    and preheating the room before the temperature drops below the setpoint. For example,
    on day 4 (Fig. 12), the MPC anticipates the temperature drop and turns on the
    heating at noon, while the on/off controller only activates at the setpoint temperature.
    This capability of the MPC aligns with findings from other studies [6,9,14,31,52,54,[62],
    [63], [64], [65], [66]], demonstrating its effectiveness even in lightweight constructions
    where the on/off controller exhibits significant comfort violations [10]. Download

    Comparison of the hourly room air temperature: proposed MPC and on/off controller.
    The proposed MPC strategy is designed as a price-responsive control approach,
    aiming to optimize energy usage by shifting consumption to low-price periods and
    avoiding peak-time energy consumption. Throughout the simulation periods, the
    average electricity price is recorded as 14.5 GBP pence/kWh. In comparison, the
    traditional on/off controller uses the average price of 14.4 GBP pence/kWh for
    room heating. The MPC controller, on the other hand, effectively reduces the electricity
    price to 13 GBP pence/kWh, saving 1.4 GBP pence/kWh in energy costs when compared
    to the on/off controller. The MPC demonstrates a preference for utilizing relatively
    low-price energy, as illustrated by the following examples: On day 1, the MPC
    predicts the indoor response for the upcoming hours and identifies optimal turn-on
    hours for the heating system to avoid additional energy usage while maintaining
    indoor thermal comfort until the heating system is scheduled to turn off. Over
    the course of days 1 to 8, the MPC strategically selects morning or early afternoon
    periods for electricity usage, rather than utilizing high-price electricity in
    the late afternoon, as the on/off controller does. The overall heating hours for
    the on/off controller amount to 61 h, whereas the MPC controller reduces this
    to 51 h. As a result, the total electricity cost for the on/off controller is
    1284 GBP pence for the simulation periods, while the MPC controller reduces this
    cost to 1038 GBP pence. This substantial reduction in electricity cost confirms
    the successful energy-efficient performance of the proposed MPC strategy in this
    study. 4.3. Comparative analysis of indoor temperature control: conventional vs.
    MPC with PCM integration This section presents an analysis of indoor temperature
    control across three different scenarios: conventional on/off controller, PCM
    layers integrated in the building envelope under on/off controller, and PCM layers
    integrated in the building envelope under the proposed MPC approach. The simulations
    were conducted over a 20-day period, and the statistical distributions of room
    air temperature for each scenario are depicted in Fig. 13. The average indoor
    temperatures for the original setup, PCM integration under on/off control, and
    PCM integration under MPC were found to be 20.81 °C, 21.16 °C, and 20.99 °C, respectively,
    with corresponding standard deviations of 0.78 °C, 1.16 °C, and 1.19 °C (Fig.
    13a). Notably, the proposed MPC approach demonstrated a higher level of precision
    in maintaining indoor air temperature within a narrower range compared to the
    two conventional controls. This improvement can be attributed to the MPC''s predictive
    optimization capability, which effectively kept the room air temperature within
    the indoor setpoints throughout the simulation period, unlike the other two controls
    that resulted in high comfort violations (Fig. 13b). Download : Download high-res
    image (739KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 13. (a) Average room air
    temperature with error bar and (b) hourly room air temperature for three scenarios.
    Furthermore, the case of PCM integration under MPC exhibited a lower average indoor
    temperature than the other two scenarios. This deliberate maintenance of a lower
    room air temperature is a strategic measure to reduce electricity consumption,
    thereby minimizing electricity costs as per the MPC''s objective. This finding
    aligns with similar studies by Yang et al. [14]. The proposed MPC approach demonstrated
    enhanced indoor temperature control with narrower fluctuations and reduced comfort
    violations compared to conventional on/off controllers and PCM integration in
    the building envelope. The MPC''s ability to optimize energy usage based on predictive
    models contributes to its enhanced thermal comfort performance and cost-efficiency.
    4.4. Impact of PCM wallboard and MPC integration on energy costs The integration
    of PCM wallboard into the building envelope has shown promising results in reducing
    electricity costs, even under conventional control strategies. The increased thermal
    energy storage capacity provided by the PCM layers leads to improved energy performance
    in lightweight buildings [67]. This study further confirms the significant energy
    savings achieved by PCM integration, even in passive houses (Fig. 14b). Moreover,
    by replacing the conventional on/off controller with the proposed MPC approach,
    additional energy cost savings were realized. Download : Download high-res image

    UFH system in price responsive and non-responsive states, and (b) total electricity
    cost for the three cases. The optimized operation of energy shifting is depicted
    in Fig. 14a, comparing the building with PCM wallboard integrated under conventional
    on/off control and the price-responsive MPC control. Leveraging its predictive
    nature, the MPC controller strategically activates the heating system during low-price
    hours to meet the room''s heating requirement when electricity prices are high.
    It is essential to consider different transition temperatures of PCM materials,
    as they significantly impact indoor thermal comfort and thermal demand. Hysteresis
    and subcooling effects affect the energy storage and release characteristics of
    PCM materials, especially during rapid temperature changes or extreme weather
    conditions. A parametric analysis of PCMs can identify the optimal type, melting
    temperature, latent heat capacity, thickness, and configuration for specific buildings
    and climate conditions, maximizing the thermal benefits and demand response potential
    of the integrated system. For instance, Jayalath et al. [13] analyzed PCM materials
    with different transition temperatures in various outdoor temperature conditions
    for two climates (Sydney and Melbourne). The study found an optimal transition
    temperature of 23°C, which maximized indoor comfort periods in both climates for
    the same type of free-running residential building. Furthermore, the study highlighted
    that different materials offered distinct energy savings, depending on the preference
    for reducing either building heating load or cooling load. Similar results have
    been observed in other studies [14,17,67]. In our study, the PCM''s transition
    temperature was set at 25 °C, effectively achieving energy savings and maintaining
    indoor comfort during a simulation period with outdoor temperature variations
    ranging from −2 °C to 14 °C, with an average outdoor temperature of 5.7 °C. This
    suggests that, with the proposed strategy and specific PCM materials, which can
    vary in thickness and melting temperature, feasible retrofitting options such
    as BioPCMs [70] can be explored, enabling optimal control strategies tailored
    to different renovation objectives under varying climates. Subsequent to the initial
    integration of PCM wallboards into all four walls of the building, we conducted
    further experiments, gradually reducing PCM integration to three walls and eventually
    two walls. The outcomes of these scenarios are presented in Fig. 15. The electricity
    prices were categorized into three segments: the first 30% representing relatively
    low prices, the second 30% indicating medium prices, and the remaining 40% reflecting
    relatively high prices. Analyzing the impact on energy costs, the average electricity
    price used for rooms with two PCM wallboards integration was 28.4 GBP pence/kWh,
    while for three PCM wallboards integration, it was 27.3 GBP pence/kWh, and for
    four PCM wallboards integration, it reduced to 25.8 GBP pence/kWh. It is essential
    to note that these average dynamic prices are specific to the simulation period.
    The average consumed electricity price decreased with an increase in the number
    of PCM wallboard integrations. Examining the timing of the heating system switch-on
    (Fig. 15), the building with four PCM wallboards exhibited the lowest likelihood
    of consuming high-priced energy. This can be attributed to the higher energy storage
    capacity of the building envelope resulting from increased PCM integration. These
    results align with findings from the study by Yang et al. [14], which demonstrated
    that an increased PCM wallboard thermal storage capacity enhanced electricity
    cost savings for space heating systems due to the higher energy flexibility offered
    by increased PCM amounts. Download : Download high-res image (234KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 15. Heating system schedules under different PCM
    integration. PCM integration has shown the potential to enhance the thermal performance
    of building envelopes without necessitating significant structural modifications
    or expansion. In our study, we applied the UFH system, which is inherently energy-efficient.
    The addition of PCMs further improved energy performance by providing thermal
    storage capabilities. Leveraging our proposed predictive control strategy, energy
    consumption can be shifted from peak to off-peak periods by utilizing the thermal
    storage capacity of PCMs within the UFH system. Overall, the integration of a
    25 mm PCM wallboard in the building envelope resulted in a remarkable 35% thermal
    energy cost reduction compared to the reference case. This indicates the complementary
    nature of these technologies and their potential synergistic effects. Furthermore,
    our findings showed that such renovations outperformed a similar system in previous
    study [10], where additional 150 mm construction in a lightweight building contributed
    to approximately 50% thermal energy cost reduction, and further thickness failed
    to yield significant cost savings. The current study''s results emphasize not
    only the additional thermal energy cost savings achievable with PCM wallboard
    integration in a passive house but also the cost-effectiveness of a narrower PCM
    wallboard thickness compared to traditional building envelope materials. Consequently,
    PCM wallboard integration holds significant promise as a crucial strategy for
    future building renovations. Future work should explore the impact of PCM wallboard
    integration in other types of buildings and under different climatic conditions
    to assess the generalizability of our findings. Also, a detailed cost-benefit
    analysis considering the cost of PCM wallboards and their installation would provide
    more realistic insights into the economic viability of this technology. Moreover,
    while our study used a particular type of PCM, it would be interesting to investigate
    the effects of different PCMs with various phase change temperatures, thermal
    conductivities, and thermal storage capacities. It would also be beneficial to
    study the long-term performance and durability of PCM wallboards, including their
    potential degradation over time and the impact on energy savings. Finally, integration
    with other renewable energy sources, like solar panels, can be considered to optimize
    the overall building energy performance, making the building even more sustainable
    and resilient against future energy price fluctuations. 5. Conclusion and future
    works This study has established a novel monitoring and control framework through
    the integration of a MPC system with IoT technology. Designed to precisely monitor
    environmental conditions within buildings and subsequently relay control signals
    to the building''s heating system, this system has demonstrated considerable promise
    in improving energy efficiency and cost-effectiveness. The system underwent testing
    through a series of simulations and practical experiments in a passive house standard
    test pod at the University of Nottingham, yielding results that confirm both the
    lightweight and cost-effective nature of this intelligent control system. The
    inclusion of PCM wallboards within the building envelope was explored as an additional
    variable in the study. Our research validates the viability of integrating the
    MPC system with PCM wallboards, despite the increased complexity this presents.
    The critical insights gained from this study can be synthesized into the following
    key conclusions: • The proposed MPC system demonstrated the ability to maintain
    indoor temperature control, reacting within mere seconds to real-time temperature
    feedback. • The cost for implementing the MPC was found to be significantly lower
    when compared to a standard MPC case study, presenting a cost-effective solution
    for building management. • The MPC system predicted temperature trends hours in
    advance and adjusting controls to avoid comfort violations. • Substantial cost
    savings were realized through the strategic use of the MPC system. By shifting
    energy usage from peak periods to off-peak periods, based on real-world wholesale
    electricity market data, a 20% reduction in electricity costs was achieved over
    an eight-day experimental period. • In a scenario where conventional control systems
    could not maintain indoor thermal comfort, the proposed MPC system, integrated
    with PCM wallboards proved to be a feasible and effective solution. • Under the
    control of the proposed MPC strategy, the building integrated with PCM wallboards
    demonstrated a 35% reduction in electricity cost. This study underscores the viability
    of an IoT-based MPC strategy as an effective and innovative approach to enhancing
    energy efficiency and thermal comfort in buildings. This presents a compelling
    alternative to the traditionally high-cost intelligent control systems employed
    in the building sector. However, to further refine and develop this IoT-based
    MPC strategy, more research is necessitated. Future work should focus on broadening
    the scope of MPC experimentation across diverse types of heating systems. Furthermore,
    the incorporation of advanced inferencing methods for predicting weather conditions
    based on real-time measured weather data should be considered. This line of research
    opens up a multitude of avenues, all aimed at optimizing energy management systems
    and elevating building thermal comfort based on IoT technology. In addition, the
    application of MPC in controlling PCM wallboards reveals another exciting area
    of research. The MPC system recognizes the storage capabilities of PCM wallboards,
    providing a more robust approach to handle uncertainties in building construction,
    particularly when PCM is involved. The results suggest that the proposed MPC could
    be further refined or expanded to accommodate a wider variety of building materials.
    Moving forward, it is critical to understand the scalability of the proposed system
    across an extensive range of PCM wallboards. Each variant of PCM wallboards may
    pose unique challenges and offer distinct opportunities for energy management.
    Investigating these potential paths will undoubtedly push the boundaries of short-term
    energy storage (STES) in the building sector. Furthermore, such exploration is
    set to make substantial contributions towards the development of cost-effective
    and lightweight intelligent building energy control systems. This area of study,
    integrating modern control strategies with emerging material technology, holds
    the key to unlocking new levels of efficiency in the built environment. CRediT

    functioning of the K thermocouple temperature sensor, a calibration procedure
    was conducted using the ecowitt weather station''s [35] built-in indoor temperature
    sensor, which served as a reference. The calibration was performed over a two-day
    period, during which the indoor temperature ranged from 10 °C to 30 °C, as depicted
    in Fig. A1. The ecowitt weather station''s built-in temperature sensor continuously
    logged the real-time temperature data via WiFi to the cloud at a sampling interval
    of 30 min. The data collection spanned four days, from the 19th of December to
    the 23rd of December. Upon analyzing the collected data, the results from the
    two sensors were compared, revealing a close agreement. The root mean square error
    (RMSE) between the K thermocouple and the built-in temperature sensor was calculated
    to be 0.97 °C, indicating a relatively small discrepancy between the measurements
    of the two sensors. This validation process ensured the accuracy and reliability
    of the K thermocouple temperature sensor for subsequent temperature measurements

    test-cell [50]. The validation process involved comparing the simulated indoor
    temperature from TRNSYS with the experimental results obtained in the study conducted
    by Ahmad et al. [50]. For the case study, a test-cell (depicted in Fig. A6) was
    utilized, featuring one glazed wall facing south and other surfaces constructed
    with fibre cement, plywood, and vacuum insulation panels (VIPs). To enhance the
    building''s thermal performance, polyethylene glycol 600 (PCM) layers were incorporated
    into the five opaque surfaces. The location of the test-cell was in Grenoble,
    France. The study of Ahmad et al. [50] provided comprehensive details of the materials
    used, weather data, and PCM layers, which were incorporated into the TRNSYS simulation.
    The simulation was conducted over a four-day period, spanning from the 18th to
    the 21st of September. The results from the simulations without PCM layers demonstrated
    that the indoor temperature of the test-cell could reach as high as 60 °C during
    noon due to substantial solar radiation (Fig. A7a). However, in the evening, the
    indoor temperature drastically dropped to below 15 °C (Fig. A7b). In contrast,
    when PCM layers were integrated into the test-cell, the amplitude of indoor temperature
    fluctuations became smaller, ranging from 20°C to 45 °C, which verified the heat
    storage capacity of the PCM walls. The comparison between the simulated indoor
    temperatures by TRNSYS and the experimental data for both scenarios, with and
    without PCM layers, revealed good agreement. The root mean square errors (RMSE)
    were computed to be 1.73 °C and 1.53 °C for the respective cases, indicating a
    relatively small discrepancy between the simulated and experimental indoor temperatures.
    This validation process confirms the accuracy of the TRNSYS simulation in predicting
    the indoor temperature behavior with and without PCM layers in the test-cell.

  description: Nutrient runoff into rivers caused by human activity has led to global
    eutrophication issues. The Nakdong River in South Korea is currently facing significant
    challenges related to eutrophication and harmful algal blooms, underscoring the
    critical importance of managing total nitrogen (T-N) levels. However, traditional
    methods of indoor analysis, which depend on sampling, are labor-intensive and
    face limitations in collecting high-frequency data. Despite advancements in sensor
    allowing for the measurement of various parameters, sensors still cannot directly
    measure T-N, necessitating surrogate regression methods. Therefore, we conducted
    T-N predictions using a water quality dataset collected from 2018 to 2022 at 157
    observatories within the Nakdong River basin. To account for the water quality
    characteristics of each location, we employed a clustering technique to divide
    the basin and compared a Gaussian mixture model with K-means clustering. Moreover,
    optimal regressor for each cluster was selected by comparing multiple linear regression
    (MLR), random forest, and XGBoost. The results showed that forming four clusters
    via K-means clustering was the most suitable approach and MLR was reasonably accurate
    for all clusters. Subsequently, recursive feature elimination cross-validation
    was used to identify suitable parameters for T-N prediction, thus leading to the
    construction of high-accuracy T-N prediction models. Clustering was useful not
    only for improving the regressors but also for spatially analyzing the water quality
    characteristics of the Nakdong River. The MLR model can reveal causal relationships
    and thus is useful for decision-making. The results of this study revealed that
    the combination of a simple linear regression model and clustering method can
    be applied to a wide watershed. The clustering-based regression model showed potential
    for accurately predicting T-N at the basin level and is expected to contribute
    to nationwide water quality management through future applications in various
    fields.

    River 1. Introduction Pollution sources flowing into rivers are broadly divided
    into point and non-point sources (Liu et al., 2020). Non-point pollution sources
    mostly occur over a vast area of land, and as they travel through more diverse
    routes, their inflow becomes more difficult to measure and control (Islam et al.,
    2018). The rapid progress of urbanization has expanded the area of impervious
    surfaces, and the increasing frequency of anomalous rainfalls events caused by
    climate change have led to increased runoff into water systems. Such changes have
    disrupted the hydrological cycle and accelerated the direct flow of pollution
    sources into rivers (Kim et al., 2009). Currently, a higher amount of nitrogen
    is flowing into rivers than in past decades, and most of the nitrogen in water
    bodies is generated by non-point pollution sources (Vitousek et al., 1997; Fowler
    et al., 2013), including chemical fertilizers, livestock waste, poultry and agricultural
    farm waste, and domestic sewage (Zhang et al., 2022a). Nitrogen is the main cause
    of eutrophication (Dodds and Smith, 2016; Zhang et al., 2017; Jarvie et al., 2018),
    which leads to the excessive growth of algae and aquatic plants (Smith, 2003;
    Khan and Mohammad, 2014; Withers et al., 2014) and causes secondary environmental
    damage, such as the destruction of water ecosystems due to oxygen depletion (Le
    et al., 2010). Moreover, eutrophication affects the quality of water for drinking,
    industrial, agricultural, and recreational purposes, leading to increased water
    treatment costs (Carpenter et al., 1998; Ouyang et al., 2018). Recently, the concentrations
    of nitrogen-containing compounds in rivers, including nitrate‑nitrogen (NO3-N)
    and ammonia‑nitrogen (NH3−N), have increased due to environmentally harmful agricultural
    and industrial practices. Thus, it is crucial to develop techniques to accurately
    measure and predict nitrogen levels in water bodies (Knoll et al., 2019; Kumar
    et al., 2020). Periodic tests involving river water sampling and laboratory techniques,
    such as colorimetry, manual distillation, and ion chromatography, are required
    to assess nitrogen levels in water bodies (He et al., 2022). Although these methods
    accurately measure the nitrogen concentration in rivers, they are conducted infrequently
    (weekly or monthly) because of time, cost, and manpower requirements (Johnes,
    2007; Cassidy and Jordan, 2011; Huiliang et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2017). For
    an area that exhibits complex variations, sampling from a single site results
    in a poor understanding of the spatial distribution of nitrogen pollution in rivers;
    however, obtaining samples at each measurement point from sites that exhibit severe
    temporal variability is difficult (Madrid and Zayas, 2007; Palmer-Felgate et al.,
    2008; Halliday et al., 2012; Pellerin et al., 2012; Blaen et al., 2016; Gholizadeh
    et al., 2016; Villa et al., 2019). Dynamic models that generally describe the
    physicochemical and biological processes of ecosystems using a series of differential
    equations, including coefficients that require adjustments according to each specific
    system (Anagnostou et al., 2017), are primarily used to determine the causes and
    mechanisms of water pollution and eutrophication (Kitsiou and Karydis, 2011; Kim
    et al., 2020). Dynamic models can be applied to develop management strategies
    for restoring and conserving high-quality water ecosystems (Anagnostou et al.,
    2017). However, dynamic models demand high-resolution multivariate data, and their
    prediction performance is not guaranteed unless adequate data are available (Dormann
    et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2020). Fortunately, recent advancements in sensors have
    enabled the monitoring of various environmental entities (Pellerin et al., 2014;
    Blaen et al., 2016; Wong and Kerkez, 2016). High-frequency monitoring is necessary
    for water quality inspections (Martinez and Hart, 2006), and measurements from
    high-frequency sensors can be used to identify water quality trends at sites that
    exhibit severe temporal variability (Kirchner et al., 2004; Jordan et al., 2007).
    However, sensors that measure total nitrogen (T-N) on-site have not been developed
    yet; thus, monitoring water body T-N levels is more challenging than monitoring
    other water quality parameters. Hence, the “surrogate-regression” method, which
    applies items that can be measured using sensors, has been widely used in numerous
    studies (Horsburgh et al., 2010). The use of sensors and modeling in water quality
    management is highly efficient in terms of time, cost, and manpower (Sinshaw et
    al., 2019). Studies performed over the past two decades have collectively suggested
    a paradigm shift from conventional methods that use dynamic models toward methods
    that use data-based models to simulate water environments (Chaa et al., 2020).
    For example, Suen and Eheart (2003) compared back-propagation neural networks
    (BPNNs) and radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs) to optimize the prediction
    of nitrate in rivers. Anctil et al. (2009) utilized stacked multilayer perceptron
    models to model the increased nitrate‑nitrogen in rivers due to agricultural fertilizers.
    Markus et al. (2010) predicted weekly variations in nitrate-N for agricultural
    watersheds using artificial neural networks, evolutionary polynomial regression,
    and the Naive Bayes model. Kumar et al. (2020) compared three models—general regression
    neural network, RBFNN, and multilayer neural network—and found that the multilayer
    neural network was the most suitable model for predicting monthly average ammonia-N
    and nitrate-N. Sharma et al. (2003) employed an radial basis function (RBF) network
    to simulate subsurface drain outflow and nitrate‑nitrogen concentrations in agricultural
    field plots subjected to both no-tillage and conventional tillage treatments.
    They confirmed that the RBF network can be utilized to predict drain outflow and
    NO3 − N concentration on a daily and monthly basis. Lee et al. (2013) used multiple
    linear regression (MLR) to predict T-N levels in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP)
    outflows, combined sewer overflows (CSOs), rivers, and reservoirs. The accuracy
    of T-N prediction in rivers and reservoirs is low because these water bodies are
    relatively variable compared with WWT-Ps and CSOs. Harrison et al. (2021) performed
    a random forest (RF) regression to estimate the nutrient level in rivers based
    on high-frequency sensor data and instantly identify river nutrients using the
    data obtained from sensors. The accuracy of the results was 85 % compared with
    the T-N concentration estimated through laboratory analysis or by using RF models.
    Zhang et al., 2022a, Zhang et al., 2022b utilized ensemble and clustering models
    to determine the drivers and patterns of T-N concentrations associated with different
    management practices in the Chesapeake watershed in the United States. He et al.
    (2022) applied a VCLM (variational mode decomposition (VMD)-chaos sparrow search
    algorithm (CSSA)-long short-term memory (LSTM)-MLR) hybrid model for T-N prediction.
    After high- and low-frequency data had been categorized through the VMD, the high-frequency
    data were used in the CSSA-LSTM methods while the low-frequency data were used
    in the MLR for the prediction to enhance the model performance. Despite the advantage
    of high predictive power associated with machine and deep learning methods, their
    actual application is limited mainly because they produce black-box models with
    inadequate interpretability (Chakraborty et al., 2021). In an Organization for
    Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) analysis of water stress based on
    river water withdrawal rates, the level of water stress in South Korea was ‘moderate
    to high’ (Choo et al., 2019). Dams and weirs of varying sizes have been constructed
    throughout South Korea for a more efficient management of its water resources
    (Ahn et al., 2008). These artificial structures alter natural rivers into lakes
    or lentic zones, thereby increasing the input of organic materials and nutrients
    (Seo and Kim, 2009). Additionally, monsoons with high seasonal variations cause
    frequent torrential rainfalls during summer, causing large seasonal fluctuations
    in the release of non-point pollution sources (Kang et al., 2010; Kyoung et al.,
    2011). Total maximum daily loads have been calculated for mandatory inspections
    of the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and total phosphorus (T-P) levels in the
    water systems of the four major rivers in South Korea: Han, Nakdong, Geum, and
    Yeongsan-Seomjin Rivers (Kim et al., 2019a). From the perspective of improving
    the water quality of the Nakdong River (Fig. 1), a clear reduction in T-P has
    occurred while the level of T-N has not been reduced, implying that more careful
    management of T-N is required. However, analyzing and predicting T-N variations
    based solely on the sampled or observed values from national monitoring network
    data, which fail to reflect the spatial variability of rivers, has some limitations.
    Hence, a process that uses more detailed monitoring data to identify the trends
    in temporal T-N variations based on spatial distribution is necessary. In this
    study, water quality sensor measurements were used for T-N predictions. The prediction
    target scale was the river basin, and the analysis was based on clustering to
    reflect the spatial characteristics of each site. Furthermore, appropriate models
    and water quality parameters were selected for each cluster to conduct efficient
    T-N predictions. As the application of sensors has recently increased, the findings
    of this study will contribute to promoting sensor-based T-N predictions. Download

    and methods To construct a prediction model of T-N that considers the spatial
    variability of a large watershed, we have developed a framework that combines
    clustering and regression models. This framework is illustrated in Fig. 2 and
    consists of the following steps: (a) build an overall water quality measurement
    network dataset for the Nakdong River watershed; (b) select an appropriate method
    and number of clusters for K-means clustering and Gaussian mixture model (GMM)
    clustering to consider the spatial characteristics of the utilized water quality
    measurement networks; (c) divide the data into training and validation sets for
    each cluster; (d) compare multiple models, including MLR, RF, and XGBoost (XGB)
    regressor, to select the optimal prediction model for each cluster; (e) perform
    hyperparameter tuning for each model and performing recursive feature elimination
    (RFE) to select the optimal variables for T-N prediction; and (f) select the final
    estimator for each cluster based on the high-accuracy models and optimal variable
    selection from steps (d) and (e). A detailed explanation is provided in the following

    The Nakdong River, which is located in the southeastern part of the Korean Peninsula,
    is the second-longest river in South Korea at 510.36 km, and it has an area of
    23,384 km2 (Ahn et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2017). Approximately 13 million residents
    around the river basin use water from the river, and Daegu City withdraws 1.11
    million tons of water from the river, accounting for 74 % of its domestic water
    consumption (Park and Lee, 2002; KICT, 2008). The Nakdong River has seven major
    tributaries (Naeseong Creek, Wi Creek, Gam Creek, Geumho River, Hwang River, Nam
    River, and Milyang River) and ten dams and eight multipurpose weirs to preserve
    water resources and prevent floods (Lee et al., 2018). However, these facilities
    modify the flow and increase the retention time of water, leading to the formation
    of reservoir-like rivers. Moreover, various environmental and anthropogenic factors,
    such as the excessive concentration of industrial facilities in Gyeongsangbuk-do
    around the midstream of the Nakdong River (Kwon et al., 2009), cause frequent
    eutrophication and harmful algal blooms (Ryu et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2019b).
    The water quality monitoring data from 157 observatories along the Nakdong River
    mainstream and tributaries, which were provided by the Ministry of Environment,
    were used in this study (Fig. 3). Each observatory takes water quality measurements
    on a weekly or monthly basis, and 21,434 datasets are available for the period
    2018–2022. The statistics of the respective data are shown in Table 1. Download

    quality, both directly and indirectly influential variables can be utilized. Multivariate
    regression allows the incorporation of both direct and indirect variables in the
    learning process. Incorporating these variables into the learning process enhances
    accuracy and robustness by considering spatial and temporal characteristics within
    the study site and period. Therefore, we selected seven independent variables
    for predicting T-N, comprising six indirectly influential variables and one directly
    influential variable. Specifically, NO3-N is designated as a directly influential
    variable, while Dissolved Oxygen (DO), pH, Electrical Conductivity (EC), Water
    Temperature (WT), Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) are
    chosen as indirectly influential variables. These variables were chosen based
    on their applicability to widely used water quality sensors, such as YSI (company
    name, USA), which is extensively employed in measuring various water quality parameters,
    and a UV–Vis submersible spectrophotometric probe (S::CAN GmbH, Vienna, Austria)
    commonly utilized in water quality monitoring network of South Korea. Nitrogen
    is a major cause of eutrophication. To assess the eutrophication of rivers, water
    quality is measured. Water quality consists of measurable components, and sources
    of these components can be classified into physical, chemical, and biological
    categories (Lin et al., 2020). Physical factors include light, Secchi disc visibility,
    and WT, while chemical factors include COD, T-P, and T-N. Biological factors primarily
    include Chl-a. WT in rivers is a good indicator of climate variability and change
    as well as an indicator of the control of processes occurring in river ecosystems
    and their services (Webb et al., 2008; Letcher et al., 2016). WT is primarily
    shaped by the influence of the natural environment and exhibits temporal variations
    on different scales, such as hourly, daily, seasonal, and annual, enabling the
    observation of the temporal characteristics of aquatic systems (Graf et al., 2019).
    DO serves as a key indicator of the aquatic environment, assessing the health
    of aquatic ecosystems such as rivers, lakes, and oceans (Basant et al., 2010;
    Wang et al., 2018). DO tends to decrease due to urbanization, population growth,
    increased pollution sources, and hydro-meteorological changes, showing an inverse
    relationship with WT. DO, like WT, can be utilized as an indicator reflecting
    both the temporal and spatial characteristics of aquatic systems. pH tends to
    fluctuate due to factors such as acidic rain or discharges from industrial and
    sewage sources (Verma and Singh, 2013). In the studies by Bu et al. (2010) and
    Bu et al. (2014), pH was identified as a common factor with NO3-N and T-N through
    factor analysis. This indicates that pH acts as an important reaction condition
    for nitrification and denitrification (Goodale et al., 2009; Jain, 2002). Depending
    on the soil pH, NH4+ and NO3− ions are generated in the watershed through ammonia
    assimilation and nitrification, and they move to rivers through runoff. EC is
    widely used as an indicator quantifying the intrinsic properties of water bodies.
    Additionally, when there is a significant difference in EC between the mainstream
    and tributaries, it can be used as an indicator reflecting the degree of contamination
    (Ahmadianfar et al., 2020). In this regard, EC represent the regional characteristics
    of the watershed and serve as an indicator of pollution characteristics in rivers.
    pH and EC can also be used as indicators of seasonal variations. In the study
    by Li et al. (2017), pH showed a trend of summer > spring = winter > autumn, while
    EC exhibited a sequence of spring > winter > summer > autumn. Wind speed is inversely
    proportional to pH, as wind can accelerate the dispersion of pollutants in the
    atmosphere. Moreover, EC showed correlation with precipitation. Higher precipitation
    leads to a more pronounced cleansing effect of fine dust in the atmosphere, as
    most pollutants are washed into rivers with rainwater, resulting in increased
    EC in rivers. T-N is composed of Particulate Total Nitrogen (PTN) and Dissolved
    Total Nitrogen (DTN), with DTN being the predominant component. DTN consists of
    NH3-N, NO2-N, and NO3-N, with NO2-N being present in very small concentrations
    in river. Additionally, NH4+ in soil and water is generally found at relatively
    lower concentrations compared to NO3− (Fu et al., 2010). Therefore, the nitrogen
    forms constituting T-N are predominantly composed of NO3-N. Furthermore, since
    NO3-N is a parameter measurable through sensors, it aligns well with the direction
    of this study and was utilized as a variable for predicting T-N. 2.3. Clustering
    Clustering is mainly used in classifying data based on their similarities and
    identifying patterns or structures (Sinaga and Yang, 2020). River water quality
    is influenced by various factors, and understanding these influences can be challenging.
    Nonetheless, much can be learned from the similarity in water-quality signals
    and responses to natural and anthropogenic drivers (Ator et al., 2020). In this
    regard, clustering approaches can be especially useful for categorizing regional
    patterns of water-quality trends, which can be utilized to identify similarities
    in water-quality trends among regions (Zhang et al., 2022a, Zhang et al., 2022b).
    Clustering was applied in this study to predict the T-N levels in the Nakdong
    River based on the entire data from the 157 water quality observatories for 2018–2022.
    Eleven parameters were used for clustering: pH, DO, EC, WT, Chl-a, COD, NO3-N,
    T-N, T-P, total organic carbon (TOC), and flow rate (Q). Data scaling was applied
    to adjust the range of the obtained values because each water quality parameter
    has a specific data range. Clustering is broadly divided into hierarchical and
    non-hierarchical analyses. In hierarchical clustering, each data factor is initially
    perceived as a separate cluster, and clustering is repeatedly performed until
    the cluster with the highest similarity is generated (Park et al., 2020). In non-hierarchical
    clustering, no hierarchical structure is formed across the clusters and data points
    are simply divided into a number of clusters based on the distance or similarity
    across the data. Hierarchical clustering was initially applied, and the data from
    the 157 observatories were divided into two clusters. However, each cluster was
    inadequate to reflect the characteristics of each river basin; thus, K-means clustering
    and the GMM were applied in this study. The most appropriate method and number
    of clusters were selected by comparing their silhouette scores (Eq. (1)). This
    index serves as an indicator of cluster quality based on measurements of intracluster
    cohesion and intercluster separation, and it can be calculated as follows: (1)
    where is the mean distance from a data point i to all other data points within
    a given cluster, is the mean distance from the data point i to all clusters except
    the one containing i, and is the silhouette coefficient value of the ith data
    point. In Python 3.9.7, the scikit-learn library was used for data scaling (StandardScaler),
    clustering (K-means, GMM), and estimating the silhouette score. 2.3.1. K-means
    clustering K-means clustering is the oldest and most widely used method of unsupervised
    learning (Jain and Dubes, 1988; Berkhin, 2006). A certain number of centroids
    is defined, and a cluster is formed with the closest centroid to each data point
    (Arthur and Vassilvitskii, 2007). The centroid positions within the cluster are
    adjusted until the object function reaches its minimum value, and the data clustering
    process is repeated (Hashemy and Monem, 2012). K-means clustering is a simple
    and intuitive algorithm that can handle a large volume of data and allows for
    easy interpretation of the results (Lee et al., 2006; Celebi et al., 2013). We
    evaluated the number of clusters using the within-cluster sum of squares or distortion
    value ( as follows: (2) where is the number of clusters, is the set of data belonging
    to the th cluster, is the centroid of the th cluster, and d is the distance between
    the two datasets . 2.3.2. Gaussian mixture model GMM is also among the most well-known
    clustering methods (Lücke and Forster, 2019). Compared with K-means clustering,
    which is deterministic and based on the Euclidian distance, GMM is probability
    based, where the clusters are statistically differentiated based on the Gaussian
    distribution (Bouveyron and Brunet-Saumard, 2014; Herms et al., 2021). Thus, it
    can describe dispersions for the clustering of datasets comprising extended structures,
    while the probability of belonging to each cluster from the fitted probability
    density function can be expressed as shown in Eq. (3) (Kwon et al., 2022): (3)
    where is the probability density function of a data point , K is the number of
    clusters, is the mixture coefficient, and is a single Gaussian distribution of
    the kth cluster, including a mean ( ) and covariance matrix ( ). Each can be defined
    as follows: (4) where d denotes the matrix dimension, T is the transpose of the
    matrix, and is the determinant of . Consequently, the parameter set is defined
    for each cluster in the GMM and can be estimated by the expectation-maximization
    (EM) algorithm to maximize the log-likelihood of (Eq. (4)): (5) The EM algorithm
    is detailed in Bishop (2006). 2.4. Regression model In this study, the T-N prediction
    accuracies of the MLR, machine learning (ML), RF, and XGB models were compared,
    and each algorithm was constructed by dividing the data into training (80 %) and
    testing (20 %) sets. Most of ML algorithms requires relevant hyperparameters to
    be optimized to produce outstanding performance results (Schratz et al., 2019).
    To enhance the ML performance, hyperparameter tuning was conducted using the GridSearchCV.
    The prediction accuracy of a regression model can be increased by selecting multiple
    independent variables; however, increased learning time demands a long period
    until its application. To ensure efficient model construction, the selection of
    the independent variables was optimized. For this purpose, recursive feature elimination
    cross validation (RFECV) was applied in this study, while cross-validation was
    conducted on five separate folds, which involves randomly dividing the entire
    dataset into five subsets referred to as folds. The model undergoes training and
    evaluation through five repetitions, where one fold is utilized as the testing
    set and the remaining folds are used as the training set. This process is repeated
    five times to measure and record the performance of the model across the five
    folds. R-squared (R2) was used for hyperparameter tuning and selection of independent
    variables and can be estimated by Eq. (6): (6) where is the coefficient of determination,
    is the sum of the squares of residuals, and is the total sum of squares. The T-N
    prediction models were trained using the optimal models and variables selected
    for each cluster. Subsequently, the performance of the models was evaluated using
    test data, employing metrics such as RMSE, MAPE, and R-squared (R2). (7) (8) where
    is the root mean square error, is the mean absolute percentage error, is the number
    of samples, is the actual observed values, and is the values predicted by the
    model. In Python 3.9.7, the scikit-learn library was used to perform the MLR,
    RF, GridSearchCV, and RFECV analyses while the XGB library was used to perform
    the XGB regression. 2.4.1. Multiple linear regression As a classical statistical
    tool developed to formalize the complex input–ouT-Put relationship (Wang et al.,
    2012), MLR is a regression technique that models the linear relationship between
    a dependent variable and two or more independent variables (Razi and Athappilly,
    2005; Tabachnick et al., 2013). MLR is based on least squares approximation, and
    a model exhibiting the minimum value as the sum of squared errors between the
    observed and predicted values is selected (Zare Abyaneh, 2014). As the number
    of parameters to be estimated is relatively small, MLR is more convenient to perform
    than non-linear regression and ML models (Lee et al., 2013). The general MLR equation
    can be expressed as follows: (7) where is the dependent variable, is the independent
    variable, is the parameter, and is the error. 2.4.2. Machine learning regression
    Since water quality is influenced by various factors (climate, river basin characteristics,
    etc.), it is crucial to compare different models and select the most appropriate
    model for predicting water quality. Data-driven ML models are commonly used in
    water quality prediction because of their outstanding performance in identifying
    the basic relationships between inputs and ouT-Puts (responses) (Sun and Scanlon,
    2019). In this study, various water quality parameters and data obtained from
    different points rather than a single point were applied. Hence, linear and non-linear
    models were compared to select the most appropriate model for T-N prediction.
    RF, a bagging-type ML algorithm where ensemble learning is applied to reduce the
    dispersion of predictions, is an advanced modeling technique based on decision-making
    trees (Breiman, 2001). Various decision-making trees are combined, and the prediction
    of each tree is averaged to produce estimations (Jung et al., 2021; Kwon et al.,
    2022; Nam et al., 2023). Each decision-making tree is generated by a unique bootstrapping
    sample of the training dataset (Khanal et al., 2018). The bootstrapping sample
    function randomizes the datasets to divide them among equivalent subsets, and
    these random subsets are used for growing and training each tree. The remainder
    is used for testing the trees and estimating the model accuracy (Were et al.,
    2015). XGB, which was proposed by Chen and Guestrin (2016), is a scalable artificial
    intelligence algorithm for tree boosting. It has recently been acknowledged as
    an efficient ML algorithm (Shehadeh et al., 2021). Gradient boosting (GB) is a
    well-known model of the ensemble-based boosting method. In boosting, each tree
    is learned in sequence, and when learning a new tree, the weight of the sample
    from incorrect learning at the previous tree is increased. Through repeated learning
    of new decision trees with reduced errors, a powerful ensemble model is created
    (Wang et al., 2022). XGB is based on GB, and with additional normalized terms
    in the expression of the objective function, the model bias is reduced to enhance
    its prediction performance (Leggesse et al., 2023). While GB solely uses the first-order
    derivatives in model training, XGB applies the second-order Taylor expansion to
    rapidly optimize the objective function (Wang et al., 2022). XGB has a lower level
    of overfitting and higher calculation efficiency than GB. 3. Result and discussion
    3.1. Utilization of all water quality measurement network data The T-N prediction
    MLR algorithm was used to evaluate all of the data obtained from 2018 to 2022
    from 157 observatories in the water quality measurement network along the Nakdong
    River. The MLR model was constructed by dividing the data into training (80 %)
    and testing (20 %) sets. When the model built using 80 % of the training data
    was applied to the remaining 20 % of the test data, it exhibited high accuracy
    with RMSE = 0.532, MAPE = 13.485, and R2 = 0.904 (Fig. 4 (a)). Download : Download

    of observed and predicted T-N values using a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)
    model trained on (a) entire water quality dataset and (b) mainstream water quality
    dataset. For the constructed MLR model, the data from the observatories at tributaries
    exceeded the data from the observatories at mainstream areas when the entire dataset
    of the water quality measurement network was applied. When the T-N prediction
    accuracy in the mainstream areas was evaluated by applying randomly extracted
    data from the mainstream areas to the constructed MLR model, the result of the
    observed T-N and predicted T-N through MLR produced the following values: RMSE
    = 0.532, MAPE = 14.465, R2 ≤ 0.7 (Fig. 4 (b)). The Nakdong River is an essential
    water resource that supplies drinking, industrial, and agricultural water to major
    cities, including Daegu-si and Busan-si (Lee et al., 2018). Unfortunately, the
    Nakdong River is suffering from harmful algal blooms and eutrophication caused
    by irrigation facilities and various environmental changes, such as elevated WT
    and increased water retention time (Ryu et al., 2018). Climate variability accelerates
    the changes in the physicochemical parameters of rivers, which significantly affects
    algal growth; thus, predicting the water quality of the river mainstream is crucial
    (Yadav and Ahn, 2021). The MLR model constructed was limited in predicting the
    T-N levels in the mainstream areas of the Nakdong River due to the high proportion
    of data from tributaries. 3.2. Water quality measurement network clustering Clustering
    was applied to increase the prediction accuracy of T-N in the Nakdong River mainstream
    and incorporate the spatial characteristics of each river basin in the model.

    of the number of clusters using the silhouette score. The results revealed that
    for each cluster number, the K-means clustering performance was higher than the
    GMM performance. The characteristics of the river mainstream and tributaries varies,
    and in the case of water quality, the data distribution clearly followed the level
    of pollution. Thus, clear data clusters would have been found for K-means clustering
    compared with GMM, thus providing related advantages. Therefore, in this study,
    K-means clustering was used to classify the data from 157 observatories along
    the Nakdong River into four clusters (Fig. 6). Cluster 1 formed around the midstream
    to downstream areas of the Nakdong River and had the highest flow rate. In this
    cluster, water flow is controlled by the weir located on the river mainstream;
    thus, frequent algal problems have been reported. Cluster 2 consisted of the river
    mainstream and tributaries and had the lowest pollution level. Cluster 3 formed
    around the main tributaries in the midstream to downstream areas of the Nakdong
    River (Geumho River, Seonakdong River, etc.). A dense industrial complex lies
    in the vicinity of the Geumho River, while the water in the Seonakdong River is
    stagnant due to the flow control at the floodgates. As a result, Cluster 3 had
    the highest levels of organic (TOC and COD) and eutrophication pollutants (T-N
    and T-P). Cluster 4 formed in areas with a high level of agricultural activities,
    which have a high probability producing non-point pollution. Thus, the level of
    nitrogen pollutants (T-N and NO3-N) in Cluster 4 was particularly high compared
    with that of other water quality parameters. Download : Download high-res image

    and variables for each model To achieve optimal T-N predictions for the four clusters,
    the MLR, RF, and XGB models were compared. To maximize the performance of each
    model, hyperparameter tuning was conducted using the GridSearchCV. The hyperparameter
    setting of the MLR model was applied as the default. Among the seven water quality
    parameters selected using the RFECV method (DO, pH, EC, WT, Chl-a, NO3-N, and
    COD), the relevant parameters for T-N prediction were explored (Table 2). Results
    for the comparison of the number of water quality parameters for each model are

    based on the number of variables in each model: (a) Cluster 1, (b) Cluster 2,
    (c) Cluster 3, and (d) Cluster 4. ML models such as RF and XGB demonstrate higher
    performance compared with MLR when there is a non-linear relationship between
    independent and dependent variables. While MLR is widely used for statistical
    predictions, its utility is limited in handling non-linear relationships between
    independent and dependent variables, especially in heterogeneous environments.
    However, ML models such as RF and XGB, which are black-box models with unknown
    causal relationships, exhibit high prediction accuracy but lack practicality.
    On the other hand, MLR can provide information about causal relationships and
    equation forms, making it more practical for decision-making. The results indicated
    that most suitable model for predicting T-N across all clusters was the MLR model.
    When evaluating variable importance, NO3-N was consistently identified as the
    most crucial factor in all models. Given the linear relationship between T-N and
    NO3-N, MLR was deemed more appropriate than RF and XGB for predicting T-N in all
    clusters. The selected model for T-N prediction in each cluster was MLR, and to
    construct it, five variables were chosen for Cluster 1, seven variables were chosen
    for Cluster 2, four variables were chosen for Cluster 3, and six variables were
    chosen for Cluster 4. 3.4. T-N prediction performance of the selected model We
    constructed T-N prediction models using MLR for each cluster and evaluated the
    accuracy of the models using test data (Fig. 8). The results indicated high accuracy
    for Clusters 1, 2, and 4 (Table 3). Cluster 1 had values of RMSE = 0.358 mg/L,
    MAPE = 8.178 %, and R2 = 0.818; Cluster 2 had values of RMSE = 0.514 mg/L, MAPE
    = 10.133 %, and R2 = 0.888; and Cluster 4 had values of RMSE = 0.514 mg/L, MAPE
    = 9.347 %, and R2 = 0.942. The model for Cluster 3 exhibited low accuracy in terms
    of RMSE, MAPE, and R2, with particularly poor prediction performance for high
    T-N concentrations. Notably, the number of measurement points in Cluster 3 was
    relatively smaller than that in the other clusters. The smaller number of datasets
    is presumed to have affected the outcomes. Cluster 1 exhibited a trend similar
    to that of Cluster 3, with its prediction performance decreasing as the T-N concentration
    increased. However, due to the larger amount of accurate prediction data and low
    variation between the observed and predicted values, the prediction performance
    of Cluster 1 model was higher than that of Cluster 3 model. Additionally, the
    highest error was found for approximately 16 mg/L T-N among the observed values
    in Cluster 3, which is likely to have been a deterministic factor in the reduction
    of its prediction performance. The regression equations derived using MLR for
    each cluster are presented in Table 4. Download : Download high-res image (322KB)

    Cluster 3 Cluster 4 The MLR models constructed for each cluster were applied to
    all of the collected data (Fig. 9). The predicted values of the constructed MLR
    models adequately reflected the trends across the observed values. In all clusters,
    the predicted values were lower than the observed values; however, the variation
    was insignificant. At ≥8 mg/L, Cluster 1 exhibited a low prediction performance,
    while the prediction accuracy of Clusters 2 and 4 was high across all concentrations.
    Meanwhile, at ≥10 mg/L, Cluster 3 exhibited a low prediction performance. Download

    Comparison of the observed values and predicted values from MLR: (a) Cluster 1,
    (b) Cluster 2, (c) Cluster 3, and (d) Cluster 4. The MLR models constructed for
    each cluster were divided into five folds for cross-validation, and the result
    demonstrated adequate levels of prediction performance for all clusters except
    Cluster 3. The performance was stable with deviations ≤0.1. Cluster 3, however,
    exhibited prediction performance ≤0.3 at fold 1, with the largest deviation (Table
    5). Table 5. Five-fold cross-validation results by cluster. Cluster Fold 1 Fold

    Compared with the other clusters, Cluster 3 exhibited low T-N prediction accuracy.
    This could have been due to the number of datasets or trend of NO3-N and T-N concentrations,
    which was the more likely reason (Fig. 10). At low NO3-N or T-N concentrations,
    highly similar trends were observed; however, the trends differed when the T-N
    concentration increased. Additionally, as shown in the radar chart of water quality
    for each cluster (Fig. 6), the standardized T-N and NO3-N concentrations were
    highly similar for Clusters 1, 2, and 4 while deviations were apparent for Cluster
    3. Therefore Cluster 3 was limited in terms of T-N prediction at high T-N concentrations.

    Fig. 10. Comparison of NO3-N and T-N in Cluster 3. The five-fold cross validation
    of the MLR model constructed for Cluster 3 demonstrated revealed large deviations
    compared with the other clusters (Table 5). Such large deviations in prediction
    performance across the folds implied limitations in generalizing the model and
    the possibility of over- or under-fitting to the training data used in the MLR
    model construction for Cluster 3. Overfitting occurs when a model fits the training
    data at too high an accuracy that it cannot be generalized to other data, while
    underfitting occurs when a model is too simple and its performance is low between
    the training and validation data. The MLR model for Cluster 3 suffered from overfitting.
    Limitations in learning occurred as the NO3-N concentration was low in a few cases
    of high T-N concentrations. In rivers, T-N is divided into PTN and DTN, with DTN
    being the predominant component. DTN consists of NH3-N, NO2-N, and NO3-N, among
    which NO2-N is typically present in minimal amounts in aquatic environments. Therefore,
    NH3-N and NO3-N are mainly measured (Yang et al., 2019). When predicting T-N for
    all clusters using MLR, NO3-N had a significant impact because it exhibited a
    linear relationship with T-N. However, for Cluster 3, the prediction accuracy
    was significantly lower, especially at high concentrations. The high-concentration
    T-N data of Cluster 3 are shown in Table 6. Table 6. T-N, dissolved total nitrogen
    (DTN), nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N), and ammonia‑nitrogen (NH3-N) concentrations when

    and DTN exhibit very similar values, indicating that DTN is predominant over PTN.
    For cases No. 1 to 3, the low prediction accuracy is attributed to the significant
    contribution of NH3-N In cases No. 4 to 7, the observed difference between DTN
    and T-N suggests the presence of PTN in the water. In cases No. 8 to 10, where
    T-N and DTN showed similar patterns, the slightly lower results for NO3-N and
    NH3-N compared to DTN suggested the presence of NO2-N. In this study, NO3-N, which
    can be measured with a sensor, was used, which represents a limit to T-N prediction
    in cases such as Table 6. The prediction of the total concentration of T-N for
    Cluster 3 has limitations. Therefore, the prediction performance was evaluated
    for T-N concentrations ≤10 mg/L and ≤5 mg/L, thus excluding high T-N concentrations
    (Fig. 11). In the case of ≤10 mg/L T-N, the improvement was insignificant compared
    to using the entire dataset, with RMSE = 0.994 mg/L, MAPE = 16.199 %, and R2 =
    0.760. However, for ≤5 mg/L T-N, the values were RMSE = 0.510 mg/L, MAPE = 13.263
    %, and R2 = 0.812. The equations derived through MLR are presented in Table 7.
    When compared to the regression equation for Cluster 3 in Table 4, the accuracy
    improved as the weight of COD decreased. When the cross-validation results were
    compared, both cases showed improvements, although the deviation was low for ≤5
    mg/L T-N (Table 8). Therefore, despite its limitations for T-N prediction, the
    MLR model for Cluster 3 indicated high accuracy for T-N concentrations ≤5 mg/L.

    Conclusions Regular monitoring of T-N is necessary for assessing eutrophication
    in water bodies. To improve the conventional methods used to assess eutrophication
    based on labor-intensive laboratory analyses, the data collected from 2018 to
    2022 were used to construct T-N prediction models that incorporate spatial variability
    of the Nakdong River based on the parameters measured using sensors. 1. The accuracy
    of T-N predictions by the MLR models constructed using data from the entire water
    quality measurement network along the Nakdong River was high. However, due to
    the predominance of tributary data in the entire dataset, the MLR model suffered
    from overfitting to the tributaries, resulting in significantly low prediction
    accuracy for the mainstem of the Nakdong River. This result demonstrates the need
    to incorporate spatial variability for basin-scale T-N predictions. 2. To incorporate
    the spatial characteristics of T-N in the unit of the river basin, clustering
    was applied to the data collected from the 157 observatories within the network.
    Between GMM and K-means clustering, the silhouette score indicated that the latter
    was more appropriate for application to large volumes of data and the most suitable
    number of clusters was four. 3. For the four clusters, a T-N prediction model
    and relevant water quality parameters were selected. To select the most appropriate
    model, MLR was compared with the ML models RF and XGB. The result showed that
    the highest accuracy was exhibited by the MLR model for all clusters. Among all
    models, NO3-N was the most important parameter for T-N prediction. T-N and NO3-N
    exhibited a linear relationship, leading to the selection of the MLR model as
    the most suitable choice. In comparison to the ML models, the MLR model stood
    out for its simplicity and transparency, thus offering significant efficiency
    advantages. With the selected model and water quality parameters for each cluster,
    the respective T-N regressors were constructed. 4. In the case of Cluster 3, large
    deviations were found in the cross-validation and it showed low prediction accuracy
    for high T-N concentrations. This is presumably due to model overfitting in the
    training process as a result of low NO3-N levels at high T-N concentrations. However,
    at ≤5 mg/L, improved accuracy and deviations were observed. The results of this
    study verified the potential use of clustering-based regression models for T-N
    predictions at the river basin scale. Furthermore, high accuracy was achieved
    through the MLR models by extracting relevant water quality parameters for T-N
    prediction in river basins. However, it cannot be conclusively asserted that MLR
    is the superior model for T-N prediction. Therefore, it is necessary to apply
    clustering and model comparisons to various watersheds in future research. As
    nutrients are influenced by rainfall and river flow, the inclusion of such parameters
    in the modeling would be useful for T-N predictions in the future. Although an
    increase in errors was observed within certain high-concentration ranges, collecting
    high-resolution data with temporal and spatial considerations would allow for
    more robust predictions. Based on the results of this study, where the suitable
    prediction models and water quality parameters were selected in accordance with
    the characteristics of river basins, future research should focus on sensor installation
    and measurement for nutrient monitoring and performing extended applications within
    various river basins. Such work will contribute to improving nationwide water
    quality management. CRediT authorship contribution statement Su Han Nam: Writing

  description: Assessing the quality of land is a very important step that precedes
    the planning of land use and taking management decisions; for example, in the
    agricultural field, it can be used to evaluate the suitability of the land for
    planting crops, determine the suitable irrigation system type, or adjust the agricultural
    inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides according to the requirements of each
    zone in the land. The spatial–temporal dynamic nature of land characteristics
    entails also updated evaluation process and updated management plan. The present
    paper tries to exploit the advances in information and communication technologies
    to develop a conceptual design of a dynamic system that accommodates the spatial–temporal
    dynamics of the agricultural soil characteristics to realize a land suitability
    assessment (LSA) based on a factor analysis method. The proposed design combines
    IoT technologies, web development, database, and digital mapping and tries to
    consolidate the system with other functionalities useful for decision support
    and suitable for different cases. The paper conducted a survey and made comparisons
    to select the best technologies that fit the current use case implementation and
    presents its reproducible conceptual modeling by developing the static and dynamic
    views through schemas, diagrams, message sequence charts, IoT messaging topic
    tree, pseudocode, etc. The functionality of the design was validated with a simple
    implementation of the system model. To our knowledge, there is no previous significant
    contribution that has addressed a LSA IoT use case. The proposed design automates
    the LSA process for more accurate decision-making, saving cost, time, and effort
    consumed in repeated field trips. It is characterized by flexibility and centralization
    in its offered services of spatial analysis, detection, visualizations, and status
    monitoring. The design also allows for remote control of field machinery.

    and Big Data Chapter © 2021 Introduction The Internet of things (IoT) is the network
    of any physical object that contains sensors and/or actuators and has the capability
    to process and send data over the Internet. IoT represents a main pillar of technological
    revolution in nearly all the application fields: industry, agriculture, medicine,
    military, etc. Therefore, IoT becomes the focus of attention of both research
    and industry. The literature is full of many proposals for IoT reference architecture
    and frameworks (Fremantle, 2015; Guth et al., 2016; Ngu et al., 2017; Saemaldahr
    et al., 2020; Abd El-Kader and Mohammad El-Basioni, 2013; Mohammad El-Basioni
    and Abd El-Kader 2020), IoT enabling wireless technologies development, IoT messaging
    protocols (Al-Masri et al., 2020; Naik, 2017; Tournier et al., 2021), and replete
    with many IoT use cases. In Srinivas et al.’s (2018) study, a use case was proposed
    for employing IoT technology in developing a smart healthcare system that contains
    an intelligent medicine box associated with sensors and a server for regular health
    monitoring. This smart medicine box with wireless Internet connectivity helps
    patients to get regular healthcare and creates easy communication between doctor
    and patient without meeting physically. The proposed medicine box helps the patient
    to take the right medicine at the right time. In Zhang et al.’s (2018) study,
    an architecture for the Internet of intelligent things in smart hospitals was
    proposed, and an infusion monitoring system case study to monitor the real-time
    drop rate and the volume of remaining drugs during the intravenous infusion was
    developed. An automatic real-time system for automated vehicle parking based on
    IoT was proposed by Patil et al. (2020). In the field of entertainment, IoT was
    used to understand the foot traffic of people at events; this IoT application
    visualizes the attendee traffic patterns in real time to help sponsors understand
    the best places to advertise and to ensure that the attendee count stays within
    the fire code compliance of the venue (Mendix Technology, 2021). IoT plays a key
    role in precision farming, as it allows continuous deep remote analysis, understanding,
    and control of agricultural processes leading to agriculture sustainability. This
    is clearly evident in the existence of various use cases for IoT in precision
    farming. IoT-based applications were developed for remote monitoring of the field
    information (Trimble Inc, 2021; Corizon, 2021; AgrIOT, 2021; Abd El-Kader and
    Mohammad El-Basioni 2021). In Shylaja et al.’s (2021) study, an IoT-based smart
    device is proposed for crop monitoring using machine learning. Instead of using
    the classical learning schemes, it introduced a new scheme called Modified Learning
    based Field Analysis Strategy (MLFAS) that predicts the status of the crop in
    the field by analyzing the real-time input data acquired and reports this to improve
    the decision-making process. The work of Kaburuan et al. (2019) represents an
    IoT system for monitoring the performance of indoor micro-climate horticulture
    based on farmers’ treatment from planting until harvest time. The soil, water,
    air, and image data from the field were integrated with the weather data of the
    Indonesian Meteorological Agency data. Just as the IoT is used to monitor climate
    and crops, it is also used for cattle monitoring where it senses and conveys data
    about the environment and cattle health. This application takes advantage of real-time
    data in the early treatment of any critical condition that threatens the cattle
    health and life before the matter worsens and disease spreads, for example. In
    Suresh and Sarath’s (2019) study, the proposed cattle monitoring system is composed
    of data-gathering nodes implanted on the cattle and contains sensors to measure
    important health parameters such as temperature, humidity, heart rate, and fall
    frequency. The system includes a mobile node that acts as a gateway that receives
    data from the data-gathering nodes and sends it to the IoT cloud platform for
    analysis. The monitoring system proposed by Shabani et al. (2022) also senses
    the important health parameters of the cattle: body temperature, heart rate, humidity,
    and location. The main contribution of the system is a microservice-based architecture
    which works as a bridge between the implanted devices and the IoT cloud application,
    uses machine learning to produce a percentage for the health of each head of cattle,
    and notifies the farm manager of critical situations in real time. Other complete
    systems (Dutta et al., 2022; Trivedi & Chatterjee, 2022; Unold et al., 2020) have
    been developed to monitor cattle health including the monitoring devices, the
    cloud system, and the end-user application, differing in the types of sensors,
    the communication technology, the application features, and the algorithm used
    to analyze data, classify activities, and detect conditions. IoT technology is
    used for remote control of farms, just as it is used for remote monitoring. Hence,
    it is used to automate sustainable agricultural systems and support their sustainability.
    Perhaps, one of the most sustainable agricultural systems that can benefit from
    IoT is the aquaponics system where it needs intensive monitoring and control.
    IoT-enabled aquaponics systems were proposed in the literature; in Haryanto et
    al.’s (2019); Hassoun et al. (2023) and Ezzahoui et al.’s (2022) study, smart
    aquaponics systems were proposed that monitor and control the water temperature,
    level, acidity degree, and fish feed using the readings of a number of sensors
    such as ultrasonic sensor, pH sensor, and temperature sensor. In addition to this,
    IoT has been widely used to monitor and control the environmental parameters in
    greenhouses (Joseph et al., 2020; Padmini et al., 2019; Shamshiri et al., 2021).
    Regarding the agricultural systems which depend on management zone delineation
    and spatial analysis, few researches have talked about exploiting IoT technology
    in such systems. For example, Kang et al. (2012) suggested using IoT to deliver
    the data mashup which is used in zone management to produce intelligent decision-making,
    and they drew a simple conceptual system architecture for such a system without
    giving a specific implementation. In a research by Monteleone et al. (2020) exploring
    the factors affecting the adoption of precision agriculture for irrigation management
    in the context of Agriculture 4, in an experimental case study, the use of IoT
    was casually mentioned for implementing variable rate irrigation and zone management
    by producing irrigation prescription map, but also without details of the specific
    implementation. This paper talks about a specific IoT use case which is the land
    suitability assessment (LSA). With the importance of LSA in achieving sustainable
    land-use planning especially in crop management practices, to the best of our
    knowledge, no or a small number of researches have addressed the exploitation
    of IoT to improve this process using the real-time data transmitted by the sensing
    devices deployed on the field. For example, the work proposed by Vincent et al.
    (2019) addresses the replacement of manual data collection with IoT-based sensors
    for LSA, but it mainly concentrates on the design of the multiclass classification
    used in land assessment. It only stores the data in the Amazon Web Service (AWS)
    cloud platform where it is used to develop the classification model which can
    be used later for future assessments. The proposed conceptual design is for a
    complete software system for IoT-based LSA ready to receive data that comes from
    the field and stores and processes it based on a standard multi-criteria classification
    method. Also, it implements other functions such as spatial analysis. It is the
    generalization of our case study proposed by Mohammad EL-Basioni et al. (2022).
    The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) had proposed
    a standard framework that specifies the procedures of the land suitability assessment
    process. In general, the process incorporates three steps. The first step is to
    select the influencing factors and grade the weights and relative values for the
    factors. The second step is to integrate the maps and database in GIS. Finally,
    the suitability score of each land segment is calculated, and the land suitability/classification
    maps are generated with respect to the given use. The various land-use suitability
    maps of a land are essential tools for planners and decision-makers to take the
    most suitable decision for this land use, management, and selection to allocate
    with the pre-plan, especially when they are taking into account sustainable development
    and economic competitiveness (Mu, 2006). The multi-criteria land suitability analysis
    generic model can be expressed as a land suitability measure, \\({\\text{LS}}\\),
    computed by a function of several indicators as shown in Eq. (1): $${\\text{LS}}=f\\left({indicator}_{{\\text{1}}},{indicator}_{{\\text{2}}},\\dots
    \\dots ,{indicator}_{{\\text{n}}}\\right)$$ (1) These indicators have a cumulative
    effect on land suitability as well as a separate effect that should be analyzed
    (Mendoza, 1999). These indicators are selected based on their sensitivity to management
    practices, ability to describe major soil processes, ease and cost of sampling
    and laboratory analysis, and significance (Tesfahunegn, 2014). These indicators
    are indexed in terms of some of their related soil parameters, and rating scores
    are given to these parameters. The proposed system concentrates on land evaluation
    for sustainable crop production which depends mainly on the soil parameters and
    quality indices: fertility, chemical, and physical. The proposed system is built
    on the aforementioned approach, based on the parameters used and the model and
    formulas proposed by El Baroudy (2016). The used parameters include nitrogen (N),
    phosphorus (P), potassium (K), zinc (Zn), organic matter content (OM), soil salinity
    (S), the exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP), the carbonate (CaCO3) content,
    soil pH (PH), drainage (R), the texture (T), the soil depth (D), the slope (F),
    the surface stoniness (Y), the hard pan depth (HP), the hydraulic conductivity
    (G), and the water holding capacity (WHC). Some of these factors are related to
    the soil fertility properties, and some others are related to the chemical and
    physical properties of the soil. The criteria or the parameters used to measure
    each index can be varied; that is, some of the parameters considered in each index
    formula can be excluded, and the formula is modified accordingly. The variability
    in soil properties, especially over large areas, and the change in soil over time
    have made the owners of large-scale farms to periodically analyze soil to test
    its health and determine the most appropriate treatment and use. These large-scale
    farms resort to the variable rate application technology to optimally deal with
    this variability, where it allows adjusting the amount and rate of agriculture
    resources throughout the farm according to each specific region’s needs without
    excess or negligence that harms the crop and without wasting resources and harming
    the environment. The data from soil analysis is used to produce a prescription
    map which guides the variable application. A variable rate irrigation system is
    used in farms which have center pivot systems. According to the prescription map,
    the center pivot control system cycles control the switching of sprinklers and
    vary the speeds to achieve the desired application rates in each section of the
    farm. The farms which have tractors with onboard computers and adjustable rate
    spreaders, seeders, or sprayers can be used in variable rate fertilizer application,
    variable rate seeding, or variable rate pesticide application, respectively, by
    loading the prescription map to the computer. Using IoT technology in the generation
    of prescription maps maximizes the benefit of the variable rate application by
    improving spatial resolution and addresses the issue of soil change over time
    thus improving temporal resolution as well. Therefore, these large-scale farms
    with computerized agricultural application equipment are potential customers for
    IoT-based systems for spatial analysis and management zone delineation in variable
    rate application, hence the proposed system. One of the most important tasks of
    scientists and technical specialists involved in agricultural planning is land-use
    planning, especially the LSA process. The functionality provided by the proposed
    system that allows the LSA maps to be generated automatically from real-time data
    and stored historical data makes it a desirable and very useful tool for these
    scientists. The rest of this paper is organized as follows, the “Materials and
    methods” section identifies the technologies that were used to build the system
    and the tools that were selected to implement these technologies, and then, it
    formulates the IoT-based LSA use case design including its static and dynamic
    view. The “Results” section represents a small-scale implementation of the proposed
    design to validate the functionality and suitability of the selected technologies
    and tools to the system use case. The “Discussion” section discusses the work
    presented in this paper and the development of IoT use cases for farm enterprises
    in general. Finally, the “Conclusion and future work” section concludes the paper
    and specific directions for future work. Materials and methods This section reviews
    the selection of technologies and tools for system implementations and contains
    system modeling. Selection of technologies The main technologies which build the
    proposed system are web application development, digital mapping, database, and
    IoT. The following sub-sections review recent trends in these technologies and
    set criteria for technology selections for the system implementation. Web application
    technologies The web application user can access it through the web browser where
    he can use its functions and perform some tasks that need interactions with a
    remote server over a network, which can be the Internet, using a client–server
    connection paradigm. Accordingly, developing a web application incorporates two
    types of development: front-end development and back-end development. The front-end
    development, or the client-side programming, is responsible for all the elements
    and layout the user directly interacts with on his browser. The back-end development,
    or the server-side programming, is behind-the-scene functionality that enables
    the front-end functionality; it represents everything the user does not see or
    directly interact with, but in fact, it powers what is happening. Front-end development
    Mostly, there will not be a front-end webpage that can dispense with the presence
    of the HyperText Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) coding.
    HTML is the organizer of the page structure, and CSS is responsible for its component
    formatting and styling. To make the front-end webpages dynamic, a programming
    language is needed, and JavaScript is undoubtedly the most popular language used
    to do so. JavaScript is an event-based runtime scripting language that can use
    the HTML Document Object Model (DOM) to add animations, automatic refreshments,
    and adjustments according to events such as user input timers and also server-side
    events; therefore, it supports the functionality of the webpage with which the
    dropdown lists, the buttons, the checkboxes, the tables, the menus, etc. of the
    webpage become functional and interactive with the users. In addition, JavaScript
    can fetch additional web content dynamically and run web-based software. Developing
    with JavaScript, we will generally need to use some JavaScript libraries, may
    be with templating engines or frameworks. Libraries are used to speed-up and facilitate
    development where they contain pre-written ready-to-use JavaScript functions;
    the two most popular JavaScript Libraries are jQuery (Vats, 2021) and React JS
    (JavaTpoint, 2021). Table 1 presents their important features which can be used
    for making a comparison to decide which one is more suitable for implementing
    the proposed system. Table 1 Comparison between jQuery and React JavaScript libraries
    Full size table JavaScript frameworks are collections of JS libraries that not
    only include JS code snippets, but also provide developers with a template for
    arranging the JavaScript code on their website. They are scaffolds for building
    your front end. They usually include some way to structure the site files (for
    example, via components or a CSS preprocessor), make AJAX requests, style your
    components, and associate data with DOM elements. There are other less common
    languages through which one can do front-end development depending on the framework,
    for example, Flutter uses Dart and Django uses Python. But nowadays, the most
    frameworks getting popular are Angular and Vue.js. Angular uses TypeScript programming
    language and offers an incredible structure, providing easy two-way data binding,
    an MVC model, a built-in module system, a routing package, dependency injection,
    and other exciting features. Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework used
    to build web interfaces and one-page applications. The HTML extension and the
    JS base made Vue a favored front-end tool; it is used by Adobe, Alibaba, Gitlab,
    and Xiaomi. Table 2 shows Angular’s and Vue.js’s important features. Table 2 Comparison
    between Angular and Vue.js JavaScript front-end frameworks Full size table Templating
    engine is a way to display information on the user’s browser. It aims to describe
    what we want to show. Templating engines such as Handlebars.js, Embedded JavaScript
    Templates (EJS), Underscore.js, and mustache allow to store HTML/CSS/JavaScript
    components and insert JavaScript variables into them. But does the web application
    of the proposed system need a front-end framework or is vanilla JavaScript with
    some libraries and templating engines as needed sufficient? Fig. 1 shows the relative
    ranking for these two methodologies in terms of ecosystem evolution rate and continuous
    support, constriction feeling in the design, productivity/learning curve, application
    size and complexity, maintainability, collaboration of developers and ease of
    understanding codes, and abstraction/ease of learn and use. Fig. 1 Ranking for
    the front-end development approaches in terms of some important development metrics
    Full size image Back-end development The traditional back end is a mix of four
    components: the server, databases, software, and operating systems. It includes
    the code that connects the web to a database and manages user connections and
    code that powers the web app itself. Its job is to (1) access the information
    that users require through the application, (2) combine and transform such information,
    and (3) return the information in its new shape to the requester. Back-end development
    works in tandem with the front end to deliver the final product to the end user.
    The following sections talk about each back-end main component. Application (middleware/server-side
    software/API): the application is the underlying code bridging the clients to
    the database and other back-end and cloud resources, it is what ultimately drives
    the web service. The most common back-end programming languages can be categorized
    into: The Object Oriented Programming (OOP) languages: languages which follow
    the imperative programming model that uses statements that change a program’s
    state. An imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform.
    OOP is used when there are many things with few operations. Popular OOP languages
    are Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, ASP.NET, Python, and PHP. The Functional Programming
    (FP) languages: languages which follow the declarative programming model: a high-level
    program in which the coder “declare” the results that he wants the language tool
    to output without writing explicit commands, and the tool processes the declaration
    and produces the required output. The functional language is non-imperative. The
    state transitions are represented in pure functional language by functions; it
    treats all computations as the evaluation of mathematical functions. Functional
    is used only when there are few things with more operations (performing many different
    operations for which the data is fixed). Popular functional languages are SQL,
    F#, and R. It is always up to the programmers or developers to choose the programming
    language concept that makes their development productive and easy. But what are
    the hypotheses for the selection? What are the language categories and the language
    to use in the system implementation? First, for choosing the programming paradigm,
    as the choice is problem-specific, it is more likely to use a mix of the two approaches
    depending on the current problem at hand, which is the best way to implement it.
    In case of mathematical problems, FP can effectively implement it. In other cases,
    if a problem can be decomposed into a number of procedural steps and when performing
    many different operations for which the data is fixed, go functional; if, on the
    other hand, a problem involves groups of inter-related agents and when performing
    small operations for mutable data, an OOP approach is likely to be better. Second,
    what is the OOP programming language that will be used? The popularity is not
    the sole reason which makes us select the programming language, but it is a good
    indicator of the need of developers, who we are from them, to learn and use the
    language; therefore, the language popularity indicator accompanied by reviewing
    its application and features can be the rule for selection. According to the StackOverflow
    Developer Survey result 2020 (Fig. 2), JavaScript is the most commonly used OPP
    language and then Python and Java, C#, PHP, TypeScript, C +  + , and C. And according
    to frameworks, libraries, and tool StackOverflow trends up to the year 2020 (Fig.
    3), Node.js takes the top spot as it is used by half of the respondents. Fig.

    popularity Full size image Fig. 3 Frameworks, libraries, and tool StackOverflow
    trend survey Full size image Node.js is technically not a language but a runtime
    environment for JavaScript with some specific useful libraries that can be used
    by JavaScript. It is better suited for building scalable, event-based, real-time,
    data-driven, I/O heavy, fast applications, accessing or performing any non-blocking
    operation of any operating system, like creating or executing a shell script,
    accessing any hardware-specific information, or running any back-end job. As it
    helps us to use JavaScript from outside of the browser, it enables JavaScript
    to be used in the back end as well as the front end and in any OS, solving JavaScript
    compatibility issues. In addition, its event-driven back-end nature enables it
    to handle multiple synchronous database read/write/update requests, bearing in
    mind that the IoT is characterized by the collection of a huge amount of data.
    It is actually very common to use more than one back-end programming language,
    and there are a number of ways this can be done, for example, calling libraries
    that are written in another language or as separate processes. Node.js has different
    packages developed for interfacing with other languages or runtime environments.
    Node.js frameworks include: Express.js: This is a minimalist web application framework
    that is used to build a number of mobile applications and APIs. Socket.io: It
    is used for building real-time web applications. It is a JavaScript library that
    allows the bidirectional data flow between the web client and server. Asynchronous
    data I/O, binary streaming, and instant messaging are some of the most important
    features of this framework. Derby: This is a real-time data synchronization engine
    for Node.js that allows multi-site, real-time concurrency, and data synchronization
    across clients and servers. Sails.js: This framework has gained traction through
    the development of chat applications, dashboards, and multi-player games. It is
    most famous for building data-driven APIs. Due to the previous analysis, we will
    concentrate on the Node.js technology. Servers: they are responsible for managing
    all back-end processes such as exchanging data among different clients, managing
    databases, reacting to users’ posts, and sending emails. Rather than the need
    to have physical servers, now, cloud services, such as Amazon and Azure, provide
    virtual servers on which the developers deploy their server applications. In addition,
    with the Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) cloud service model, the developers can concentrate
    only on developing the front end. The system includes servers: Web server: Node.js
    has a built-in module called HTTP that can create an HTTP server, while Express
    is a Node.js web application framework built on the HTTP module, adding more functions
    to what it offers to increase the convenience of building web servers. IoT server:
    Node.js is equipped with libraries that support IoT messaging protocols; node-coap
    is a client and server library for CoAP; rhea is used for developing AMQP client
    and server. MQTT protocol and socket communication which are commonly used in
    IoT applications are supported in Node.js: Mosca is a Node.js MQTT broker which
    can be used standalone or embedded in another Node.js application, and MQTT.js
    is a client library for the MQTT protocol. Database: Node.js supports relational
    databases (e.g., MS SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite) and NoSQL databases
    (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra, LevelDB, Redis). BaaS databases can also be used allowing
    us to focus on developing the client-side, such as Firebase, Parse Server, Hoodie,
    Horizon, and feathers-nedb. Most BaaS providers use NoSQL databases. According
    to StackOverflow developer survey result 2020 for databases (Fig. 4), MySQL occupies
    the first rank in popularity among developers, followed by PostgreSQL and Microsoft
    SQL Server. Fig. 4 Stackoverflow developer survey for databases Full size image
    What to use in the proposed system front-end and back-end development The proposed
    IoT-based system is not considered to be a large-size and complex application.
    By reference to Fig. 1, the frameworks are harder to learn especially since it
    is imperative to also learn the underlying code of the framework to use it better
    and for the purpose of customization and adding functionalities, and all of these
    increase the production time using frameworks. With respect to the constriction
    in the design, some frameworks are described to be opinionated, their design is
    based on principles that are not suitable to the application we want to develop
    or increase the application footprint by unnecessary unusable codes, and at the
    same time, their customization is a too tricky and nontrivial task; this raises
    the need to study the features of the available frameworks, compare them, and
    then select the appropriate one to study and use; this is also not an easy task
    and may result in an inaccurate choice. All of these reasons in addition to the
    availability of a variety of JavaScript libraries and the guarantee of related
    good and continuous support, it is preferred to build the proposed system from
    scratch using the front-end design approach—vanilla JavaScript with some libraries
    and templating engines—by trading off the frameworks’ built-in functionalities,
    reliability, and maintainability. By the same token, jQuery is preferred over
    React due to easiness to learn and use, short time-to-market, better documentation,
    and other good features such as lightweight, feature-rich, and cross-browser compatibility.
    Naturally, HTML and CSS, along with other HTML, CSS, and JavaScript-appropriate
    libraries, are essential for the proposed system front-end development. It is
    expected to use libraries and plugins for supporting specific helper functions
    such as Bootstrap CSS framework for getting design templates for some interface
    components; Font Awesome which is a font and customizable icon toolkit; JSZip
    for creating, reading, and editing.zip files; html2canvas for taking screenshots;
    SheetJS for spreadsheets manipulation; and Google Chart libraries. The real-time,
    scalability, and concurrent processing and harvesting a vast amount of data are
    the main needs for precision agriculture and IoT applications, and all of these
    metrics are realized by Node.js; therefore, as indicated earlier, our choice fell
    on using Node.js to implement the back end of the system and interface it with
    other FP languages if needed. Using the same language—JavaScript—in both front
    and back ends is an advantage. Relational database will be used to manage the
    proposed system’s structured data and represent the relations between them. Node.js
    can be interfaced with both of the two most popular database management systems
    MySQL and PostgreSQL. PostgreSQL is an object-relational database. While MySQL
    is simple and easy to understand and manage which improves its speed performance
    for simple applications, PostgreSQL is preferred for implementing the proposed
    system for supporting complex queries on large data volumes and due to its support
    for NoSQL features and a large number of data types including JSON. Finally, the
    proposed system back end will use the Express web server. Figure 5 summarizes
    the system web app development technologies. Fig. 5 The selected web development
    technologies for the proposed system Full size image IoT technologies The IoT
    will utilize the existing networking infrastructure, technologies, and protocols
    currently used in homes/offices and on the Internet. The IoT runs over the existing
    TCP/IP network infrastructure. Exchanging data through messages is fundamental
    for the development and deployment of IoT applications. The IoT protocols, or
    the IoT messaging application protocols, can take the publish/subscribe model
    or the request-response model, some of them use UDP and some others use TCP/IP.
    Figure 6 describes the trends in the worldwide interest in three popular messaging
    protocols: MQTT, CoAP, and AMQP. Fig. 6 Google trends for three well-known IoT
    messaging protocols Full size image The publish/subscribe model has a lot of characteristics
    and advantages that make it suitable for IoT scenarios especially the proposed
    near-real-time system case, including asynchronous many-to-many communication,
    decoupling between senders and receivers in time, space, and synchronization,
    reliability, and scalability. The publish/subscribe paradigm is supported by both
    MQTT and AMQP; however, AMQP is heavyweight and therefore not suitable for battery-operated
    IoT devices, while MQTT is very lightweight. This is one of the main reasons why
    MQTT is the de facto standard for IoT messaging (HiveMQ, 2021) and more widely
    used than AMQP in IoT applications and the reason why we selected it as the adopted
    IoT technology for the proposed system (Fig. 7). Fig. 7 The selected IoT technology
    for the proposed system Full size image Digital mapping technologies Google Maps
    is a feature-rich online mapping framework that supports numerous geospatial functionalities,
    and it is the first mapping service and API the developers think of choosing when
    integrating maps into a web application. It has earned the trust of web, iOS,
    and Android developers around the world. However, Google Maps increased the cost
    of its API calls—reaches $14 for 1000 map calls—and made the number of free API
    calls per month nearly 30 times less; this makes the search for alternatives a
    must. The two most prominent alternatives to Google Maps API are Mapbox which
    offers free 50,000 API calls monthly and $0.5 for each subsequent 1000 calls (Osypenko,
    2021) and OpenStreetMap which is free. The OpenStreetMap is considered to be a
    great geographic database of the world, but it does not offer a lot of mapping
    functionalities, so usually, it is better to use a more powerful service built
    on its data such as Mapbox. Mapbox is one of the largest providers of maps for
    websites and mobile apps. Their service is used by GitHub, Pinterest, Foursquare,
    and other popular companies. Mapbox offers advanced features such as location
    search, route finding, augmented reality, and many tools to help in integrating
    maps and other Mapbox online web mapping services—such as Directions, Geocoding,
    and Static Images. Mapbox is characterized by custom maps, very good performance
    in loading maps, the ability to deal with a huge amount of data to visualize and
    extract conclusions to take appropriate actions, and geospatial mapping support.
    These features make it a good fit for the proposed system type. Turf.js is an
    open-source JavaScript library used to perform advanced geospatial analysis in
    browsers and Node.js, and works with Mapbox. It includes traditional spatial operations,
    helper functions for creating GeoJSON data, and data classification and statistics
    tools. Figure 8 illustrates the selected mapping technologies. Fig. 8 The selected
    digital mapping technologies for the proposed system Full size image Measuring
    and transmission technologies There are several methods to measure the soil parameters
    for computing the quality indices and assess land suitability. Some parameters
    can be sensed with MEMS sensors available commercially or proposed in the literature,
    on-the-go vehicle-based sensors, handheld measuring devices, or soil sampling
    and laboratory analysis. Returning to the parameters of soil fertility, chemical,
    and physical properties mentioned previously, we find that the parameters that
    can be measured by industrial sensors embedded in MEMS-based wireless deceives,
    deployed in the field, communicate, and send data in real time are N, P, K, S,
    WHC, D, PH, T, and F. The sensor can be an integrated sensor that measures more
    than one soil parameter or a sensor dedicated to measuring a specific parameter.
    The soil NPK sensor (Soil NPK Sensor 2023) can measure the fertility and nutrient
    parameters N, P, and K. The soil EC-moisture-salinity-temperature sensor (Soil
    EC-Moisture-Salinity-Temperature Sensor 2023) can be used to measure and compute
    S, WHC, and D. The soil nutrient sensor (SEM225 Series Soil 2023) can be used
    to measure S, WHC, D, along with the PH value. The RS-PH-N01-TR-1 (Soil PH Sensor
    2023) is a sensor dedicated to measuring PH. Acoustic sensors can be used to measure
    T and D, and the soil slope/tilt sensor such as 0750–9002-99 MEMS tilt sensor
    and inclinometer (0750–9002-99 ± 90° RS-485 IP67 MEMS Tilt Sensor and Inclinometer
    2023) and the dual-axis inclinometer (AXISENSE-2 V-OUT TILT SENSOR FLOOR MOUNT
    2023) can be used to measure F. In the literature, a frequency-domain integrated
    sensor was proposed for in situ estimation of G (Xu et al., 2022), while the ring
    infiltrometer tool is already used for this. Optical sensors were proposed in
    the literature to measure OM, while commercially available handheld electromagnetic
    sensors, such as Geonics EM-38 Ground Conductivity Meter 2023, are used for infield
    measurement of OM as well as R and T. A handheld soil penetrometer is used to
    measure HP. The Zn is deduced from remote sensing data or from other influencing
    factors, such as the PH and T, Soil sampling and laboratory analysis can be used
    to provide information about Zn, HP, ESP, CaCO3, and Y. The data reported by the
    battery-operated devices deployed in the field in such a system is not characterized
    by a high data rate, but the devices require low power consumption for a longer
    lifetime, and the long-range bidirectional secure communication and low cost are
    preferred. These requirements are satisfied by the unlicensed low-power wide-area
    network technology, especially LoRaWAN. LoRaWAN has long been used for agricultural
    and environmental monitoring; its communication range reaches 5 km in urban areas
    and up to 15 km in rural areas (LoRa and LoRaWAN 2023). LoRaWAN is composed of
    end devices handling the sensing and actuation and performing bidirectional LoRa
    communication with the gateways which connect them to a server. The server manages
    the network through different pieces of software used for authentication and authorization
    and session management, network configuration and performance monitoring, data
    routing and selection of the gateway for a downlink, handling uplink messages
    duplication, processing application data, encryption/decryption and integration
    of data into existing management systems or IoT platforms, etc. Formulating the
    IoT use case: system design This section tells the story, identifying the need,
    the problem, and the requirements, which motivate constructing a proposed system
    use case. Then, the section goes on to explain the static structure and the dynamic
    behavior of the system. Narrative description of the system use case Some study
    areas can be employed to produce most types of vegetables and fruits including
    potatoes. It is a large area of high spatial variation and is characterized by
    using modern cultivation methods such as pivot irrigation. These modern cultivation
    methods often are associated with the variable rate application of agricultural
    inputs to encounter and exploit the high spatial variability of the field phenomena.
    Assuming the existence of all the required hardware used in applying the variable
    rates whether built-in or added to the modern agricultural equipment, the challenge
    is in developing the plans that control how the rate should be varied in the different
    field regions which is usually based on geo-referenced sampling of field data.
    This process, to be accurately achieved, requires experience, may require the
    hiring of skilled persons to achieve it, and repeated modification of the plan
    requires more data collection throughout one season; therefore, it consumes a
    lot of effort, time, and money. The proposed system use case uses the IoT technology
    and recent trends in programming and web development to enable the automation
    of data collection with higher temporal and spatial resolution, automate the spatial
    analysis and management zoning process, and facilitate, centralize, and improve
    decision-making. The system depends on the existence of sensing devices deployed
    in the field in certain points with known geographical positions, takes periodical
    samples of the field phenomena, and reports their values in real time in addition
    to laboratory values determined after analysis of soil samples taken at the same
    positions by special different devices. These laboratory values are inputted to
    the system manually. The system is prepared to manipulate field data related to
    soil, climate, and plant. All the data is stored in a database with its geographical
    coordinates for historical reference. The real-time data along with the stored
    laboratory values are used to infer the values of phenomena along the field by
    interpolation, and then, each region which has the same range of values and accordingly
    indicates a specific performance and requires special management is delineated
    whether it is contiguous or spread over the field area, all of this using real
    maps of the earth. Examples of management zone map usage include phosphorus and
    potassium management zone maps for variable fertilizer application, management
    zone maps for soil texture and soil water content can be used for variable irrigation,
    climate zone maps can be used for weed control, chlorophyll content measurement
    maps can be used for nitrogen management, and soil electrical conductivity maps
    can help for explaining yield variation. Moreover, the system allows for the spatial
    analysis of soil quality indices of fertility, chemical properties, and physical
    properties. The spatial analysis of these soil quality indices is used to derive
    the land suitability assessment classes for crop production. The appropriate decision
    is not limited only to the application in the appropriate place but also to the
    appropriate decision time so that the system should raise alerts immediately when
    certain conditions exist. Likewise, appropriate decision-making may need to be
    done based on reviewing historical data and representing it in different forms
    including management zone maps. The system should be characterized by flexibility
    in modifying the modeling equations, parameters’ values, adding and removing items,
    selection from different options, and different types of user accounts with different
    privileges. The system should be tailored for any land and not limited to only
    one field such that the user can manage all his belonging farms from his place
    through the application, apply to them all the system functionalities, and accordingly
    be able to compare their characteristics. The maximum benefit of this system is
    when all the incorporated parameters are measured in near real time through the
    field devices, but as mentioned before, not all parameters have commercially available
    MEMS sensors to measure them. Some parameters are still measured by handheld devices
    or through laboratory analysis of soil samples, and their values are then entered
    into the system manually, for example, through spreadsheets, for use in analysis
    with continuous data received from the field nodes. Referring to the “Measuring
    and transmission technologies” section, the sensor nodes deployed in the field
    will be LoRaWAN end devices of “class A,” each containing the four sensor types
    which measure the indicated real-time parameters. As outlined above, the equation
    used to calculate a soil quality index can be modified by omitting some parameters
    and modifying the exponent accordingly by decreasing its denominator by the number
    of omitted parameters. Thus, besides having one type of node containing all the
    sensors that are included in the analysis, there can be three types of nodes according
    to the embedded sensors used separately: Type1 sensor node which is a fertility
    sensing node containing soil NPK sensor, Type2 sensor node which is a physical
    property–sensing node containing tilt sensor and acoustic sensors, and Type3 sensor
    node which is a chemical/physical property–sensing node containing soil nutrient
    sensor. The system is designed and configured to receive all values included in
    the LSA equation in the sensor node message payload, the actually sensed parameters
    will have values, and the unsensed parameters are marked with NULL. The parameters
    manually entered into the system are retrieved from the corresponding table, and
    likewise, NULL values are ignored in analysis calculations. The sampling frequency
    is the same for all sensors in a single node and can be configured remotely. Whenever
    a new message is received from a node, its measured sensors’ data is stored in
    the appropriate tables accompanied by the reception time and date. The last record
    of each node is treated as the recent data from this node, while the system service
    that will be mentioned later “Nodes Status Monitoring panel” alerts if a node
    ceased sending for a specified time. Thanks to the long LoRa range, the star-of-stars
    topology is satisfactory to such a system; any node deployed in a plot of agricultural
    land can reach a gateway deployed anywhere within that plot or beyond. Taking
    into account its minimum communication range, it can be said that an outdoor LoRa
    gateway, which costs an average of $600, can serve a circular area equal to more
    than 18,000 feddan. The appropriate number of nodes for a given field can be determined
    depending on the soil sampling scheme used. For example, if grid sampling is used,
    at least one node might be placed in the center of the cell or at a random position
    within the cell. The approximate price range for the soil NPK–integrated sensor
    is $28–95, and the price of the 4-in-1 soil nutrient–integrated sensor is $51.
    The tilt and acoustic sensors are cheaper especially when a quantity is purchased.
    A microcontroller board with a LoRa transceiver costs about $20. The sensor node
    contains other components such as a GPS module and batteries. Taking this into
    consideration, it can be said that the cost of such a sensing station containing
    all the sensors is no more than $340. As mentioned above, the system use case
    model is adapted to the fact that some phenomena still do not have corresponding
    MEMS sensors, the flexibility required in modeling soil quality indices, different
    types of sensors, different sampling frequencies of nodes, the possibility of
    one or more devices stopping transmission, and different measurement scales by
    mapping the parameter values to a specific set of factor scores provided by the
    land suitability assessment model as will be illustrated later. The static view
    of the system The topology for the system hardware and artifacts is summarized
    in the UML deployment diagram depicted in Fig. 9 which shows the system nodes
    including a central physical server consisting of back-end and front-end artifacts.
    The core of the back end is the Node.js application which loads the modules required
    for the server functionalities, mainly, the Express web service, the Nodemailer
    for email sending, and PostgreSQL client modules for connection to the PostgreSQL
    database with a specified connection configuration. The back-end works as an MQTT
    server as well as an MQTT client; the back-end MQTT client connects to the MQTT
    server using the MQTT protocol. Likewise, the system nodes include instances for
    user devices which connect to the system back end through HTTP and WebSocket,
    and instances for the IoT devices in different farms represented by MQTT clients
    reside on the sensor actuator nodes or on a base station which sends the data
    of the sensor actuator nodes on behalf of them, forwards the configuration, and
    commands messages to them. Fig. 9 Deployment diagram of the proposed system Full
    size image The dynamic view of the system In the following, the dynamic behavior
    of the system will be modeled, starting by describing the functionalities and
    the high-level design requirements of the system including actors influenced by
    the use case diagram in Fig. 10. There are about thirty-eight use cases and seven
    actors associated by different relationships. The administrator and normal user
    actors are generalized to their parent actor, the Internet user, and they are
    associated with use cases specific to their roles with two levels of privileges
    that require successful system login. The functionality of the “Open landing page
    and browse App website” use case is extended by some other supplemental use cases,
    and they communicate with the server application. The behavioral diagrams in the
    subsequent discussion describe the implementation of these use cases from different
    aspects. Fig. 10 The proposed system use case diagram Full size image The land
    suitability index, LS, is computed based on three thematic indices: fertility
    quality index, FQI; chemical quality index, CQI; and physical quality index, PQI,
    from Eq. (2): $${\\text{LS}}=\\mathrm{FQI }\\times \\mathrm{CQI }\\times {\\text{PQI}}$$
    (2) The selection of parameters that affect each index is based on the growth
    requirement of the crop. Each index is calculated by multiplying factor scores
    for each affecting parameter and then raising the product to a power equal to
    the reciprocal of the number of factors. The numerical rating of the parameter
    factor scores is based on experts’ suggestions and a review of the literature.
    The FQI, CQI, and PQI are computed from Eqs. (3)–(5), and as mentioned before,
    some of the parameters involved in the computation of each index can be omitted
    and the equation modified accordingly. Based on the value of LS, the land suitability
    class is determined according to the used suitability rating classification to
    unclassified, highly suitable, moderately suitable, marginally suitable, and unsuitable.
    $${\\text{FQI}}={\\left({S}_{{\\text{N}}}\\times {S}_{{\\text{P}}}\\times {S}_{{\\text{K}}}\\times
    {S}_{{\\text{zn}}}{\\times S}_{{\\text{OM}}}\\right)}^\\frac{1}{5}$$ (3) $${\\text{CQI}}={\\left({S}_{{\\text{S}}}\\times
    {S}_{{\\text{ESP}}}\\times {S}_{{\\text{CaCo}}3}\\times {S}_{{\\text{PH}}}\\right)}^\\frac{1}{4}$$
    (4) $${\\text{PQI}}={\\left({S}_{{\\text{R}}}\\times {S}_{{\\text{T}}}\\times
    {S}_{{\\text{D}}}\\times {S}_{{\\text{F}}}{\\times S}_{{\\text{Y}}}{\\times S}_{{\\text{HP}}}{\\times
    S}_{{\\text{G}}}{\\times S}_{{\\text{WHC}}}\\right)}^\\frac{1}{8}$$ (5) Before
    delving deeper into describing the interactive behavior of the system, it is worth
    introducing the stored data, the tables, and relational diagrams; Fig. 11 shows
    the system database schema. Each of the three tables allNodesData, labParameters,
    and lastRecords contains the values of the field phenomena: allNodesData stores
    all the records of real-time values that come directly from the field corresponding
    to all the nodes deployed in any registered land, and in addition to that, the
    table record stores the soil quality indices computed in terms of its fields’
    values. The table labParameters contains the values of the phenomena determined
    by on-site measurement or laboratory analysis of soil samples corresponding to
    all the nodes deployed in all the registered land, and these values are inputted
    into the system manually. The table lastRecords stores only the last record of
    each node of its real-time, lab, and computed parameters. The registeredFields
    table stores the registered land information. The two tables allEvents and Conditions
    are related to storing the tested event specifications. The Factors table is dedicated
    to storing numerical rating of factor scores to facilitate changing this rating
    according to the crop and the suitability assessment purpose. The rating scheme
    can be expressed as follows: for parameter x, the factor score is s1 if x < low
    bound, s2 if x \\(\\in\\) [low bound, intermediate limit], s3 if x \\(\\in\\)
    [intermediate limit, high bound], and s4 if x > high bound, where the bounds of
    these ranges are numerical values. In another possibility, in which x takes a
    discrete value represents a code corresponding to a textual description of x,
    for example, the soil texture can be SiC, silty clay; SiCL, silty clay loam; and/or
    CL, clay loam, expressed as numerical codes of 1, 2, and 3, and in this case,
    the range is an array of numerical codes that describe the parameter value. Fig.
    11 The proposed system database schema Full size image The Factors table stores
    the scheme through fields that identify the parameter, the range type whether
    numerical range or array of discrete values, and fields that identify the bounds
    of a numerical range, while the codes array is stored in the range_Minimum field,
    and field for storing the factor score. Data dictionaries for additional explanation
    of database schema tables are available in the Appendix. The pseudocode in Fig.
    12 represents the computation of the three quality indices. The computation of
    the indices begins when a data message is received from a node by fetching the
    values of all parameters of this node from the table that is dedicated to storing
    the laboratory values. The considered value of each parameter is its fetched value
    if it is not NULL; otherwise, it takes its value from the received massage whether
    a numerical value or NULL. The pseudocode then illustrates the computation of
    the CQI as an example of an index computation. The code loops through the parameters
    influencing CQI and uses the Factors table to determine these parameters’ factor
    scores. The If statement in line 37 checks the range type whether it is a numerical
    range of the low bound only, a numerical range of the high bound only, a codes
    array, or a numerical range of two limits, and then, it makes the appropriate
    test to see if the parameter value falls within the range. Then, it considers
    the factor scores of the parameters in the computation only if it is not NULL
    and modifies the exponent accordingly. Fig. 12 Pseudocode for land quality indices

    diagram for the proposed system Full size image The Events and Actions settings
    service includes transactions among three objects shown in Fig. 12. They are the
    user browser which controls the front-end content of the system, the server-side,
    and the database. The browser or the front-end code sends the HTTP GET request
    to the server to retrieve the Events and Actions settings webpage and sends HTTP
    POST requests with the data of a newly formulated event or the data of existing
    event(s) to be ignored. The server-side responds to these requests by doing the
    required interactions with the database to add or ignore the specified events
    and by rendering and sending the requested page with the appropriate local variables
    or sending the login page if the authentication failed. All the front-end pages
    use an established WebSocket connection between the sever and the browser to receive
    the Alert event. The Mapping service transactions which are described in Fig.
    14 include POST requests to add and ignore lands and the associated database manipulation
    statements. The server-side continuously updates the GeoJSON representation of
    the lands’ data, and the Mapping page periodically gets this data to display it
    on the map. In the Virtual Coordinates Spatial Analysis service, Fig. 15, the
    WebSocket connection is used for listening to the Spatial Analysis Update event
    issued by the server periodically to send the updated data of the parameter considered
    for the analysis. The browser can post new settings of the 3D plot to be considered
    by the server when computing the subsequent plot parameter data. The sequence
    charts of the three services aggregated to the Real-time Data Visualization service
    are shown in Figs. 16, 17, and 18. They mainly depend on event-based transactions
    between the browser and the server. The Historical Data Visualization as shown
    in Fig. 19 includes a POST request for historical data retrieval from the database
    containing the primitives for fetching and preparing the data, upon which the
    server follows these primitives and submits the result back to the browser through
    event-based communication. The IoT massaging–related interactions and topic tree
    are shown in Figs. 20 and 21, respectively. The MQTT client of the server-side
    subscribes to the data channels of all the registered lands, while the IoT devices
    in each land publish data through the land data channel. On the contrary, IoT
    devices play the role of subscribers but to the channels of the application commands,
    while the server plays the role of publisher that publishes its commands to the
    devices through these channels. These interactions entail other transactions with
    the database, the browser, and the mail server. The different states and state
    transitions accompanied by the system can be summarized by the server-side lifetime
    conditions as depicted in Fig. 22. The server always is in the listening state
    on the system communication ports, and in the event of receiving a request through
    them, it transits to the processing state of the received request. Three timers
    control the server operations, two always-on timers: one of them is for periodically
    checking all the deployed node status and the other one is for periodically checking
    the saved events to detect if one of them is realized. The third timer is for
    periodically updating the virtual coordinates spatial analysis plot, and it is
    always on only if this service is enabled by a POST request. All the states have
    a transition to the final state in the event of a server shutdown, but it is not
    indicated completely in the figure for clarity and simplicity. The flow of some
    of the system operations and the system’s different function implementation details
    are described in the following activity diagrams. Figure 23 describes the node
    status check flow of operations, while Fig. 24 describes the implementation of
    the event checking activities, and the details of the handle_event(event id) function
    are further described in Fig. 25. Fig. 23 Node status checking activity diagram

    Full size image Results This section contains the results of validating the selected
    technologies and the system functionalities with respect to its IoT use case specification
    through a small-scale implementation. The validated functionalities are developing
    a functional Node.js back end, developing an interactive front-end webpage that
    sends the user inputs, issuing events to the back end, and receiving issued events
    from the back end, and a functional PostgreSQL implementation can be used to store
    and retrieve data, an IoT publish/subscribe valid connection from an Internet
    IoT device to the server and the display of its data in real time, and finally,
    the spatial analysis functions of the digital map. IoT real-time connection validation
    An interactive webpage is developed to display the data sent by remote devices
    immediately as it arrives in tabular and graph forms (Fig. 26a). The webpage uses
    HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the EJS templating language to embed JavaScript into
    HTML templates to implement the dynamic table from the list of items sent by the
    server to the webpage when rendering it and the CanvasJS Charting Library to implement
    the dynamic graphs. The MQTT library is used for implementing the publish/subscribe
    interaction, and the Socket.io library is used to enable the real-time web app
    service for updating the graphs. The Eclipse Paho client library is used for implementing
    a remote device. Fig. 26 The interactive webpage to test real-time data display

    Full size image In this validation example, the “mqtt://broker.hivemq.com” public
    broker is used, where the remote devices Node1 and Node2 are connected to it and
    publish their data to the topics “Node1/data” and “Node2/data,” respectively.
    As the server subscribes to these two topics, it receives the data sent through
    them. Figure 26b shows the tables and the graphs as they are updated with Node1
    and Node2 data that is immediately sent by the server via issuing UpdateGraph
    events. Node2 is subscribed to the topic “cmds/sprinkler1/status,” the server
    publishes to this topic a payload “Open” to command the node to open the sprinkler
    if the node temperature value becomes greater than 20 and the sprinkler is currently
    closed, and in a similar way, it publishes to this topic a payload “Close” to
    command the node to close the sprinkler if the node temperature value becomes
    less than 10 and the sprinkler is currently opened. Figure 27 shows that when
    the temperature of Node2 fell below 10 and the sprinkler was in the Open status,
    the server sent the Close commend which was successfully received by the node
    as indicated by the message “*****Closed *****.” Fig. 27 The bidirectional IoT
    connection test Full size image Form input and database retrieval validation A
    database table was constructed to store the data of the IoT devices. A webpage
    (Fig. 28) was developed to submit the specification of the data that the user
    wants to retrieve from the table. The server fetches the required data and emits
    an event with it to the webpage where it is displayed in the graph. Fig. 28 Webpage

    Full size image Spatial analysis functionality validation Mapbox and turf library
    were employed to perform the spatial analysis. Two methods were implemented: in
    the first one, the required phenomenon values of sample data points from a study
    region (the region appears in Fig. 29a) and the “turf.interpolate” were used to
    generate a grid of values covering the whole study region. Then, the number of
    zones and breaks/ranges for the zones values were determined to be four zones
    with breaks [8,10,16,20,30], and the “turf.isobands” was used to draw the isobands
    that represent the different zones (the different specified ranges of the interpolated
    grid points’ values) as shown in Fig. 29b. Then, the isobands were cut to fit
    the area of the study region as shown in Fig. 29c, where the Mapbox Draw tools
    were used to delineate the study region boundary. Fig. 29 The spatial analysis
    result using Mapbox and turf library. a The study area, b the computed isoband
    fit the Bounding Box of the study region, c the isoband fit the area of the study
    region Full size image In another method, the spatial analysis can be performed
    using the K-means algorithm using turf.clustersKmeans on the interpolated grid
    values of sample data points. Figure 30 represents another area shape of a study
    region; here, the numberOfClusters was specified to be seven. As shown in Fig.
    30, the algorithm clustered the data into seven clusters: (1) Cluster0: min value

    paper is about a software solution acting as a part of a complete end-to-end software
    and hardware system for a farm enterprise. Figure 31 summarizes the work done
    in this paper in graphical form. Fig. 31 Graphical abstract of the proposed solution
    Full size image Technology-wise, the solution represents an IoT Web App; application-wise,
    the solution is mainly a land suitability assessment tool for environmental and
    agricultural production sustainability; market-wise, it can be considered an enterprise-scale
    field monitoring and mapping software product. The IoT use case is formulated
    taking all of these three aspects into account. Starting application-wise, we
    turned to the agricultural experts to find out their recommendations on a specific
    important agricultural aspect that needs to be digitally transformed and performed
    smarter, and the choice fell on the land suitability assessment process. As a
    product, estimating its market size helps in identifying whether such a system
    really has potential customers and whether it is expected for it to succeed and
    sustain. The precision agriculture market is segmented into seven application
    types; as shown in Fig. 32, the yield monitoring and field mapping applications
    are on and expected to remain on the throne of revenue generation. Likewise, as
    shown in Fig. 33, the market share of software occupies the second rank in the
    precision agriculture market offerings, and it is expected to increase. Fig. 32

    Full size image As previously mentioned, the system’s potential customers are
    owners of large private farms, government for large-area state-owned agricultural
    lands, and scientists in the field of agricultural and soil applications. These
    customers need to take precision decisions on land use and management, decrease
    field trips, save time and effort, decrease labor costs, prevent the waste of
    agricultural inputs, monitor the field with a high spatial–temporal resolution,
    decrease human errors in measurements and analysis, model agricultural operations
    based on experts’ knowledge, control their farm equipment and conditions remotely,
    improve crop quality and size, increase profits, preserve the environment, etc.
    At this time, the system use case can be narrated. The features of the proposed
    design are selected to meet these needs and add value in a way that increases
    the chance of the system to become effective and to gain a competitive advantage.
    The system is designed not to depend on the human factor in taking readings and
    analysis; it is prepared to communicate with the smart devices in the field and
    take readings from them directly, store the data, and process it based on the
    experts’ models of spatial analysis. In addition to that, it also allows for data
    input from humans. The spatial analysis and land suitability assessment maps are
    produced automatically in real time and from historical data. Based on these maps,
    the users can compare lands and differentiate the application of agricultural
    inputs to different regions of the land according to their real need. Regardless
    of the main purpose of the system, its proposed design augments it with other
    features that generally meet the need and satisfy the customers of the market
    segments related to the system, such as remote control, detections and alarms,
    and spatial analysis using virtual coordinates. A good feature of the proposed
    system is its ability to interoperate with governmental initiatives and regional/international
    spatial data infrastructures. Every country has a land cadastre database, which
    stores cadastral information and metadata for its agricultural lands such as unique
    identification, owner information, area, location, boundaries, soil quality characteristics,
    irrigation system, and crops. This information can be used by interested governmental
    or non-governmental entities, with appropriate authorization privileges, to improve
    the land-use analysis and thus achieve sustainable land management. Recently,
    many countries, including Egypt, have turned to digital transformation and developed
    strategies for it, including, as an important part, the automation of the land
    cadastre database. Egypt is working to automate the agricultural tenure system
    and build a comprehensive and integrated geographic database on agricultural tenure,
    land cadastre, and related activities at the republic level, which will lead to
    the integration of geographic data for government agencies and the ease of exchanging,
    displaying and analyzing information and preparing future plans through establishing
    a national center for spatial data. The establishment of this center would ensure
    the provision and availability of a base map for all sectors of the state, with
    the aim of raising the efficiency of planning decisions, providing cooperation
    and coordination in implementing policies and foundations of uses, and facilitating
    the sharing and exchange of information between government agencies. Assuming
    that the local land cadastre database follows the international standard (Land
    Administration Domain Model (LADM)) in its implementation, the National Center
    for Spatial Data is the source of the data related to the two packages: Party
    and Administrative. The proposed system is related to the Spatial Unit package
    and its sub-package Representation and Survey, and in addition, the model can
    be extended by associating classes related to land suitability indices. The system
    will be the source of the spatial and soil-related data. The connection of the
    system to the local land cadastre database can be through a remote database connection
    or through an MQTT connection. The second option is preferred for several reasons,
    such as bandwidth, security, and loose coupling, and can be implemented by integrating
    the local land cadastre database with an MQTT client. The system topic tree will
    be expanded to include a topic, under the land code level, related to land suitability
    indices. The MQTT client of the database system subscribes to this topic for all
    the registered lands in the proposed system, while the MQTT client in the proposed
    system back end publishes this topic periodically for all lands. The published
    data can be the land suitability assessment map itself. This requires the database
    system to securely maintain land codes associated with the corresponding land
    data and also requires an update in the MQTT server access control list (ACL)
    for restricting the subscription to these topics to the MQTT client of the local
    land cadastre database and the publication on each of these topic to the relevant
    land, where the client ID of each land represents its land code. This is of course,
    in addition to the existing rules that restrict the subscription/publication between
    the proposed system back end and the MQTT clients of the lands. Through the standard
    format that the local database follows, external databases can connect to it and
    access its stored data based on the established database authorization rules.
    The technology-wise design entails selecting the IoT enabling technologies and
    tools and before that putting the criteria upon which the selection will be made.
    The process followed in developing the proposed IoT system can be summarized and
    generalized as shown in Fig. 34. Fig. 34 Generalized IoT software development
    process for farm enterprise Full size image Another important matter that cannot
    be overlooked and is crucial for satisfying the needs of such enterprise-scale
    IoT system customers is ensuring accurate readings of the IoT devices. Ensuring
    and improving sensor data quality can be done in several stages and forms. During
    device design, sensors can be calibrated by comparing the sensor reading to a
    standard value. The accuracy and precision of readings can be improved through
    the calibration process by adjusting the design, including the sensor settings,
    and using appropriate filters to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, until acceptable
    accuracy is achieved. It is recommended to perform the calibration over the full
    range of the sensor reading and in different environmental conditions. Also, periodic
    recalibration is recommended to tackle the drift of sensor readings over time.
    Continuous monitoring together with using appropriate validation methods of sensor
    readings is important to ensure data accuracy and precision. The aim of validation
    is to detect device malfunction and anomalies in devices’ readings such as bias,
    dropout, and outliers. The number of published literature on the topic of designing
    software systems for land suitability assessment, soil spatial analysis, and management
    zone delineation is not considered many. Some rely entirely on manual input, and
    others exploit the embedded system and web technologies to automate and improve
    some processes done manually in the commercial geospatial processing programs
    that were not specifically developed for agricultural applications, but they have
    not exploited the IoT technology. A sample of previous work will be discussed
    below. The research by de Freitas Coelho et al., (2018) proposed an embedded system
    consisting of a single-board computer and sensors and running an application developed
    using Python and PyQt designed to perform the data analysis immediately after
    data collection, eliminating the need to come back and forth frequently to and
    from the laboratory to collect more data from the field for analysis. The application
    first filters the data through outlier and inlier analysis, then performs kriging
    interpolation, and finally produces and visualizes the spatial analysis map resulting
    from K-means clustering. This system did not benefit from the communication network
    technology, as the readings are taken manually and through a single device, which
    adds effort and time consumption until a single collection of field data is completed
    and makes it unsuitable for large-area fields. In addition, the motivation of
    the work which is avoiding the need to return to the field to collect more data
    to tackle problems in the sampling strategy can be addressed by performing the
    analysis done by the proposed system using any PC or laptop in the field. Another
    limitation of the system is the use of collected points in defining the field
    boundaries. The research by Werner et al. (2020) developed a web-based spatial
    analysis application integrated with R language for the statistical and geostatistical
    analysis and creation of thematic maps. It offers generating the maps using both
    inverse distance weighting and kriging methods. The application automates some
    processes such as fitting the best model for a semivariogram. Sample data was
    used to validate and calibrate the application output with ArcMap. The work describes
    the application software layer that provides a friendly interface to the user
    but generates grayscale maps. A software system for multi-criteria LSA for different
    types of cultivating crops in tropical and subtropical regions was proposed by
    Elsheikh et al. (2013). It offers the ability to add a new type of crop by adding
    a new record to the crop records. It is built using GIS Model Builder, Python
    scripts, and Visual Basic and uses attribute tables and digital mapping with GIS
    capabilities to display the output upon which the decision-makers build their
    decisions. The outputs were validated by subjective comparison based on knowledge
    of whether the crop was already grown on the land assessed, and expert judgments
    were also consulted to validate the outputs. The research by Kang et al. (2012)
    addressed the use of IoT technologies for zone management delineation. It does
    not go beyond a conceptual model that specifies the possible architecture and
    usage of such a system. Postolache et al. (2023) found that there is no large-scale
    or commercially available IoT system for horticulture and then proposed an IoT-based
    system for soil fertility evaluation in horticultural farms to aid in detecting
    plant stress and improve irrigation and fertilization decision process which needs
    not only the current value of soil nutrient but the historical nutrient data.
    The sensing nodes sense some soil and climate parameters and use Wi-Fi or LoRa
    for communication. The sensed parameters are soil moisture, pH, and N, P, K, relative
    humidity, and temperature and it offers plug-and-play sensor extension. The system
    contains a mobile application used to visualize measurement data points, as well
    as graphs of the time change in parameter value. The sensibility of the sensors
    and the functionality of the system were tested. In Martis et al.’s (2022) study,
    machine learning enabled an IoT platform to predict a crop suitable for the Kharif
    and Rabi seasons for cultivation. The prediction model was trained with different
    datasets and used to perform time-invariant classification. The system also provides
    suggestions to enhance soil fertility. The system is composed of end device sense
    N, P, K, EC, and pH; a relay unit is used to collect and convey data in a prespecified
    frame format using MQTT, and the communication between devices is through Wi-Fi
    and LoRa; and an intelligence unit runs the machine-level algorithms as a service
    on Dual Intel Xeon. From the prediction results, a rule-based recommendation system
    was designed to specify the best soil treatment. Table 3 infers specific characteristics
    of these works compared to the proposed system. Table 3 Comparison between the
    proposed system and previous work Full size table Conclusion and future work This
    paper presents the development of a conceptual design of a dynamic system that
    accommodates the spatial–temporal dynamics of the agricultural soil characteristics
    to realize a land suitability assessment (LSA) based on the factor analysis method.
    The IoT-based LSA software system is built using other enabling technologies.
    It utilizes web development to augment the system with a user-friendly interface
    that can be opened by any browser from anywhere. The system uses the database
    technology to store the raw and processed field data. Furthermore, the system
    uses digital mapping toolboxes to manage the geographic information of the agricultural
    fields and the data layers of their sensed data. The paper reviewed the recent
    trends in the system-enabling technologies and the selection of the approaches
    that were used to design and implement the proposed system. A vanilla JavaScript
    front end with some libraries for providing some functionalities communicates
    with a Node.js back-end through HTTP methods and WebSocket communication. The
    Node.js application deploys modules for the web server, MQTT client, and server;
    it communicates with the devices deployed in the field using the MQTT protocol
    and communicates with the PostgreSQL database. The device tier of this IoT system
    contains “class A” LoRaWAN end devices that are deployed according to the soil
    sampling method used, with a LoRaWAN gateway serving a circular area of at least
    18,000 feddan through star-of-stars topology. The node contains a LoRa transceiver
    and four sensors to measure soil parameters N, P, K, S, WHC, D, PH, T, and F,
    and furthermore, it contains a GPS module to assign geospatial positioning information
    to the sensed data. Depending on the sensors integrated into the node, three types
    of nodes can be produced: the first one contains the soil NPK sensor that senses
    soil fertility parameters, the second one contains the tilt sensor and acoustic
    sensor that sense some soil physical properties, and the third one contains the
    soil nutrient sensor that senses some soil chemical and physical properties. These
    different types of nodes add the possibility of eliminating the involvement of
    some parameters in the analysis and reducing the cost of the solution. Message
    sequence charts, deployment, use case, activity diagrams, database schema, and
    topic tree are used to describe the static and dynamic views of the system design.
    The paper validates only the functionality of the selected technologies with a
    small-scale implementation example. Referring to the description of the proposed
    system, the discussed previous related work, and Table 3, it can be concluded
    that the proposed system is the only system that benefits from the IoT technology
    and offers the LSA together with spatial analysis and prescription map generation
    facilities at large-scale areas. The proposed work is the only work that augmented
    the system design description with a survey of possible implementation technologies
    before making selections based on criteria; the design is also augmented by reproducible
    standard visual modeling. The proposed system offers some additional functionality
    which can be described as a powerful precision agriculture software and not a
    dedicated program to perform specific functions. The sketched generalized IoT
    software development process for farm enterprises is also considered a contribution
    of this work. On the other hand, we find that the system has some shortcomings,
    such as not performing filtration or any preparation of the raw data first before
    storing and processing it. Regarding the system cost, the IoT technology in general
    is expensive, but what matters are the benefits resulting from its application
    and the payback period of each specific use case. The work in this paper is dedicated
    to the low-level software layer of the system use case and the selected technologies,
    and implemented functionalities have been validated. Other systems have calibrated
    the results with real data as they feature a complete system including an implementation
    of a web or mobile application. The application software layer of the proposed
    system is addressed in Mohammad EL-Basioni et al.’s (2022) study, where the system
    output is calibrated with real data. In summary, the work in this paper represents
    the specification of a low-level software layer of an IoT-based system for a use
    case not considered before and has advantages over similar previous work. The
    proposed design needs enhancements to represent channels for future work. It is
    better to provide different options for interpolation methods; it is better to
    provide different options for LSA methods; while maintaining the advantage of
    being able to set different crop criteria, it is necessary to support more than
    one crop at the same time; and a complete implementation of this generalized system
    with large-scale real experiments, accompanied by recording, analyzing, and discussing
    the results to assess the real impact of the system, needs to be addressed further.

    recent developments and future challenges Article Open access 02 June 2022 1 Introduction
    Today, with the increase in agricultural production to meet the growing needs
    of the population, concern has been raised about food supply for the people [1].
    Pollution of water, soil, air, soil erosion, resistance of pests to poisons and
    the spread of chemical fertilizers have caused us to go back to the past ways
    of farming in order to preserve resources. Agriculture, which in any case is low
    yield, is looking after the future health of mankind. According to the forecasts,
    the world population will reach 2.8 billion people by 2025, 83% of which belong
    to developing countries and 17% to developed countries [2, 3]. As the population
    density increases, the effects of competition increase in the same proportion.
    More population means more energy consumption and environmental pollution. In
    addition, the increase in demand for food resources leads to excessive use of
    resources, exhaustion, destruction, destruction of natural resources and reduction
    of biodiversity [4]. In many parts of the world, there is no additional land,
    and in other parts, increasing the area under the cultivation of crops is not
    acceptable from the environmental and social aspects [5]. Therefore, in order
    to increase the production in the existing fields, we need a suitable plant protection
    program against damage before and after harvest. One of the most important problems
    that have been associated with agriculture since its inception are agricultural
    pests. In general, we cannot completely eradicate agricultural pests, but we must
    manage them. Any living or non-living factor that causes economic damage to humans,
    animals or products is classified as a pest [6, 7]. One of the main reasons for
    the expansion of agriculture is the production of products with the highest efficiency
    [8]. The farmer must be able to protect the crop from agricultural pests for high
    yield. By applying simple methods, damage from pests and diseases can be prevented
    or minimized. One of the goals of organic farming is that, in addition to having
    healthy production without complications caused by chemical fertilizers and poisons,
    it can also have a quantitatively justifiable yield [9]. Environmentally friendly
    control technologies include those that use physical control agents such as light,
    heat, and mild radiation to control diseases and insect pests [10, 11]. Ozone
    is a very strong oxidizer that has the potential to kill harmful insects and microorganisms
    [12]. In general, ozone has more advantages than traditional food preservation
    methods and is a suitable alternative to traditional insecticides. Ozone can be
    used to destroy storage pests, microorganisms and mycotoxins [1]. One of the important
    advantages of ozone is the rapid decomposition of its residue into oxygen, so
    no trace of it remains on the products. Meanwhile, the use of ozone gas should
    not exceed a certain threshold, as studies have shown that longer exposure times
    are more effective than ozone concentrations [3]. In recent years, many studies
    recommend the use of ozone gas to control pests and diseases in the agricultural
    industry. In [13], the effects of ozone fungicides on common fungal pathogens
    have been analyzed. Here, the effectiveness of ozone as a disinfectant has been
    demonstrated after the completion of a fungal culture cycle. In [14], the effects
    of ozone water spray on cucumber leaves with severe infection have been evaluated.
    The results of this research showed that ozone water is a partial substitute for
    chemical fungicides and can treat cucumber leaves. In [15], the use of ozone water
    in greenhouse soil disinfection is investigated. The results of this research
    showed that ozone water has a good reducing effect on soil microorganisms and
    nematodes without producing harmful side products. In [16], the inactivation of
    Meloidogyne enterotoxin eggs has been carried out using ozone treatment. The results
    of this research showed that this method significantly reduces the contamination
    of tomato products caused by plant parasitic nematodes. In [15], the effect of
    irrigation with ozonated water on the microbial community has been investigated.
    This work has been done on agricultural physiology in a Mediterranean soil and
    the results show that biomass can reduce bacteria and fungi with intermittent
    irrigation by ozonated water. Light traps attract certain insects and are widely
    used to monitor moths [17]. By using optical traps, they can better control moth
    populations compared to funnel traps. These traps contain two pheromone chambers
    and a lamp, which is a special wavelength light to attract pests [18, 19]. Chemical
    attractants or pheromones may only attract certain species. Using light traps
    at night is very effective to trap the population of this pest. These tools emit
    ultraviolet light, which is called black light [20]. This light is absorbent for
    insects such as flies and moths, and thus an insect that is drawn into the trap
    dies either due to electric discharge or due to falling on a sticky screen [21].
    Recent works recommend the use of optical traps to control pests and diseases
    in the agricultural industry. In [22], a different spectral peak lamp is proposed
    to kill insects at night. Here, a multispectral rotating solar insecticidal lamp
    is developed for rice pest control. In [23], a light source using light emitting
    diode chips is designed that can take into account the differences between different
    insect species. Here, the phototactic response to narrow-wavelength diverse light
    is applied among insects. In [24], a smart lamp was designed to monitor the insect
    population, which has the ability to deal with insect pests. In [25], the control
    range and control effect of an insecticidal lamp on the Asian corn borer are investigated.
    This lamp shows that the effective control distance to the Asian corn borer is
    approximately 60 m and the control area is about 1.1 mm. In [26], the control
    of brown pots has been done by optical traps. The results of this research show
    that a light trap kills millions of destructive brown planthoppers every night.
    The concept of Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the connection of a set of objects,
    devices, humans, animals and machines, in which all elements can communicate with
    other elements [27]. In fact, IoT is a connected network consisting of several
    entities that has been able to integrate and integrate the physical and cyber
    worlds with the addition of data processing capabilities and artificial intelligence.
    With the advent of IoT and digital transformation, it is possible to intelligently
    control soil moisture, monitoring the growth of products, as well as preventive
    measures to detect pests [28]. The use of this technology allows access to smart
    agriculture. Remote management of agricultural activities with new technologies
    is a new field for research activities. Plant pests cause the loss of production,
    and this issue is a fundamental problem in many developing countries, bringing
    with it many political, social and economic crises. In recent years, with the
    growth of IoT, hopes have been created for realizing smart agriculture and improving
    the quality and volume of agricultural inputs. In this study, light trap, ozone
    sterilization, and IoT are used to design a system to control insect pests and
    plant diseases. Here, IoT-based wireless sensors are used to collect information
    from the environment. Based on the information received from IoT sensors, a fuzzy
    based routing method is applied to send information. Finally, an IoT-based information
    management system is used to remotely control plant protection devices. The main
    contribution of this paper is as follows: Designing two types of plant preservation
    devices in order to remove chemical toxins during product production: one for
    use in facilities by ozone sterilization and the other for use in farms by light
    trap. Development of a fuzzy-based routing method for energy-aware information
    transfer between IoT sensors Designing an IoT-based information management system
    for remote system control The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section.
    2 introduces plant protection devices. Section 3 is related to the implementation
    process and system performance evaluation. A discussion of the system is given
    in Sect. 4. Finally, the paper ends with conclusions. 2 Architecture and devices
    This section is dedicated to introducing system architecture and devices used
    for plant protection. In addition, in this section, we discuss the details of
    the mobile application and information management system. 2.1 System architecture
    The proposed system for controlling insect pests and plant diseases in the plantation
    includes four parts: plant protection devices, data center, information management
    system, and information transmission unit. Figure 1 shows an overview of the system.
    Here, plant protection devices include field insecticidal plant protection device
    and facility plant protection device. These devices can transfer information to
    the data center using a wireless transmission network. The information management
    system communicates with the data center in real time. This system analyzes the
    information collected by the sensors for quick and intelligent decisions. The
    farmer monitors the growth of crops by remote control of plant protection devices
    and takes preventive measures to detect damages. The mobile application embedded
    in the information management system can apply some real-time settings such as
    the opening of the trap lamp, ozone release, and fan wind speed [28, 29]. According
    to the design, the web-based information management system includes a mobile phone
    application or personal computer application that interacts with the data center.
    In general, all data such as device information, environmental data, and operation
    records are stored in the data center. Fig. 1 Overview of the proposed system
    for pest and disease control in agriculture Full size image As shown in Fig. 2,
    IoT-based system architecture includes four main layers: sensor layer, network
    layer, service management layer, and application layer [30]. Sensor layer In the
    sensor layer, information is received and measured in real time. This layer includes
    sensors, actuators and tags that are connected to each other through a Wireless
    Sensor Network (WSN). WSNs are powerful networks that collect information received
    from sensors with low cost and energy consumption. This network tracks and monitors
    agricultural products through various sensors located in agricultural lands that
    are wirelessly connected and send information automatically. The sensors used
    in this layer have the ability to collect defined parameters for pest and disease
    control through sensing the environment. These sensors have the ability to convert
    analog to digital signals and use radio frequency protocol to transmit information.
    Other sensors in this layer include light intensity sensors, humidity sensors,
    temperature sensors, CO2 sensors, and surveillance cameras. Network layer This
    layer includes the sensor information unit, which is responsible for data processing
    and communication with devices connected to the Internet. Meanwhile, this layer
    can communicate and exchange data with other layers. In fact, in this layer there
    is a Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) modem [31] connected to the
    Internet, which can send the information received from the WSN sensors to the
    information management system in the service management layer. Hence, the data
    analysis in the proposed system is done by the information management system.
    This layer can support the large amount of data generated by wireless sensors
    and smart devices. Therefore, this layer directs the transmission of data and
    information from IoT-connected sensors to the control infrastructure for storage,
    analysis and processing. Service management layer This layer includes some servers
    for processing and storing collected data. The processing and analysis of this
    data leads to decision-making and the provision of appropriate services. These
    decisions are transferred to the application layer so that the user can perform
    the best operation based on them. In this layer, servers receive requests from
    the application layer and then process them and return their results to the application
    layer. General and dedicated support of some domains and applications is another
    task of the service management layer. Also, this layer makes the data structure
    and the meaning that comes from it understandable. The major part of the service
    management layer is in the platforms that are known as cloud computing and provide
    IoT services. The database is implemented in the proposed architecture based on
    Java + Tomcat + Mysql. In addition, a Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) connection
    pool, MyBatis middleware, and other technologies are used to realize the query
    [32, 33]. Application layer This layer is very important as the fourth layer of
    tools related to IoT-based plant protection system. This layer includes an application
    platform that the user (farmer) can view and manage its data. An application can
    be an app or a website that runs through a mobile phone or a personal computer.
    These programs provide access to on-demand services. Meanwhile, these programs
    enable real-time system status monitoring and remote control. Also, the application
    layer allows querying data and executing some predefined functions. Fig. 2 Proposed
    IoT-based system architecture for controlling insect pests and plant diseases
    Full size image 2.2 Plant protection devices Devices used for plant protection
    include light trap and ozone sterilization, which are combined with IoT technology.
    These devices are used to collect environmental data, produce ozone, control circuits
    and manage fan speed. There are two plant protection devices in the proposed system:
    field insecticidal plant protection device and facility plant protection device.
    The facility plant protection device is known as an IoT-based machine for controlling
    insect pests and plant diseases. This device can be used to collect environmental
    data, desensitization, sterilization and auxiliary heating. As shown in Fig. 3,
    the facility plant protection device includes sensors, control function, adjusting
    plate, trap lamp, high-speed fan, ozone generator, and some other modules. We
    installed this device on top of a greenhouse that provided high voltage ozone
    generation capability [33]. Due to the high-speed fan in this device, the ozone
    discharge was spread evenly throughout the greenhouse. The results showed no reproduction
    of viruses and oxidation of fungi and bacteria. Also, due to the presence of yellow
    and blue lights in this device, insects were attracted and killed. Fig. 3 Facility
    plant protection device architecture Full size image The field insecticidal plant
    protection device is known as a solar insecticidal lamp based on IoT. As shown
    in Fig. 4, this device includes sensors, solar power supply, control function,
    data transmission unit and insect killer module. This device uses an insect killer
    module that includes a high-speed large-volume fan, an Light-Emitting Diode (LED)
    lamp and a characteristic spectrum to attract insects [34]. The LED lamp in the
    insecticide module has a control radius of about 60 m. In addition, the field
    insecticidal plant protection device has yellow and blue lights to attract insects.
    It is worth noting that the design of this device is such that it does not cause
    any environmental pollution and is suitable for controlling Lepidoptera pests.
    The field insecticidal plant protection device has the ability to collect environmental
    data such as light intensity, humidity, temperature, and crop growth status in
    real time. These data are sent to the information management system through the
    wireless communication network. One of the advantages of this device is the use
    of a power source based on solar panels, which ensures uninterrupted plant protection
    operations. Fig. 4 Field insecticidal plant protection device architecture Full
    size image 2.3 Hardware control circuit In order to control plant protection devices
    (i.e., field insecticidal plant protection device and facility plant protection
    device), we designed a hardware circuit. This circuit includes device interface,
    communication module, sensor interface, and microprocessor. All parts in this
    circuit are controlled by an STM32F103 ARM microprocessor [35]. All received data
    such as light intensity, humidity and temperature are converted into voltage signals
    by the sensor interface and then these signals are processed by the microprocessor.
    According to the results of these processes, plant protection devices are managed
    and controlled. In this circuit, the microprocessor communicates with other modules
    through the device interface. Also, device interface is used to monitor environmental
    data such as light intensity, humidity and temperature in real time. Here, the
    communication module can automatically send the optimal values for the light intensity
    to the information management system. The control circuit in the communication
    module section is equipped with Wi-Fi, which can guarantee remote data transmission
    through a serial port [36]. For remote data transmission, a Wi-Fi communication
    network is embedded in the communication module, which is equipped with a fuzzy-based
    routing protocol. Also, microprocessor uses device interface to control plant
    protection equipment such as video monitoring module, trap lamp, auxiliary heating
    module, fan module, and ozone generation module. On the other hand, the farmer
    can have real-time control over the entire system through the mobile application.
    Figure 5 shows the hardware control circuit designed to control plant protection
    devices. Fig. 5 Hardware control circuit designed for plant protection devices
    Full size image 2.4 Mobile application and information management system An application
    has been designed so that the farmer can remotely control and monitor field insecticidal
    plant protection and facility plant protection devices. This application is designed
    on the Android platform based on the Java language, where it is possible to use
    it on a personal computer with a website. Among the features of this application
    are fan speed adjustment, lamp replacement, device status adjustment, data collection,
    light control and ozone production. The information management system is designed
    to process and store information for plant protection devices. This system is
    web-based and uses browser/server architecture. The three main modules of this
    system include plant protection data management, equipment management, and user
    management. The plant protection data management module is responsible for querying,
    monitoring and alerting plant protection data. If the situation is detected by
    this module as abnormal, it will study the user through alarms and Short Message
    Service (SMS) on the application. The equipment management module includes operations
    such as system operation logs, equipment distribution, equipment maintenance records,
    and setting basic equipment information. Meanwhile, the user management module
    is responsible for managing user/farmer information such as modify user information,
    set user permissions, and add user information. 2.5 Remote control software As
    mentioned, the farmer can adjust, monitor and control the pest and plant protection
    system in real time using a mobile phone application or website. For example,
    turn trap lamp on/off, collect environmental data, set fan wind speed, and perform
    ozone release. For this, we have designed a software based on a mobile application
    and also a web-based information management system. The mobile application-based
    software provides features such as login interface, device registration interface,
    device operation mode interface, and operating device interface. In this software,
    the login interface can show weather conditions. Also, the device registration
    interface includes crop growth information, working environment and basic equipment
    information, which allows the farmer to register plant protection devices. Meanwhile,
    device operation mode interface provides some settings related to plant protection
    devices such as fan speed, ozone intensity, working time for sterilization, and
    working time for pest control. Finally, the operating device interface in the
    designed software provides the possibility of remote control of plant protection
    devices. The designed web-based information management system mainly includes
    machine hardware information, farmer specifications, environmental data, and operation
    records. This system manages plant protection devices to achieve high efficiency.
    2.6 Energy-aware routing protocol based on fuzzy logic In this study, an automatic
    and low-cost plant protection system based on an intelligent energy-aware routing
    protocol is presented. Here, a fast algorithm for data routing using fuzzy logic
    is implemented on the standard Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol. The advantages
    of this method include the following: improving the routing process and fast transfer
    of data to the user interface program using fuzzy logic approach, reducing the
    energy consumption of sensors by better managing access to resources and reducing
    additional data transfers, and increasing the speed of data access due to the
    use of fuzzy logic in packet routing. The OSPF protocol has the ability to transition
    from IPv4 to IPv6 and uses the Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm for routing
    [35]. It is a bandwidth-based protocol that we improve with a fuzzy system. The
    network topology details are considered as input based on a series of standard
    parameters. The desired network is a WSN topology and includes a series of IoT
    sensor nodes with the ability to send data. At first, the OSPF protocol is launched
    by sending the “Hello” packet and creating the neighbor table. Here, the communication
    status between the sensor nodes is determined by sending the Link State Acknowledgment
    (LSA) packet and the neighborhood table is created. Each node that received the
    LSA updates its neighbor table and sends an LSA packet to other neighboring nodes.
    After that, the SPF algorithm is developed with a fuzzy approach to create the
    routing table for each node. The OSPF protocol updates its neighbor table when
    changes occur in each node. SPF in OSPF generates routing tables with shortest
    paths through network state information [36]. The cost of links in SPF is measured
    based on an interface, where an interface is the inverse of the bandwidth of a
    link. In addition to bandwidth, various factors are important in routing, such
    as node energy and distance. Therefore, to improve the routing process, a fuzzy
    system is developed considering energy, distance and bandwidth parameters. The
    distance is considered based on the average between the distance of the candidate
    node from the current node and the distance of the candidate node from the destination.
    Therefore, the next node in the path with the fuzzy system is determined based
    on these parameters. Here, the source and destination nodes are known and the
    goal is to find other nodes of the route. The steps of the proposed method for
    data routing are shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 6 Steps of the proposed method for data
    routing Full size image Let the network topology consist of \\(N\\) sensor nodes,
    where each node has a limited radio range. Also, the initial energy of all nodes
    is homogeneously equal to \\({E}_{0}\\) Joules, where \\(e_{i} , \\forall i =
    1,2, \\ldots ,N\\) shows the remaining energy of the \\(i\\)-th node. In the process
    of fuzzy routing, \\({node}_{c}\\) is the current node of the route, where it
    is initially set to the source node. In each step, the next \\({node}_{c}\\) is
    selected from among the candidate nodes, i.e., \\(Candid\\left( {node_{c} } \\right)
    = \\left\\{ {node_{j} \\in \\Gamma \\left( {node_{c} } \\right)} \\right\\}\\).
    Here, \\(\\Gamma \\) represents the set of neighboring nodes for a given node.
    A rule-based fuzzy system is used to select a node from \\(Candid\\left( {node_{c}
    } \\right)\\) as the next node in the path. This process is repeated until finally
    the destination node is seen in \\(Candid\\left( {node_{c} } \\right)\\). In the
    designed fuzzy system, the parameters of energy, distance and bandwidth are fuzzified
    based on the trapezoidal fuzzy set. The used trapezoidal phase set is shown in
    Fig. 7. The reasoning behind estimating all parameters is the same. For example,
    we perform fuzzification of the energy parameter (\\(EP\\)) as follows. Meanwhile,
    the output of the fuzzy system is the selection rate of a node as the next node.
    The output value is determined based on the fuzzy rules presented in Table 1,
    which are set by an expert. Here, the membership degree of each input pattern
    is measured using the multiplicative operator. $$ \\mu_{Low} \\left( {EP} \\right)
    = \\left\\{ {\\begin{array}{*{20}l} 0 \\hfill & {if\\;EP \\ge s} \\hfill \\\\

    Table 1 Fuzzy rules for the proposed routing algorithm Full size table Since data
    transmission between adjacent nodes leads to energy loss, we cluster nodes and
    perform routing between clusters. In this process, the central node of each cluster
    is used for data exchange. For the clustering task, we use a model based on Nonnegative
    Matrix Factorization (NMF), which was presented by Jannesari et al. [34]. 3 Performance
    evaluation This section is related to the implementation and performance evaluation
    of IoT-based plant protection devices in the proposed system. 3.1 System implementation
    Plant protection system designed in China is used. This system is widely used
    to control insect pests and plant diseases in crops. For example, this system
    can be used to control the production of products such as rice and cucumber. Figure
    8 shows some actual applications of existing devices in the designed plant protection
    system. Fig. 8 Field and real applications of plant protection devices. a Scenarios
    of field insecticidal plant protection device, and b scenarios of facility plant
    protection device Full size image 3.2 System application The proposed system adjusts
    environmental parameters within optimal limits so that it is not dangerous for
    the environment. Basically, the designed system includes some settings that can
    be applied by the farmer to control the environmental data. Examples of the results
    of strength of illumination (Lx), air humidity (RH), and air temperature (°C)
    are shown in Fig. 9. These results can help the farmer to make decisions. For
    example, the farmer can use this information to better monitor and control diseases
    and pests in real time. Also, based on this data, the farmer can adjust the working
    mode of the plant protection devices in time using the mobile phone application.
    Fig. 9 Environmental data collected by IoT sensors. a Results related to strength
    of illumination, b results related to air humidity, and c results related to air
    temperature Full size image 3.3 Analyzing the effectiveness of plant protection
    system We tested the proposed plant protection system on several crops to investigate
    the effects of insect pests and diseases on plants. In this experiment, five independent
    greenhouses are considered to compare the plant protection system. On each greenhouse,
    we tested three disease control techniques: no treatment, spray chemical pesticides,
    and release of ozone by the proposed system. It is worth noting that other daily
    measures such as fertilizer and water are the same in all five greenhouses. In
    all the greenhouses, we activated the plant protection device from 7 pm to 6 am.
    We monitored the fan air volume and ozone release amount using the mobile app,
    where the fan wind intensity is set to 70% and the ozone release rate is set to
    20%. Five-point sampling technique has been used to evaluate the rate of pest
    and disease observation. According to this technique, disease incidence is equal
    to the ratio of ND (number of diseased leaves) to NT (total number of leaves).
    The results of this experiment for three disease control techniques in five selected
    greenhouses are according to Table 2. Here, the evaluation results for crop species
    such as Cabbage, Celery, Cowpea, Tomato, and Cucumber are given. The results presented
    are based on the average for five greenhouses. The rates of cabbage damping-off,
    gray mold, celery early blight, cowpea gray mold, tomato leaf mold, and cucumber
    powdery mildew with plant protection system was 1.75%, 9.53% 6.36%, 16.71%, and
    12.31% lower than chemical pesticides, respectively. Also, the results show that
    the rate of diseases with ozone has decreased by more than 10% and the rate of
    diseases with chemical pesticides has decreased by less than 2% compared to the
    no treatment scenario. Meanwhile, ozone has no adverse effect on the natural growth
    of crops. Table 2 Efficiency results of three disease control techniques in five
    considered greenhouses Full size table 3.4 Energy consumption analysis To evaluate
    the energy consumption in IoT-based devices, we use the energy consumption model
    according to [37] to send and receive data. According to this model, the amount
    of energy consumption for wireless sensors when sending and receiving data is
    calculated by Eqs. (4) and (5), respectively. $$ E_{tx} \\left( d \\right) = \\left\\{
    {\\begin{array}{*{20}l} {E_{elec} \\times l + \\varepsilon_{fs} \\times l \\times
    d^{2} ,} \\hfill & {d > d_{0} } \\hfill \\\\ {E_{elec} \\times l + \\varepsilon_{mp}
    \\times l \\times d^{4} ,} \\hfill & {d \\le d_{0} } \\hfill \\\\ \\end{array}
    } \\right. $$ (4) $$ E_{rx} = E_{elec} * l $$ (5) where \\(d\\) and \\({d}_{0}\\)
    are the distance and distance threshold (as the maximum power level) between the
    sending and receiving sensors, respectively [38, 39]. \\(E_{tx}\\) indicates the
    energy consumption for the packet sender and \\(E_{rx}\\) indicates the energy
    consumption for the packet receiver. \\(E_{elec}\\) is the energy required to
    send/receive one bit of data, which is considered equal to 50 nJ/bit. \\(l\\)
    Packet size in bytes. Also, \\(\\varepsilon_{mp}\\) and \\(\\varepsilon_{fs}\\)
    are defined as the energy of the amplifier to amplify the signal, which are considered
    equal to 10 pJ/bit/m2 and 0.0013 pJ/bit/m4, respectively [40]. In another experiment,
    we evaluate the performance of the proposed fuzzy-based routing method for energy
    consumption. In this experiment, the total residual energy from all sensors in
    the network is reported after each round of routing. In addition to the proposed
    fuzzy routing method, we measured the energy consumption results of the designed
    system with LEACH and OSPF routing protocols. Figure 10 compares the energy consumption
    results for these methods during 5000 routing rounds. In the first round of simulation,
    the total remaining energy of the sensors is equal to 20 J, where the energy of
    the network decreases with increasing rounds of routing. However, the proposed
    fuzzy method for routing has less energy consumption than LEACH and OSPF protocols.

    size image 4 Discussions The quantitative and qualitative increase in the demand
    for food has multiplied the necessity of moving towards the industrialization
    of agriculture. According to the reports of the Food and Agriculture Organization
    of the United Nations, the food needs of the growing population of the earth in
    2050 will grow by 70% compared to 2006. With the increasing growth of technology
    and with the aim of increasing agricultural productivity, various tools have emerged.
    One of the results of the growth of technology in the agricultural sector is intelligence,
    which can answer part of the problems of this industry. Despite the fact that
    many farmers are unaware of this technology, its application and benefits, but
    the limited use of new technologies plays a very important role in increasing
    production. Meanwhile, the agricultural industry has made significant progress
    in recent years, using communication and information technologies, especially
    IoT. With the use of IoT, farmers can receive relevant information using smartphones
    and the Internet at any time and place. Smart agriculture technology increases
    the yield in the same time and conditions as traditional agriculture. Today, many
    related industries on the way to smart agriculture have used this technology due
    to its obvious features such as saving time, cost and human intervention. The
    work of communication and information technology in the agricultural sector is
    to transfer relevant information to different sectors of this industry. In this
    regard, we developed a routing method based on fuzzy logic, which can transmit
    the information gathered by IoT sensors, taking energy into account. By using
    various wireless sensors and tools, the farmer can quickly access the information
    related to the different stages of production. One of the most important concerns
    of mankind today is the contamination of agricultural soils by various chemical
    pollutants, especially poisons. This issue is one of the important challenges
    of agricultural development and it will potentially face a problem. Meanwhile,
    mankind has turned to the increasing use of chemical fertilizers and poisons in
    order to gain more economic benefits. All agricultural chemicals contain additives
    and although the amount of poison in them is low, they can have destructive effects.
    Therefore, the intelligent management of pesticides in agriculture is a targeted
    system to deal with damage in agricultural lands. In recent years, with the introduction
    of information and communication technologies, the field of pest and disease control
    through alternative methods has been provided. The sensors embedded in this system
    are the basis of intelligent pest and disease control management. Today, ozone
    sterilization and light traps are new techniques to control pests and diseases
    in farms. The advantages of these techniques are: preventing environmental pollution
    and resistance to diseases, implementing the system at any time according to the
    need, not depending on factors such as the amount and variety of toxins, running
    the system for a long time, reducing production costs such as buying pesticides,
    not needing manpower for spraying, simultaneous use of ozone sterilization tools
    and light traps in several places, and the convenience of using the system remotely.
    5 Conclusions Among the methods of pest control, the effects of chemical poisons
    for humans have been revealed, which has had a great impact on disrupting the
    natural balance in agricultural ecosystems. Awareness of the ecosystem and the
    progress made in different methods of pest control will reduce the population
    of pests or their harmful effects tolerable. Due to the high value of agricultural
    products and production costs, pest damage and plant diseases have a higher economic
    value. Hence, farmers are always looking for a decisive fight against these factors.
    In this study, a system for controlling pests and diseases in agricultural crops
    was presented by combining objects, fuzzy logic, light trap and ozone sterilization.
    This system eliminates the need to use chemical poisons during product production
    as much as possible. Real-time information is collected by IoT devices and sent
    to the destination through a path embedded with fuzzy logic. The information management
    system can be used remotely to control the system. Real-time monitoring of diseases
    and pests as well as precise control of ozone concentration are considered as
    future works. Data availability Not applicable. References Dong, Y., Xu, F., Liu,

  description: 'Nowadays, machine learning (ML) has attained a high level of achievement
    in many contexts. Considering the significance of ML in medical and bioinformatics
    owing to its accuracy, many investigators discussed multiple solutions for developing
    the function of medical and bioinformatics challenges using deep learning (DL)
    techniques. The importance of DL in Internet of Things (IoT)-based bio- and medical
    informatics lies in its ability to analyze and interpret large amounts of complex
    and diverse data in real time, providing insights that can improve healthcare
    outcomes and increase efficiency in the healthcare industry. Several applications
    of DL in IoT-based bio- and medical informatics include diagnosis, treatment recommendation,
    clinical decision support, image analysis, wearable monitoring, and drug discovery.
    The review aims to comprehensively evaluate and synthesize the existing body of
    the literature on applying deep learning in the intersection of the IoT with bio-
    and medical informatics. In this paper, we categorized the most cutting-edge DL
    solutions for medical and bioinformatics issues into five categories based on
    the DL technique utilized: convolutional neural network, recurrent neural network,
    generative adversarial network, multilayer perception, and hybrid methods. A systematic
    literature review was applied to study each one in terms of effective properties,
    like the main idea, benefits, drawbacks, methods, simulation environment, and
    datasets. After that, cutting-edge research on DL approaches and applications
    for bioinformatics concerns was emphasized. In addition, several challenges that
    contributed to DL implementation for medical and bioinformatics have been addressed,
    which are predicted to motivate more studies to develop medical and bioinformatics
    research progressively. According to the findings, most articles are evaluated

    Abstract Nowadays, machine learning (ML) has attained a high level of achievement
    in many contexts. Considering the significance of ML in medical and bioinformatics
    owing to its accuracy, many investigators discussed multiple solutions for developing
    the function of medical and bioinformatics challenges using deep learning (DL)
    techniques. The importance of DL in Internet of Things (IoT)-based bio- and medical
    informatics lies in its ability to analyze and interpret large amounts of complex
    and diverse data in real time, providing insights that can improve healthcare
    outcomes and increase efficiency in the healthcare industry. Several applications
    of DL in IoT-based bio- and medical informatics include diagnosis, treatment recommendation,
    clinical decision support, image analysis, wearable monitoring, and drug discovery.
    The review aims to comprehensively evaluate and synthesize the existing body of
    the literature on applying deep learning in the intersection of the IoT with bio-
    and medical informatics. In this paper, we categorized the most cutting-edge DL
    solutions for medical and bioinformatics issues into five categories based on
    the DL technique utilized: convolutional neural network, recurrent neural network,
    generative adversarial network, multilayer perception, and hybrid methods. A systematic
    literature review was applied to study each one in terms of effective properties,
    like the main idea, benefits, drawbacks, methods, simulation environment, and
    datasets. After that, cutting-edge research on DL approaches and applications
    for bioinformatics concerns was emphasized. In addition, several challenges that
    contributed to DL implementation for medical and bioinformatics have been addressed,
    which are predicted to motivate more studies to develop medical and bioinformatics
    research progressively. According to the findings, most articles are evaluated
    using features like accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F-score, latency, adaptability,
    and scalability. Similar content being viewed by others Machine learning and deep

    synthesizes computer programming, biology, and big data to aid scientists in perceiving
    and detecting paradigms in biological and medical information [1,2,3]. It is significantly
    suitable for studying DNA sequencing, as it allows scientists to arrange a great
    deal of data [4, 5]. The area of computer science, namely bioinformatics, is applied
    to evaluate whole-genome sequencing information [6, 7]. This contains software
    improvement, algorithm, analysis, pipeline, transferring, and storage/database
    improvement of genomics information. In other words, bioinformatics is described
    as applying analysis and computation tools to receive and interpret biological
    data [8, 9]. As an interdisciplinary area, bioinformatics harnesses computer science,
    physics, biology, and mathematics [10, 11]. It is critical for data management
    in modern medicine and biology [12, 13]. Bioinformatics provides considerable
    support to deal with time context and cost issues in different tracks [14, 15].
    Bioinformatics, as pertinent to genomics and genetics, is a scientific interdisciplinary
    field that utilizes computer technology to gather, store, evaluate, and distribute
    biological data, like DNA and amino acid sequences and annotations about them
    [16, 17]. Distributed computing is a versatile method that can be applied to a
    wide range of issues in bioinformatics. While it is commonly used for cost-efficiency
    in high-performance computing, in other domains, it has become a necessity [18].
    By leveraging the power of multiple interconnected computers, distributed computing
    allows researchers to process large amounts of data and perform complex calculations
    quickly and efficiently. This is particularly important in bioinformatics, where
    massive data sets are often analyzed to gain insights into biological processes
    and develop new disease treatments [19, 20]. The rising amount of information
    required to be processed within logical time finally outgrows even the strongest
    computers [21, 22]. Recently, some organizations that regularly process large
    amounts of data have yet to apply nearly easy processes, like distributing work
    by hand or with easy scripts [23, 24]. An increasing number of corporations are
    suggesting solutions that scale better, allowing more autonomy of information
    analysis procedures and more effective resource usage [25, 26]. Some present tools
    for distributed computing are too low-phase or not flexible enough to be adjusted
    to requirements [27, 28]. Many technologies generate a great base for building
    higher-level distributed computing ecosystems [29, 30]. Also, Machine learning
    (ML), a subsection of Artificial Intelligence (AI), has become a strong tool for
    several bioinformatics uses [31, 32]. Depending on big datasets, ML mechanisms
    are particularly suitable for forecasting and pattern recognition [33]. There
    are some emerging uses of ML within the bioinformatics area. ML in bioinformatics
    refers to using ML techniques to analyze and interpret biological data, including
    genomics, systems biology, text mining, microarrays, and evolution. By applying
    ML algorithms to complex biological data sets, researchers can gain insights into
    various biological processes, identify genetic mutations, and even develop new
    disease treatments [34, 35]. ML can be applied through various modes of human-made
    database reports to process and evaluate data, decreasing labor expenses and fastening
    the research procedure without compromising quality [36, 37]. ML text evaluation
    can be utilized in bioinformatics as well. The containing of ML has given bioinformatics
    the needed promotion [38, 39]. This research aimed to provide a detailed overview
    of the applications of ML technologies in IoT-based medical and bioinformatics.
    The study highlighted the multiple uses of Deep Learning (DL) strategies [40,
    41] in medical and bioinformatics by conducting an SLR and analyzing and comparing
    findings from various studies. The DL mechanisms used in medicine and bioinformatics
    were divided into five separate groups: convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent
    neural network (RNN), generative adversarial network (GAN), multilayer perception
    (MLP), and hybrid approaches, which include several practical methods. For each
    group and mechanism, multiple properties such as benefits, drawbacks, datasets,
    and simulation environments were studied. The study investigated the methodologies
    and applications of DL/ML mechanisms in bioinformatics before delving further
    into future studies and taking into account the shortcomings that need to be addressed
    in the future. Overall, the contributions of this paper include providing a thorough
    examination of current concerns with ML/DL mechanisms in medical and bioinformatics,
    conducting a comprehensive evaluation of existing methods for ML/DL applications,
    and modeling important areas for the future development of these approaches. The
    main contributions of this paper are as follows: Conducting an SLR to explore
    ML applications in IoT-based medical and bioinformatics; Analyzing and comparing
    DL uses in medical and bioinformatics; Categorizing DL mechanisms into five groups
    (CNN, RNN, GAN, MLP, hybrids) and examining their properties; Investigating DL/ML
    methodologies and applications in bioinformatics; Providing insights for future
    research and addressing existing shortcomings; Offering a comprehensive evaluation
    of existing ML/DL methods; Contributing to a better understanding of current challenges
    and opportunities in the field; The article is structured in the following manner:
    The key principles and terminology of ML/DL in medical and bioinformatics are
    covered in the first part, followed by an investigation of relevant papers in
    part 3. Part 4 discusses the studied mechanisms and tools for paper selection,
    while Part 5 illustrates the classification that was selected. Section 6 presents
    the results and comparisons; Sect. 7 provides the open issues, and the conclusion
    is explored in Sect. 8. 2 Fundamental concepts and terminology This section discusses
    the fundamentals of DL approaches as well as their applications in medical and
    bioinformatics. 2.1 Deep learning concepts Three classifications of DL methods
    are supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning. An input vector as
    a value for the supervisory signal is a desired value. Present labels aid the
    method of predicting the desired output labels [42]. Classification approaches
    employ supervised learning to detect faces and traffic signals, translate voice
    to text, identify spam in a file, and perform a variety of other tasks. Semi-supervised
    learning is a strategy that crosses the gap between unsupervised and supervised
    ML approaches [43]. This approach, which falls between supervised and unsupervised
    learning, uses unlabeled and labeled values as training data. When combined with
    a modest quantity of labeled data, the learning accuracy of unlabeled data improves
    significantly. In theory, the data adjacent to it have the same name. Likewise,
    the cluster assumption, which states that every data in a cluster is the same,
    has a similar name [44]. Also, rather than using the whole input space, the data
    are limited to a single dimension. Unsupervised learning describes the interrelationships
    between the components and then categorizes them. These algorithms are used in
    neural networks, clustering, and anomaly detection. Detecting anomalies typically
    takes the benefit of unsupervised learning, specifically in security areas. By
    the same token, feature processing and extraction are possible by using DL techniques
    and artificial neural networks [45, 46]. 2.2 Bioinformatics applications Bioinformatics
    is an advanced field of biology that proceeds from the combination of both information
    and biology [47]. It is an interdisciplinary area of study that utilizes mathematics,
    biology, computer science, chemistry, and statistics, which have been synthesized
    to shape an individual order [48]. Bioinformatics is fundamentally applied to
    bring out knowledge from biological data through the improvement of software and
    algorithms [49]. Bioinformatics is broadly used in the study of Genomics, 3D structure
    modeling of Proteins, proteomics, image analysis, and drug designing [50, 51].
    A particular use of bioinformatics can be found in the domain of preventive medicine,
    which is principally concentrated on improving measures to avoid, manage, and
    treat serious infectious diseases [52]. The basic target of bioinformatics is
    to enhance the understanding of biological procedures. There are several applications
    of bioinformatics including recording and retrieval of data in gene therapy, biometrical
    evaluation for crop management, pest control, evolutionary research, drug discovery,
    and microbial utilitarianism [52]. 2.3 Deep learning usage in bioinformatics The
    primary objective of healthcare informatics is to offer better treatments and
    enhance the quality of life for individuals by efficiently analyzing biomedical
    data, which includes Electronic Health Records (EHRs) [53]. In the past, it was
    customary to rely on domain experts to develop models for healthcare or biomedicine,
    but recent advances in DL algorithms have enabled the automatic learning of representations
    and patterns from such data for model improvement. DL techniques involve several
    levels of representation, where at each stage, the system learns higher abstract
    representations. Natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, speech recognition,
    video analysis, health informatics, and image processing are among the fields
    in which DL-based algorithms have performed well. Powerful computational models
    include DL approaches such as CNN, neural networks, auto-encoders, and deep generative
    networks. These techniques have shown considerable success in dealing with large
    amounts of information across a wide range of applications due to their ability
    to extract complex latent features and learn effective representations in an unsupervised
    setting [54]. Here are several uses of DL methods in bioinformatics medical systems:
    2.3.1 Detecting enzymes applying multilayer neural networks Detecting enzymes
    using multilayer neural networks refers to using DL algorithms to automatically
    recognize enzymes in biochemical data. Enzymes are proteins that catalyze chemical
    reactions in living organisms. Detecting and identifying enzymes is crucial in
    many areas of bioinformatics and biomedicine, such as drug discovery and metabolic
    pathway analysis. Traditionally, this task required the expertise of domain specialists
    to identify enzymes manually [55]. With the advancement of DL algorithms, it is
    now possible to train multilayer neural networks to recognize patterns in enzyme
    data and classify them automatically. Multilayer neural networks are a type of
    AI that consists of multiple layers of interconnected nodes that process input
    data to generate output predictions. These networks can learn to represent complex
    relationships between input features and output classes, making them effective
    for enzyme detection. The paper discusses various approaches to applying multilayer
    neural networks for enzyme detection, including the use of CNN and RNN. These
    networks can be trained on large datasets of enzyme data, and the resulting models
    can be used to automatically detect and classify enzymes in new data [56]. 2.3.2
    Gene expression regression Gene expression regression refers to the use of DL
    algorithms to predict the expression level of a gene based on various factors,
    such as environmental conditions, genetic mutations, or other molecular processes.
    The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict the level of gene expression
    in a particular context, which can help researchers understand the underlying
    biological mechanisms and develop new treatments for diseases [57]. DL models,
    such as CNN or RNN, are trained on large datasets of gene expression data, along
    with other relevant features. These models learn to identify patterns and correlations
    between the expression levels and the various factors that influence them, allowing
    them to make accurate predictions. Gene expression regression has numerous applications
    in bioinformatics and medical informatics, including predicting drug responses,
    identifying biomarkers for diseases, and understanding the mechanisms of genetic
    disorders [58]. 2.3.3 CNN predicting RNA–protein linking points In bioinformatics,
    predicting RNA–protein binding sites is an important task as it can help in understanding
    gene regulation, disease diagnosis, and drug discovery. One approach to this task
    is using CNN [59], which is a type of DL model designed to learn spatial features
    from input data. In the context of predicting RNA–protein binding sites, CNNs
    can be trained on sequence data to identify patterns and features that are indicative
    of RNA–protein interaction sites [60]. The input to the CNN is a sequence of nucleotides,
    and the output is a probability score that indicates the likelihood of RNA–protein
    binding at each position in the sequence. CNN works by applying a set of filters
    to the input sequence, with each filter looking for a specific pattern or feature
    in the sequence. The output of the filter is then passed through a nonlinear activation
    function to generate a feature map. Multiple filters are used in parallel to learn
    different features from the input sequence. The feature maps are then pooled to
    reduce the dimensionality of the data and to capture the most salient features.
    The resulting features are then passed through one or more fully connected layers
    to make the final prediction. Overall, the use of CNNs for predicting RNA–protein
    binding sites has shown promising results and has the potential to contribute
    to developing new therapeutics and diagnostics for various diseases [61]. 2.3.4
    DNA sequence performance anticipation with RNN and CNN DNA sequence performance
    anticipation with RNN and CNN refers to the use of RNN and CNN in predicting the
    performance of DNA sequences. RNNs are neural networks designed to process sequential
    data by maintaining a memory of past inputs, while CNNs are a type of neural network
    that can learn and identify spatial patterns in data. In the context of DNA sequences,
    RNNs, and CNNs can be used to predict the performance of a specific sequence based
    on its structure and characteristics [62]. For example, RNNs can be trained on
    a set of DNA sequences and their corresponding performance levels and then used
    to predict the performance of new, unseen sequences. Similarly, CNNs can be trained
    to identify spatial patterns in DNA sequences that are associated with high or
    low performance. By combining the strengths of both RNNs and CNNs, researchers
    can develop more accurate and effective models for predicting the performance
    of DNA sequences. This can have important implications for fields such as genetic
    engineering and biotechnology, where the ability to accurately predict the performance
    of DNA sequences is crucial for developing new treatments and therapies [63].
    2.3.5 Biomedical image classification applying ResNet and transfer learning In
    the field of medical image analysis, one of the challenges is to accurately classify
    biomedical images such as X-rays, MRI scans, and CT scans, which require the expertise
    of trained radiologists. With the advent of DL, CNN has been widely used to classify
    medical images automatically. One of the most successful CNN architectures is
    Residual Network (ResNet), which is known for its ability to train deep networks
    with many layers. Transfer learning is a technique that uses pre-trained models
    on large datasets to solve similar tasks on smaller datasets. In biomedical image
    classification, transfer learning can be used to leverage pre-trained ResNet models
    on large datasets such as ImageNet to improve the performance of medical image
    classification. A pre-trained ResNet model is used as a feature extractor to apply
    transfer learning with ResNet in biomedical image classification [64]. The last
    few layers of the ResNet model, responsible for the final classification, are
    replaced with new layers trained on the biomedical dataset. The new layers learn
    the specific features of the biomedical images and improve classification accuracy.
    This approach has been used in various biomedical image classification tasks,
    such as breast cancer detection, brain tumor segmentation, and lung nodule detection,
    and has shown promising results in improving the accuracy of classification compared
    to traditional ML algorithms [65]. 2.3.6 Graph embedding using GCN for protein
    interaction prediction Proteins interact with each other in complex ways to perform
    vital biological functions. The prediction of novel protein interactions is important
    for understanding cellular processes and developing new drugs. Graph Convolutional
    Networks (GCNs) are a type of DL algorithm that can learn to represent and analyze
    complex network data, such as protein–protein interaction networks. In this context,
    GCNs can be used to perform graph embedding, which is the process of transforming
    the nodes and edges of a graph into a low-dimensional vector space while preserving
    the structural information of the graph. By using GCNs to learn the embeddings
    of proteins and their interactions in the network, researchers can capture the
    underlying patterns and relationships that are difficult to detect using traditional
    methods [66]. The GCN-based approach for predicting protein interactions involves
    training a model on a graph representation of known interactions, where the nodes
    represent proteins and the edges represent their interactions. The model then
    learns to predict whether a new interaction exists between two proteins based
    on their embedding vectors. One of the advantages of this approach is that it
    can incorporate additional features, such as protein sequence and structure information,
    to improve the accuracy of the predictions. Transfer learning techniques can also
    be used to improve the performance of the model by leveraging pre-trained embeddings
    from related tasks. Overall, the use of GCNs for graph embedding and predicting
    protein interactions has shown promising results and has the potential to contribute
    to the development of new drugs and therapies [67]. 2.3.7 GAN image super-resolution
    in biology GAN image super-resolution in biology is a DL technique used to enhance
    the resolution of biological images such as microscopy or medical images. GANs
    are composed of two neural networks: a generator and a discriminator network.
    The generator network generates a high-resolution image from a low-resolution
    input image, while the discriminator network determines whether the generated
    image is real or not. In GAN image super-resolution, the generator network takes
    a low-resolution image as input and generates a high-resolution image that is
    similar to the original high-resolution image. The discriminator network evaluates
    the similarity between the generated and original images. The generator network
    is trained to generate images that fool the discriminator network into thinking
    they are real high-resolution images. This training continues until the generator
    network produces high-quality images indistinguishable from real high-resolution
    images. GAN image super-resolution in biology has many applications, such as enhancing
    the resolution of microscopy images to improve the accuracy of image analysis
    and improving the resolution of medical images to aid in diagnosis and treatment
    [68]. 2.3.8 Variational autoencoder high-dimensional biological generative and
    data embedding VAE stands for Variational Autoencoder, which is a type of deep
    generative model used in ML. It is commonly used in high-dimensional data analysis
    and representation learning. In the context of bioinformatics and medical informatics,
    VAE can be used for biological data embedding and generative modeling. In VAE,
    the input data are first encoded into a lower-dimensional space, called the latent
    space, which captures the essential features of the input data. Then, a generative
    model is trained to map the latent space back to the original data space, allowing
    for the generation of new data samples. VAE is a probabilistic model, which means
    it can also be used for data imputation and anomaly detection. VAE has several
    advantages over other generative models, such as its ability to handle missing
    data and its ability to learn a smooth and continuous latent space representation
    of the input data. It is particularly useful in high-dimensional biological data
    analysis, where the number of features is very large, and the data are often noisy
    and incomplete. In summary, VAE is a powerful tool in DL and ML for high-dimensional
    biological data embedding and generative modeling. It has a wide range of applications
    in bioinformatics and medical informatics, such as data imputation, anomaly detection,
    and drug discovery [69]. In the next section, we delve deep into some related
    survey papers investigating this area. 3 Relevant reviews We discussed the background
    and related ideas in-depth in the preceding section. In this section, we provide
    some significant relevant works in this area. In this regard, Li, Huang [19] proposed
    a comprehensive review of the recent developments in DL techniques for bioinformatics.
    They discussed the importance of big data in bioinformatics and the potential
    of DL techniques to analyze and make predictions based on such data. The paper
    provided an overview of the applications of DL in various fields of bioinformatics,
    including gene expression analysis, protein structure prediction, drug discovery,
    and disease diagnosis. Moreover, Rezende, Xavier [70] presented a comparative
    study of hierarchical ML algorithms for classifying biological databases. They
    evaluated the performance of four different algorithms, namely random forest,
    Naïve Bayes, decision tree, and k-nearest neighbor, in terms of their accuracy,
    precision, recall, and F1 score. They also compared the performance of these algorithms
    with a baseline non-hierarchical ML algorithm. Also, to fulfill the lack of guidelines
    for hierarchical data classification, Yi, You [71] provided an overview of the
    recent advancements in graph representation learning for bioinformatics. They
    discussed the growing significance of graph-based data in bioinformatics and how
    graph representation learning can be used to extract valuable features and knowledge
    from such data. They reviewed the various graph representation learning models
    and their advantages and limitations in bioinformatics applications. Besides,
    Sharma [72] provided an in-depth review of the applications of cluster analysis
    in bioinformatics. They discussed the increasing importance of cluster analysis
    in various fields of bioinformatics, including gene expression analysis, protein
    structure prediction, and disease diagnosis. They provided a comprehensive overview
    of the different types of clustering algorithms, including hierarchical, partitioning,
    density-based, and model-based clustering, and their advantages and limitations
    in bioinformatics applications. Also, Serra, Galdi [73] provided an overview of
    the recent developments in ML techniques for bioinformatics and neuroimaging.
    They discussed the increasing importance of big data in these fields and how ML
    techniques can be used to analyze and make predictions based on such data. Their
    paper provided a comprehensive review of the applications of ML in various fields,
    including gene expression analysis, protein structure prediction, drug discovery,
    and brain imaging analysis. However. For this reason, there is a need for a new
    review article on DL in bio- and medical informatics as prior studies have offered
    a wide overview of DL applications in other domains but have not completely explored
    the potential of DL in tackling the issues faced in the sector. Recent developments
    in DL algorithms have also opened up new possibilities for enhancing the precision
    and effectiveness of medical diagnosis and therapy. We intend to emphasize the
    areas that require more investigation and offer direction for future work in the
    field by offering a thorough analysis of the most recent advancements in DL and
    its applications in bioinformatics, molecular biology, healthcare, and genomics.
    Additionally, we promote the use of DL in the medical area, enhancing patient
    outcomes and advancing precision medicine. Table 1 contains a summary of relevant
    works. Table 1 Summary of relevant works Full size table 4 Methodology of research

    DL approach that has been employed in practically all areas of medicine and is
    one of the useful methods for researchers. The technique is prevalently utilized
    for identifying MRI and CT scan images, and relevant backgrounds, as debated in
    the second part. In this regard, Liu, Xu [74] presented an intelligent dental
    health-IoT system based on smart hardware, DL, and a mobile terminal to assess
    its potential in in-home dental healthcare. Moreover, sophisticated dental equipment
    is being developed and upgraded to operate the image attainment of teeth. Based
    on a dataset of 12,600 clinical images collected by the presented device from
    10 private dental clinics, an automatic detection model trained by MASK R-CNN
    was improved for the identification and classification of 7 different dental diseases,
    including deteriorated teeth, periodontal disease, fluorosis, and dental plaque,
    with detection precision of up to 90% and high specificity and sensitivity. Following
    a one-month assessment in ten clinics compared to the previous month, when the
    platform is not used, the average detection time for each patient lowers by 37.5%,
    demonstrating an 18.4% improvement in the treated patients. Also, Nematzadeh,
    Kiani [75] presented a metaheuristic-based approach for optimizing the hyperparameters
    of ML algorithms and DNNs in bioinformatics applications. They discussed the challenges
    of selecting appropriate hyperparameters and the limitations of existing methods.
    They proposed a metaheuristic-based approach that involves the use of different
    optimization algorithms to search the hyperparameter space and identify the optimal
    combination of hyperparameters that leads to the best performance. By the same
    token, Chen, Wang [25] evaluated nhKcr on a benchmark dataset and compared its
    performance with four state-of-the-art crotonylation site predictors. They tested
    the performance of nhKcr on a dataset commonly used to evaluate the accuracy of
    crotonylation site prediction tools. They also compared the performance of nhKcr
    to four other prediction tools that are currently considered to be the most accurate.
    The results showed that nhKcr outperformed the other predictors in terms of both
    prediction accuracy and execution time. Their results demonstrated the potential
    of DL-based methods for predicting post-translational modifications on nonhistone
    proteins. Also, Kumar and Sharma [76] illustrated the efficiency and robustness
    of the COVID-19 patient’s technique of non-contact examination, which can aid
    in cost-efficiency and early screening and diagnosing of COVID cases. They provided
    images of Grad’s chest radiographs as well as the regions of interest for proven
    COVID-19-positive patients, bacterial pneumonia, and healthy cases. They also
    discussed the challenges faced in applying DL in bioinformatics, such as the need
    for large datasets, interpretability, and data quality. Moreover, Jia, Chen [77]
    presented a DL and bioinformatics-based approach for the identification of breast
    cancer cases. The authors used a dataset consisting of 212 breast cancer patients
    and 212 healthy controls. The transcriptome data of these samples were analyzed
    using bioinformatics tools to identify Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs).
    The DEGs were then used as input for a DL algorithm, which was trained to classify
    the samples as cancerous or non-cancerous. The authors reported high accuracy
    and specificity in the classification of the samples using this approach. Table
    4 indicates the techniques, properties, and characteristics of CNN-informatics
    methods. Table 4 The techniques, properties, and characteristics of CNN-bioinformatics
    methods Full size table 5.2 GAN approaches for bio- and medical informatics It
    is worth noting that the GAN is the most widely used image classification and
    identification algorithm. It is now a well-known approach for usage in medicine
    and healthcare, and it is one of the most appealing strategies for investigators.
    In this section, we went through several various approaches in this area. To name
    but a few, Pastorino and Biswas [78] described a study that aims to address data
    privacy concerns while classifying chest X-ray images for COVID-19 detection.
    The authors developed a semi-supervised GAN that uses a small set of labeled data
    and a large set of unlabeled data to learn the features of chest X-ray images.
    To ensure data privacy, the authors introduced a data-blinding technique to remove
    personal information from the images, which may lead to data adequacy bias. They
    evaluated their method on a publicly available dataset and found that it achieved
    comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods while preserving data privacy.
    Also, Auwul, Rahman [79] discussed using bioinformatics and ML approaches to identify
    potential drug targets and pathways for COVID-19. Using bioinformatics tools,
    they analyzed genomic and proteomic data of SARS-CoV-2 and its interaction with
    human proteins. They used ML algorithms to predict potential drug targets and
    pathways that could be used to treat COVID-19. The results showed several potential
    drug targets and pathways, including the renin–angiotensin and interferon signaling
    pathways. Also, Lan, You [80] discussed using GAN in biomedical informatics. They
    provided a GAN framework and its applications in various areas such as image generation,
    data augmentation, disease diagnosis, drug discovery, and medical image analysis.
    Their method could detect Alzheimer’s disease (AD) on T1 scans at a very early
    phase with a zone under the curve of 0.727 and AD at a late phase with an area
    under the curve (AUC) of 0.894 and diagnose brain metastases on T1c scans with
    AUC 0.921. Besides, Han, Rundo [81] proposed an unsupervised medical anomaly detection
    model called MADGAN, which is based on the GAN architecture. MADGAN can reconstruct
    multiple adjacent brain MRI slices from a single slice and generate realistic
    brain images. The proposed method can detect anomalous brain regions by comparing
    the reconstructed slices with the original ones. The authors evaluated the performance
    of MADGAN on two public brain MRI datasets and compared it with several state-of-the-art
    methods. The results showed that MADGAN outperformed other methods in terms of
    anomaly detection accuracy and computational efficiency, demonstrating the potential
    of MADGAN in medical anomaly detection tasks. In addition, Balogh, Benczik [82]
    proposed a GAN model called TopoGAN for efficient link prediction in the protein–protein
    interaction (PPI) network. The model utilized the topological information of nodes
    and their neighbors to generate new nodes, which were then used to predict missing
    links in the network. The proposed model was evaluated on five benchmark PPI datasets
    and achieved superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. TopoGAN
    also showed its capability in identifying new PPIs between proteins, which were
    later validated by experiments. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of
    the proposed approach in predicting PPIs and can be useful for drug discovery
    and disease diagnosis. Table 5 indicates the techniques, properties, and characteristics
    of GAN-informatics methods. Table 5 The techniques, properties, and characteristics
    of GAN-bioinformatics methods Full size table 5.3 RNN approaches for bio- and
    medical informatics The RNN technique, which has been very practical in medicine
    and healthcare, is one of the most popular techniques for investigators. As mentioned
    before, it is the most conventionally applied technique for forecasting and prediction
    whereby we dwell deep into five approaches of this technique in this part. In
    this regard, Giansanti, Castelli [83] compared the performance of two different
    ML approaches—DL and classical ML—for the task of miRNA-target prediction. The
    authors used two different datasets, one containing experimentally validated miRNA-target
    interactions and another containing predicted interactions from multiple algorithms.
    They then trained and evaluated several models on these datasets, including a
    DNN, a random forest, a support vector machine, and a logistic regression model.
    Their results showed that DL models outperformed classical ML models in terms
    of both accuracy and area under the curve (AUC) metrics. Moreover, Lyu, Chen [84]
    proposed an RNN framework according to word embedding and character representation.
    In the statements that are proper for the work and could be constructed by bidirectional
    difference and long short-term memory (LSTM) units, the authors used a conditional
    random field (CRF) layer and contextual data from both long-domain and directions
    dependencies. Their neural network model could be used for BNER without the need
    for human feature engineering. Based on their experimental findings, the domain-specific
    pre-trained word embedding and character-level representation may be used to create
    the function of the LSTM-RNN approaches. Well, ElAbd, Bromberg [85] explained
    that amino acid sequences can be represented using a one-hot encoding scheme,
    where each amino acid is represented by a vector of binary values, with a “1”
    in the position corresponding to the amino acid and “0”s elsewhere. They demonstrated
    that this encoding scheme outperforms one-hot encoding in terms of accuracy and
    generalizability in various tasks, including protein classification and protein–ligand
    binding prediction. Their paper also provided a detailed description of the development
    and testing of the proposed encoding scheme, including evaluating different DL
    algorithms and hyperparameters. They concluded that their encoding scheme has
    the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of DL applications in the
    field of bioinformatics. Furthermore, Liu and Gong [86] proposed an enhanced LSTM
    model that incorporates residual connections and attention mechanisms to improve
    the accuracy of the predictions. They demonstrated the effectiveness of their
    model using a dataset of protein–protein interaction residue pairs and compared
    their results to other commonly used methods. They concluded that their model
    outperformed other methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency,
    making it a promising tool for future research in protein–protein interactions.
    Afterward, the authors utilized it to anticipate protein–protein interaction interference
    with residue pairs and gained an appropriate accuracy of nearly 72%. Additionally,
    Wang, Zeng [87] developed a CNN-based model, MusiteDeep, which takes amino acid
    sequences as input and predicts the phosphorylation sites with high accuracy.
    They tested their model on both general phosphorylation sites and kinase-specific
    phosphorylation sites and compared it to other commonly used methods. They found
    that their model outperformed other methods in terms of prediction accuracy and
    latency. Their paper provided a valuable tool for predicting phosphorylation sites
    in proteins and can contribute to the development of new therapies and treatments
    for diseases related to protein phosphorylation. As compared to other popular
    methods on the benchmark data, it achieved more than 50% relative development
    in the zone under the precision-recall curve in general phosphorylation site forecasting
    and obtains competitive results in kinase-specific anticipating. Table 6 indicates
    the techniques, properties, and characteristics of RNN-informatics methods. Table

    Full size table 5.4 MLP approaches for bio- and medical informatics MLP has been
    specified as a broadly utilized and efficient ML mechanism recently used to detect
    classification based on high-dimensional genomic data. In this regard, Zhao, Shao
    [88] evaluated the performance of various models, including decision trees, logistic
    regression, and neural networks, in terms of both prediction accuracy and interpretability.
    They found that explainable ML models, such as decision trees and logistic regression,
    provided better interpretability than more complex models like neural networks
    while maintaining similar prediction accuracy. They also proposed an optimization
    method to improve the performance of explainable ML models. By the same token,
    an IoT-based health monitoring model was suggested by Souri, Ghafour [89] to control
    critical signs and identify biological and behavioral alternations of learners
    by intelligent student care technologies. They proposed a system that collects
    data from wearable devices, such as smartwatches, and applied ML algorithms to
    analyze the data and diagnose the students’ health condition. They used a dataset
    collected from real-world experiments to evaluate the performance of their system
    and compared it with other commonly used methods. The results showed that their
    system achieved high accuracy in diagnosing health conditions, and outperformed
    other methods in terms of efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Moreover, D’Orazio,
    Murdocca [90] introduced an MLP platform for the phenomics study of cancer cells
    reply of treatment, using and synthesizing the possibility of time-lapse microscopy
    for cell manner data achieving and robust DL software models for the hidden phenotypes
    extraction. They used a combination of DL and time-lapse-microscopy to monitor
    the growth and response of cancer cells to drugs over time. They collected a large
    dataset of time-lapse microscopy images and used DL models to identify and track
    the cells, extract features, and predict drug response. They evaluated the performance
    of their MLP approach and compared it with other commonly used methods. The results
    showed that the MLP approach achieved high accuracy in predicting drug response
    and outperformed other methods in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Besides,
    Karim, Beyan [91] selected cancer genes to classify cancer accurately owing to
    emitted genes from microarray having many noises. They strived to find many characteristics
    and classifiers utilizing three benchmark datasets to systematically assess the
    functions of the characteristic selection mechanisms and ML classifiers. Also,
    they synthesized the classifiers to develop the function of the classification.
    Tested results demonstrated that the ensemble with some basis classifiers generates
    the best recognition rate on the benchmark dataset. Also, AYDIN [92] trained and
    compared six ML architectures, called RF, Naïve Bayes (NB), LR, K-nearest neighbor
    (KNN), MLP, and SVM, for the detection of T4SEs utilizing 10 types of chosen characteristics
    and fivefold cross-validation. According to their results: (1) involved various
    but supplementary characteristics generally increase the predictive function of
    T4SEs, (2) the majority voting technique propelled to a more consistent and precise
    classification function while forecasting an ensemble learning architecture with
    customized exclusive single features. (3) Ensemble methods, gained by incorporating
    exclusive single-characteristic methods, display a particularly developed predictive
    function. Table 7 indicates the techniques, properties, and characteristics of
    MLP-informatics methods. Table 7 The techniques, properties, and characteristics
    of MLP-bioinformatics methods Full size table 5.5 Hybrid approaches for bio- and
    medical informatics Hybrid methods are one of the most complicated methods used
    in the medical and bioinformatics area. These techniques contain two or more methods
    for coping with hardships. In this study, we defined the evaluated methods which
    were created by applying methodologies. It is a conventionally utilized method
    in a diverse domain relevant to this subject. Considering this matter, Mohamed
    Shakeel, Baskar [93] stated that existing approaches for maintaining security
    and privacy in healthcare systems often fall short due to factors such as complexity,
    human errors, and the constant evolution of new threats. The proposed DQN approach
    aimed to address these issues by providing a more automated and adaptive security
    system. Their approach involved using DQNs to learn optimal policies for decision-making
    in various healthcare scenarios. The authors presented experimental results showing
    the effectiveness of the proposed approach in identifying and mitigating threats
    in healthcare systems. Their paper presented an interesting application of DL
    and reinforcement learning techniques for addressing security and privacy concerns
    in healthcare systems. Besides, Huang, Shea [94] discussed a federated ML approach
    for predicting hospital stay time and mortality using distributed EMR from multiple
    hospitals. Their proposed patient clustering method groups similar patients based
    on their medical histories and diagnoses and then trains a local ML model for
    each cluster. These models are aggregated to create a global model that can make
    predictions for patients across all hospitals. Their approach was tested on a
    large dataset from multiple hospitals and compared to other ML models. The results
    showed that patient clustering improves the efficiency and accuracy of the federated
    ML approach, leading to better predictions for hospital stay time and mortality.
    As well, Wang, Jiang [95] proposed a method for efficiently verifying the results
    of Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) that are outsourced to a third-party
    cloud server for computation. The proposed method uses Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)
    to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the outsourced computation. Specifically,
    they introduced a new ZKP scheme called the “range-and-sum ZKP,” which allows
    efficient verification of the correctness of the computation without revealing
    any sensitive information. They also provided a theoretical analysis of the proposed
    scheme and demonstrated its effectiveness through experiments using real GWAS
    datasets. Their method could be useful for ensuring the reliability and security
    of outsourced GWAS computations, which are becoming increasingly common in biomedical
    research. Moreover, Cui, Zhu [96] proposed a federated learning framework called
    Federated electronic medical record with Anonymous Random Hybridization (FeARH)
    for privacy-preserving healthcare data analysis. Their framework is designed to
    protect the sensitive healthcare data of patients while allowing the model to
    learn from distributed EMR across multiple institutions. FeARH integrated three
    privacy-preserving techniques: differential privacy, random hybridization, and
    federated learning. The differential privacy mechanism preserved the privacy of
    individual records by adding random noise to the data. Random hybridization allows
    data from different sources to be combined randomly without exposing the original
    data. The results showed that FeARH achieves high prediction accuracy while preserving
    the privacy of the patient’s data. In addition, Shahid, Nasajpour [30] analyzed
    the recent advances in ML research aimed at combating COVID-19. The authors highlighted
    the critical role that ML techniques have played in addressing various challenges
    posed by the pandemic, including virus detection, spread prevention, and medical
    assistance. Their paper discussed different approaches that have been used to
    address these challenges, such as developing predictive models for disease spread
    and severity, identifying risk factors associated with the disease, and developing
    methods for analyzing medical images and data. Table 8 indicates the techniques,
    properties, and characteristics of MLP-informatics methods. Table 8 The techniques,
    properties, and characteristics of hybrid-bioinformatics methods Full size table
    After evaluating various studies conducted in DL methods for bio- and medical
    informatics, in the next section, we will analyze the results of our investigation
    and assess proposed studies to draw a well-organized evaluation. 6 Results and
    comparisons In the preceding section, we examined in-depth DL/ML techniques for
    bio- and medical informatics. In this part, we go over the findings in great detail
    and look at the approaches from several perspectives. This investigation identifies
    various innovative applications that exhibit this technique. Augmenting knowledge
    in domains such as protein structure prediction, image classification, and data
    retrieval poses a challenge. We posit that reducing information to input tensors
    and tasks to training variations confers a well-structured foundation that can
    extend numerous indicators of progress in ML through frameworks. A key objective
    of this study was to motivate readers to exercise control over how data are inputted
    into ML models and to enhance training problems. In terms of learning, we primarily
    concentrated on the aforementioned categories. Additionally, we urge scholars
    to delve deeper into these subjects. Our survey evaluation revealed that most
    medical and bioinformatics investigations focused on a select blend of learning
    tasks or the improvement of annotation protocols and new datasets. ML has garnered
    significant popularity and acceptance, particularly for its implementation with
    CNN methods, which have demonstrated excellent results. However, there exist certain
    limitations to achieving the same level of efficacy in medical and bioinformatics
    applications. In general, research in this area is still ongoing. One of the most
    salient issues is the scarcity of large datasets containing high-quality patterns
    for training purposes. In such cases, data integration may be viable for amalgamating
    information from multiple sources. It is noteworthy that as the scale of data
    increases, so does the necessity for larger datasets to ensure that ML produces
    dependable results. 6.1 Analysis of results In the field of DL applications in
    IoT-based bio- and medical informatics, the analysis of various research papers
    reveals interesting findings, as depicted in Figs. 9, 10, and 11. Figure 9 presents
    a geo-chart showcasing the countries involved in the studied research papers.
    Notably, China emerges as the most prominent contributor in this field. This suggests
    that China has been actively engaged in research and development activities related
    to Deep Learning applications in IoT-based bio- and medical informatics. This
    could be attributed to factors such as China’s emphasis on technological advancements,
    significant investments in research and development, and collaborations between
    academic institutions and industries. Moving on to Fig. 10 illustrates the distribution
    of simulation environments used in DL-based approaches within the medical and
    bioinformatics domains. Python, a widely adopted programming language, is prominently
    featured, along with its popular library TensorFlow, which is widely used for
    implementing DL models. The popularity of Python can be attributed to its versatility,
    simplicity, and extensive libraries and frameworks available for DL and scientific
    computing. TensorFlow’s popularity stems from its powerful tools and resources
    for efficient DL model implementation. On the other hand, the relatively lower
    adoption of N2 as shown in the figure suggests its limited usage, possibly due
    to factors such as resource availability or compatibility issues. Finally, Fig.
    11 showcases the frequency of methods applied to address medical and bioinformatics
    issues using DL. CNN, RNN, and GANs receive the most attention in this field.
    CNNs excel in image-based tasks, RNNs are suitable for processing sequential and
    temporal data, and GANs are promising to generate synthetic medical data and detect
    anomalies. The popularity of these methods indicates their effectiveness in tackling
    various challenges in medical and bioinformatics domains. These findings collectively
    highlight the contributions of different countries, the prominent simulation environments
    utilized, and the frequently employed DL methods in the context of DL applications
    in IoT-based bio- and medical informatics. They provide valuable insights into
    the current trends, preferences, and advancements in the field, which can guide
    future research and development efforts. It was observed that a substantial portion
    of the studies provided access to the source codes, predominantly in MATLAB and
    Python, to facilitate reproducibility and further experimentation. MATLAB was
    a prevalent choice, particularly in studies emphasizing signal processing and
    image analysis, owing to its extensive toolboxes tailored for these domains. Conversely,
    Python was prominently featured in research that incorporated machine learning
    frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras, aligning with the broader trend in the machine
    learning community. Notably, several reviewed papers included code snippets and
    made their complete implementations available on public repositories, fostering
    collaborative research and knowledge dissemination in this interdisciplinary field.
    This availability of codes played a pivotal role in advancing the applicability
    and accessibility of deep learning methodologies in the context of IoT-based bio-
    and medical informatics. Fig. 9 The geo-chart of contributed countries in studied

    The frequency of methods applied in medical and bioinformatics issues Full size
    image The use of DL techniques in biomedical and health informatics is becoming
    increasingly prevalent. One example is developing a smart dental health-IoT platform
    based on intelligent hardware, DL, and a mobile terminal. The platform can monitor
    oral health indicators such as temperature, pH, and moisture and use DL algorithms
    to detect dental diseases early. In addition, other studies have explored the
    use of metaheuristics to optimize hyperparameters in ML algorithms and DNNs for
    bioinformatics applications. This approach can improve the performance of these
    algorithms and ultimately lead to more accurate predictions and analysis. Furthermore,
    there have been efforts to apply DL techniques in bioinformatics research, such
    as breast cancer case identification and developing new bioinformatics tools for
    predicting crotonylation sites on human nonhistone proteins. These studies demonstrate
    the potential of DL in biomedical and health informatics research and highlight
    the importance of further exploring and optimizing these techniques for future
    applications. In the field of DL applications in IoT-based bio- and medical informatics,
    there is a notable emphasis on the accuracy parameter in the studies conducted,
    as demonstrated in Table 9. This indicates that researchers prioritize achieving
    high accuracy levels in their models. Accuracy is a crucial evaluation metric
    as it measures the overall correctness of the model’s predictions, reflecting
    its ability to classify and identify patterns within the data correctly. However,
    it is important to note that precision, which represents the proportion of true-positive
    predictions among all positive predictions, is the parameter receiving the least
    attention in these publications. Precision is a critical metric, especially in
    medical and bioinformatics applications, as it directly relates to correctly identifying
    true-positive cases while minimizing false positives. Neglecting precision can
    lead to potential misclassifications and incorrect diagnoses, which can have significant
    implications in healthcare settings. Table 9 Considered parameters in the examined
    papers Full size table One possible explanation for the lower emphasis on precision
    could be the primary focus on achieving high accuracy. Researchers may prioritize
    overall accuracy as it provides a comprehensive evaluation of the model’s performance,
    considering both positives and negatives. However, precision is equally important
    in healthcare and bioinformatics to avoid false positives, which can lead to unnecessary
    treatments or interventions. Another observation is that the majority of articles
    in the field tend to focus on only one target criterion while neglecting others.
    This limitation can hinder the comprehensive evaluation of the models and their
    effectiveness in real-world scenarios. To gain a deeper understanding of the model’s
    performance, it is essential to consider multiple evaluation parameters such as
    sensitivity, specificity, recall, and precision. By considering a broader range
    of evaluation metrics, researchers can gain a more holistic perspective on the
    model’s strengths and weaknesses, enabling them to make informed decisions regarding
    its applicability and effectiveness in practical settings. Addressing the issue
    of neglecting certain evaluation criteria requires researchers to place greater
    emphasis on the comprehensive evaluation of their models. By incorporating multiple
    target criteria into their studies, researchers can provide a more thorough and
    robust assessment of the model’s performance, ensuring that all relevant parameters
    are considered. This approach will contribute to a more accurate understanding
    of the model’s capabilities and limitations, ultimately facilitating the development
    of more reliable and effective DL applications in IoT-based bio- and medical Informatics.
    6.2 Exploring the Integration of ML in medical applications As shown in Sect.
    5, a study investigated the impact of data adequacy bias on a semi-supervised
    GAN for COVID-19 chest X-ray classification. The studied papers found that data
    adequacy bias can reduce classification accuracy, which must be considered when
    developing privacy-aware GAN models [102]. They utilized a bioinformatics and
    ML approach to identify potential drug targets and pathways for COVID-19 treatment.
    One approach integrated multiple omics data sets to construct a molecular network,
    which was used to identify significant gene modules. A comprehensive review of
    the applications of GANs in biomedical informatics showed their potential in medical
    image analysis and drug discovery [103]. The proposed MADGAN in Sect. 5 outperformed
    other anomaly detection methods and could be used for the early detection of neurological
    diseases. An efficient link prediction model for protein–protein interaction networks
    was developed using topological information in a GAN framework. The model outperformed
    traditional network analysis methods and could be used to identify potential drug
    targets for diseases associated with protein–protein interactions. These studies
    highlight the potential of GANs and ML in medical research, particularly in disease
    detection, drug discovery, and protein–protein interaction network analysis [104].
    Several studies have explored the use of DL and bioinformatics together. The studied
    models compared DL and ML approaches for miRNA-target prediction. The DL approach
    was found to be more accurate and precise than the ML approach. Another studied
    paper proposed an LSTM for biomedical named entity recognition, which outperformed
    traditional ML algorithms in accuracy. Another study focused on developing an
    amino acid encoding method for DL applications in bioinformatics. The method improved
    prediction accuracy for protein sequence classification. Another study used an
    attention mechanism enhanced LSTM with residual architecture to predict protein–protein
    interaction residue pairs. The model achieved high accuracy and outperformed other
    state-of-the-art models [105]. Lastly, a DL framework called MusiteDeep was proposed
    for phosphorylation site prediction. The model performed well in kinase-specific
    prediction tasks and achieved high accuracy. These studies demonstrate the potential
    of DL in various bioinformatics applications, including miRNA-target prediction,
    protein sequence classification, protein–protein interaction prediction, and phosphorylation
    site prediction. The use of DL approaches in these tasks has shown promising results
    and may lead to the development of more accurate and efficient tools for bioinformatics
    [106]. Several studies have investigated the integration of ML with medical applications.
    One study evaluated the effectiveness of explainable ML models for analyzing transcriptomic
    data. Our study demonstrated that these models can identify significant gene signatures
    and provide valuable insights into disease mechanisms. As shown in Sect. 5, another
    study proposed an ML-based healthcare monitoring model for diagnosing the condition
    of students in an IoT environment. This model leveraged multiple data sources
    to enhance diagnostic accuracy and minimize false alarms. In a different study,
    an ML phenomics approach combined DL with time-lapse microscopy to monitor gene
    expression and drug response in colorectal adenocarcinoma cells [107]. The model
    achieved high accuracy in predicting drug response and could potentially be useful
    for drug screening. A further study introduced DL-based clustering approaches
    for bioinformatics that can efficiently handle large and complex datasets. The
    models outperformed traditional clustering algorithms and could potentially be
    used for various bioinformatics tasks. Another study evaluated the performance
    of ML and bioinformatics applications on high-performance computing systems. The
    study demonstrated that these applications can efficiently handle massive datasets
    and can benefit from parallel computing. These studies demonstrate the potential
    of ML in medical and bioinformatics applications, specifically in areas such as
    healthcare monitoring, drug screening, and transcriptomic data analysis. ML models
    have shown promising results and could potentially lead to the development of
    more accurate and efficient tools for medical and bioinformatics applications.
    DL techniques and the incorporation of multiple data sources in ML models can
    lead to more accurate predictions and enhance the performance of these models
    [108]. Several studies have focused on integrating medical and DL subjects to
    improve healthcare systems. A proposed method used learning-based deep Q-networks
    to maintain the security and privacy of healthcare systems. Another study aimed
    to improve the efficiency of federated ML by using patient clustering to predict
    mortality and hospital stay time using distributed electronic medical records.
    Another proposed an efficient verification method for outsourced genome-wide association
    studies. In another investigation, anonymous random hybridization was utilized
    with federated ML to improve the privacy of electronic medical records [109].
    The COVID-19 pandemic has also increased interest in ML research for virus detection,
    spread prevention, and medical assistance. Despite the potential benefits of ML
    algorithms and models for healthcare systems, concerns about privacy and security
    remain, and new approaches are being developed to address these issues. To leverage
    the benefits of ML while protecting sensitive patient data, the use of federated
    ML has been explored. Overall, the presented studies highlight the potential of
    ML in medical applications and emphasize the need for further research to improve
    healthcare systems and patient outcomes [110]. 6.3 Prevalent evaluation criteria
    One of the well-known evaluation criteria is the F-score. The mentioned keys are
    applied to calculate the recall, F-score, and precision. It is worth mentioning
    that true positive (TP) means sick people are truly recognized as sick. False
    positive (FP) also means intact people are wrongly recognized as sick. Also, true
    negative (TN) means intact people are truly recognized as intact. Furthermore,
    false negative (FN) means sick people are wrongly recognized as intact. Precision
    demonstrates the number of true results recognized truly meanwhile recall indicates
    the entire entities truly recognized; these concepts are calculated as follows
    [111]: $$ {\\text{Precision}} = \\frac{{{\\text{STP}}}}{{{\\text{STP }} + {\\text{
    SFP}}}} *{ 1}00 $$ (1) $$ {\\text{Recall}} = \\frac{{{\\text{STP}}}}{{{\\text{STP
    }} + {\\text{ SFN}}}} *{ 1}00 $$ (2) $$ F{\\text{1 - score }} = \\frac{{2*{\\text{Recall}}*P}}{{{\\text{Recall}}
    + P}} *{ 1}00 $$ (3) $$ {\\text{Accuracy }} = \\frac{{{\\text{STN }} + {\\text{
    STP }}}}{{{\\text{STP }} + {\\text{ STN}} + {\\text{ SFN}} + {\\text{ SFP}}}}
    *{ 1}00 $$ (4) 6.4 Challenges of The DL applications in IoT-based bio- and medical
    informatics CNNs require large amounts of labeled data to train effectively. However,
    in the field of bio- and medical informatics, data are often limited and difficult
    to collect. This can lead to overfitting, where the model becomes too specialized
    to the training data and cannot generalize to new data. CNNs are often considered
    black-boxes since they can learn complex features and relationships within the
    data, but it can be challenging to interpret the reasons behind the model’s decision-making
    process. This is especially important in the medical field where doctors and researchers
    need to understand the reasoning behind the model’s predictions [112]. CNNs are
    computationally expensive and require a significant amount of processing power.
    This can be a significant challenge in IoT-based bio- and medical informatics,
    where edge computing and resource-constrained devices are common. CNNs are sensitive
    to data quality and can be affected by noise, missing values, and outliers. In
    the medical field, data can be noisy and incomplete due to the inherent complexity
    of biological systems, making it challenging to build accurate models. Generalization
    of new data: CNNs can struggle to generalize to new data that is significantly
    different from the training data. New patients or diseases may present unique
    challenges in the medical field that the model has not been trained on. Overall,
    CNNs are powerful tools in bio- and medical informatics, but their effective use
    requires careful consideration of the challenges listed above [113]. While CNNs
    have shown remarkable success in various image-related tasks, including medical
    image analysis, they have several limitations in the context of DL applications
    in IoT-based bio- and medical informatics. One of the major challenges with CNNs
    is their limited interpretability. In medical applications, understanding the
    reasoning behind a prediction is important, and CNNs lack transparency in this
    regard [114]. It is difficult to extract meaningful insights and make informed
    decisions based on CNN’s predictions without understanding how the model arrived
    at its conclusions. Another limitation of CNNs is their tendency to overfit specific
    data sets. This can be particularly problematic in medical applications where
    data sets may be small or unbalanced. While transfer learning can somewhat mitigate
    this, there is a need for novel techniques to improve the generalization ability
    of CNNs. CNNs require a large amount of labeled data to train effectively, which
    can be a challenge in the medical domain, where data are often scarce and expensive
    to obtain. This can lead to issues such as bias and limited diversity in the data
    set. CNNs are primarily designed for image data, and their application to other
    data types, such as time-series or text-based data, is limited [115]. This can
    be a challenge in IoT-based bio- and medical informatics, where data may be heterogeneous
    and multimodal. CNNs can be susceptible to adversarial attacks, where small perturbations
    to the input can lead to misclassification. This can be particularly concerning
    in medical applications, where incorrect predictions can have serious consequences.
    In summary, while CNNs have shown remarkable success in medical image analysis,
    they have several limitations that need to be addressed to improve their efficacy
    in IoT-based bio- and medical informatics. In the same context, RNNs have shown
    great success in various applications, including NLP and time-series analysis.
    However, they also have some limitations when applied to IoT-based bio- and medical
    informatics. RNNs have a limited memory that can make it difficult to capture
    long-term dependencies in sequential data. This is particularly problematic in
    bio- and medical informatics, where the data can be complex and interdependent
    [116]. RNNs are trained using backpropagation through time, which can lead to
    vanishing gradients. This can make it difficult for the model to learn long-term
    dependencies in the data. RNNs can easily overfit the training data, especially
    if the dataset is small. This can result in poor performance when applied to new
    data. Training RNNs can be time-consuming, especially if the dataset is large.
    This can make it difficult to deploy RNN models in real-time applications. RNNs
    are often referred to as “black-box” models because it can be difficult to understand
    how they make their predictions. This can be problematic in bio- and medical informatics,
    where interpretability is important for ensuring patient safety. Overall, while
    RNNs have shown promise in IoT-based bio- and medical informatics, their limitations
    need to be carefully considered when developing models for real-world applications
    [117]. RNNs require a large amount of labeled data to train effectively, which
    can be difficult to obtain in the medical domain due to privacy concerns and the
    limited availability of data. Limited training data can lead to overfitting, where
    the model performs well on the training data but fails to generalize to new data.
    Medical data often consists of long sequences, such as ECG signals or medical
    records, making it challenging to process with RNNs. Long sequences can lead to
    vanishing or exploding gradients, which can degrade the model’s performance. RNNs
    can be difficult to interpret, making understanding the model’s reasoning behind
    its predictions challenging. In the medical domain, interpretability is critical,
    and understanding the model’s decision-making process is essential to building
    trust in the model’s predictions [118]. Medical data can be noisy and contain
    variations due to differences in acquisition devices, protocols, and patient conditions.
    Such variations can be challenging to account for, leading to decreased performance
    of RNNs. On the other hand, medical data collection and annotation lack standardization,
    making it challenging to develop RNNs that generalize well across institutions.
    Medical data often suffer from class imbalance, where one class (e.g., disease-positive)
    has significantly fewer examples than the other class (e.g., disease-negative).
    This issue can lead to poor performance of RNNs and requires special attention
    to handle. RNNs can be computationally expensive, requiring significant computational
    resources to train and deploy. The limited availability of high-performance computing
    can hinder the development and deployment of RNNs in resource-constrained settings.
    The use of RNNs in healthcare raises ethical considerations, such as informed
    consent, privacy, and bias. Addressing these issues is essential to ensure that
    the use of RNNs in medical applications is ethical and fair [119]. Overall, these
    challenges highlight the need for careful consideration of RNNs’ application in
    IoT-based bio- and medical informatics and the importance of addressing the unique
    challenges of this domain. As well, GAN has shown groundbreaking promise in generating
    realistic synthetic data, but they also have some limitations and challenges when
    it comes to their applications in IoT-based bio- and medical informatics. GANs
    require large amounts of training data to learn the underlying distribution of
    the data [120]. However, obtaining large amounts of annotated data can be challenging
    and expensive in bio- and medical informatics. This can limit the effectiveness
    of GANs in these applications. GANs are often used to generate images, but generating
    high-resolution images with fine details can be challenging. This is particularly
    important in medical imaging applications where fine details can be critical for
    accurate diagnosis. GANs are often viewed as black-boxes, meaning it is difficult
    to understand how they arrive at their generated output. In GAN models, the lack
    of interpretability can be a concern in medical applications where decisions based
    on generated data can also have serious consequences. GANs are well suited for
    generating images, but they may not be as effective for other types of data, such
    as time-series data or text data [121]. This can limit their applicability in
    certain medical informatics applications. GAN training can be unstable, with the
    generator and discriminator networks constantly competing with each other. This
    can make it difficult to achieve convergence and lead to poor quality generator
    output. GANs are a popular DL technique that has shown promising results in various
    applications, including bio- and medical informatics. However, some challenges
    still need to be addressed to make GANs more effective in these contexts, particularly
    in cloud-based settings [122]. However, GANs rely heavily on high-quality data
    for training, and data quality is especially critical in bio- and medical informatics.
    In IoT-based bio- and medical informatics, data can be noisy, incomplete, and
    biased, making it challenging to train GANs accurately [123]. IoT-based bio- and
    medical informatics involve sensitive patient data, which must be kept private
    and secure. However, GANs require large amounts of data to train, which poses
    a risk to patient privacy and security. Therefore, robust data security measures
    must be in place when using GANs in this context. Researchers must find ways to
    make GAN models more interpretable. One of the significant challenges in bio-
    and medical informatics is the availability of a limited dataset. The limited
    data can affect the accuracy of the GAN model’s results, and in some cases, it
    may not be possible to train a GAN model with a limited dataset. The healthcare
    industry is highly regulated, and GANs must comply with regulatory requirements
    to be approved for use. Ensuring compliance with regulations can be challenging
    when working with GANs, especially when dealing with IoT-based bio- and medical
    informatics, where data security and privacy concerns are high. In summary, while
    GANs offer significant potential for IoT-based bio- and medical informatics, some
    challenges still need to be addressed to make them more effective and acceptable
    for use in this context [124]. These challenges include data quality, data privacy
    and security, interpretability, limited datasets, and regulatory compliance. The
    MLP is a type of artificial neural network that is widely used in DL applications.
    While MLPs have shown promising results in various domains, including IoT-based
    bio- and medical informatics, they also have some limitations that need to be
    noted. MLPs are primarily designed to handle tabular data and are not well suited
    for processing sequential data. This can be a limitation in bio- and medical informatics,
    where sequential data such as time-series data or sequences of DNA are often used
    [125]. MLPs are prone to overfitting, which means they can become too specialized
    to the training data and fail to generalize to new data. This can be particularly
    problematic in bio- and medical informatics when working with small datasets,
    where overfitting can lead to inaccurate predictions. Considering black-box models,
    MLP models are not easily interpretable. This means it can be challenging to understand
    how an MLP arrives at its predictions. Interpretability is crucial in bio- and
    medical informatics, where decisions can have significant consequences. MLPs do
    not handle missing data well. This can be a limitation in bio- and medical informatics,
    where datasets can be incomplete due to various reasons, such as missing data
    points or unbalanced data [126]. MLPs can struggle with high-dimensional data.
    This can be a limitation in bio- and medical informatics, where data can be high-dimensional.
    While MLPs have shown outperformed results in IoT-based bio- and medical informatics,
    it is essential to consider their limitations and explore alternative models that
    can better address these challenges. MLP is a type of feedforward neural network
    that is commonly used in DL applications. When it comes to IoT-based bio- and
    medical informatics, there are several challenges associated with using MLPs.
    Although, one of the biggest challenges in the field of bio- and medical informatics
    is the limited availability of data. Data may be scarce or difficult to obtain
    in many cases, making it challenging to train MLP models effectively [127]. Even
    when data are available, it may be of poor quality. This can be due to noise,
    bias, or other factors that can affect the accuracy and reliability of MLP models.
    Referred to as black-box, it can be difficult to understand how they arrive at
    their predictions. In the bio- and medical informatics field, interpretability
    is critical, as doctors and other medical professionals need to understand and
    trust the predictions made by these models. Overfitting occurs when a model becomes
    too complex and starts to fit the noise in the training data instead of the underlying
    patterns. This can be a problem in bio- and medical informatics, where models
    need to be able to generalize to new data. In bio- and medical informatics, many
    ethical considerations must be taken into account when using DL models [128].
    For example, it is important to ensure that the models are not biased against
    certain populations or groups and that they are used responsibly and ethically.
    Overall, MLPs can be a powerful tool in IoT-based bio- and medical informatics,
    but several challenges must be addressed to use them effectively. Besides, Medical
    data often suffer from class imbalance, where one class (e.g., disease-positive)
    has significantly fewer examples than the other class (e.g., disease-negative).
    This issue can lead to poor performance of DL models and requires special attention
    to handle [129]. Real-time data processing is crucial in some medical applications,
    such as monitoring critical patients. However, DL models can be computationally
    expensive and may not be able to process data in real time. Thus, developing efficient
    DL models that can operate in real time is a challenge. The lack of standardization
    in healthcare data collection and annotation hinders the development of DL models.
    Different hospitals and healthcare systems use different protocols, which makes
    it challenging to create models that generalize well across institutions [130].
    Data sharing is crucial for improving DL models’ performance, especially in healthcare,
    where the amount of data is limited. However, due to privacy concerns and the
    lack of incentives for sharing data, sharing medical data is challenging. The
    use of DL algorithms in healthcare raises ethical considerations, such as informed
    consent, privacy, and bias. Addressing these issues is essential to ensure that
    the use of DL models in medical applications is ethical and fair. The development
    and deployment of DL models can be expensive, making it difficult to implement
    them in resource-limited settings. Moreover, DL models may require specialized
    hardware and software, further increasing their cost. In other words, the limitations
    of CNN methods in this context primarily revolved around their potential inefficacy
    in handling small or highly specialized datasets and the challenges posed by the
    need for substantial computational resources for training and inference, which
    could be a hindrance in resource-constrained IoT and cloud environments [131].
    Also, the limitations of RNN methods in this systematic literature review mainly
    pertain to their struggle in capturing long-range dependencies in sequential data,
    which is crucial in certain biomedical applications, and their computationally
    intensive nature, potentially posing challenges in real-time processing within
    resource-constrained IoT and cloud environments [132]. Also, the limitations of
    GAN methods in this topic primarily revolved around their complexity in training
    and potential instability, which may require careful tuning and substantial computational
    resources, potentially impeding their practical implementation in resource-constrained
    IoT environments, while the limitations of MLP methods in this systematic literature
    review primarily revolved around their relative inefficacy in handling complex,
    high-dimensional data and their limited capability to capture intricate relationships
    within biomedical datasets, potentially leading to suboptimal performance in certain
    applications. The limitations of hybrid methods included potential challenges
    in model interpretability and increased complexity in combining different deep
    learning techniques, which may hinder their practical implementation and deployment
    in healthcare IoT systems. These additional challenges highlight the multifaceted
    nature of implementing DL applications in IoT-based bio- and medical informatics
    and emphasize the need for a collaborative and interdisciplinary approach to overcome
    them. 6.5 Dataset in medical and bioinformatics using DL approaches The importance
    of datasets in DL applications in IoT-based bio- and medical informatics cannot
    be overstated. DL algorithms rely on large amounts of data to learn and make accurate
    predictions or classifications. In bio- and medical informatics, the availability
    of high-quality, comprehensive datasets is crucial for developing DL models that
    can accurately diagnose diseases, predict treatment outcomes, and identify potential
    drug targets. Furthermore, the success of DL models depends heavily on the quality
    and diversity of the data used to train them. A biased, incomplete, or unrepresentative
    dataset of the target population can lead to biased or inaccurate results [133].
    Therefore, it is essential to ensure that bio- and medical informatics datasets
    are diverse, representative, and of high quality. Moreover, using standardized
    datasets is critical for facilitating comparison and reproducibility of research
    results across different studies. Standardized datasets enable researchers to
    evaluate the performance of their models against others using the same data, facilitating
    the development of new and improved algorithms and methodologies. In summary,
    high-quality, comprehensive, diverse, and standardized datasets are essential
    for developing and evaluating DL models in IoT-based bio- and medical informatics
    [134]. They provide the foundation for the accurate diagnosis and treatment of
    diseases and the identification of new drug targets. The application of datasets
    in the field of DL for IoT-based bio- and medical informatics is crucial for developing
    accurate and efficient models. Without standard datasets, the models cannot learn
    and make accurate predictions. One of the key challenges in developing DL models
    for bio- and medical informatics is the availability of labeled datasets. Labeled
    datasets are critical for supervised learning, which is the most common approach
    in DL. This is because DL models need large amounts of labeled data to learn complex
    patterns and relationships in the data. In bio- and medical informatics, these
    labeled datasets are often created through manual annotation or by experts in
    the field. Many publicly available bio- and medical informatics datasets can be
    used for DL applications, such as the MIMIC-III dataset for EHR, the ImageNet
    dataset for medical imaging, and the PhysioNet dataset for physiological signals.
    These datasets have been used to develop models for various applications such
    as disease diagnosis, drug discovery, and personalized medicine. The usage of
    datasets in DL applications for bio- and medical informatics also requires careful
    attention to data privacy and security. Patient data are highly sensitive and
    must be handled carefully to protect patient privacy [135]. Researchers must ensure
    that the datasets used for training their models comply with ethical and legal
    requirements and that the data are de-identified before use. Researchers must
    carefully select and preprocess datasets, comply with ethical and legal requirements,
    and handle patient data with great care to protect patient privacy. In the realm
    of DL applications in IoT-based bio- and medical Informatics, the datasets employed
    are characterized by their substantial scale and diversity. For instance, a prominent
    study focused on cardiac arrhythmia detection leveraged a dataset encompassing
    10,000 electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings, each spanning 10 s and sampled at a
    rate of 500 Hz, resulting in a total of 50,000 data points per recording. Another
    noteworthy dataset in neurology research consisted of 500 patients with Parkinson’s
    disease, yielding over 150,000 data points per patient across various sensor readings.
    Additionally, a comprehensive dataset for Alzheimer’s disease prediction integrated
    multimodal data, including structural MRI images from 1000 subjects, alongside
    demographic and cognitive assessments. These quantitative specifics exemplify
    the rich and varied nature of datasets in this field, which play a pivotal role
    in training and evaluating deep learning models for bio- and medical informatics
    applications within the IoT framework. Recent advancements in high-throughput
    sequencing technology have provided the scientific community with access to vast
    biological datasets [135]. The increased availability of these datasets has led
    to the expansion of Internet web services, which enable biologists to evaluate
    large amounts of data online for scientific audiences. Consequently, researchers
    have been exploring innovative methods for interrogating, evaluating, and processing
    data to extract information about molecular biology, biomedicine, physiology,
    and electronic health records. ML has gained significant popularity in the computational
    biology sector due to its capacity to handle massive datasets and predict outcomes
    with high statistical accuracy [136]. ML algorithms are statistically based computational
    processes that can identify hidden models in a dataset and generate reliable statistical
    predictions. As such, ML has been utilized in various computational biology challenges,
    aiding scientists in discovering critical information about diverse aspects of
    biology. However, most biologists and healthcare professionals lack the requisite
    skills to undertake a data mining project, resulting in reluctance or avoidance
    of ML evaluations. In other cases, researchers may follow erroneous procedures
    when initiating an ML venture, resulting in flawed evaluations or a false sense
    of success. There are various approaches to leveraging ML in computational biology
    research to address these issues. Though it may seem weird, the most significant
    key point of ML research does not consider ML: it considers your dataset attributes
    and deployment. To begin, you must determine whether you have enough data to address
    this computational biology issue with ML [137]. Currently, in the big data age,
    with massive biological datasets publicly available online, this issue may look
    unconnected, yet it appears to be a big issue in the statistical learning community
    and field. Whereas collecting more information can usually be advantageous for
    your ML patterns, considering the least dataset size to be capable of training
    appropriately an ML algorithm may be tricky. Even though this is not probable,
    the best condition would be having a minimum of ten times as many information
    examples as there are data characteristics. The second crucial aspect to consider
    is the structuring of the dataset. In essence, this involves converting the data
    attributes into a standardized range, manipulating their input features, randomly
    reordering the dataset instances, refining and preparing the input dataset, and
    incorporating innovative generated characteristics, which will ultimately decide
    the success or failure of an ML study in a scientific assignment [138]. Due to
    each dataset’s idiosyncrasies and its specific scientific domain characteristics,
    datasets contain information crucial to their respective fields. Additionally,
    datasets may contain substantial errors arising from their researchers’ lack of
    expertise. Moreover, human curators may not always control annotations, and some
    may be incorrect. Further, annotations on comparable genes from various laboratories
    or biological research groups may differ and contain conflicting data. Such challenges
    can potentially impact the efficacy of an ML mechanism application. Considering
    the significance and the exclusiveness of every dataset area, ML research can
    succeed only if an investigator vividly knows the dataset details, and it may
    be properly configured before executing any data mining method. Managing biological
    datasets correctly entails numerous steps, which are commonly grouped into a phase
    called data preprocessing [139]. Moreover, it is often necessary to perform feature-based
    normalization of numerical datasets into intervals before ML algorithm analysis
    to bring the entire dataset into a standardized format. Hidden semantic indexing
    is a data retrieval strategy that relies on this preprocessing step for predicting
    gene performance annotation. It is a great data preprocessing tip to start with
    a small-scale dataset. Biology often involves large datasets with many cases [140].
    Therefore, if you have a massive dataset and your ML algorithm training is time-consuming,
    creating a small-scale dataset with a comparable ratio to the main dataset can
    significantly reduce processing time. Splitting the original large dataset allows
    you to assess and control your approach using a combined, limited dataset. Several
    datasets are available for DL applications in IoT-based bio- and medical informatics.
    Some of the best datasets and their applicability are presented in Table 10. Table
    10 Datasets and their descriptions Full size table Each of these datasets has
    unique characteristics that make them suitable for different types of research
    in bio- and medical informatics. For example, MIMIC-III is well suited for research
    in critical care, while the NIH Chest X-ray dataset is useful for research in
    medical imaging. Researchers can use these datasets to develop and validate DL
    algorithms for disease diagnosis, prediction, and treatment. However, it is important
    to note that these datasets have limitations and biases that must be taken into
    account when using them for research. 6.6 IoT applications using DL methods in
    bio- and medical informatics IoT applications employing DL methods in bio- and
    medical informatics constitute a transformative frontier in healthcare technology.
    These applications leverage the interconnectedness of devices and sensors within
    the IoT ecosystem to revolutionize patient care, diagnosis, and treatment. DL
    algorithms, renowned for their prowess in processing vast and complex data, are
    employed to analyze diverse biomedical data streams, including physiological measurements,
    medical imagery, and genomic information. This enables real-time monitoring of
    patient health, early detection of anomalies, and personalized treatment plans.
    Additionally, DL-based predictive models facilitate accurate prognostic assessments
    and aid in the development of precision medicine approaches [137]. Moreover, integrating
    DL with IoT technologies enhances data security and privacy, ensuring compliance
    with healthcare regulations. This synergy between DL and IoT in bio- and medical
    informatics holds immense potential to enhance the quality of healthcare delivery
    and drive innovations that could reshape the future of medical practice. 6.7 Security
    issues, challenges, risks, IoT, and blockchain usage The application of DL in
    IoT-based bio- and medical informatics poses several security challenges and risks.
    In particular, processing and storing large amounts of sensitive data such as
    patient health information raises concerns about data privacy and security. This
    is especially important in the case of medical data, where the misuse or mishandling
    of data can lead to serious consequences for patients. One of the major challenges
    is ensuring the security of data transmission over networks [141]. The use of
    IoT devices and sensors in medical applications raises concerns about the potential
    interception of data by malicious actors, leading to the risk of data breaches
    and cyber-attacks. Moreover, integrating different IoT systems and devices creates
    complex interdependencies that require careful consideration to avoid security
    vulnerabilities [142]. Blockchain technology has been proposed as a potential
    solution to mitigate these challenges and risks. Blockchain technology can provide
    a secure and tamper-resistant mechanism for storing and sharing medical data in
    a decentralized manner. The use of blockchain can also ensure that data are only
    accessible by authorized parties, and provide a way to audit data access and usage.
    However, there are also challenges associated with the use of blockchain in this
    context. For example, there are concerns about the scalability of blockchain systems
    and the complexity of integrating blockchain with existing systems [143]. Moreover,
    the use of blockchain in medical applications raises ethical and regulatory considerations
    related to data ownership and consent. In summary, applying DL in IoT-based bio-
    and medical informatics poses significant security challenges and risks. The use
    of blockchain technology is a promising approach for mitigating these challenges,
    but it also requires careful consideration and further research to ensure its
    effective integration and implementation in this context. Certainly, as mentioned
    earlier, security is a critical concern in the context of IoT-based bio- and medical
    informatics applications. Since these applications involve sensitive data related
    to individuals’ health, any security breaches can have severe consequences [144].
    One way to address security concerns is through the use of blockchain technology.
    Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology offering a secure and tamper-proof
    way to store and share data. It achieves this by using cryptographic algorithms
    and decentralization to ensure that the data stored on the blockchain is immutable
    and transparent. In the context of IoT-based bio- and medical informatics, blockchain
    can be used to secure the data generated by IoT devices and ensure its integrity,
    authenticity, and privacy. For example, blockchain can be used to create a secure
    and tamper-proof log of all the data generated by IoT devices, which can be accessed
    only by authorized parties [145]. Additionally, blockchain can implement secure
    and privacy-preserving data sharing mechanisms between healthcare providers and
    researchers. However, the use of blockchain in this context also comes with its
    own challenges and risks [146]. For instance, blockchain’s high computational
    and storage requirements may not be feasible for resource-constrained IoT devices.
    Additionally, blockchain’s immutability can make it difficult to correct errors
    or update data, which can be problematic in the context of medical data that may
    need to be updated or corrected over time [147]. Finally, the use of blockchain
    also raises concerns about data privacy and confidentiality, as it can be challenging
    to ensure that sensitive medical data are not shared or accessed by unauthorized
    parties. Therefore, while blockchain technology offers a promising solution for
    securing IoT-based bio- and medical informatics applications, it is important
    to carefully consider its application and weigh the risks and benefits before
    implementation. Utilizing IoT devices in medical settings comes with its own set
    of security issues, risks, and challenges that need to be addressed to maintain
    patient confidentiality and safety. Medical data are highly confidential, and
    unauthorized access or alteration of such data can have severe consequences. Additionally,
    wireless communication channels used to transmit medical data can be intercepted
    by attackers, which can compromise patient privacy [148]. One of the primary security
    challenges in AI applications in IoT-based bio- and medical informatics is the
    enormous amount of data generated by IoT devices, making it difficult to secure
    and manage. Consequently, advanced security measures must be developed by researchers
    to safeguard data from unauthorized access or modification. Moreover, medical
    data are generated in various formats and protocols, making integration and analysis
    difficult. This lack of interoperability between different devices and data sources
    presents a significant challenge in ensuring medical data security. Another challenge
    is the lack of transparency and explainability of AI algorithms employed in healthcare.
    Healthcare providers and patients must understand how decisions are made and why
    certain treatments or interventions are recommended. AI algorithms in healthcare
    also pose ethical and legal concerns, such as potential bias, discrimination,
    and accountability issues. Addressing these ethical and legal considerations is
    crucial to ensure AI’s fairness, transparency, and accountability in healthcare.
    Blockchain technology is a promising solution to these security challenges. Blockchain
    technology provides a decentralized, secure, and transparent way of managing and
    sharing data. In the IoT-based bio- and medical informatics context, blockchain
    can secure medical data, maintain its confidentiality, integrity, and availability,
    and provide a tamper-proof audit trail, thus enabling transparency and accountability
    in decision-making processes. Furthermore, blockchain can establish trust in medical
    devices and their data [149]. Its decentralized nature reduces the risk of a single
    point of failure, making it an ideal solution for securing medical data where
    trust is essential. Blockchain can also manage access to medical data securely,
    allowing patients to control who has access to their data and grant permission
    to healthcare providers to access it, thus protecting their privacy. However,
    blockchain technology in healthcare also presents challenges such as scalability,
    which requires significant computational power and storage capacity to manage
    large volumes of data generated by IoT devices. Additionally, the lack of blockchain
    interoperability standards makes it difficult to integrate different blockchain
    networks and medical devices. Researchers have proposed various security mechanisms
    for ensuring medical data security in IoT-based bio- and medical informatics,
    including secure communication protocols, access control mechanisms, encryption,
    and secure storage. They have also developed secure data aggregation mechanisms
    allowing medical data aggregation from multiple sources while preserving data
    privacy and confidentiality [150]. To address the lack of transparency and explainability
    of AI algorithms, researchers have proposed the use of explainable AI algorithms
    and AI interpretability techniques that identify factors that contribute to the
    decision-making process. 6.8 Upcoming deep learning models Several emerging DL
    models and techniques were gaining traction but might not have been extensively
    utilized in this specific context at this time. One such model is the Transformer
    architecture, originally designed for natural language processing tasks but showing
    promise in various domains beyond text analysis, including image and time-series
    data. Its self-attention mechanism and parallel processing capabilities might
    offer novel approaches for handling complex biomedical data in IoT-based systems.
    Additionally, few-shot learning techniques, such as meta-learning and transfer
    learning, were garnering interest for their potential to adapt models to new tasks
    with limited labeled data, which could be particularly relevant in healthcare
    scenarios with scarce annotated datasets. Furthermore, integrating explainable
    AI (XAI) techniques with DL models is an emerging trend that could provide valuable
    insights into the decision-making process of complex models, ensuring transparency
    and trustworthiness in critical medical applications. It is essential to consult
    the latest literature and conferences related to this field for updates on the
    utilization of these and other novel DL models in IoT-based bio- and medical informatics
    [151]. Considering the comprehensive evaluation of the studied paper in DL methods
    in bio- and medical informatics, there are still several open issues that we intend
    to discuss in the next section as well as some key research challenges and future
    works. Moreover, transformer architectures offer a promising solution to overcome
    the limitations of RNNs in DL applications within IoT-based bio- and medical informatics.
    Unlike RNNs, transformers do not rely on sequential processing, allowing them
    to capture long-range dependencies more effectively. Their self-attention mechanism
    enables simultaneous consideration of all input elements, making them highly adept
    at handling complex, high-dimensional data prevalent in biomedical applications
    [152]. This characteristic facilitates robust feature extraction, crucial for
    image recognition and time-series analysis tasks. Additionally, transformers demonstrate
    superior parallelizability, leading to faster training times and more efficient
    utilization of computational resources. This attribute is particularly advantageous
    in resource-constrained IoT environments where real-time processing is paramount.
    Furthermore, transformers have demonstrated impressive performance in various
    natural language processing tasks, suggesting their adaptability to various data
    modalities. As such, incorporating transformer architectures into DL applications
    in IoT-based bio- and medical informatics holds great promise for advancing the
    state-of-the-art in this field. 7 Open issues and key challenges In the previous
    section, we thoroughly examined the results. In this part, we look into open concerns
    and important challenges in-depth. The bioinformatics sector is a reliable source
    of a vast amount of daily patient data, predominantly in the form of hard copies.
    However, due to technological advancements in data acquisition devices, bioinformatics
    organizations are now collecting data in an electronic format [153]. The utilization
    of bioinformatics data analytics has the potential to bring about significant
    changes in the healthcare industry, enabling improvements in the diagnostic process
    and overall quality of care. Despite the considerable success of DL in various
    fields, such as protein structure prediction and genome editing, its application
    in computational biology has been met with significant challenges. DL methods
    often encounter problems related to a lack of annotated information, a lack of
    ground truth for non-simulated datasets, and significant discrepancies between
    training data diffusion and real-world test data diffusion, which can hinder result
    interpretation and benchmarking. Moreover, the use of DL methods raises ethical
    and moral challenges related to biases in architectures and datasets [154]. The
    increase in DL methods and data has made training efficiency a primary bottleneck
    for further advancements in the field. DL models are often regarded as inscrutable
    due to their lack of interpretability, posing significant challenges in medical
    applications where clinicians need to comprehend how the models arrived at their
    diagnoses or treatment recommendations. Ongoing research is focused on developing
    more interpretable DL models. Moreover, IoT-based bio- and medical informatics
    generate vast amounts of sensitive data, thereby presenting a significant risk
    of data breaches when using DL models, necessitating robust security measures
    to prevent unauthorized access, theft, or alteration of the data. However, the
    development and testing of DL models are restricted by a shortage of high-quality
    medical datasets. Furthermore, ethical concerns related to patient privacy, informed
    consent, and bias arise with the use of DL models in medical applications, necessitating
    the development of guidelines and regulations to guarantee ethical usage. In addition,
    integrating these models into clinical workflows and educating clinicians on their
    effective usage and result interpretation presents a significant challenge to
    their adoption in clinical settings. Another issue is the difficulty of DL models
    to generalize to new data beyond the training data, which is crucial in medical
    applications for generalizing to new patient populations or disease types. Addressing
    these open issues demands collaboration among researchers, clinicians, and policymakers
    [155]. If adequately addressed, DL models can revolutionize the field of IoT-based
    bio- and medical informatics, leading to better patient outcomes. 7.1 Key research
    challenges This section focuses on key obstacles in further detail. The success
    of DL in different subareas of computational biology relies on various factors
    such as the availability and diversity of standardized supervised and unsupervised
    datasets, the computational nature of the problem, ML benchmarks with significant
    biological implications, and the software engineering infrastructure required
    to train DL architectures. Addressing the outstanding issues related to DL patterns
    necessitates the development of innovative solutions such as improving model explainability,
    generating actionable and comprehensible insights, mitigating the ethical issues
    associated with DL models, enhancing efficiency, and reducing training costs.
    The DL and computational biology communities are developing innovative solutions
    to tackle these challenges [156]. 7.1.1 Explainability Perhaps one of the most
    crucial limitations of DL models today, particularly for clinical and biological
    applications, is their lack of explainability. Unlike simpler regression models
    in statistics, it is challenging to demonstrate the importance and function of
    each network node in a DL model. The highly nonlinear decision boundaries and
    overparameterized nature of DNNs, which enable them to achieve high prediction
    accuracy, also make them difficult to characterize [157]. This lack of explainability
    is a significant obstacle in computational biology, where the trustworthiness
    of a DL model is essential for sensitive clinical decision-making applications.
    It is equally important to understand why a model can make accurate predictions
    as it is to understand how it makes those predictions in biology. For instance,
    in protein function and structure prediction, we must understand the policies
    controlling a protein’s 3D geometry and attributes. Addressing these problems
    is crucial for providing biological insights and making practical decisions in
    clinical settings. In recent years, there have been numerous efforts in the ML
    community to enhance procedures for explaining “black-box” DL models. Many of
    these efforts have been applied to computational challenges in computer vision
    and biological applications. One of the approaches is activation maximization,
    which optimizes the model’s response by using gradient descent to offer an input
    that best represents a result. Normalization is done using closed-form density
    performances of the information or GANs that mimic information dispersion to make
    these inputs understandable to humans. Other techniques, such as the Taylor expansion
    for Fourier transform, use more direct approaches to extract insights from NN
    performance [158]. These explanations take the form of a heatmap that displays
    the importance of each input attribute. Another well-known process uses backpropagation
    to investigate the input features to which the output is most susceptible. These
    techniques have been used for cancer diagnostic prediction using DNNs, gene expression,
    and categorization. 7.1.2 Effective training Perhaps one of the most crucial limitations
    of DL models today, particularly for clinical and biological applications, is
    their lack of explainability. Unlike simpler regression models in statistics,
    it is challenging to demonstrate the importance and function of each network node
    in a DL model. The highly nonlinear decision boundaries and overparameterized
    nature of DNN, which enable them to achieve high prediction accuracy, also make
    them difficult to characterize [159]. This lack of explainability is a significant
    obstacle in computational biology, where the trustworthiness of a DL model is
    essential for sensitive clinical decision-making applications. It is equally important
    to understand why a model can make accurate predictions as it is to understand
    how it makes those predictions in biology. For instance, in protein function and
    structure prediction, we must understand the policies controlling a protein’s
    3D geometry and attributes. Addressing these problems is crucial for providing
    biological insights and making practical decisions in clinical settings. Effective
    training is crucial in the development of DL models for IoT-based bio- and medical
    informatics applications. DL models require large amounts of high-quality data
    and sufficient computational resources to achieve optimal performance. There is
    often limited access to large, diverse datasets in the medical domain due to privacy
    and confidentiality concerns [160]. Therefore, data augmentation techniques such
    as image and signal processing, or the use of generative models such as GANs,
    can be used to increase the size and diversity of the available data. Moreover,
    transfer learning, a technique where pre-trained models are adapted to a specific
    task, can be used to train DL models in medical applications effectively. This
    is particularly useful in cases where the available data are limited or where
    there is a need for the model to be trained on multiple related tasks. Another
    crucial aspect of effective training is hyperparameter tuning. DL models have
    numerous hyperparameters that need to be set correctly to achieve optimal performance.
    This process can be time-consuming and requires expertise in the field. However,
    the use of automated hyperparameter tuning techniques such as Bayesian optimization
    or grid search can significantly improve the efficiency of this process [161].
    In summary, effective training of DL models for IoT-based bio- and medical informatics
    applications requires careful consideration of data quality, computational resources,
    data augmentation techniques, transfer learning, and hyperparameter tuning. By
    using these techniques, researchers can improve the accuracy and robustness of
    DL models, leading to better patient outcomes. In recent years, there have been
    numerous efforts in the ML community to enhance procedures for explaining “black-box”
    DL models. Many of these efforts have been applied to computational challenges
    in computer vision and biological applications. One of the approaches is activation
    maximization, which optimizes the model’s response by using gradient descent to
    offer an input that best represents a result [162]. Normalization is done using
    closed-form density performances of the information or GANs that mimic information
    dispersion to make these inputs understandable to humans. Other techniques, such
    as the Taylor expansion for Fourier transform, use more direct approaches to extract
    insights from NN performance. These explanations take the form of a heatmap that
    displays the importance of each input attribute. Another well-known process uses
    backpropagation to investigate the input features to which the output is most
    susceptible. These techniques have been used for diagnosing cancer using DNNs,
    gene expression, and categorization. 7.1.3 Data security and privacy One of the
    most significant challenges facing the field of IoT-based bio- and medical informatics
    is ensuring the security and privacy of medical data. The data collected by IoT
    devices are often highly sensitive, and if it falls into the wrong hands, it could
    have serious consequences. Therefore, researchers must develop secure, privacy-preserving
    methods for collecting, transmitting, and storing medical data. This includes
    the use of encryption, access control, and anonymization techniques. 7.1.4 Interoperability
    and data integration Another significant challenge is the lack of interoperability
    between different medical devices and data sources. IoT devices often generate
    data in different formats and using different protocols, making it difficult to
    integrate and analyze the data. Researchers must develop standardized data formats
    and protocols that enable seamless data integration and interoperability across
    different devices and platforms. Data integration is critical to DL applications
    in IoT-based bio- and medical informatics. It involves combining multiple data
    sources from various sensors, devices, and databases into a unified dataset that
    can be used to train and test DL models. In medical informatics, the data sources
    may include EHR, medical imaging data, clinical notes, and genomic data. Different
    systems may generate these data sources and may have different formats, making
    integration challenging. However, integrating these data sources is essential
    to capture the full complexity of the patient’s health status. DL models trained
    on integrated datasets can provide a more comprehensive and accurate understanding
    of patient health, enabling more personalized and effective treatments. Data integration
    can also lead to the development of new insights and discoveries by enabling the
    identification of previously unknown patterns and correlations. However, data
    integration also poses some challenges. One significant challenge is ensuring
    data quality and consistency, as data from different sources may have errors,
    biases, or inconsistencies. Additionally, data integration may raise privacy and
    security concerns, as sensitive patient data from multiple sources may be combined.
    To address these challenges, data integration strategies need to be carefully
    designed to ensure data quality and consistency, protect patient privacy and security,
    and enable efficient data retrieval and analysis. 7.1.5 Real-time monitoring and
    diagnosis Real-time monitoring and diagnosis are crucial aspects of IoT-based
    bio- and medical informatics. The integration of sensors and devices with DL models
    enables the continuous collection and analysis of data, allowing for timely diagnosis
    and treatment of medical conditions. For example, wearable sensors can monitor
    vital signs such as heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation in real
    time, providing continuous data streams for DL models to analyze. These models
    can then identify patterns and anomalies that may indicate a potential medical
    issue, allowing for early intervention and treatment. Real-time monitoring and
    diagnosis can also improve patient outcomes by enabling personalized treatment
    plans. By continuously collecting and analyzing data on a patient’s condition,
    DL models can identify individualized treatment approaches that are tailored to
    a patient’s specific needs. However, there are also challenges to implementing
    real-time monitoring and diagnosis in IoT-based bio- and medical informatics.
    These include the need for secure and reliable data transmission, integrating
    data from multiple sources, and developing effective and interpretable DL models
    that can provide accurate and timely diagnoses. Real-time monitoring and diagnosis
    is a critical application area of DL in IoT-based bio- and medical informatics.
    This involves continuously collecting data from various sensors and devices, processing
    it in real time using DL models and providing real-time feedback to medical professionals
    or patients. One example of real-time monitoring and diagnosis is in wearable
    devices that collect data on heart rate, blood pressure, and other vital signs.
    DL models can analyze this data in real time and alert medical professionals if
    any abnormalities or anomalies are detected. This can help medical professionals
    make timely interventions and prevent adverse health outcomes. Another example
    is in medical imaging, where DL models can analyze medical images in real time
    and provide quick and accurate diagnoses. This can be especially useful in emergencies
    where quick decisions must be made based on limited information. Real-time monitoring
    and diagnosis have the potential to improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare
    costs by enabling early interventions and preventing adverse events. However,
    it also presents challenges related to data privacy and security and the need
    for robust and reliable DL models that can operate in real time. This requires
    the use of high-performance computing and advanced ML techniques. 7.1.6 Predictive
    analytics Predictive analytics is a type of advanced analytics that involves the
    use of statistical models and ML algorithms to analyze historical data and make
    predictions about future events. In the context of real-time monitoring and diagnosis
    in IoT-based bio- and medical informatics, predictive analytics can be a valuable
    tool for identifying potential health risks and predicting patient outcomes. DL
    models can identify patterns and make predictions about future health events by
    analyzing data from various sources, such as medical devices, electronic health
    records, and patient-generated data. For example, predictive analytics can be
    used to identify patients who are at high risk of developing a particular disease
    or condition, allowing clinicians to intervene early and prevent the onset of
    the disease. In addition to predicting future health events, predictive analytics
    can also be used to optimize treatment plans and improve patient outcomes. By
    analyzing data from previous patients with similar conditions, DL models can identify
    the most effective treatment options for individual patients and provide personalized
    treatment recommendations. Real-time monitoring and diagnosis can benefit greatly
    from the use of predictive analytics, as it allows clinicians to take proactive
    measures to prevent adverse health events and improve patient outcomes. However,
    it is important to note that predictive analytics is only as accurate as the data
    it is based on. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that the data used for training
    and testing DL models is accurate, representative, and unbiased. 7.1.7 Ethical
    and legal considerations The use of DL applications in IoT-based bio- and medical
    informatics raises ethical and legal considerations that must be addressed. One
    of the primary concerns is the privacy of patient data. As DL algorithms analyze
    large amounts of personal data, it is critical to maintain patient confidentiality.
    This requires strict security measures and protocols to prevent unauthorized access,
    data breaches, or theft. Another ethical consideration is the potential for bias
    in DL models. Biases can be unintentionally introduced in the training data, leading
    to inaccurate results or unequal access to medical care. Therefore, it is essential
    to develop guidelines and regulations to ensure that DL models are developed and
    used ethically and that patient rights are protected. Moreover, informed consent
    is another ethical consideration. Patients must be fully informed of the use of
    their data and the potential risks and benefits associated with the use of DL
    models in their medical care. It is essential to obtain informed consent from
    patients before using their data in any DL application. Lastly, there are also
    legal considerations related to the use of DL in medical applications. The regulations
    governing the use of medical data vary from country to country, and it is important
    to ensure compliance with these regulations. Additionally, liability issues may
    arise if a DL model produces incorrect diagnoses or treatment recommendations.
    Therefore, it is necessary to establish legal frameworks and guidelines for the
    development and deployment of DL applications in medical settings. 7.1.8 Human–computer
    interaction Human–computer interaction (HCI) refers to the design, evaluation,
    and implementation of interactive computer systems that take into account the
    user’s needs, goals, and limitations. In the context of DL applications in IoT-based
    bio- and medical informatics, HCI is an essential aspect that helps ensure that
    the technology is usable, efficient, and effective for healthcare professionals
    and patients. HCI plays a crucial role in the development and deployment of DL
    applications in healthcare settings. It involves the design of user interfaces
    and interaction techniques that enable users to interact with DL models and make
    informed decisions based on their outputs. For example, a user interface that
    provides a visualization of the DL model’s output in real time could be used to
    facilitate the interpretation and understanding of the model’s predictions. Moreover,
    HCI is vital in ensuring that DL models are designed and evaluated in a way that
    takes into account the ethical and legal considerations of using these technologies
    in healthcare. This includes ensuring that the models are transparent, interpretable,
    and do not perpetuate bias or discrimination. Additionally, HCI can help to ensure
    that DL models are used in a way that respects patient privacy and confidentiality.
    In summary, HCI is a critical aspect of designing, developing, and deploying DL
    applications in IoT-based bio- and medical informatics. It helps ensure that the
    technology is usable, efficient, and effective for healthcare professionals and
    patients and is designed and used ethically and legally. 7.1.9 Scalability and
    generalizability Scalability and generalizability are two important factors in
    the deployment of DL models in IoT-based bio- and medical informatics. Scalability
    refers to the ability of a system to handle increasing amounts of data, users,
    or processes. In the context of DL models, scalability is important because medical
    datasets can be quite large and complex, requiring significant computing resources
    to process and analyze. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that DL models are
    scalable and can handle the increasing amounts of data that will be generated
    in the future. Generalizability refers to the ability of a model to perform well
    on new, unseen data. In medical applications, generalizability is critical because
    it is essential that models can accurately predict outcomes for new patients.
    DL models are often criticized for their lack of generalizability, as they may
    perform well on the training dataset but struggle when presented with new data.
    Therefore, developing DL models that are generalizable to new patient populations
    and disease types is important. To address these issues, researchers are exploring
    new DL architectures and techniques that can improve the scalability and generalizability
    of models. For example, transfer learning is a technique that allows models to
    reuse learned features from one task to another, reducing the amount of data required
    for training and improving generalizability. Additionally, federated learning
    is a technique that allows models to be trained on distributed datasets, reducing
    the amount of data that needs to be transferred and improving scalability. Addressing
    scalability and generalizability issues is crucial for successfully deploying
    DL models in IoT-based bio- and medical informatics [163]. 7.2 Future works In
    this section, we thoroughly examine future projects. As an interdisciplinary scientific
    field, bioinformatics has become essential in aiding the study of “omics” areas
    and technologies in life sciences, primarily managing and evaluating data from
    various “omes.” The massive influx of high-throughput biological information in
    recent years, due to technological advancements in “omic” areas, has highlighted
    the necessity and importance of bioinformatics resources for the analysis of large
    and complex datasets. To meet this demand, there is a significant need for a new
    generation of highly qualified scientists with cross-disciplinary knowledge and
    skills, capable of using complex systems, software, and algorithms to manage and
    interpret sophisticated biological data. To achieve this goal, there are various
    resources available, such as international bioinformatics education and training
    platforms, web-based courses, workshops, research conferences, and online education.
    However, developing countries need more creative platforms, network and web access,
    educational technologies, high-performance computing systems, and better funding
    to improve bioinformatics education. In terms of research, bioinformatics tools
    must be developed to handle the increasing volume of high-throughput data from
    metabolomics, metagenomics, span genomics, and proteomics. Efficient tools are
    also required for genome annotation and assembly with high accuracy, which necessitates
    sequencing more genomes, polyploid species, sub-genomes, single-cell genomes,
    and tissues to produce quality data for programming approaches and bioinformatics
    algorithms. In the future, ML programs will be increasingly employed for both
    clinical and research purposes. Although ML algorithms have shown potential in
    analyzing images, their effectiveness is still dependent on the availability of
    computing resources. Additionally, human operators need to inspect and validate
    the output of ML algorithms, which can be a time-consuming process. 7.2.1 Multimodal
    data integration Multimodal data integration is a promising area for future work
    in the field of IoT-based bio- and medical informatics. With the increasing availability
    of diverse data modalities, there is a need for novel DL architectures that can
    effectively integrate and learn from multiple sources of information. Researchers
    can explore the development of new multimodal architectures that can handle different
    data types, such as imaging, genomics, and clinical data. Multimodal data integration
    can potentially improve the accuracy of diagnosis and treatment in medical applications.
    Future research can investigate the impact of multimodal data integration on different
    medical conditions and assess its potential benefits and limitations. Transfer
    learning has been widely used in DL to improve the performance of models in domains
    with limited data. Researchers can investigate the use of transfer learning techniques
    for multimodal data integration, where the knowledge learned from one modality
    can be transferred to another modality. As discussed earlier, interpretability
    is an essential aspect of DL models in medical applications. Future research can
    focus on developing interpretable multimodal models that can provide insights
    into how the model arrived at its decision by incorporating information from different
    modalities. The use of multimodal data in medical applications raises ethical
    and legal concerns related to patient privacy, data sharing, and informed consent.
    Future research can investigate these concerns and develop guidelines and regulations
    to ensure the ethical use of multimodal data in medical applications. Overall,
    the integration of multimodal data is a promising area for future work in the
    field of IoT-based bio- and medical informatics, and there is a need for novel
    techniques and approaches that can effectively handle diverse data modalities
    and improve the accuracy of diagnosis and treatment [164]. 7.2.2 Federated learning
    Federated learning is a promising technique that allows for distributed model
    training across multiple devices, without requiring data to be centrally stored.
    As such, it can potentially address the data privacy and security concerns prevalent
    in IoT-based bio- and medical informatics. Medical data are often high-dimensional
    and complex, making it challenging to develop federated learning algorithms that
    are both efficient and accurate. Future research could focus on developing federated
    learning algorithms that can effectively handle these complexities. Federated
    learning has shown promising results in certain medical applications, such as
    Electroencephalography (EEG) analysis and medical imaging. However, it is still
    unclear how well it will perform in other applications, such as genomics or clinical
    decision-making. Future research could investigate the performance of federated
    learning in different medical applications. Communication between devices in a
    federated learning setup must be secure to ensure patient privacy and prevent
    data breaches. Future research could focus on developing communication protocols
    that are both secure and efficient, allowing for effective federated learning
    across a wide range of medical applications. Medical data often come from a variety
    of sources and in different formats, making it challenging to integrate for use
    in federated learning. Future research could focus on developing techniques to
    address data heterogeneity, such as data normalization and data augmentation,
    to improve the effectiveness of federated learning. The ultimate goal of federated
    learning in IoT-based bio- and medical informatics is to improve patient outcomes.
    Future research could focus on developing frameworks for the deployment of federated
    learning models in clinical practice, including how to integrate them into existing
    clinical workflows effectively. 7.2.3 Explainable AI Explainable AI is an important
    research area in the field of DL applications in IoT-based bio- and medical informatics.
    Researchers can work on developing new models that are inherently interpretable,

    7.2.4 Transfer learning Transfer learning, a technique in which a model trained
    on one task is adapted for use on a new task, has shown great promise in medical
    applications. There is a growing interest in using transfer learning for medical
    image analysis tasks. By adapting pre-trained models on large general image datasets
    like ImageNet to medical imaging tasks, we can leverage the learned features and
    weights to improve the performance of the models on smaller medical datasets.
    Transfer learning has been successfully applied to NLP tasks by pre-training large
    language models like BERT on vast amounts of text data. There is a need for models
    that can understand medical language and terminologies in the medical field. Fine-tuning
    these pre-trained language models on medical text datasets can improve their performance
    on medical text classification tasks. Transfer learning has not been widely applied
    to time-series data in the medical field. However, with the increasing availability
    of wearable devices and IoT sensors that generate time-series data, transfer learning
    can effectively leverage pre-trained models for tasks like patient monitoring
    and disease prediction. In the medical field, obtaining large amounts of data
    from a single institution can be challenging due to privacy and security concerns.
    Domain adaptation techniques can be used to transfer knowledge from pre-trained
    models to a new dataset with a different distribution. This can be particularly
    useful for tasks like disease diagnosis, where the model needs to be trained on
    data from multiple institutions to ensure generalizability. As mentioned earlier,
    multimodal data integration is an essential area of research in medical informatics.

    Smart agricultureIoTCloud platformGreenhouse controlSTM32 1. Introduction Smart
    agriculture is an agricultural development mode that uses modern science and technology
    to improve agricultural production efficiency and reduce resource waste. With
    the growth of the global population and the impact of climate change, traditional
    agriculture is facing many challenges such as land scarcity, water scarcity, and
    environmental pollution. Under this background, smart agriculture emerge as the
    times require. It achieves precise management and intelligent decision-making
    in agriculture through applying advanced sensing technology, cloud computing and
    IoT [1]. Greenhouse agriculture is one of the most important. Greenhouses provide
    controlled environmental conditions that allow plants to grow at any time of the
    day or night. At present, the application of IoT in agricultural greenhouse management
    has become a hotspot of human attention. It has changed traditional agriculture
    which is limited by many factors such as natural environment, geographical location,
    and climate. Smart greenhouse control system can realize the development and application
    of smart agriculture. It can monitor and control aspects such as light, water
    flow, inlet pipe pressure, supply voltage, ground temperature and humidity, air
    temperature and humidity, and so on, in order to improve the agricultural production
    efficiency of greenhouse [2]. However, there are still some problems in current
    greenhouse agriculture. Since environmental parameter in greenhouse is usually
    set by human, such as temperature, humidity, light and so on. Therefore it is
    unable to accurately monitor and manage the environment and crop growth. In addition,
    productivity is affected by seasonal and weather conditions that limit greenhouse
    crop growth [3]. The Smart Agriculture Greenhouse Cloud Control System is designed
    to solve these problems in an IoT way, as shown in Fig. 1. Based on IoT technology,
    the sensor network can monitor environmental parameters and crop cultivation inside
    and outside greenhouse in real time. And it transmits these data to the cloud
    platform for processing. Cloud computing and big data analytics can generate appropriate
    control strategies on cloud platform based on crop needs and growth patterns.
    The cloud platform sends commands through control equipment, thus adjusting temperature,
    humidity, carbon dioxide and other environmental parameters in the greenhouse,
    eventually realizing precise control of crop growth environment [4]. In this way,
    crop yield can be maximized, resource use can be improved, energy consumption
    can be reduced, and stability in crop production and quality can be ensured. Therefore,
    it is an ideal solution to solve problems and difficulties of current greenhouse
    grow systems by creating a cloud-based smart greenhouse control system. It achieves
    precise monitor and control of the environment inside and outside greenhouse and
    the growth of crops through applying advanced information technology. And it improves
    resource utilization efficiency, optimizes production management, and improves
    crop yield and quality. Smart agricultural greenhouse cloud control system can
    bring high economic benefits to farmers, reduce environmental harm and promote
    sustainable development of agriculture [5]. This paper aims to design a smart
    agricultural greenhouse cloud control system based on IOT to achieve the above
    objectives. The system workflow is as follows. Firstly, environmental data be
    collected by STM32 microcontroller, wireless communication module, sensors and
    other devices. Then, ESP8266 WiFi module transmits the data to AliCloud’s interface,
    and these data are visualized on the cloud. Finally, the user can connect to the
    cloud by cell phone or computer to view greenhouse environmental conditions in
    real time. Through the above research methodology and experimental design, we
    hope to derive the effect of smart agriculture greenhouse cloud control system
    to improve greenhouse agricultural production efficiency, save energy, change
    crops growth environment and other aspects. It provides a useful reference for
    the development of IoT and smart agriculture. Download : Download high-res image

    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 highlights related
    work that has been done and is in progress in the area of greenhouse control.
    Section 3 discusses the various components used in the proposed system. Section
    4 describes the architecture and implementation of the system. Experimental results
    of the proposed work are given in Section 5. Section 6 discusses the conclusions
    and future scope. 2. Related work Smart greenhouse control is a very interesting
    research topic and researchers have been working on smart control systems for
    agricultural greenhouses. This section gives a brief description of existing solutions
    for developing the smart control of greenhouses. At present, designing and developing
    control systems by using IoT, has become a trend in the application of agricultural
    greenhouse management technology. It changes the situation of traditional agriculture,
    which is constrained by a variety of factors, including the natural environment,
    geography and climate. People have designed smart control system applications
    through IoT. It effectively improves environmental conditions inside greenhouse,
    which includes temperature, humidity, light intensity and carbon dioxide concentration,
    and other factors. So it has positive significance for improving crop yield and
    quality [6]. IoT agricultural greenhouse measurement and control technology can
    realize the automatic detection of agricultural area information. For example,
    we can set up wireless sensor nodes, information collection devices, information
    routing devices, solar power supply system and wireless sensor transmission system.
    In this way, we can monitor parameters such as soil moisture, soil temperature,
    air humidity, temperature, light intensity and plant nutrient content [7]. Where
    the wireless sensor aggregation nodes are created through IoT [8]. The system
    dynamically manages, displays, analyzes and processes the greenhouse’s environmental
    factors and provides visualization graphs for the farmer. Depending on crop need,
    system provides information about various text, sound and light alarms. IoT greenhouse
    smart measurement and control system realizes automatic operation of the greenhouse.
    It not only reduces energy consumption and operating costs, but also provides
    an ideal growth environment for plants. In addition it reduces people’s work intensity
    and improves equipment utilization. It also improves greenhouse climate, reduces
    pests and diseases, and increases crop yields [9]. Greenhouse farms still face
    many challenges in terms of efficient operation and management. Continuously evolving
    IoT technology, including smart sensor, device, network topology, big data analytic,
    and smart decision-making, is recognized as a solution to solve major challenges
    in greenhouse agriculture. For example, it is used in greenhouse local climate
    control, crop growth monitoring and crop reaping [10]. With agricultural informatization
    level constantly improving, Chinese greenhouse smart measurement and control system
    has made great progress in terms of technology and scale. However, we still have
    a big gap in the field of smart greenhouse control compared with developed countries,
    especially in production stability control, modernization and industrialization
    of supporting facilities [11]. Overseas greenhouses often use automatic control
    system to monitor and control greenhouse environments. These systems usually include
    sensor, actuator and controller. Sensor is used to monitor environmental parameters
    such as temperature, humidity and light. Controller sends commands to make devices
    such as ventilation and irrigation work to keep ideal environmental conditions
    in the greenhouse. Control methods use advanced control techniques, including
    fuzzy control, model predictive control, neural network control and adaptive control.
    Besides, it uses physical model-based control, state feedback control and control
    methods based on optimal control theory. They are all well known in improving
    greenhouse crop production performance, and these control technologies usually
    have strong data analysis and decision support capabilities. It collects and analyzes
    data about the greenhouse environment and plant growth. Based on the data, the
    system is able to provide accurate decision support and optimize management strategy
    [12]. In contrast, China’s greenhouse control has just started, and most of greenhouses
    are manually operated. There are fewer control methods, only traditional PID control,
    fuzzy control, neural network control and so on. Greenhouse data analysis and
    decision support levels are relatively low, and there is still much improvement
    space [13]. However, Chinese greenhouse control systems can be better adapted
    to need and actual situation of local agriculture. Since local agricultural organization
    and crop characteristics are different from other countries, China’s greenhouse
    control system is closer to the needs of domestic agriculture in terms of design
    and functionality. So it can provide more personalized and precise control strategies
    and technical solutions [14]. China is a vast country, farmers are relatively
    conservative in their thinking, and it is difficult to unify the standards of
    the agricultural industry chain. As a result, there are difficulties in collecting,
    analyzing, integrating and sharing information resources. In terms of agricultural
    production, small farmers are the majority. That is why it is difficult to unify
    scale, mechanization and systematization. The cultural level of farmers is generally
    low, so that the promotion of smart technologies and ecological concepts is not
    progressing fast enough. In addition smart agricultural technology development
    has three major contradictions and problems: resource environment, science and
    technology shortcomings, and institutional deficiencies [15]. In traditional greenhouse,
    climatic variables and other growth methods depend on the grower’s assessment.
    But smart greenhouse growing is a closed growing process where greenhouse is managed
    through information and communication technology (ICT). It improves quality and
    quantity of crops and minimizes human participation [16]. Emerging IoT technology
    offers huge potential to develop innovative approaches and smart solutions that
    can change the agriculture sector in every way. Therefore, combining IoT with
    greenhouse and transforming them into smart automatic greenhouse is considered
    as one of the most ideal solutions [17]. When the IoT started to emerge, some
    people started to research smart greenhouse. Li et al. [18] have proposed an agricultural
    greenhouse environment monitoring system based on IOT, combining the Internet,
    wireless networks, and mobile. It realizes remote real-time monitoring of greenhouse
    environmental information. The implementation method is as follows. Through ZigBee
    protocol, a wireless sensor network was built for collecting environmental information
    such as temperature and humidity. Finally, the collected environmental information
    was accessed to the Internet and mobile network through the control center, which
    realized the SMS heating and real-time monitoring of agricultural environmental
    information. However, when a text message is received, it cannot be immediately
    controlled accordingly. Such as when the temperature is too high, the vent opening
    size cannot be regulated immediately. Ahmad et al. [19] have proposed a method
    for greenhouse management and monitoring using Memsic and Zigbee technology. The
    system can monitor soil temperature and humidity, air temperature, and light radiation.
    All sensors are able to collect data from the greenhouse and send it to the microcontroller
    on a regular basis. Data is sent from transmitter to the receiver and displayed
    on a device such as smartphone, laptop or PDA. It uses MP Lab and LabView softwares
    in programming and interfacing process. Although the system can monitor the growing
    environment of the greenhouse through the device, it cannot control greenhouse
    remotely. With the development of IoT, more and more programs are proposed. Cao
    et al. [20] proposed a wireless agricultural monitoring platform by Mesh Wi-Fi
    network. The system consists of a root node, three relays and six nodes. Each
    node has three sensors for measuring parameters, including soil moisture and soil
    temperature, ambient temperature and ambient humidity of the farm, and light intensity.
    The collected data is transferred from the node to the root node, then updated
    to the cloud database and displayed on the dashboard. The MEAN stack-based site
    will create real-time information tracking and keep historical data for the owner.
    However, the system does not have a complete cloud-based platform, so it cannot
    remotely control greenhouse operations by Internet. The system built through wireless
    sensor networks and cloud platforms works extremely well. Ping et al. [21] have
    proposed an IoT and ARM-based framework for soil moisture control and irrigation
    management. In this system, the values obtained by the sensors are stored on a
    cloud server and necessary suggestions are provided over the web. When the ground
    temperature is high and soil moisture is low, an automatic irrigation system is
    triggered and the user is also notified by email. Users can easily monitor the
    irrigation system through the cloud server and mobile web application. Jing et
    al. [22] have proposed a distributed agricultural service system that integrates
    social and physical information in order to provide decision support from farmers.
    The system uses wireless sensor networks, cloud computing, and distributed systems
    architecture to manage people, plots, crops, and equipment. Services include crop
    planning, production guidance, and equipment control. User terminals include computers,
    mobile applications and applets. 3. Components used in the proposed system The
    composition of a control system needs to have controller, sensor, actuator, controlled
    object. In addition, it also needs communication module, display module and so
    on. They work together to form a perfect control system. The proposed system provides
    a cost-effective solution for detecting environmental conditions in greenhouses,
    which can be controlled automatically or manually remotely through the Internet.
    According to the current price, accuracy, and ease of use of controllers and sensors;
    the applicability and difficulty of compiling software; and the price and applicability
    of cloud platforms, we choose following components. But users can choose higher
    accuracy sensors or faster speed controllers depending on the specific use situation,
    which of course means a higher price. 3.1. STM32F407ZGT6 microcontroller The STM32F407ZGT6
    is a microcontroller unit based on a high-performance ARM Cortex-M4 32-bit RISC
    core operating at up to 168MHz. Cortex-M4 core has a floating point unit (FPU)

    sensor The sensing part of the wind speed sensor is formed by three conical or
    hemispherical empty cups [25]. Three hemispherical or conical hollow cup shells
    are fixed to a trident star-shaped bracket at to each other or to a cross-shaped
    bracket at to each other. The bracket made of plastic or alloy. The inductive
    part is connected to an engine. The empty cup rotates, driving the engine rotor
    to produce current. When the rotor is faster, the current is higher and the voltage
    at the ends of the generator is higher. The wind speed sensor is connected to
    the microcontroller through a connecting wire, which is used to measure the voltage
    across the sensor and then obtain the actual wind speed. Based on the wind speed,
    the wind level at that time is obtained through a self-writing program. The wind
    speed sensor output voltage signal and wind speed calculation formula is shown
    in Eq. (1): (1) where means wind speed in , means voltage in . 3.4. Raindrop sensor
    The sensor is made of high-quality FR-04 double-sided material with a large area
    of , and its surface is treated with nickel-plating technology [26]. Therefore,
    the module has excellent performance in terms of oxidation resistance, electrical
    conductivity, and longevity. In addition, the module is capable of data transfer
    via digital and analog. 3.5. DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor The DHT11 is
    an integrated temperature and humidity sensor that includes a moisture-measuring
    element and a temperature-measuring element [27]. The communication method between
    the DHT11 and the microcontroller is single bus communication, so that only one
    data line is required to achieve communication with the microcontroller. In addition,
    the DHT11 has very low power consumption. When the operating voltage is 5 , the
    average maximum current is 0.5 . 3.6. BH1750FVI digital illuminance sensor The
    BH1750FVI digital illuminance sensor module is a digital integrated circuit for
    serial bus interface. It uses the IIC communication protocol, operates on DC5
    , and its input illumination range is from 1 to 65 535 [28]. 3.7. SGP30 gas sensor
    The SGP30 is a gas sensor that provides detailed information on actual air quality
    level or concentration, such as ppm for airborne CO and actual level of volatile
    organic compound [29]. The module has excellent long-term stability, resistance
    to contamination caused by silicone, TVOC output, and H2-based CO equivalent output.
    3.8. Wireless communication module NRF24L01 The NRF24L01 is a wireless communication
    module with FSK modulation and NORDIC Enhanced Short Burst Protocol. It supports
    point-to-point or point-to-multipoint wireless communication up to six nodes.
    The communication band is 2.4G, and the communication rate is up to 2 Mbps. The
    module adopts the highly efficient GFSK modulation method, which has strong anti-interference
    ability. It can realize the requirements of multipoint or specific frequency modulation
    communication in 126 selectable channels. The features and benefits of the module
    are summed up below: • Long wireless communication range. The NRF24L01 module
    supports the 2.4 GHz ISM band. It has adjustable communication range that can
    reach about 100 m in the best case. • Reliable and stable. NRF24L01 module adopts
    frequency hopping technology. It has strong anti-interference and stability performance.
    It can keep excellent communication quality in complex wireless environment. •
    Fast response time. The NRF24L01 module has fast switching times and transmission
    rates up to 2 Mbps. Thus, it is well adapted for real-time data transmission and
    applications that requires fast response times. • Multinode communication. The
    NRF24L01 module supports multinode network communication. It can achieve communication
    modes of point-to-point, point-to-multipoint and multipoint-to-multipoint. As
    a result, it can flexibly adapt to the needs of various communication topologies.
    • Simple interface. NRF24L01 module connects to the microcontroller with simple
    interface that uses SPI communication protocol. Therefore small number of I/O
    pins can realize communication with external controller. • Cost-effective. The
    NRF24L01 module offers excellent performance and price ratio. It is one of the
    cost-effective wireless communication solutions for many IoT and embedded applications.
    Although 2.4 GHz frequency wireless communication has high penetration power,
    the communication distance is relatively short. In practical applications, when
    communication distance exceeds 100 m, it may encounter problem that data cannot
    be reliably received. For longer communication distances, LORA communication module
    with 433 MHz frequency can be considered as an alternative to NRF24L01. LORA technology
    has a larger communication range that can reach several kilometers or even farther.
    However, it is important to note that as an alternative, LORA communication module
    can be more expensive, it costs three times as much as NRF24L01. 3.9. ATK-ESP8266
    WiFi module The ATK-ESP8266 is a high-performance UART-WiFi module [30]. The communication
    modes are as follows. ATK-ESP8266 module communicates data with a microcontroller
    through serial port communication and can realize transformation between serial
    port and WiFi. After configuring the serial port, this module can transmit data
    through the network. For example, when the module is configured with relevant
    parameters through AT commands, it can connect to WiFi. After that it can connect
    to the cloud based on domain name, protocol of the cloud platform. In addition
    the selected ESP8266 module can be replaced by 4G DTU in case of higher requirements.
    But the price is several times of ESP8266. 3.10. TFTLCD screen TFTLCD, also called
    Thin-Film Transistor Liquid-Crystal Display, is a flat panel display made using
    thin-film transistor technology and liquid crystal display technology. It consists
    of thin-film transistor array, liquid crystal material layer, color filter layer
    and backlight. The liquid crystal display (LCD) has a thin-film transistor (TFT)
    set on each pixel. Which can effectively avoid crosstalk during non-selective,
    and make the static characteristics of LCD independent of the number of scanning
    lines. Thus the image quality is greatly improved. TFTLCD has the following characteristics:
    high resolution, good color performance, wide viewing angle, fast response time,
    low power consumption. We chose the size of 7-inch screen, which resolution is
    800 × 480, with 16-bit true color display. 3.11. Keil5 development software Keil5
    is an embedded system development tool. It provides a complete programming environment.
    It includes code editor, debugger, compiler, emulator and downloader. In addition,
    it supports many different microcontroller architectures such as ARM, Cortex-M
    and 8051. All in all, Keil5 is a powerful, easy to use embedded software development
    tool that helps developers quickly build high quality embedded systems. 3.12.

    provided by AliCloud. It provides a series of technologies and tools, and it supports
    the access, management and data interaction of IoT devices. It is widely used
    in the field of IoT and can support IoT applications in a variety of fields such
    as smart home, smart industry, and smart transportation. Users can realize a variety
    of business needs, such as device interconnection, data sharing, intelligent analysis,
    and so on, through the AliCloud IoT platform. Which effectively improves the intelligence
    and sustainability of IoT applications. 4. Architecture and implementation The
    architecture of the proposed system is shown in Fig. 2. It consists of four parts:
    sensor acquisition control network, network transmitter, application platform,
    and greenhouse equipment management. Sensor acquisition control network collects
    the environmental information in real time; BeiDou/GPS module performs the location
    positioning; TFTLCD screen displays the collected data, latitude, longitude, time
    and other information in real time [31]. The wireless communication module is
    responsible for information interaction with the network transmitter [32]. Network
    Transmitter’s role is sending the environmental information collected by the received
    sensors to the cloud through the ESP8266WiFi module. These information processed
    and stored in the database. Sensor acquisition control network and network transmitter
    systems use hardware as shown in Table 2. The application platform is built on
    AliCloud IoT platform [33]. After building the project and connecting the devices,
    we create various physical models and display the data on the cloud platform.
    Through data communication and information interaction, visualization platform
    is constructed on the AliCloud platform. It includes a Web-side visualization
    platform and a mobile-side visualization platform. We can access the Internet
    through a computer or cell phone, thus enabling automatic control the various
    agricultural equipment in the greenhouse. Sensor acquisition control network.
    The STM32F407ZGT6 is used as the main controller to obtain the air temperature
    and air humidity inside and outside the greenhouse through the DHT11 temperature
    and humidity sensor, get the light intensity inside the greenhouse through the
    BH1750FVI digital illuminance sensor, get the carbon dioxide concentration inside
    the greenhouse through the SGP30 gas sensor, get the temperature and humidity
    of the soil in the greenhouse through the soil temperature and humidity sensor,
    get the wind speed outside the greenhouse through the wind speed sensor, and get
    the rainfall outside the greenhouse through the rainfall sensor [34]. At the same
    time combined with BeiDou/GPS module for location positioning. The information
    obtained after comprehensive processing is displayed on TFTLCD liquid crystal
    display [35]. Through the NRF24L01 wireless communication module, the collected
    data are sent to the network transmitter according to the specified communication
    mode, communication address, and communication band [36]. Download : Download

    microcontroller as the main controller. In the environment with network, the ESP8266
    module can automatically connect to the network and AliCloud platform after the
    microcontroller is power on. The wireless communication module receives the data
    which is sent from the sensor acquisition and control network, and then it is
    sent to AliCloud through the ESP8266 module. The working condition is displayed
    on the OLED screen. Application platform. First of all, we need to write C program
    by keil5 software. That is, according to the information of ESP8266, we write
    AT command suitable for UART serial port. Then, microcontroller makes use of the
    serial port to communicate with ESP8266 module. The purpose is make the ESP8266
    module connect to Aliyun by successively receiving a reset command, a mode setting
    command, a WiFi connection command, and a connect to Aliyun domain name command.
    After that, microcontroller sends topic subscription through MQTT protocol. ESP8266
    connects through the Internet and sends relevant data according to MQTT protocol.
    AliCloud performs JSON data parse to communicate between ESP8266 and cloud. AliCloud
    distributes the data through data transfer protocol so that server gets a series
    of data streams. As a result, internal servers such as Web server are able to
    perform display and control operations based on the constructed visualization
    platform. Finally, we inserted component models on the visualization platform
    to connect physical devices and uploaded data. Table 2. Hardware required for

    data big screen control is usually used in larger scale data monitor and display
    scene. For complex data management and control need, big screen control can provide
    better operation experience and detail display. In contrast, the mobile control
    is less, screen size is limited, display of information and charts is relatively
    small. The big data screen in cloud control is usually fixed operation site. While
    mobile control has greater flexibility and portability. Users can monitor and
    control through mobile phones anywhere and anytime. According to specific use
    scenario and need, users can choose the control method that suits them. Greenhouse
    equipment management. First of all, the various agricultural equipment in the
    greenhouse needs to be networked with wireless devices in the 2.4G band, so that
    it can communicate with the network transmitter. TThen, the device can turn on
    or off by receiving data commands. For example, opening and closing of irrigation
    valves, size of valve openings, and extent of irrigation in a greenhouse are determined
    by soil moisture sensor, water level sensor, and webcam. For roller shutter control,
    the system has three phase motor switching control, insulation blanket position
    detection, data uploading, and so on. In the control of the sunshade, the system
    has shade and retraction control of the sunshade and so on. However, the above
    operation is difficult to construct a hardware system, so we constructed a ventilation
    control device. The size of vent is controlled by a stepper motor [37]. The stepper
    motor is powered by a switching power supply with specifications of 220 V input
    and 24 V output. The ventilation system performs motion control combining information
    received from the sensors and position data measured by the laser distance measuring
    module. In addition, ESP8266 WiFi module can receive information from the cloud,
    which enables remote manual network control. The exact control information and
    relevant data are displayed on the OLED screen. The control algorithm employs
    dual-mode control, that is, PID control and Bang-Bang control. The Bang-Bang ＋
    PID control algorithm has high dynamic performance and can reduce response time
    and steady-state error of system [38]. Meanwhile, the algorithm is simple to implement
    and suitable for real-time control system. The main controller is STM32F407VET6,
    which can receive sensor or Aliyun information through NRF24L01 module or ATK-ESP8266
    WiFi module. Based on the received information, the program combines the environmental
    parameters to calculate the adjustment data for the vents. This value is used
    as controller output [39]. This value is converted to the frequency of the PWM
    output. Finally, the signal from the controller is output to the stepper motor
    controller so that the stepper motor can be controlled. The hardware used for
    the vent control system is shown in Table 3. The Bang-Bang ＋ PID control algorithm
    is divided into two stages: When the system error is large, Bang-Bang control
    is used; when the system error is small, PID control is used. As shown in Eq.
    (2). (2) where -control output; -error between input and feedback; -proportional
    coefficient; -sampling time; -integral time constant; -differential time constant;
    -output of Bang-Bang control. is the switching function of the two algorithms.
    When 0, 1, system is used for Bang Bang control; When 1, 0, system is used for
    control. Table 3. Hardware required for vent consoles. Equipment Number Function

    and debug in a laboratory environment. In addition, we tested certain outdoor
    environmental factors in a natural outdoor environment. The working model of the
    proposed system is shown in Fig. 3. The experiment consisted of the following

    acquisition control network. Part A contains wind cup wind speed sensor, DHT11,
    raindrop sensor, and satellite position module antenna. Part C is the core part

    Part D is the soil measurement device (not shown on the left), which contains
    DS18B20 and soil moisture sensor. 5.1. Collection and transmission of environmental
    data STM32F407ZGT6 collects data from DHT11 temperature and humidity sensors and
    DS18B20 temperature sensor by single-bus communication protocol; collects data
    from light sensor and SGP30 sensor by IIC communication protocol; collects data
    from wind speed sensor, raindrop sensor and soil humidity sensor by ADC interface,
    and receives positional information from BeiDou/GPS module by serial communication
    protocol. Then, all of the above data are processed and displayed on the TFTLCD
    screen. According to the SPI communication protocol, the data are sent to the
    network transmitter by NRF24L01 wireless communication module. When testing is
    performed, the designed device is placed in a simulated environment. During testing,
    we found that the microcontroller module is able to work as expected. The system
    can detect the environmental data and display it in the TFTLCD screen. The Fig.
    4 shows the detected environmental data of the system in the simulated environment.

    and cloud big screen, they can both transfer and share data through cloud service.
    Users can share data on different devices. They can realize the function is basically
    the same. In complex control, the mobile device is no match for the network big
    screen control. However, for some simple functions, their realization is basically
    same. Mobile device control have some advantages compared to web big screen control.
    The mobile device is light and portable. It can be carried anywhere. Data can
    be displayed on mobile devices. Users can view the data anytime, anywhere which
    is not depend on a specific big screen device. As a result, it can meet the needs
    of users to analyze and make decision environmental data at any time. 6. Conclusions
    and future research work 6.1. Conclusions The model put out in this work aims
    to accomplish centralized management and automated control, both of which are
    significant goals. A centralized monitoring and control center is provided by
    this technology, which centralizes the collection of greenhouse data in real-time.
    Through the cloud platform, administrators may check on changes to the greenhouse
    environment, crop growth, and numerous parameter indicators whenever and wherever
    they want. The cloud platform offers remote monitoring and management of greenhouse
    machinery, including irrigation systems, temperature control, and ventilation.
    To achieve automatic modification of the greenhouse environment and enhance crop
    quality and production effectiveness, administrators can remotely set control
    parameters through the cloud platform. 6.2. Future research work However, despite
    the fact that the cloud platform can be automatically controlled by gathering
    data about the greenhouse’s temperature, humidity, light, etc., there is no combination
    of data analysis and algorithmic modeling in the cloud platform to provide correct
    cloud control. That is one way forward. The given information can be used to further
    improve the system and expand its usefulness on the cloud platform. In order to
    create more accurate models and offer more precise management solutions, the greenhouse
    data obtained is thoroughly examined and learned from. For example, combining
    crop growth models and meteorological data to predict future trends in the greenhouse
    environment. From there, factors like ventilation and irrigation are changed to
    improve crop quality and yield. Following this, the settings for irrigation and
    ventilation are fine-tuned in order to optimize both crop quality and productivity.

    indicators 1. Introduction The wastewater sector is faced with many challenges
    that result from ageing and inefficient processes, including substantial carbon
    emissions, high energy consumption, regulatory compliance failures, and loss of
    public trust (Borzooei et al., 2019). Unfortunately they are only being worsened
    by the impacts of climate change, urbanisation, and population growth (Haldar
    et al., 2022). Although a plethora of technologies have been developed in recent
    years to combat these issues at a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) level by academia
    and industry (Kehrein et al., 2020), water utilities are unable to make the required
    investment decisions to shift towards sustainable wastewater treatment. Decision
    support systems (DSSs) have been used to support complex decision making in the
    water sector, including WWTPs with the aim of optimising technology selection
    procedures or process control to improve operational performance (Wardropper and
    Brookfield, 2022). Wastewater decision makers have additional considerations compared
    with other industries, as on top of conventional technical, economic, and environmental
    issues, the social and regulatory implications of their actions must be considered
    (Ullah et al., 2020). Commonly public perception and social acceptance problems
    arise when utilising and recycling wastewater streams to generate resources (Kehrein
    et al., 2020). Water provision and sanitation services are also highly regulated
    and must be protected due to their importance for society, industry, and the environment
    (Preisner et al., 2022). Additionally, it is proving difficult to create markets
    for new products recovered from wastewater, such as tackling the end-of-waste
    status for their use in the European Union (Palmeros Parada et al., 2022). Therefore,
    water utility and WWTP decision makers are facing stricter regulations to improve
    operation regarding human health protection, environmental preservation, and emissions
    reduction (Mannina et al., 2019), whilst simultaneously pursuing greater circularity
    and revenue generation through resource recovery strategies to improve business
    performance. This creates complex multi-objective problems when operating and
    selecting technologies for improving WWTPs, which are traditionally labour intensive,
    trial-and-error experiments that rely on the judgement of operators (Ntalaperas
    et al., 2022; Sucu et al., 2021). To ensure that all relevant information, performance
    trade-offs, and cause and effect relationships are taken into consideration when
    dealing with complex problems, DSSs must be utilised by the water sector for more
    robust decision making (Ullah et al., 2020). A DSS is a computational system that
    assists the user in choosing an optimal or consistent solution to a particular
    problem in a reduced timeframe, particularly when the solution is unclear, by
    aggregating often conflicting values or preferences to examine the trade-offs
    between solution objectives (Giupponi and Sgobbi, 2013; Mannina et al., 2019;
    Wardropper and Brookfield, 2022). A review by Mannina et al. (2019) classified
    wastewater DSS intentions as; design, energy consumption, operational optimisation,
    improvement of effluent quality, or environmental sustainability. Of course, decision
    makers may want to investigate a combination of or all of these goals at once,
    which can often be contradictory (Eseoglu et al., 2022). For example, WWTP direct
    emissions and electricity consumption typically increase when improving effluent
    quality, however, this action negatively impacts any net zero targets. Therefore,
    when using DSSs to solve multi-objective problems the goal of the study must be
    defined with clear constraints for optimisation, and an adequate number of relevant
    key performance indicators (KPIs) chosen, to ensure the resulting decision is
    a true reflection of the defined goals. Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM)
    tools for selecting the optimal technology for a specific scenario have been developed
    in literature (Eseoglu et al., 2022; Južnič-Zonta et al., 2022; Sucu et al., 2021).
    Depending on MCDM application, the goals of the assessment will impact the KPIs
    used to constrain the decision-making process and final outcome. Conventional
    WWTP operation is monitored using effluent quality and consequently controlled
    with a few key parameters, meaning process control is often intuitive with operators
    unable to understand the real time impacts of their decisions (Ntalaperas et al.,
    2022). Another key area for DSS use in the water sector is online process optimisation,
    however, it has not been widely applied in WWTPs as improvements to sensors, mathematical
    models (soft sensors), and data visualisation are needed for precise operational
    monitoring and control. However, a combination of data-driven models and artificial
    intelligence enables performance prediction that can be used to reduce energy
    demand, decrease costs, improve effluent quality, and lower emissions (Matheri
    et al., 2022). Considering the transformation that WWTPs face to improve performance
    by reducing emissions, energy consumption, and operating costs whilst meeting
    stricter regulatory targets, water utilities are expected to become ever more
    reliant on DSSs to solve multi-objective problems for optimal selection and operation
    of sustainable technology. This study focuses on the use of multi-criteria DSSs
    to support these two functions for WWTP decision makers. Rather than focussing
    solely on their typology, analysis of the correct selection and utilisation of
    relevant KPIs during DSS application is prioritised, to ensure that outcomes fulfil
    decision maker requirements. This is a pertinent aspect of complex multi-objective
    decision-making and one which is often overlooked or undervalued by the methodologies
    in the literature. 2. Methodology 2.1. Wastewater sector goals Currently, there
    is a mismatch in terms of the decision maker goals and the KPIs selected when
    utilising DSSs at a WWTP level. Therefore, this section maps the wastewater ambitions
    of the European Commission which can be used to direct the utilisation of DSSs
    to meet water sector targets. The European Commission has directives which act
    as the framework for adequate wastewater treatment in the EU and are critical
    sources for understanding high-level water sector goals. However, in many cases
    they are decades old and do not reflect the regions recent sustainability ambitions
    (European Commission, 2022). The Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive (UWWTD)
    (91/271/EEC) published in 1991, acted as the basis for transforming European water
    systems by limiting pollutant levels in WWTP discharge. The Sewage Sludge Directive
    (86/278/EEC) was introduced for the correct use of sewage sludge in agriculture.
    It details the requirements in terms of heavy metal concentration, quantities
    of sludge applied per hectare, and the crops prohibited from application (Council
    of the European Union, 1986). Although the UWWTD and Sewage Sludge Directive have
    been successful in improving environmental and human health, as 92 % of wastewater
    is now treated satisfactorily (European Commission, 2022), the next generation
    of wastewater treatment must go beyond this to achieve the EU''s sustainability
    goals, whilst ensuring this fundamental objective is still maintained. To instigate
    further change to WWTPs, a proposal to update the UWWTD was published in October
    2022 with the aim of introducing new rules up to the year 2040 (European Commission,
    2022). This update will be key for delivering the European Green Deal''s zero
    pollution target and highlights many water sector goals that decision makers will
    need to adopt in Europe. It expands regulatory compliance to smaller plants and
    introduces binding energy neutrality targets for the sector, polluter pays for
    the treatment of toxic micropollutants, and minimum recovery rates for phosphorus.
    Additionally, improved data monitoring and usage are required for measuring and
    mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and micropollutants, and making KPIs
    public to improve benchmarking and transparency (European Commission, 2022). The
    European Commission is pursuing a CE to facilitate many of its sustainability
    targets, therefore, it published the CE Action Plan in 2020 (European Commission,
    2020). As part of this, the European Commission aims to intensify nutrient recovery
    from wastewater by establishing Integrated Nutrient Management Plans (Radini et
    al., 2023). Another key element is the development of Water Reuse Regulation (2020/741)
    to facilitate the circular use of wastewater effluents. The document provides
    a classification system regarding the technology required to achieve the contaminant
    levels for application to specific crop grades (European Parliament, 2020), relying
    on the use of Water Reuse Risk Management plans to ensure public and environmental
    health (Radini et al., 2023). WWTPs should improve effluent quality for the circular
    use of water, also reducing the quantity of raw water abstracted. Therefore, it
    is clear that for a sustainable and circular transition, WWTPs must focus on emissions
    reduction, resource recovery, and water reuse, and acknowledge the importance
    of proper data usage, to align with water sector goals at a European level. Analysis
    of regional government wastewater strategies is vital for creating useful DSSs.
    However, their it remains challenging to implement tangible decisions at WWTP
    level, as individual utilities have their own priorities based on local facets.
    Considering legislative constraints, sector-wide ambitions, and local factors
    can make the identification of priorities at a WWTP-scale challenging for decision
    makers. Therefore, rigorous indicator selection and usage is needed to ensure
    DSS KPIs align with stakeholder goals at every level of decision making, or else
    WWTPs are at risk of undesirable future impacts and events. 2.2. Article collection
    method 2.2.1. Research question There have been recent publications which discuss
    multi-criteria analysis (MCA) DSSs for the wastewater sector (Ddiba et al., 2023;
    Mannina et al., 2019), however they allude to issues that exist for the assessment
    and selection of technologies. Mannina et al. (2019) states that ‘sustainable
    aspects are incorporated in accordance to DSS developers, as there is no standard
    that can be applied while developing the systems’, whilst Ddiba et al. (2023)
    concludes that some sustainability implications are not adequately covered by
    decision support tools. This shows that a lack of standardisation has resulted
    in the development of indicator-based methodologies that do not fully consider
    the sector''s sustainability goals. However, the wastewater sector must meet the
    requirements set out in Section 2.1 in the coming years, therefore, this review
    systematically analyses the specific indicators selected, and how they are used
    by DSSs, to understand the impact on WWTP outcomes. This results in the research
    question of how are indicators selected and utilised in decision support tools
    for technology selection and process optimisation at WWTPs, and to what extent
    are sustainability and circularity pillars harmonised to meet decision maker goals?
    Additionally, the need to construct standardised DSS procedures to facilitate
    sustainability outcomes is highlighted, thus following literature review recommendations
    are provided to act as the starting point for this. The types of MCA used to facilitate
    complex decision making have already been the subject of systematic reviews (Kozłowska,
    2022), meaning the methods available in literature have already established. Therefore,
    they do not require further generalised study and is why the focus of this review
    is on DSSs implemented for wastewater technology assessment to understand current
    practices and provide recommendations for improvement. 2.2.2. Search strategy
    The evaluation of WWTP DSSs was completed using systematic review, following the
    guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses
    (PRISMA) method (Page et al., 2021). Articles describing multi-criteria, indicator-based
    DSSs for WWTP technology selection and process optimisation were collected from
    Scopus (www.scopus.com) and Web of Science (www.webofscience.com) databases. The
    configuration of this review required two independent searches to collect data
    using a combination of Boolean connectors, and a previous review in the area by
    Mannina et al. (2019) established the time series of 2018–2022. MCDM technology
    selection DSSs were found using the search term (“wastewater treatment” OR WWT
    OR WWTP OR sludge) AND (DSS OR “decision support system” OR MCA OR “multi criteria”
    OR MCDM OR “multi-criteria”) AND (selection OR identification OR KPI). Whilst
    the multi-objective optimisation DSS search used (WWTP OR “wastewater treatment
    plant” OR “wastewater treatment process”) AND (control OR operation OR monitoring
    OR optimisation OR optimization) AND multi AND (criteria OR objective) terms.
    2.2.3. Selection of studies Fig. 1 shows the steps taken to screen initial search
    results and collect articles used for review (Page et al., 2021). Results were
    exported to Mendeley reference management software for processing, and after removing
    duplicates 127 articles and 144 articles related to technology selection and process
    optimisation DSSs were identified respectively. They were then analysed to ensure
    the inclusion of only high-quality, peer-reviewed, original articles, thereby
    removing non-English, conference proceedings, book chapter, and review paper sources.
    Next, sources were primarily screened based on their title, and subsequently using
    the abstract and content in full, to establish the final list of articles. Technology
    selection DSSs were excluded if used for geographic location planning, source
    selection, resource allocation, performance assessment, or operation monitoring,
    and did not utilise multiple indicators for decision making. Process optimisation
    DSSs were excluded if only used for performance monitoring, fault-detection, visualisation
    tasks, load prediction, or sensor utilisation, and did not use multiple indicators
    to optimise control parameters. An additional six relevant articles were collected
    from a review paper by Mannina et al. (2019) investigating DSSs for WWTPs, to
    incorporate appropriate literature from outside the search time series. Download

    Flowchart of the steps taken during the article selection procedure (Page et al.,
    2021). 3. Technology selection DSSs The decision to invest in new technology at
    a WWTP is a complex and multi-faceted decision to fulfil business, sustainability,
    and regulatory targets. MCDM tools have been developed for this purpose, however,
    there is often little emphasis on linking the goals of the assessment with indicator
    selection, weighting, and scoring methods. This potentially leads to outcomes
    that do not truly satisfy all stakeholder and decision maker goals at regional,
    national, utility, community, or WWTP scales. Literature collected in Section
    2 is reviewed to understand conventional methods and highlight good practices
    regarding alignment of KPIs with DSS goals. Table 1 summarises the MCDM WWTP technology
    selection DSSs collected from literature, resulting in a total of thirty-one articles.

    Table 1 summarises DSS properties namely the technologies selected, aim, case
    study of application, and categories used to group assessment indicators. The
    four main technology groups selected using MCDM DSSs are; wastewater treatment
    (WWT), sewage sludge treatment (SST), water reuse (WR) and resource recovery (RR),
    or a combination thereof. Since 2018, the development of DSSs for the selection
    of RR technologies has emerged as a priority for decision makers. The aim of each
    DSS has been directly quoted from the source, as this is key to understanding
    specific goals of the DSS when selecting appropriate indicators to facilitate
    desired outcomes. Lastly, the categories defined when selecting indicators are
    provided, which is important for relating DSS goals to selected KPIs for technology
    assessment. The assessment category column in Table 1 highlights the popularity
    of using economic, environmental, social, and technical sustainability dimensions
    to group indicators. Steps of the reviewed MCDM DSSs are summarised in Fig. 2,
    including examples at each stage from the reviewed literature. Download : Download
    high-res image (486KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Generic steps
    of MCDM technology selection DSSs, including examples and techniques available
    for use at each stage. The thirty-one papers developing MCDM technology selection
    DSSs were categorised in Table 1 based on the type of technology being assessed.
    Selection of WWT technologies is the most common with fifteen DSSs, as WWT decision
    making is complex so selection of treatment methods is challenging. RR is the
    second most common focus, which can be attributed to the emphasis placed on selecting
    sludge treatment technologies for recovery purposes (usually energy). This highlights
    the desire of decision makers to make use of a resource that was previously considered
    a waste during WWT, reflecting the modern objective to enhance circularity of
    the sector. Four DSSs for WR technology selection have been developed, acknowledging
    that due to global warming, water stress is being exacerbated for many people,
    requiring more efficient use of water by decision makers. Lastly, two DSSs focused
    solely on the selection of technologies for SST, whilst only one was developed
    that combined technology selection for WWT and SST. It is critical to list the
    type of technologies being selected by a DSS so that the correct assessment criteria
    or indicators can be integrated. This is reflected by the low number of WWT/SST
    DSSs, as it is difficult to select criteria that are suitable for the assessment
    of both treatment technologies since their goals and expected outcomes differ.
    3.1. DSS goals To ensure that selected technologies will result in the benefits
    expected by stakeholders and decision makers, the aim of DSS application must
    be clearly defined. As shown in Table 1, the most common aims used vague and generic
    language for the selection of the most suitable/appropriate/viable/best-fitting
    technology in ten DSSs. Although this reveals the intention of the DSS, rarely
    are these terms explained in a way that enables the user to understand what these
    ‘suitable’ technologies may look like considering the scenario of application.
    This lack of direction limits wider utilisation of developed DSSs and could explain
    why most are not used across multiple case studies. Next, nine DSSs aim for the
    identification/selection/prioritisation/recommendation of technologies for a specific
    function, including non-potable water reuse or resource recovery strategies. Although
    this instructs the user with regards to the expected function of selected technologies,
    it does not provide any justification as to the reasoning for their selection.
    Third, the aim of seven DSSs is to select sustainable or assess the sustainability
    of alternatives. This is not useful unless a vision of sustainable wastewater
    treatment is defined by the DSS developers, as users cannot fully understand how
    to assess and compare the sustainability of alternatives (targets summarised in
    Section 2.1 are useful here). Evaluation/analysis of technologies utilising specified
    criteria, such as environmental or economic aspects is another common DSS aim,
    with three identified from the collated list. These highlight the assessment criteria
    used to select technologies but does not provide the user with adequate reasoning
    of why they should implement the technologies. Finally, two DSSs aim to optimise
    or find the optimum solution, which is difficult to comprehend unless the objectives
    being optimised are explicitly defined. Without a clear definition of DSS aims,
    there is a disconnect in user knowledge, as the aim is key for understanding why
    a DSS is implemented and selecting the correct indicators to facilitate desired
    outcomes or water sector targets. Therefore, vague language must be mitigated,
    and complete definition of aims is encouraged from DSS developers to help users
    implement technology selection tools correctly. 3.2. Indicator selection As discussed,
    selection of assessment indicators or criteria when using any WWTP DSS is crucial
    to ensure the chosen technology fulfils decision maker and stakeholder goals.
    Therefore, methodologies implemented for indicator selection by DSSs are scrutinised
    and summarised in Fig. 3. Download : Download high-res image (152KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Methods of indicator selection used by MCDM
    technology selection DSSs, with the number DSSs using each method in bold. Fig.
    3 shows that it is common for DSS developers to self-select indicators or provide
    a list from which users can choose indicators, with little methodological explanation
    given (An et al., 2018; Castillo et al., 2016; Chhipi-Shrestha et al., 2017; Chrispim
    et al., 2020; Fetanat et al., 2021; Garrido-Baserba et al., 2015; Gherghel et
    al., 2020; Južnič-Zonta et al., 2022; Renfrew et al., 2022; Srivastava and Singh,
    2022; Sucu et al., 2021). This results in a significant gap in DSS user knowledge,
    as they are unable to reason whether the selected indicators are relevant to their
    scenario of application. Data availability can be used to guide indicator selection,
    relying on primary data where possible or secondary data acquired through reasonable
    effort, such as modelling, whilst meeting data quality requirements. To improve
    the robustness of indicator selection, some authors define criteria or provide
    additional justifications to choose appropriate indicators from literature (Arroyo
    and Molinos-Senante, 2018; Attri et al., 2022; Liu and Ren, 2022; Molinos-Senante
    et al., 2014; Nkuna et al., 2022; Palma-Heredia et al., 2020; Sadr et al., 2018).
    For example, Molinos-Senante et al. (2014) reasons indicator selection using transparent,
    representative, relevant and quantifiable evaluation criteria, however, definitions
    of these terms are not provided potentially resulting in ambiguity for the user.
    More complete approaches conducted structured literature reviews for indicator
    selection (da Silva Junior et al., 2022; Leoneti et al., 2022; Lizot et al., 2021).
    Lizot et al. (2021) describes the terms entered into literature search engines
    to collect assessment criteria utilised by other WWT MCDM tools, and then lists
    specific information and data availability requirements applied to create indicator
    shortlists. However, only a short description of shortlisting steps is given which
    focuses on technical aspects (such as plant load, location, or size), rather than
    sustainability goals. Alternatively authors used knowledge of local factors to
    select appropriate DSS indicators from literature (de Almeida et al., 2022; Oertlé
    et al., 2019). Đurđević et al. (2020) utilised their own judgement to select DSS
    indicators considering the state of wastewater and sewage sludge management, socio-economic
    standards, and available data (from national databases) in the local area. Liu
    et al. (2020) provides an explanation of the local context for each indicator
    provided, such as using economic costs as the project may need some financial
    support from the community or process simplicity due to the lack of professionals
    for operation. This strategy encourages the DSS user to consider local factors
    during decision making, however, a more robust approach is to use local stakeholder
    perspectives as well. Some DSS developers recognise the importance of rigorous
    indicator selection to achieve desired outcomes by utilising external expert or
    stakeholder opinions, for example to screen assessment criteria from a longlist
    identified during literature review (Ali et al., 2020; Salamirad et al., 2023).
    Ling et al., 2021a, Ling et al., 2021b developed a method starting with a round
    of literature review to collate indicators previously used to evaluate WWT performance.
    The list is then refined based on key terminology mentioned during interviews
    (thematic analysis using Nviva software) with water company employees utilising
    the DSS. Eseoglu et al. (2022) employs the use of a questionnaire study by experts
    from across many roles in WWTPs from design to operation, and combines this with
    other information including effluent discharge regulation, environmental impacts,
    and design parameters. These DSSs acknowledge that indicator selection is an important
    part of strategic MCDM, and the combination of stakeholder views with technical
    appraisal of local factors enables the user to select indicators which adequately
    reflect their goals. Fig. 3 highlights that these more robust indicator selection
    methods are less popular, helping to answer the research question by reporting
    a lack of robust methods for indicator selection in most of the DSSs developed
    for WWTPs. The specific indictors selected showed that only two DSSs did not utilise
    economic indicators (Chrispim et al., 2020; Fetanat et al., 2021), with most the
    common being capital and operating expenditure, whilst others chose life cycle
    costing (LCC) (Chhipi-Shrestha et al., 2017) and net present value analysis (Lizot
    et al., 2021). Removal efficiencies of regulated wastewater constituents, including
    total suspended solids (TSS), chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen
    demand (BOD), nitrogen, and phosphorus, were commonly selected to determine treatment
    performance (Arroyo and Molinos-Senante, 2018; Eseoglu et al., 2022; J Ling et
    al., 2021b; Liu et al., 2020; Molinos-Senante et al., 2015; Silva Junior et al.,
    2022). Indicators of environmental performance covered GHG emission (Gherghel
    et al., 2020; Južnič-Zonta et al., 2022; Jiean Ling et al., 2021a), carbon footprint
    (Chhipi-Shrestha et al., 2017; Renfrew et al., 2022), and life cycle assessment
    (LCA) (usually eutrophication, climate change, and acidification) impacts (Castillo
    et al., 2016; Lizot et al., 2021). Effort was made to consider the social impacts
    of technologies, commonly their odour and noise aspects (Eseoglu et al., 2022;
    Oertlé et al., 2019; Sucu et al., 2021), whilst some quantified microbial (Chhipi-Shrestha
    et al., 2017) and ecological risks (Liu et al., 2020). In most cases, circularity
    indicators were combined with environmental KPI sets, including water reuse (Eseoglu
    et al., 2022; Lizot et al., 2021), resource or product recovery potential (Chrispim
    et al., 2020; Renfrew et al., 2022), and material circularity (Palma-Heredia et
    al., 2020). Lastly, technology energy consumption was one of the most commonly
    selected indicators, however, only a few DSSs consider renewable energy (Lizot
    et al., 2021), energy reduction (Durdević et al., 2020), or self-sufficiency (Palma-Heredia
    et al., 2020) dimensions. From this it is clear that DSS developers select indicators
    from across the triple bottom line to support sustainable performance, but there
    is a gap in terms of facilitating sustainability targets and circularity assessments.
    Few KPIs are explicitly selected to quantify progress towards the high-level water
    sector targets of Section 2.1 by failing to link indicator selection with targets
    such as GHG reduction, phosphorus recovery, or energy neutrality. This even includes
    those DSSs with the aim of selecting technologies for sustainable and circular
    actions, such as water reuse or energy recovery. 3.3. Indicator categorisation
    Often criteria or indicators are categorised to show user assessment priorities
    and indicate potential benefits or impacts of selected technologies. Table 1 defines
    the DSSs categories employed to separate indicators and shows that twenty of the
    thirty-one DSSs utilise discrete sustainability pillars. The most popular combination
    uses four environmental, economic, social, and technical (assumed interchangeable
    with functional, operational, or resilience) categories. Nine DSSs used a combination
    of other categories defined by the developers, and some did use sustainability
    pillars, however, they were combined to create hybrid socio-economic or -environmental
    categories. Many DSSs also utilise circularity KPIs, however, as mentioned in
    Section 3.2 they are categorised as environmental indicators. This is worrying
    as enhancing the circularity of wastewater resources does not directly correspond
    to improved environmental performance. This leads to a significant gap in decision
    maker knowledge as circularity indicators are being used to as a substitute for
    sustainability impacts. Therefore, DSSs with circularity objectives, such as resource
    recovery, need standardised assessments that use CE indicators to evidence enhanced
    resource circularity, supported by sustainability analysis to quantify wider benefits.
    This will facilitate technology selection that simultaneously meet the water sector
    sustainability and circularity targets detailed in the European Green Deal and
    CEAP. Some DSS developers created hybrid categories including socio-economic (Đurđević
    et al., 2020) and socio-environmental (Silva Junior et al., 2022), or combined
    environmental and technical categories together (Chrispim et al., 2020). This
    suggests authors may be unsure as to which categories some indicators belong.
    This is further perpetuated by authors placing the same indicators in different
    sustainability pillar categories. For example, WWT technology removal efficiencies
    have been placed in environmental sustainability (Liu et al., 2020; Lizot et al.,
    2021; Molinos-Senante et al., 2014) and technical categories (Eseoglu et al.,
    2022; Silva Junior et al., 2022). This may explain the increase in popularity
    of using the four pillars of sustainability for categorisation in recent years,
    as it enables delineation of operational and environmental KPIs, highlighting
    the desire of decision makers to understand the environmental impacts of potential
    technologies more clearly. However, this seems to result in some confusion regarding
    the objectives of certain indicators, such as GHG/carbon footprint, as Đurđević
    et al. (2020) defines this as a technical indicator, whereas Lizot et al. (2021)
    utilises it as an indicator of environmental performance. Similarly, odour and
    noise indicators are placed in both environmental (Sucu et al., 2021) and more
    commonly social categories (Eseoglu et al., 2022; Lizot et al., 2021; Molinos-Senante
    et al., 2014). These differences evidence the need to enhance sustainability/circularity
    assessment knowledge and develop standardised methods for KPI selection and categorisation.
    The popularity of indicator categorisation using sustainability pillars has led
    to some DSS developers using this method even when their defined aims do not refer
    to sustainable technology selection. To combat this, some authors generated their
    own indicator categorisation strategies. Fetanat et al. (2021) developed indicator
    categories using the water-energy-food nexus framework to view wastewater as a
    renewable energy source, which aligns with the DSS goal to prioritise energy recovery
    from WWT. Palma-Heredia et al. (2020) created an indicator hierarchy depending
    on the scale of the application, therefore allowing decision makers at regional,
    WWTP, and operational levels to prioritise certain indicators. Although these
    categorisation methods are not as established in literature as sustainability
    pillars, developing indicator categories which consider DSS goals may be a more
    effective way for users to understand the indicators required to achieve their
    aims, especially whenever sustainable technology selection is not the objective.
    However, it can be concluded there is confusion when categorising selected indicators
    and how this activity aligns DSS outcomes with decision maker goals. 3.4. Indicator
    weighting Weighting of indicators is a critical stage for DSS users, as it enables
    them to prioritise or mitigate criteria depending on their objectives. Therefore,
    the frequency of each technique used by DSS developers for indicator weighting
    is provided in Fig. 4. The MCA discussed are those currently employed by water
    sector DSSs and does not reflect best practices for multi-attribute decision making.

    Fig. 4. Methods used to weight indicators for MCDM technology selection DSSs.
    It is common for indicators to be weighted according to the DSS user, and then
    a weighted summation is simply calculated to create a composite indicator used
    to analyse technologies. Garrido-Baserba et al. (2015) and Palma-Heredia et al.
    (2020) develop DSS weights for indicators that are predetermined and fixed, and
    given equal weighting respectively. Although this simplifies DSS usage, this weighting
    system is not recommended as it does not provide users with the ability to tailor
    KPI impacts to reflect their goals, which can be viewed as undermining the principles
    of MCDM. Another method commonly employed by DSS developers is to allow users
    to define weights themselves, (Castillo et al., 2016; Chhipi-Shrestha et al.,
    2017; Južnič-Zonta et al., 2022; Oertlé et al., 2019; Renfrew et al., 2022; Silva
    Junior et al., 2022; Sucu et al., 2021), however, DSS users can be faced with
    >20 indicators so assigning weights without a structured methodology of comparing
    indicators can lead to inconsistencies during analysis. This can result in indicator
    weightings that do not align adequately with aims and lead to bias in the assessment.
    Therefore, techniques are employed by DSS developers enabling structured analysis
    of indicators using opinions of experts and stakeholders. The analytical hierarchy
    process (AHP) is the most common weighting method used by reviewed DSSs with eleven.
    AHP was proposed by Saaty (1987) for decision making influenced by multiple independent
    factors (Liu et al., 2020). It investigates the relationship between criteria
    to create a hierarchy from which they can be prioritised (Eseoglu et al., 2022),
    often utilising external experts and stakeholders to create pair-wise comparisons.
    Therefore, many DSSs reviewed use standard AHP for weighting indicators (Đurđević
    et al., 2020; Gherghel et al., 2020; Jiean Ling et al., 2021a; Lizot et al., 2021;
    Molinos-Senante et al., 2014; Nkuna et al., 2022). However, Ling et al., 2021a,
    Ling et al., 2021b reported rarely seeing extreme scores on the judgement scale,
    and when the full scale was used the threshold consistency ratio (compares the
    weighting matrix against a random matrix, acceptable value of 0.1) is often not
    achieved. To overcome the uncertainty due to imprecise human judgements or ambiguity,
    fuzzy logic is implemented (Eseoglu et al., 2022). Many DSSs employ fuzzy-AHP
    weighting (An et al., 2018; Büyüközkan and Tüfekçi, 2021; Eseoglu et al., 2022;
    Liu et al., 2020; Sadr et al., 2018), providing a structured method of indicator
    weighting whilst mitigating inconsistencies of human thinking. Apart from AHP,
    DSS developers integrated a variety of weighting methods (Ali et al., 2020; Attri
    et al., 2022; de Almeida et al., 2022; Fetanat et al., 2021; Leoneti et al., 2022).
    Arroyo and Molinos-Senante (2018) implement Choosing-By-Advantages (CBA), citing
    several improvements over AHP including that it does not assume linear trade-offs
    between criteria. CBA encourages DSS users to understand the differences between
    criteria and assesses the importance of these differences, as supposed to AHP
    which can create conflicting questions. The Best-Worst Method (BWM) used by Liu
    and Ren (2022) and Salamirad et al. (2023) provides a simpler weighting step for
    decision makers as the number of comparisons is reduced, improving the consistency
    ratio of results and removing much of the uncertainty during pairwise comparisons.
    Srivastava and Singh (2022) simplify weighting even further by employing the Full
    Consistency Method, minimising the number of comparisons to achieve consistent
    results. Lastly, some DSS developers recommend the use of ‘experts’ without actually
    defining whom this might include (Attri et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2020), collecting
    opinions from stakeholders with little knowledge of the investigated system or
    local area, leading to inconsistent results. Whereas Eseoglu et al. (2022) utilises
    expert opinions from every stage of WWT including design, construction and operation
    engineers, and Gherghel et al. (2020) acknowledges the viewpoints of stakeholders
    from six different specialities, such as political, environmental, and plant operator
    stakeholders to ensure the holistic collection of viewpoints. Therefore, stakeholders
    with a range of expertise that understand local factors for indicator weighting
    should be used to reduce bias and inconsistency. Generally, the majority of DSSs
    in this study rely on AHP to weight criteria, which is corroborated by other reviews
    in the area (Kozłowska, 2022; Zolghadr-Asli et al., 2021), potentially incorporating
    high levels of uncertainty. Therefore, to ensure better indicator utilisation
    fuzzification and consultation of relevant experts can be used to reduce uncertainty.
    Additionally, methods recommended in literature, not utilised by the water sector
    DSSs reviewed, to mitigate weighting procedure errors are the entropy method for
    objective weight assignment or analytical network process (ANP) to account for
    correlations between criteria (Zolghadr-Asli et al., 2021). 3.5. Indicator scoring
    A range of methods to score assessment indicators have been utilised due to the
    variety of scales and units of indicator results, and often the mix of quantitative
    and qualitative indicators selected. Linguistic (such as very bad to very good)
    or numerical (can be from 0 up to 10) series are commonly integrated to normalise
    results enabling their combination. Several DSSs rely on the experts used for
    indicator weighting to assign numerical ratings directly based on their opinion
    (Đurđević et al., 2020; Jiean Ling et al., 2021a; Renfrew et al., 2022), usually
    when there is lack of empirical data (Jiean Ling et al., 2021a). Alternatively,
    Fetanat et al. (2021) relied on linguistic terms to rate technology alternatives
    as the indicators selected were immeasurable (such as energy security availability).
    Literature searches were used to establish numeric ranges of indicator results
    for each technology assessed (Attri et al., 2022). Silva Junior et al. (2022)
    collected data from technical-scientific literature relevant to case study location
    and assigned the final result by calculating the mean of the data range found.
    Before combination of indicator results, they were normalised to a value between
    0 and 1 using the lowest and highest value observed for each parameter. Rather
    than quantitatively normalising values collected from literature, Liu and Ren
    (2022) utilised a linguistic scale of five from very good to very poor, whilst
    Lizot et al. (2021) created ranges for each indicator to assign a numeric value
    to normalise quantitative indicator scores. Lastly, a common method for assigning
    scores to indicators is to directly quantify results (except for the indicators
    which are inherently qualitative). It was observed that most environmental and
    economic indicators were quantifiable, whilst technical and social indicators
    were qualitatively scored (Castillo et al., 2016; Leoneti et al., 2022; Liu and
    Ren, 2022; Molinos-Senante et al., 2014). Quantitative calculation of each indicator
    investigating technology performance is recommended, as it incorporates specific
    details and local factors of the case study. Relying on the judgement of DSS users
    or external experts enables uncertainty through the ambiguity or bias of human
    decision making to incorrectly score technologies. Furthermore, the use of values
    extracted from literature can mitigate the influence of local factors which can
    be pertinent for economic and technical indicators. Of course, when using qualitative
    indicators to investigate social aspects, local stakeholder views should be used
    to score technologies, due to their greater understanding of potential impacts
    in a given region. 3.6. Ranking The final step is to rank technologies for selecting
    the technology which supposedly best meets user requirements. Palma-Heredia et
    al. (2020) presents KPI results and recommends the DSS user to complete pairwise
    comparisons for technology selection. Although this is a simple method of completing
    the final ranking, extensive indicator lists create complexity and inconsistencies
    in user judgement. Therefore, the most common method of technology ranking employed
    by DSS developers is to create a composite indicator using the weighted sum method
    (Castillo et al., 2016; de Almeida et al., 2022; Garrido-Baserba et al., 2015;
    Gherghel et al., 2020; Liu and Ren, 2022; Molinos-Senante et al., 2014). This
    synthesises indicator scores and their corresponding weights into a single performance
    index used to rank and select technologies (Jiean Ling et al., 2021a). In the
    cases where multiple experts or stakeholders are used to weight or score assessment
    indicators, systematic analysis of results is needed to rank and select technologies.
    The technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS)
    is commonly coupled with AHP. TOPSIS selects the best alternative based on the
    shortest distance to the ideal solution and the farthest distance from the negative-ideal
    solution in geometric terms (Južnič-Zonta et al., 2022), to intensify the correctness
    and validate selection of the most appropriate technology (Nkuna et al., 2022).
    When fuzzification of data has occurred during indicator weighting, to improve
    the robustness of outcomes, this can be continued to complete fuzzy-TOPSIS (Attri
    et al., 2022; Büyüközkan and Tüfekçi, 2021; Eseoglu et al., 2022; Liu et al.,
    2020; Sadr et al., 2018). Another method employed to overcome the uncertainty
    of comparative analysis, is fuzzy-VIKOR as used by Ali et al. (2020), which utilises
    positive and negative characteristics to define compromises when conflicting views
    cause issues with decision making. This is achieved by calculating three variables
    to establish the summation and maximum distance from the best value, which are
    then combined to calculate an overall score. Alternatively, Leoneti et al. (2022)
    implements game theory to determine the preferred option from the list of acceptable
    outcomes, selecting the technology that maximises the Nash equilibria social welfare
    function. Lastly, Fetanat et al. (2021) utilised the linear assignment method
    (LAM) to rank technologies for energy recovery from WWTs. This method is chosen
    as it ranks alternatives according to conflicting criteria, by analysing the trade-offs
    between the ranking of each indicator for each technology. Therefore, LAM may
    be beneficial as wastewater and sewage sludge treatment shifts to prioritise other
    functions, such as resource recovery or water reuse. Studies in this area agree
    that TOPSIS is the most common ranking procedure (Štilić and Puška, 2023), however,
    best practice depends on the scenario of application. Methods such as PROMETHEE
    and ELECTRE are suited to handle conflicting stakeholder priorities (Štilić and
    Puška, 2023), whereas fuzzy logic and use of experts from as many specialities
    as possible should be used to tackle subjective ranking issues (Garcia-Garcia,
    2022). 3.7. Uncertainty There are various types of uncertainty that exist in MCDM
    that can arise at each step of DSS utilisation resulting from: variation, ambiguity,
    and incomplete preferences of human inputs; lack of system, parameter, data, external
    factor, or model knowledge; and prediction of outcomes or future events (climatic
    or socio-economic changes) (Walling and Vaneeckhaute, 2020). There are many methods
    to deal with MCDM uncertainty, one being fuzzification of scoring, weighting,
    and ranking procedures reliant on human judgement, as previously discussed in
    3.4 Indicator weighting, 3.5 Indicator scoring, 3.6 Ranking. Alternatively, sensitivity
    analysis is able to provide decision makers with insights into the uncertainty
    resulting from erroneous modelling of the assessed system or potential/future
    scenarios. Scenario investigation is a widely applied method of sensitivity analysis,
    in which MCDM indicator weighting is altered to reflect different viewpoints or
    future situations. For example, Molinos-Senante et al. (2014) and Salamirad et
    al. (2023) conducted scenario analysis by favourably weighting environmental,
    economic, and social KPIs in turn, validating the selected technology (constructed
    wetlands and integrated fixed-film activated sludge respectively) still ranked
    highest under alternative weighting schemes. Alternatively, Renfrew et al. (2022)
    improved the robustness of technology selection by weighting KPIs based on potential
    future scenarios, including legislative changes for emissions compliance and carbon
    footprint reduction, and selecting technologies based on their average performance
    across the scenarios. Furthermore, global sensitivity analysis (GSA) was utilised
    to verify that technology ranking is robust to fluctuating inputs over a ±10 %
    range and investigate which parameter''s uncertainty have the largest impact on
    MCDM outcomes, educating future assessments (Renfrew et al., 2022). Lastly, Južnič-Zonta
    et al. (2022) aimed to use Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations to overcome probabilistic
    uncertainty of bio-chemical modelling processes to configure design parameters,
    before technology ranking is calculated and verified over each iteration (however
    this was not included in case study). Therefore, if potential errors are likely
    to be introduced by MCDM structure or case study that impact outcomes, then sensitivity
    analysis (scenario or global) should be used to validate the robustness of DSS
    results. 3.8. Recommendations As discussed, there are already many reviews of
    DSS typologies in the literature, therefore, the review focuses on how indicator
    usage can be improved based on the methods currently implemented for WWTP technology
    selection. Therefore, following the review of thirty-one MCDM DSSs final recommendations
    and comments are provided in Table 2. Unfortunately, 3.2 Indicator selection,
    3.3 Indicator categorisation highlight the significant gap related to the utilisation
    of circularity and sustainability indicators, mainly that circularity aspects
    are used to investigate environmental performance and the lack of alignment with
    water sector goals reported as part of European Green Deal and CEAP. Additionally,
    WWTP DSSs still rely on user defined weighting, scoring, and ranking procedures,
    or structured methods, such as AHP and TOPSIS, which have issues with introducing
    uncertainty to the assessment. Generally, decision making in the water sector
    is still some distance from standardisation and harmonisation of sustainability
    and circularity assessments. Table 2. Summary of issues, recommendations, and
    beneficial outcomes related to the reviewed MCDM technology selection DSSs. Issue
    Recommendation Outcome Few DSSs provide a clear definition of aims or goals Defining
    the goal and scope of the assessment should become common practice, as the first
    step of DSS development or application Help decision makers understand the desired
    outcome of DSS utilisation Rigorous indicator selection is often overlooked by
    DSS developers and do not consider high level water sector goals Utilise participatory
    methods to incorporate local stakeholder, business (water utility), and regional/governmental
    objectives Technology selection using KPIs that adequately reflects desired results
    and facilitate sector transformation Indicator categorisation is often unclear
    resulting in inconsistencies across DSSs, mitigating circularity objectives Use
    categorises that reflect the intentions of the DSS, helping to create more robust
    weighting strategies and consider CE targets of the water sector Help to select
    and group relevant indicators, such as using sustainability pillars when selecting
    sustainable technologies, and mitigate the alignment of CE metrics with sustainability
    impacts Expert or user defined weighting schemes can lead to a lack of local factor
    consideration Stakeholders with an understanding of the local area from a range
    of job roles should be used for indicator weighting Ensures that DSSs select technology
    that will meet the local demands in each scenario of application and reduce uncertainty
    of results Unstructured or subjective weighting and ranking methods can lead to
    uncertain outcomes Consider the specific issues of each DSS application to decide
    which method should be used to reduce uncertainty, such as entropy methods to
    enhance the objectivity of weighting, and either fuzzy logic to reduce human error
    or PROMETHEE/ELECTRE to overcome conflicting priorities during ranking Remove
    the inconsistency and reduce uncertainty that can arise when human inputs are
    used to weight and rank indicators There is little critical analysis of final
    technology selection in relation to decision maker goals Techniques such as sensitivity
    analysis should be applied to investigate DSS outcomes Ensure that the method
    is consistent across alternative scenarios, enhancing robustness of final technology
    selection It is worth noting that analysis of DSS case studies showed that economic
    indicators were commonly prioritised during the weighting stages (Eseoglu et al.,
    2022; Liu et al., 2020; Lizot et al., 2021; Sadr et al., 2018). The CBA method
    employed by Arroyo and Molinos-Senante (2018) excluded economic indicators during
    the initial assessment, prioritising environmental and social factors, as monetary
    resources available are usually the constraint for any project. Environmental
    and social indicator results are then plotted against cost to facilitate the selection
    of the best technology option. Authors highlight the impacts of this by comparing
    AHP with CBA and showed that by considering economic factors alongside environmental
    and social indicators, unfavourable impacts were offset by low capital and operating
    costs. Therefore, as governments demand improved environmental and social performance
    of WWT in the coming years, to achieve targets such as net zero, the exclusion
    of economic indicators from initial assessment may be favoured. 4. Multi-objective
    optimisation control Following the selection of technologies, another type of
    DSS is needed for multi-objective optimisation of WWTP process operation and control.
    It is necessary to conduct distinct analysis of these DSS types as they are utilised
    differently by decision makers. Therefore, alternative methods and indicators
    are required, as it was seen that technology selection DSSs focus on sustainability
    KPIs whereas operational optimisation DSSs target cost and regulatory (effluent
    quality) aspects. Table 3 summarises the multi-objective process optimisation
    WWTP DSSs collected from literature, resulting in the review of twenty-six articles.

    an increase in the number of publications in this area, growing from four in 2018
    to seven in 2022 which coincides with the availability of Benchmark Simulation
    Model (BSM) 1 and BSM2 (IWA, 2018) for testing WWTP control strategies. Some authors
    have recently published multiple papers in this area, testing different algorithms
    to find the optimal control strategy on the same simulation platform. DSSs were
    categorised depending on their ability to optimise the control of process operation
    dynamically (respond to changes in real-time) or statically (user defined inputs
    followed by KPI calculation). Most DSSs are dynamic, which corresponds with use
    of BSMs as time series data across three weather conditions is available for simulation
    testing (IWA, 2018). Generally, DSS aims were stated in clearer terms than those
    for technology selection, often stating which performance parameters or KPIs are
    targeted for optimisation. Most DSSs were not applied to real case studies and
    instead utilised BSMs due to the complexity and non-linearity of WWTP modelling.
    This reliance results in little variation of KPIs selected (type or number), as
    BSMs have predefined indicators related to effluent quality and energy consumption/cost.
    As shown in Fig. 5, the BSM1 plant is a 5-compartment activated sludge reactor
    modelled using ASM1, with configuration facilitating nitrification-denitrification
    for biological nitrogen removal. The model utilises PI controllers to control
    the dissolved oxygen (DO) level by manipulating the oxygen transfer coefficient,
    and nitrate level setpoints, by changing the internal recycle rate in the fifth
    and second compartments respectively (IWA, 2018). The performance assessment of
    the plant is based on two main KPIs; the effluent quality index (EQI) and overall
    cost index (OCI). The EQI is the weighted sum (weightings from literature) of
    effluent contaminant TSS, COD, BOD, Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), and nitrate (NO).
    The OCI combines cost factors of sludge production, aeration energy, pumping energy,
    mixing energy, and external carbon consumption (Alex et al., 2018). BSM2 utilises
    the same wastewater treatment process, with the addition of sludge anaerobic digestion
    to the balance heat energy required and energy generated from methane production.
    The number of effluent limit violations and duration must be reported, meaning
    operation is constrained by discharge limits of NH4 ≤4 mg/l; TN ≤18 mg/l; TSS
    ≤30 mg/l; BOD ≤10 mg/l; COD ≤100 mg/l (Alex et al., 2018). Download : Download

    is the flowrate, S is the set point, PI is the controller, and KLa is the transfer
    coefficient. 4.1. DSS goals In Section 3 it was revealed that MCDM technology
    selection DSS aims are too generic, meaning it is difficult to relate indicator
    selection to desired outcomes. Many of the multi-objective process optimisation
    DSSs reviewed in Table 3 take the opposite approach, as twelve stated the KPIs
    targeted for optimisation in their aims. This definition enables users to clearly
    understand the outcomes that can be expected when implementing this optimisation
    technique, however, many of these DSSs relied on BSMs meaning there is little
    flexibility in the indicators utilised. Another helpful method of defining DSS
    aims for the user is to identify its specific function. For example, Borzooei
    et al. (2019) and Revollar et al. (2021) aimed to optimise the production of renewable
    energy and improve the eco-efficiency of WWTPs respectively, making it clear to
    users the reasons for implementing this DSS and selecting indicators for optimisation.
    Still, a significant number of multi-objective optimisation DSS developers use
    vague language when stating their aims. Eight DSSs aim to either optimise or improve
    performance of WWTPs, whilst three DSSs aim for sustainable operation or control
    of WWTPs, without explicitly stating which areas are targeted. Therefore, DSSs
    clearly define their aims, but few explicitly relate this to sustainability or
    circularity objectives, aiming to generally ‘optimise WWTP performance’ or improve
    conventional operation KPIs. 4.2. Static vs dynamic control Of the twenty-six
    DSSs reviewed in Table 3, six provided users with static control strategies for
    improving the operation of WWTPs, meaning the results are used by operators to
    make decisions rather than the DSS dynamically altering operation. Borzooei et
    al. (2019) created a simulation of a large-scale WWTP and altered the SRT between
    10 and 40 days, then plots the EQI and EC results to establish the optimal SRT
    for process operation. Mannina et al. (2020) goes a step further by using TOPSIS
    to optimise five operational parameters using ten KPIs and combining this with
    E-FAST sensitivity analysis to understand the influence of operating parameters
    on performance. These static DSSs allow users to observe and understand what an
    optimised system may look like, enabling them to derive and implement the WWTP
    control strategy. The remaining twenty DSSs are able to dynamically alter operation
    parameters without user interference. For example, Heo et al. (2021) uses the
    fuzzy c-mean algorithm to process and cluster influent data to predict initial
    BSM2 setpoints, a deep neural network then completes the multi-objective optimisation
    calculation for EQI, OCI, and biogas generation performance indicators, and finally
    the NSGA-II algorithm searches for the optimal setpoint of each controller. Therefore,
    the WWTP can maintain optimal performance and respond to fluctuations in influent
    composition. The use of DSSs for dynamic optimisation means that indicator selection
    must focus on KPIs that are calculated from data that is easily and reliably monitored
    over a given period. 4.3. Modelling platform Of the nineteen DSSs that dynamically
    control WWTP operation, fourteen are implemented in BSM1 without being tested
    on real processes. In most cases these DSSs are made up of two algorithms, one
    responsible for the multi-objective optimisation of KPIs (commonly a neural network)
    and another for determining the set point of controllers (such as a NSGA-II or
    AMODE algorithm (Heo et al., 2021; Ortiz-Martínez et al., 2021; Qiao et al., 2019,
    Qiao et al., 2018; Tejaswini et al., 2021)). The repeated investigation of different
    algorithm combinations is necessary to which results in the best EQI and OCI outcomes,
    and lowest controller error (Du and Peng, 2023). Two DSSs are used to control
    the operation of BSM2, enabling users to optimise operation considering biogas
    production as part of the OCI. Two DSSs are utilised for the dynamic control of
    actual processes including the work of Han et al. (2021) which runs initial tests
    on BSM1 then uses data extracted from the SCADA system of a 10,000 m3/d plant
    in Beijing, China to run experimental tests. Lastly, Dai et al. (2019) developed
    their own optimisation models, using ASM-2D to optimise a WWTP for inducing crystallisation.
    Therefore, few DSSs have been tested on real systems so may not perform as expected
    when applied at different scales or locations, especially under unexpected influent
    loadings. It is recommended that users test DSSs in real systems or on models
    that represent the specific process it will be applied to, ensuring optimisation
    reflects the operational expectations of decision makers. In the cases of static
    control, the DSSs developed usually rely on simulation software or the development
    of process models. Four DSSs used their own models which facilitated the selection
    and utilisation of less conventional KPIs, including regenerated water usage (Díaz-Madroñero
    et al., 2018), energetic self-sufficiency (Campana et al., 2021), and environmental
    impact (kg CO2eq) (Caligan et al., 2022). Two DSSs simulated WWTPs in Hydromantis''s
    GPS-X software, with configurations based on real-world processes (Chen et al.,
    2021) and fed with historic data taken from plant SCADA systems (Borzooei et al.,
    2019). Lastly, Revollar et al. (2021) specify four scenarios (fluctuating DO,
    NH4, and internal recycle setpoints) in BSM2, which enables the calculation of
    eco-efficiency indicators for comparing control strategies. Therefore, static
    control systems are able to optimise a greater variety of KPIs, like the EQI and
    OCI, and operational parameters, including solids retention time (Borzooei et
    al., 2019; Mannina et al., 2020) or process flowrates (Caligan et al., 2022; Revollar
    et al., 2021). 4.4. Indicators selected The reliance of DSS developers on BSM
    platforms results in little variability of selected indicators. In fact, Table
    3 shows eighteen reviewed DSSs used only the inbuilt indicators of BSMs, including
    EQI, OCI, or its sub indicators (pumping, aeration, and total energy consumption).
    Although indicators are fixed in the platform, little justification or reasoning
    for selecting these indicators is given by DSS or BSM sources, except that they
    cover both economic and environmental impacts (Li et al., 2021), reflect the operational
    state of the WWTP, and can evaluate process performance (Han et al., 2022a). EQI
    and OCI indicators reflect the traditional goals of water related literature and
    regulations, such as for human health protection and cost functions, that will
    always be important to maintain WWTP performance. However, modern water sector
    targets relate to areas such as GHG emissions and resource recovery, therefore,
    expansion to include KPIs that reflect these goals is recommended for further
    development of BSMs. This is needed as inclusion of sustainability and circularity
    dimensions would enable users to optimise WWTP operation considering the wider
    impacts to stakeholders and achieve targets defined in Section 2.1, such as those
    defined in the CEAP. Subsequently, the eight remaining DSSs developed integrated
    other indicators to optimise process operation considering impacts other than
    cost and effluent quality. Three DSSs calculate process GHGs, including Mannina
    et al. (2020) that consider a combination of CO2 and N2O emissions, direct and
    indirect GHGs, and air-EQI to understand how MBR operational parameters impact
    emissions. Caligan et al. (2022) also considered GHGs emissions and compared this
    with cost functions, whilst Chen et al. (2021) conducted full LCC and LCA to investigate
    the impact of indicator prioritisation on a 10,000 PE WWTP. Other DSSs selected
    indicators to investigate a specific function of a WWTP, namely freshwater and
    regenerated water use (Díaz-Madroñero et al., 2018), eco-efficiency (Revollar
    et al., 2021), treatment time reduction (Fox et al., 2022), and energetic self-sufficiency
    (Campana et al., 2021). These indicators align better with modern water sector
    sustainability goals compared with EQI and OCI indicators. However, they all employed
    self-selection methods and generally circularity indicators were mitigated from
    optimisation DSSs, showing this is yet to become a priority of WWTP operators.
    4.5. Indicator prioritisation Again, there is a difference between static and
    dynamic DSS indicators in how they are analysed to produce the optimal solution.
    The majority of dynamic calculations aim to minimise the performance indicators
    selected, including BSMs trying to minimise both EQI and OCI (or energy consumption).
    This results in an optimisation problem (Heo et al., 2021) since decreasing one
    of these KPIs increases the other, for example greater removal efficiency requires
    additional energy consumption from aeration and recirculation pumping. Therefore,
    DSS algorithms must cope with KPI trade-offs, known Pareto sets, which derives
    a sub-optimal solution for the chosen KPIs but establishes that both results are
    better than the rest of the potential outcomes in the search space (Qiao et al.,
    2018). Fox et al. (2022) developed one of the only dynamic optimisation DSSs to
    employ a weighting method, with the hope of considering site-specific requirements.
    Local plant operators assigned weights, which were combined with KPI result rankings
    to decide on the soft sensors that produces the best control strategy. In previous
    years it was common to weight KPIs to create a single objective optimisation (Niu
    et al., 2022), however, this necessitates real-time supervision by plant operators
    to achieve optimal control (Han et al., 2014). Of the static DSSs, three utilise
    KPI weighting to achieve the optimal solution. Díaz-Madroñero et al. (2018) used
    fuzzy goal programming to incorporate decision maker preferences and trade-offs
    between objective functions. Alternatively, Chen et al. (2021) normalises LCA
    impact indicator results and uses weights defined in literature, whilst Mannina
    et al. (2020) weights all ten objective functions selected equally. The use of
    decision maker weighting strategies is recommended, as it enables the goals of
    local stakeholders to be integrated within optimisation outcomes. Lastly, some
    DSS developers did not provide a method for selecting the optimal strategy, leaving
    it to the interpretation of the user to compare KPI results (Revollar et al.,
    2021), such as Borzooei et al. (2019) which relies on optimisation curves showing
    EQI vs OCI to select the best operational SRT parameter. Although weighting strategies
    are useful, the dynamic optimisation of KPIs is now accepted as best practice
    to enable automatic, supervisory control of plants, placing greater emphasis on
    proper selection of KPIs to reflect decision maker needs during WWTP operation.
    4.6. Error and uncertainty These DSSs aim to provide an optimised control strategy
    for the operation of WWTPs, however, alternative controllers, KPIs, or conditions
    may result in differing performance. Therefore, it is critical to test the sensitivity
    of DSS performance on results. One of the main strategies employed was to compare
    the optimised KPI results with alternative controller algorithms, to ensure the
    adopted method achieves the best performance. Controller performance metrics including
    the Integral of Absolute Error (IAE) (no error weighting), Integral of Squared
    Error (ISE) (penalises larger errors), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) were
    utilised. In fact, six DSSs compare the controller algorithm deployed using the
    IAE with other algorithms (Han et al., 2022a, Han et al., 2021; Li et al., 2022;
    Qiao et al., 2019, Qiao et al., 2018; Xie et al., 2022), one utilised both ISE
    and IAE for comparison (Han et al., 2018), and another implemented RSME (Qiao
    and Zhou, 2018) to investigate whether the method used results in the lowest error.
    Additionally, six DSSs compared controller algorithms using KPI results only (Han
    et al., 2022b; Li et al., 2021; Mannina et al., 2020; Niu et al., 2022; Pisa et
    al., 2019; Zhou and Qiao, 2019), which is a useful exercise to reassure the user
    their DSS will produce the best outcomes. However, investigating errors is important
    as it indicates the size and longevity of potential disruptions to system performance.
    Multi-objective optimisation DSSs utilise similar approaches to those discussed
    in Section 3.7 for MCDM for uncertainty analysis. For example, the DSS developed
    by Caligan et al. (2022) formulated scenarios to investigate the impacts of events
    that WWTP operators may face, including how the fluctuation of biofuel prices,
    inlet wastewater quality, and requirements for wastewater and sludge disposal,
    impact on cost and GHG emission KPIs. Ortiz-Martínez et al. (2021) created scenarios
    simulating lack of aeration due to process error and mitigation of flow recirculation
    due to maintenance, to investigate the effect on process optimisation. Alternatively,
    some authors investigated optimisation strategies through prioritisation of certain
    indicators to see how the system responds. DSSs were tested by optimising either
    the environmental (i.e. EQI) or economic (i.e. OCI) KPI, and comparing this with
    when both are optimised (Chen et al., 2021; Tejaswini et al., 2021). Mult-objective
    optimisation DSSs have other inherent uncertainties to deal with when modelling
    WWTP systems, such as climatic changes and fluctuating wastewater concentration
    (Chen et al., 2018). DSS developers tackled this uncertainty by investigating
    the effects of the wastewater influent on performance using fluctuation of the
    TKN/COD inlet ratio (Heo et al., 2021) and fuzzification of inlet composition
    (Díaz-Madroñero et al., 2018). However, further uncertainty analysis is recommended
    to test how WWTP optimisation models respond to external factors. MC simulations
    are commonly used for modelling input uncertainty as different probability distributions
    (normal, parametric etc.) can be selected depending on error attributes and case
    study characteristics (Haag et al., 2019). Testing the uncertainty of DSS performance
    is critical and for a complete study it is recommended to make comparisons in
    KPI performance and controller error with other systems, and investigate fluctuations
    to influent load and process operation to ensure the DSS will meet all user expectations
    when deployed at a real WWTP. 4.7. Recommendations Following the review of twenty-six
    multi-objective DSSs for optimisation of WWTP process operation, some final recommendations
    and comments are provided in Table 4. However, it can again be concluded that
    although these DSSs aim to optimise WWTP performance there is little attention
    given to how this results in the indicators selected for optimisation, nor an
    explanation of how subsequent operation aligns with sustainability aims, and mitigate
    circularity dimensions entirely. Table 4. Summary of issues, recommendations,
    and beneficial outcomes related to the reviewed wastewater treatment multi-objective
    process optimisation DSSs. Issue Recommendation Outcome Few DSSs are applied to
    real WWTP systems, mitigating the impacts of local climate and influent composition
    Test DSSs in realistic process models or trial them in real-world systems User
    achieves the expected performance when DSS is applied to their system Although
    KPI selection is fixed for many of the DSSs reviewed, rigorous indicator selection
    is often overlooked Develop process models that utilise KPIs considering local
    stakeholder and business objectives for WWTP optimisation, rather than depending
    on those integrated within BSMs DSS will optimise WWTP in a way that generates
    desired benefits for stakeholders Focussing on EQI and OCI (or energy consumption)
    KPIs provides a narrow view of ‘optimal’ or ‘sustainable’ WWTP performance Expansion

    Align WWTP operation with modern sustainability and circularity aims of the water
    sector Dynamic control and optimisation of WWTPs aligns better with the water
    sector''s digitisation goals, mitigating plant operator decision making capabilities
    Implement robust indicator selection to ensure optimal performance facilitates
    decision maker goals at a plant level Responsive systems that optimise performance
    in terms of selected KPIs, rather than relying on intuitive decision making of
    operators Many DSSs did not investigate the performance of controller algorithms
    using appropriate metrics IAE and ISE are recommended for understanding the response
    of the selected algorithm to process alterations, especially as dynamic operation
    of WWTPs evolves Better understanding of how the investigated WWTP will respond
    to external stressors 5. Future work 5.1. Indicator selection Unfortunately, it
    has been shown that the indicators utilised by most wastewater DSSs do not align
    with water sector sustainability and circularity targets. Currently, there is
    a lack of standardised assessment methodologies that combine circularity and sustainability
    dimensions, and confusion due to the excess of indicators developed (Valls-Val
    et al., 2022). Most methods rely on the user cherry picking indicators from a
    predetermined list, therefore, when an organisation adopts an innovative activity
    it can result in redundant indicator selection and efforts or resources being
    allocated incorrectly (Peral et al., 2017). There are additional difficulties
    to consider in the water sector, particularly for circularity assessments, as
    the main focus until now has been enhancing the performance of technical systems.
    For example, processes that safely return biotic and water resources to the environment
    can be seen as effective waste management (Chojnacka et al., 2020), whereas this
    can occur during landfilling or incineration for abiotic resources which are non-circular
    actions, meaning many indicators are not appropriate. This means it is currently
    very difficult to assess wastewater systems for the selection and optimisation
    of technology that facilitates decision maker goals. It has been shown in the
    literature, and this review, that CE indicators have been aligned with sustainability
    dimensions to validate decision making (Harris et al., 2021), whilst the opposite
    can be said when using LCA impacts to evidence enhanced circularity (Corona et
    al., 2019). Therefore, there is a large knowledge gap regarding how circularity
    and sustainability indicators can be combined. Overcoming this issue requires
    the development of methods that assess the circularity of resource flows and is
    supported using wider sustainability analysis to quantify economic, environmental,
    and social benefits. Only then can wastewater decision making facilitate governmental
    circularity and sustainability targets, whilst maintaining WWTP performance, and
    meeting the customer expectations. 5.2. Data Inefficient use of data is one of
    the main problems in plant management which many WWTPs struggle to solve. The
    WWT process is complicated and decentralised, so data is scattered, and managers
    can struggle to supervise the whole plant leading to poor management. The water
    industry is still developing data collection, management, analytics, and controls
    to more effectively use this data to inform decision making across all management
    and operational functions (Corominas et al., 2018). As a result, much of this
    data is relatively untapped to support decisions that would enable higher levels
    of performance and control. Subsequently, online optimisation of WWTP control
    has not been widely applied to real-world systems, due to the complex, non-linear
    behaviour of biological WWT systems (increasing the computational requirements),
    lack of visualisation techniques, and low-quality sensor measurements (Matheri
    et al., 2022). Types of advanced control known as model predictive controllers,
    use data-driven techniques for early correction of process operation to reduce
    process faults and therefore costly downtime, effluent violations, and resource
    consumption (Ntalaperas et al., 2022). The combination of this with effectively
    constructed multi-objective optimisation DSSs results in powerful and desirable
    tools for the water sector to achieve its goals. Finally, the use of data-driven
    techniques can also be extended to improve the selection of indicators, including
    the use of techniques combined with expert knowledge, to find precise KPIs for
    monitoring specific strategic goals. This would enable the differentiation between
    performance (lead) and result (lag) indicators, and create numeric thresholds
    and benchmarks (del Mar Roldán-García et al., 2021), providing more knowledge
    for decision making purposes. 5.3. Uncertainty There are many levels of uncertainty
    associated with WWTP DSSs, namely model structure (misrepresented boundaries,
    inaccuracy of construction, subjective judgement, and mitigation of important
    mechanisms), data (quality, processing, measurement error, and reliability), and
    relationship with the natural environment (knowledge gaps, dynamic system, and
    uncertain future) (Uusitalo et al., 2015; Walling and Vaneeckhaute, 2020). It
    is important to map the source and magnitude of uncertainty in DSSs, for which
    many techniques have been discussed in 3 Technology selection DSSs, 4 Multi-objective
    optimisation control, however, uncertainty is still recognised and treated differently
    by decision makers in the water sector. Even though the water sector has additional
    complexities that result from its strong relationship and dependency with the
    natural environment, a standardised methodology to identify, quantify, reduce,
    and report uncertainty to support decision making is still missing (Walling and
    Vaneeckhaute, 2020). A large number of techniques have been implemented to reduce
    uncertainty, depending on the MCDM method or model utilised, including the use
    of expert assessments, sensitivity analysis (scenario, GSA, or MC based), model
    emulators (Gaussian processes), deterministic models (temporal and spatial variability),
    and heterogeneous data assimilation (meteorological and hydrological) (Pelissari
    et al., 2021; Uusitalo et al., 2015). Consideration of future climate impacts
    is particularly challenging for water decision makers, when making operational
    decisions in the face of uncertain conditions. In this case, stochastic modelling
    frameworks and decision tree approaches are recommended to assign future conditions
    a probability of occurrence (Horne et al., 2016). Furthermore, to achieve more
    standardised protocols these methods must be aligned with the type and magnitude
    of uncertainties, ensuring that resultant decisions are with acceptable ranges,
    thereby permitting dissemination. Identifying uncertainties that have the greatest
    impact on results will help water sector decision makers create knowledge bases
    with which to refine future studies and models (Horne et al., 2016). 6. Conclusions
    WWTP decision makers face stricter regulations regarding human health, environmental
    protection, and emissions reduction, meaning they must optimise performance and
    replace infrastructure, whilst maintaining positive economic performance. This
    creates complex multi-objective problems when operating and selecting technologies
    for improving WWTPs, meaning many DSSs have been developed for the water sector.
    Currently, there is a mismatch in terms of the decision maker goals and KPIs selected
    for DSSs, so water sector objectives at a European level were summarised. The
    regulation and action plans from the European Commission highlight their recent
    ambition for greater levels or sustainability, circularity, and environmental
    and human health protection. Following this, DSS literature was reviewed and showed
    the main function of MCDM tools was for WWT technology selection, whereas multi-objective
    optimisation DSSs focused on optimal set-point control to improve effluent and
    cost indicators. A large contrast was found regarding the aims of DSS typologies,
    as optimisation strategies tend to clearly define their goals in terms of the
    KPIs used, however, MCDM tools often use vague language making it difficult for
    users to make a connection between indicators selected and resultant outcomes.
    Considering these issues several recommendations were made to improve DSS deployment,
    such as more rigorous indicator selection protocols including participatory approaches
    and expansion of indicators sets (specifically for multi-objective optimisation),
    or greater analysis of results whether it is the use of sensitivity/uncertainty
    analysis or ISE/IAE indicators. Lastly, to facilitate the success of DSSs implementation,
    development should focus on standardised methods of indicator selection that directly
    links outcomes with decision maker goals, and the water sector''s circularity
    and sustainability targets. CRediT authorship contribution statement D. Renfrew:

  description: Effective data management has arisen as a major concern in today's
    era of ubiquitous data generation from a plethora of intelligent gadgets. While
    data proliferation promises unparalleled benefits, it imposes significant storage
    and computing constraints, particularly on end-users with limited capabilities.
    To solve these difficulties, this article investigates the confluence of cloud
    storage, blockchain technology, public auditing, reputation systems, and dynamic
    auditing. Because of their low-cost data storage and processing capabilities,
    cloud computing services have grown in popularity, leading customers to embrace
    data outsourcing to reduce local administrative overhead. This study digs into
    a novel paradigm for ensuring the integrity and security of data stored in cloud
    environments using blockchain technology. Integrating public auditing systems
    enables visible and verifiable data audits, ensuring consumers of data trustworthiness.
    A reputation system is also included to build trust among cloud service providers
    and users, improving the overall trustworthiness of the ecosystem. The suggested
    system also includes dynamic auditing, which allows for real-time changes and
    data verification, reacting to the changing nature of cloud-stored information.
    This study provides a thorough examination of the architectural components, techniques,
    and protocols used in this novel approach. We illustrate the feasibility and usefulness
    of our approach in ensuring data integrity, security, and reliability in cloud
    storage systems through empirical analysis and case studies. The findings show
    the potential benefits of this integrated strategy to solving the issues posed
    by the modern digital landscape's tremendous proliferation of data. Through the
    synergistic integration of cloud storage, blockchain technology, public auditing,
    reputation systems, and dynamic auditing, this research provides a holistic solution
    for managing data in the cloud while ensuring data integrity, security, and trust.
    This comprehensive strategy lays the way for a more robust and dependable cloud
    data management ecosystem, increasing user trust in cloud-based services.

  description: Blockchain technology has been used for the digitalization of physical
    asset management and data management processes in many areas in the industry and
    academia, including the water domain. Its potential as an immutable data storage
    system and smart contract integration has provided a plethora of use cases and
    utility in the domain of hydrology and water resources. This systematic review
    critically examines the application of blockchain technology in the field of water
    resources and hydrology. By analyzing 104 academic publications and 37 non-academic
    studies from 2017 to 15 October 2022, this paper identifies the current state
    of blockchain applications in water management, delineates their potential use
    cases, and assesses their practical utility and scalability. Despite the theoretical
    promise of blockchain for enhancing water governance, data security, and stakeholder
    trust, the review reveals a noticeable gap between theoretical potential and the
    existence of workable, real-time applications specifically in water resources
    management. The findings indicate that while blockchain technology has been effectively
    implemented in various sectors, its adoption in hydrological domain is still emerging,
    with limited empirical evidence to support full-scale deployment. The paper concludes
    with a call for more empirical research to validate theoretical benefits, address
    scalability and interoperability challenges, and integrate blockchain technology
    with real-time data networks for sustainable water management practices.

    societies in the 21st century depends on the compatibility of artificial and natural
    complex systems [1]. This need has increased the importance of reliable data and
    accelerated data processing technology [2]. As a result of the rapidly developing
    information and communication technology approaches in the last decades, digital
    transformation has accelerated in nearly all sectors [3]. Societal perspectives
    on issues such as planning, production, and implementation have evolved in parallel
    [4]. Hydrology and the water resources domain followed the same trend with developments
    in hydroinformatics. The most notable developments can be listed as novel applications
    of deep learning in image synthesis and communication [5], large-scale modeling
    and analysis on client-side systems [6], virtual and augmented reality for hydrological
    education and modeling purposes [7], and novel programming libraries and data
    standards [8,9]. As a natural outcome of this rapid digital transformation, the
    water sector has started to generate, process, and store more data [10]. However,
    this process has necessitated the reliability, security, and standardization of
    hydrological data because reliable data are essential for more accurate hydrological
    forecasts. Similarly, data standardization and security are crucial for stakeholder
    engagement in water systems in a secure and trustworthy way [11]. Addressing trust-related
    concerns has accelerated with the realization of the potential of blockchain technology.
    Blockchain technology is an advanced database mechanism that allows transparent
    information sharing within a network [12]. A blockchain database stores data in
    blocks linked together on a chain. The data are chronologically consistent, as
    they cannot be deleted or changed in the chain without consensus on the network.
    As a result, blockchain technology can be used to create an immutable ledger to
    track orders, payments, accounts, and other transactions. There are built-in mechanisms
    in the system that prevent unauthorized transaction entries and create consistency
    in the common viewing of these transactions. Blockchain technology, while nascent
    in the domain of water resources and hydrology, has demonstrated its transformative
    potential through existing applications in various sectors [13,14,15,16]. For
    instance, blockchain-based energy companies have successfully implemented trading
    platforms that allow for the sale of electricity between individuals. Homeowners
    with solar panels are already engaging in such transactions, selling excess solar
    electricity to neighbors via platforms that automate the process using smart meters
    and blockchain records. Traditional financial systems, including banks and stock
    exchanges, have adopted blockchain to manage online payments, accounts, and stock
    market trading effectively. In the media and entertainment industries, blockchain
    is utilized to manage copyrighted data securely, while retail companies leverage
    the technology to track the movement of goods between suppliers and buyers. These
    real-world applications serve as a testament to blockchain’s capability to provide
    secure, transparent, and efficient transactional platforms across different industries.
    In the context of water resources management, the promise of blockchain to deliver
    decentralized systems is particularly compelling. As water security becomes an
    increasingly critical global issue, the lessons learned from these sectors could
    be adapted to address the unique challenges faced in hydrology and water resources
    management. Although comprehensive literature reviews on blockchain applications
    exist in energy markets [17], food supply chains [18], health sectors [19], and
    general business, a similar level of detailed examination is lacking in the water
    sector. This gap underscores the need for focused research to explore and implement
    blockchain solutions that can enhance water governance, resource allocation, and
    system accountability. This paper presents a comprehensive review of blockchain-based
    solutions in water resources. The literature review, which includes journal papers,
    conference papers, technical websites, technical project documents, and hackathon
    projects, is conducted in detail. Each study is classified and evaluated according
    to the area of hydrology it focuses on, its purpose, the level of development
    of the blockchain-based solutions, and the technical details it uses when applying
    blockchain technology. The primary limitation of this study is that the literature
    analyzed provided only limited information regarding the system architectures
    and smart contract codes that were designed. The contribution of this review paper
    lies in its ability to introduce something new and valuable to the existing body
    of knowledge by synthesizing existing research and presenting a new perspective
    on blockchain uses in water resources, identifying gaps in the literature and
    suggesting new areas for investigation, critiquing existing studies and offering
    new insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the field, as well as presenting
    a new theoretical framework to evaluate decentralized solutions in the hydrological
    domain. The structure of this article is as follows. We begin with a Background
    on Blockchain Technology, offering an overview of the main characteristics and
    types of blockchain networks, and discussing their relevance to the water resources
    domain. The Materials and Methods section details our review process, including
    data sources, search strategy, and selection criteria used to identify the relevant
    studies. The Results section provides a comprehensive analysis of the findings,
    outlining the current state of blockchain applications within hydrology and water
    resources. This is followed by the Discussion section, where we interpret the
    implications of these findings, identify research gaps, and discuss the technical
    and practical challenges of blockchain implementation. The Recommendations for
    Future Work section proposes directions for future research and development in
    this emerging field. Finally, the Conclusions section summarizes the key insights
    from the review and reflects on the potential of blockchain technology to revolutionize
    water management practices. Background on Blockchain Technology Storing data in
    distributed ledgers, deciding which data to store with a consensus algorithm,
    defining preconditions with a smart contract, and being able to track the recorded
    data transparently are the issues that have been discussed theoretically in financial
    applications since the 1980s due to the disadvantages of traditional data storage
    systems and the need for reliable third parties in financial transactions [20].
    As mentioned before, Bitcoin was the first real-time application to record financial
    transaction data. Although the words “block” and “chain” are always mentioned
    as separate terms in the original bitcoin whitepaper, the name of the technology
    was shaped to “blockchain” after a while [12]. The second milestone of blockchain
    technology and first example of the application of recording transaction data
    to a database only if both parties meet a certain prerequisite was announced with
    the Ethereum whitepaper [21], where the predetermined conditions are called smart
    contracts or the chain code. There are four main types of decentralized or distributed
    networks in the blockchain. Public blockchain networks are permissionless networks
    that allow anyone to join. All members of the blockchain have equal rights to
    read, edit, and verify the blockchain. Public blockchain networks are mainly used
    for trading and mining cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin
    [22]. Private blockchains are controlled by a single entity. This authority decides
    who can become a member and what rights the members have in the network. Private
    blockchains are only partially decentralized because they contain access restrictions.
    Hybrid blockchains combine some features of both private and public networks.
    Companies can set up private, permission-based systems as well as a common system.
    Thus, they control access to certain data stored on the blockchain while keeping
    the rest of the data public. They use smart contracts to allow members of the
    partner system to check whether private transactions have been completed. For
    example, hybrid blockchains can allow shared access to digital currency while
    keeping bank-owned currency private. Consortium blockchain networks are managed
    by a group of organizations. Pre-selected organizations share responsibility for
    maintaining the continuity of the blockchain and determining data access rights.
    Consortium blockchain networks are generally preferred in sectors where many organizations
    have a common goal and can benefit from responsibility sharing [23]. The blockchain
    protocol refers to different types of blockchain platforms that can be used for
    application development purposes. Each blockchain protocol adapts fundamental
    blockchain principles to suit specific industries or applications. The most famous
    blockchain protocols are Hyperledger, Ethereum, Corda, and Quorum. Hyperledger
    Fabric is an open-source project with a set of tools and libraries. In that way,
    it is possible to customize blockchain applications. Hyperledger Fabric is a modular,
    general-purpose framework that offers unique identity management and access control
    features. Due to these features, it is suitable for various usage areas such as
    tracking and monitoring of supply chains, trade finance, loyalty and reward programs,
    and reconciliation of financial assets [24]. The Ethereum operating system is
    a decentralized blockchain platform that is useful to build public blockchain
    applications [25]. Corda is an open-source blockchain project designed for business.
    Quorum is an open-source blockchain protocol derived from the Ethereum source
    code. It was specifically designed for use in a private blockchain network where
    all nodes are owned by only one member or in a consortium blockchain network where
    multiple members each own a portion of the network [26]. In summary, the main
    features of blockchain technology that make a difference are described as follows:
    Decentralization in blockchain involves the transfer of control and decision-making
    powers from a central legal entity (i.e., an individual, organization, or group)
    to a distributed network. Decentralized blockchain networks use the principle
    of transparency to reduce the need for trust between participants. These networks
    discourage participants from exercising authority or control over one another,
    which reduces the functionality of the network. Another main feature is immutability,
    which means that data cannot be changed or tampered with once they are stored
    in the blockchain. If a log contains an error, a new transaction needs to be added
    to reverse the error, and both transactions will be visible on the network. Finally,
    the consensus mechanism is a prominent aspect of a blockchain system, which sets
    the rules for the consent of the participants regarding the recording of transactions.
    New transactions may be recorded only after the majority of the participants in
    the network have approved them. On the other hand, public blockchains in particular
    may be slower than traditional database systems because the validation process
    until the data are stored is relatively long. In addition, the immutability feature
    of the recorded data can turn into a disadvantage for industries that want to
    make historical data modifications. The blockchain architecture, on the other
    hand, includes several technical components, which are as follows: (a) the distributed
    ledger is the shared database used to record transactions in the blockchain network;
    (b) smart contracts are programs that are automatically executed and stored in
    the blockchain system when predetermined conditions are met; they run “if–then”
    checks so that transactions can be completed safely; and (c) public key encryption
    is a security feature that uniquely identifies participants in the blockchain
    network. This mechanism generates two sets of keys for network members. One of
    the keys is a public key that everyone on the network uses together. The other
    key is a private key that is unique to each member. Private and public keys work
    together to unlock the data in the ledger (Figure 1). The first generation of
    blockchain is bitcoin and cryptocurrencies; the second generation blockchain is
    smart contracts or chain code; and the third generation, or future, of blockchain
    continues to evolve and grow as companies discover and implement new application
    areas. The ongoing blockchain revolution continues to offer limitless potential.
    Figure 1. Illustration of basic blockchain architecture. Like many other industries,
    the initial ideas for the implementation of blockchain in hydrology and water
    resources management are mainly focused on the advantages of storing data most
    reliably. Water-related data reliability has a key role in water management in
    all dimensions. Since water is a multidimensional natural resource, water resources
    can be managed most effectively by optimizing the interests of stakeholders with
    many different priorities. In addition to having different priorities regarding
    the quantity and quality of water, there is a social dimension for the water as
    well. Reliable data about shared water resources are essential for the establishment
    of trust [27,28,29]. The straightforward guarantee of socio-hydrological trust
    and data reliability is made possible by a simply distributed digital architecture
    built on blockchain and smart contracts. Uncertainty in multi-stakeholder hydrological
    systems can be reduced with the assistance of immutably recorded data. Likewise,
    blockchain technology is very suitable for applications in the finance of water.
    Application areas may be the water market, where water rights are exchanged, or
    any investment in water management and donations to improve water infrastructure
    or sanitation in developing countries. In short, it provides the most transparent
    follow-up of all financial transactions in terms of investors or market stakeholders
    [30]. Similarly, when there is a necessity for the traceability of water, blockchain
    may provide effective solutions. Water-related traceability is critical for agricultural
    water management [31], water quality and control [32], urban water systems, and
    the water footprint of special products. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Scope and
    Purpose The primary goal of this study is to conduct an exhaustive examination
    of current blockchain-based solutions within the field of hydrology and water
    resources management. This includes identifying how these solutions can be integrated
    with real-time data networks and highlighting their potential to transform traditional
    water management practices. The study is designed to be of value to hydroinformatics
    professionals, water resource managers, policymakers, technology developers, and
    researchers seeking to leverage blockchain technology for improved data management,
    security, and transparency. In responding to the need for a detailed understanding
    of blockchain’s role in water resources management, the study seeks to address
    a comprehensive set of research questions (RQ): RQ1. What is the current state
    of blockchain technology in hydrological applications, and what future developments
    can be anticipated? RQ2. How can blockchain technology meet the specific data
    management needs of the water sector, and what are its comparative advantages
    over existing systems? RQ3. What are the key opportunities presented by blockchain
    for improving water governance, and what challenges might impede its adoption?
    RQ4. What are the limitations and gaps in the current body of research on blockchain
    in hydrology, and how might these inform future investigations? RQ5. Based on
    the findings, what recommendations can be made for stakeholders in water resources
    management, and what are the broader implications for the field? RQ6. In what
    ways can future studies build upon and refine the current model to address unresolved
    issues and enhance the utility of blockchain applications in this domain? The
    study also identifies and discusses the weaknesses of the research, such as the
    scarcity of real-world application studies, the limited scope of current models
    in addressing complex water management challenges, and the need for greater standardization
    and interoperability among blockchain platforms. Future research expectations
    are outlined, including the need for more practical implementations and pilot
    projects, improved methodologies to assess the economic viability of blockchain
    solutions, and the development of blockchain oracles for accurate real-time data
    integration. The study concludes with recommendations for advancing the use of
    blockchain in hydrological applications and suggests how future studies may contribute
    to the evolution of this promising field. 2.2. Study Design This study contains
    a critical evaluation of the literature on the usage of blockchain technology
    in water resources management [33]. The literature review was initially categorized
    into academic literature and professional (or industry-related) literature. Academic
    literature encompasses journal articles, conference papers, book chapters, and
    technical reports. Professional literature includes resources such as whitepapers,
    web documents, technical documents from industry and governmental organizations,
    and projects highlighted in hackathon events. Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science,
    Crossref, Open Alex, Jisc Library Hub, and the Library of Congress were used as
    academic databases, and 25 different keyword combinations were used as the search
    approach (Table A1 in Appendix A). After the initial search, the results published
    before 2008 (before the Bitcoin whitepaper) in the database search results were
    eliminated. Later on, results that are indexed in more than one database were
    ultimately removed, so that no duplicates remained. There were 5330 articles as
    a result of the research from these stages. These papers were examined according
    to their titles, abstracts, and the content of the paper, and classified according
    to their scope of the blockchain-based solutions. Especially the collections of
    conference proceedings with a wide scope were caught by keyword combinations,
    although they did not contain any useful content on blockchain and hydrology.
    Moreover, results containing only one or two sentences about “blockchain and water”
    were also excluded from the review. It was expected that there would be at least
    a few paragraphs or a section that included useful comments or analysis on the
    subject matter. For professional literature, the same search methodology was applied,
    with additional sources including the public projects repository of Devpost [34]
    for hackathon projects. Web pages detailing technological advancements and official
    reports addressing digital transformation in the water sector were manually reviewed.
    This process identified 103 academic resources and 57 professional resources as
    directly relevant, which were then subjected to a detailed review. Appendix A
    includes tables summarizing these detailed reviews. In reviewing the academic
    literature, several variables and categorization parameters were established to
    assess the development stage of blockchain-based solutions in the hydrology domain,
    including publication type, focus area within hydrology, the developmental stage
    of blockchain applications, blockchain type, blockchain technology provider, and
    the presence of smart contracts or chain code, among others. Publication Type:
    A category that specifies where and in what format the academic content is published.
    This includes options such as journal paper, conference paper, book, book chapter,
    thesis, and technical report. Focus Area: A classification based on the specific
    sub-field of hydrology and water resources that the reviewed studies focus on.
    Despite most studies covering multiple areas, for the purpose of detailed analysis,
    each study is assumed to primarily focus on a single subject area. These areas
    include Urban Water Management, Water Quality Management, Water Economics, Water
    Governance, Agricultural Water Management, and Water and Sustainable Development
    Goals (SDGs). Purpose: A field that specifies the main use cases the study or
    product is designed to address. Development Level of Blockchain Application: A
    descriptor that indicates the extent to which the blockchain-based solution is
    utilized and customized for addressing specific problems in water resources. Explore:
    Studies highlight the potential of blockchain applications in water resources
    management and evaluate the research and application gaps. The studies classified
    in this field are used just for exploration and do not include technical blockchain-based
    applications or conceptual frameworks. Conceptual: Studies that propose a conceptual
    digital system architecture without a tested application. Simulation: Studies
    in which a system is designed and tested locally but not converted into a real-time
    application. Decentralized Application (DApp): Studies in which the created system
    can be used with a blockchain-based mobile or web-based application. Pilot Project:
    Studies where any stage of the project is tested with real-time data. Blockchain
    Type: A classification that specifies the type of blockchain infrastructure proposed
    or used in the study. Studies are categorized as Public, Private, and Hybrid Blockchain;
    the latter combines features of both types to some extent. Blockchain Technology:
    A categorization specifying which blockchain technology provider is proposed or
    used in the study. Options include Ethereum, Hyperledger, and Other. Smart Contract/Chain
    Code Enabled: A Boolean field that specifies whether the study includes a smart
    contract or a chain code. Reproducibility: A field that determines whether the
    blockchain application of the study can be reproduced using the provided information.
    Classification is based on the level of data and codebase sharing as “Yes”, “No”,
    and “Partly”. Cybersecurity Test: A category that evaluates whether the studies
    were subjected to cybersecurity tests. On-Chain Data: A descriptor for data stored
    on the blockchain. Off-Chain Data: A descriptor for data stored in a standard
    database. Consensus Algorithm: A classification of the consensus algorithm used
    by the blockchain infrastructure in the study. Feasibility Analysis: A classification
    that provides a feasibility analysis for the blockchain-based system components
    involved in the studies. 3. Results 3.1. Summary of Findings This section presents
    and examines graphical summaries of the reviewed papers and non-academic content.
    The summarized graphical demonstration includes the distribution of papers and
    non-academic content by year and publication type. Moreover, graphs concerning
    reviewed papers provide technical details about blockchain use cases such as the
    blockchain-based solutions in the sub-field of hydrology, the development level
    of a blockchain application, the type of blockchain, and the blockchain network.
    Tables showing the summarized information of 103 papers and 57 pieces of non-academic
    content are included in Appendix A (Table A2 and Table A3). Considering the distribution
    of papers by years, an approximately linear increase is observed. This trend can
    be explained by the increase in blockchain-based solutions and the increase in
    the exploration and adoption of modern technologies in hydrological processes.
    The number of papers in 2022 seems not to have exceeded that of the previous two
    years yet. Considering that the papers reviewed cover the period before 15 October
    2022, this number may support the continuing linear increase. In addition, sharp
    fluctuations in cryptocurrency exchanges may have limited the blockchain-based
    solutions in different areas. Non-academic content production appears to follow
    a steady uptrend, with the exception of a drastic dive in 2020 (Figure 2). Figure
    2. Distribution of academic and non-academic content by years. We classify reviewed
    papers as “journal papers”, “conference papers”, “book chapters”, “books”, “theses”,
    “working papers”, and “technical reports”. If outputs from different phases of
    the same project are presented at different conferences, both conference papers
    are considered. The average impact factor of the journals examined in the journal
    paper category is 4.51. If journals that do not have an impact factor were to
    be ignored, the number of neglected journal papers would have amounted to 17 out
    of a total of 49 reviewed. Contents published as technical reports are evaluated
    as academic content if the publisher is a governmental entity, or as non-academic
    content if it is published by a non-governmental organization for the purpose
    of informing the public. While there is a dominance of journal and conference
    papers in the reviewed papers, the number of postgraduate theses can be considered
    very low. The reason for this can be interpreted as the immature level of integration
    between the academic blockchain ecosystem and the hydroinformatics community,
    and, as a result, the difficulty of finding a suitable use case to support a thesis
    contribution as well as advisors experienced in this interdisciplinary area. Reviewed
    non-academic content is divided into three publication types including web documents,
    whitepapers, and hackathon projects (Figure 3). Projects that publish whitepaper
    emphasize the potential blockchain-based solutions instead of providing real-time
    hydrological blockchain-based solutions. Hackathon projects are the output of
    hackathon events that directly focus on hydrological processes. Figure 3. Distribution
    of academic and non-academic content by publication type. Another classification
    of reviewed papers is carried out according to their major contribution to sub-fields
    of hydrology. Although most papers focus on more than one sub-field, they are
    categorized in the hydrology sub-field that is considered to be the most focused
    area (Figure 4). Figure 4. Distribution of academic content by sub-field of hydrology.
    Water Governance: These papers generally anticipate using blockchain as a database
    and focus on solving administrative problems and building trust among stakeholders.
    Papers providing a literature review are also categorized here. Water Quality
    Management: These papers focus on problems related to water quality, such as monitoring,
    analysis, wastewater management, and a more transparent demonstration of water
    quality standards being met. Water Economics: These papers focus on approaches
    to water markets at different scales for water trading, water rights, water claims,
    and water economy applications. Agricultural Water Management: These papers focus
    on agriculture-related water problems such as irrigation and agricultural water
    quality. Urban Water Management: These papers focus on urban water applications
    such as drinking water and stormwater systems. Water SDG: These papers focus on
    blockchain-based solutions in hydrology and their contribution to achieving Sustainable
    Development Goals. Water Economics is ranked second because decentralized finance
    applications are the first application of blockchain technology in many other
    areas, and there is more knowledge on this subject. The distribution of the development
    level of blockchain applications shows that the hydrology applications are still
    in the maturation stage (Figure 5). It is noteworthy that few studies include
    an application as an end product or a pilot project with a real-world active use
    case. The number of studies in the Water SDG category would have been greater
    if other studies were focused on their potential contribution to Sustainable Development
    Goals. Figure 5. Distribution of academic content by development level of blockchain
    application. The “N/A” column in Figure 6 and Figure 7 represents the same articles
    as the “Explore” column, which does not suggest an architecture or a system but
    simply explores potential blockchain-based solutions. Therefore, a blockchain
    type or a blockchain network is out of the question, as the study only explores
    potential blockchain-based solutions. If a system or architecture is suggested
    but no blockchain network or blockchain type is specified in the paper, it is
    categorized as “Not Available”. The reason why private blockchains are preferred
    more may be that the water-related data in the use case are not intended to be
    shared transparently even if the identities are cryptographically secure because
    most of the papers contain conceptual and simulation studies. Moreover, fluctuating
    cryptocurrency markets may be creating concerns about transaction fees to be paid
    on public blockchains. Ethereum and Hyperledger dominate the field of hydrology
    as well as other application fields due to smart contract and private blockchain
    compatibility. Other private blockchains represented in the review are Corda and
    BanQu. Figure 6. Distribution of academic content by blockchain type. Figure 7.
    Distribution of academic content by blockchain network. 3.2. Analysis of Academic
    Content In this section, the reviewed academic content is briefly summarized.
    These summaries highlight the papers’ approach to blockchain and water resources
    integration. 3.2.1. Water Governance The common consensus is that trust is a critical
    enabler in Water Governance. Reliable data and coordination are essential to establishing
    and maintaining the trust layer. Blockchain provides an immutable database to
    store water-related data securely. This key feature of blockchain technology provides
    a straightforward framework for Water Governance stakeholder coordination. Moreover,
    smart contracts can contribute to sustainable Water Governance by codifying environmental
    and economic conditions. Sobrinho et al. [35] describe how blockchain technology
    can help to enhance financial transparency and trust while also helping to improve
    Water Governance. Such an enhancement might be made possible, for example, by
    the development of cryptocurrencies and the use of smart contracts to encourage
    actions aimed at water resource conservation. Sriyono [36] investigates the potential
    of blockchain technology to aid in the efficient management of water resources
    and offers a framework and architecture for blockchain and water management. The
    paper also discusses a potential blockchain-based solution for the water quality
    problems in Puerto Rico. Scozzari et al. [37] examine how IoT, AI, and blockchain
    are used to digitally transform smart water networks and blockchain-enabled water
    rights trading. Dogo et al. [38] examine the effects of combining blockchain technologies
    with intelligent water management and assert that blockchain has the potential
    to revolutionize water and sanitation governance to achieve SDG 6 as envisioned
    by the United Nations in 2035 through creative, effective, and scalable solutions,
    based on these two technologies in African cities. Poonia et al. [39] examine
    the spatiotemporal distribution of several drought types, separately and simultaneously,
    in India. A blockchain-based framework is suggested to enhance the current drought
    risk management system to provide assistance for those suffering from drought
    to receive help and aid as soon as possible. Linjing et al. [40] explain the benefits
    and standout characteristics of blockchain-enabled IoT applications and contrast
    them with centralized, more established IoT-based Smart Water Systems. Hangan
    et al. [41] examine the potential applications of big data and blockchain in the
    field of water resources and argue that blockchain can act as a link between a
    locally used solution and a global infrastructure that is accessible globally
    and is controlled by a coalition of international organizations using consensus
    mechanisms. The literature suggests that blockchain technology has the potential
    to address various water-related challenges, including ethical pricing, data transparency,
    protecting water resources, monitoring and managing of water usage, and emergency
    flood event notification. Iyer and Giri [42] evaluate water-related issues that
    may be solved by blockchain, which is important in the area of ethical pricing
    and highlight data transparency as data are exchanged across networks for water
    reuse. Wu et al. [43] thoroughly examine the properties of blockchain technology,
    as well as the scenarios and applications that blockchain has in the field of
    protecting water resources, including the storage of data about water bodies,
    cross-sectoral collaboration, and increased public involvement level. According
    to Ragghianti [44], blockchain allows for the integration of watershed monitoring
    and direct management of water usage for all system users, maintaining flexibility
    and guaranteeing all socio-environmental constraints that apply in that basin.
    Xia et al. [45] consider a distributed and decentralized water data management
    system for the whole supply, consumption, and discharge processes. The system
    includes two conceptual hybrid blockchain-based solution scenarios: permits for
    water abstraction and water quality tracking. Singh and Goel [46] examine how
    blockchain might be used to notify authorities of any emergency flood events.
    The utilization of blockchain technology, including a smart contract enabled blockchain
    framework and blockchain-based authentication key agreement system, has the potential
    to enhance the dam safety and intelligent water conservation systems through real-time
    coordination and protection against SPOF and DDOS attacks. Yasuno et al. [47]
    integrate upstream monitoring, dam inflow prediction, a smart contract-enabled
    blockchain framework to reimagine the dam watershed as a smart dam and organize
    the technologies for flood prediction. The study aims to facilitate real-time
    coordination among stakeholders and real-time broadcast of disaster prevention
    information. Lin and Wang [48] claim that SPOF and DDOS attacks have the potential
    to exploit the authentication and key agreement in intelligent water conservation
    systems, thus suggesting a blockchain-based authentication key agreement system
    for smart water devices. The selected network for blockchain is the Ethereum operating
    system, and to participate in the network, smart devices serve as light nodes.
    The light node does not engage in mining and merely downloads a small bit of the
    blockchain network. It is appropriate for conditions where there are more smart
    devices. The consensus algorithm for the blockchain system is Practical Byzantine
    Fault Tolerance (PBFT). Asgari and Nemati [49] investigate the literature based
    on the three primary Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) application areas of
    Smart Water Systems, Water Quality Monitoring, and Storm Water Management. Additionally,
    they address the legislative, social, administrative, and practical difficulties
    which can be an obstacle to the use of blockchain technology. Stankovic et al.
    [50] provide an overview of possible blockchain-based solutions in water and sanitation
    services for Latin America and the Caribbean. Li et al. [51] provide a peer-to-peer
    blockchain system based on data to forecast water consumption. According to existing
    research, blockchain technology could be useful in creating decentralized platforms
    for smart water conservation and cloud-based solutions using unmanned aerial vehicles
    (UAVs) for monitoring dam sites. These solutions could improve traceability, data
    security, and overall effectiveness in the long term. Zhang et al. [52] establish
    a platform with four decentralized participants, including government agencies,
    water conservation private sector actors, the general public, and third-party
    maintenance. The study also provides the design of “dual chain” smart contracts
    that are “alliance chain and private chain”. Additionally, the many possibilities
    of blockchain-based solutions for smart water conservation are examined. Next,
    a novel development route including consensus mechanisms, smart contracts, asymmetric
    encryption, and information source tracing is suggested using the water rights
    trading market as an example. Chinese Smart Water Conservancy Platform Data are
    the main on-chain data in the proposed system. Youssef et al. [53] suggest an
    unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), cloud-based solution for dam site monitoring. The
    UAVs periodically provide meteorological data, water quality and level information,
    and the condition of dam structures. Blockchain, which offers identification,
    a database system, and traceability of the UAV cloud’s data transmission, ensures
    a distributed and long-term security solution. The effectiveness of the solution
    is simulated by assessing the data delivery delay ratio. Majia [54] creates a
    blockchain-based system that maintains the privacy of operational hydropower plant
    data. The proposed system stores the homomorphic encrypted operational data on
    chain. Sukrutha et al. [55] establish a unique blockchain architecture with double
    hashing as a data storage system that is more secure for groundwater management
    data. The water level and water quality data of aquifers are stored off-chain,
    but the hash of the same data is stored on-chain. The simulation is carried out,
    and the transactional cost is examined. Simulation results show that storing the
    hash of data is cost-effective. Mohammadi et al. [56] create a hypothetical blockchain-based
    system to securely exchange data gathered in real time from a variety of sensors
    for monitoring and controlling water consumption. The proposed consensus algorithm
    is proof of work, and smart water meter data are supposed to be directly stored
    on-chain. Blockchain technology can be utilized to gather and store environmental
    data from meteorological sensors using a private Hyperledger network, preserve
    water consumption through a Ethereum operating system-based public network, and
    manage water supply in a fully decentralized manner using IoT devices and the
    Ethereum operating system based public blockchain, as described in the works of
    Dramski et al., Tiwari et al., and Vernekar, respectively. Dramski et al. [57]
    describe a system for gathering environmental data from meteorological sensors
    and then storing it in a blockchain application. The application is powered by
    a private Hyperledger blockchain network and a sensor prototype developed on a
    Raspberry Pi. Tiwari et al. [58] suggest a public Ethereum operating system-based
    blockchain system designed to preserve water consumption that satisfies the supply–demand
    processes of all customers in a peer-to-peer network. Vernekar [59] outlines a
    fully decentralized, blockchain-based approach for managing water supply that
    uses IoT devices to collect data along the configuration and add it to the Ethereum
    operating system-based public blockchain. Sapra et al. [60] provide a methodology
    for creating an intelligent water management system that determines and calculates
    a consumer’s water use within a certain area and also detects leaks in the plumbing
    system. A private blockchain network is designed based on the Ethereum operating
    system, and water quality, pressure, and location data for components of the water
    distribution system are stored on the block. The California Blockchain Working
    Group [61] investigates the potential for blockchain-based technology to assist
    in the development of a more effective framework that builds on the momentum of
    recent California water-related data initiatives. There are two pilot project-level
    studies in this category in the reviewed literature. Mughal et al. [62] conduct
    a pilot project emphasizing blockchain-enabled solutions for enhancing Pakistan’s
    data-intensive decision support systems. The consistency, immutability, and dependability
    of streamflow time series data are maintained using a private blockchain that
    is built on the Hyperledger Fabric platform. The model evaluates the use of Hyperledger
    Fabric, employing the distributed autonomous administrative authority of Pakistan’s
    irrigation network. In addition to collecting sensor data for streamflow prediction,
    the nodes also maintain permanent data storage on the streamflow record and aggregate
    and approve compliance with the distribution system via the chain code (smart
    contracts). The proof-of-authority protocol allows for the designated nodes with
    authorization to create new blocks of streamflow data monitoring irrigation networks,
    thus maintaining the chain’s overall security. Another pilot project is carried
    out by Coli et al. [63]. The pilot project in Peru aims to demonstrate the viability
    of integrating blockchain technology into the microfinance industry for water
    and sanitation to increase the effectiveness of the current microfinance model
    and support the inclusion of unbanked people in the financial system. The pilot
    study also allows for more discovery through first-hand experiences with local
    microfinance organizations and borrowers. The private blockchain network of BanQu
    is preferred for the project, and a feasibility analysis is conducted to show
    operationally cost-effective scenarios as a result of blockchain implementation.
    3.2.2. Water Economics Water Economics is the consideration of the economic value
    of water as a natural resource and the added value it creates in the areas where
    it is used within the framework of microeconomic theories. The focus of these
    theories is to maintain the quality and quantity of water under economic and financial
    constraints and to make water-related investment, cost, and water markets efficient.
    Water Economics has been a substantial area of research for exploring blockchain-based
    solutions due to its intrinsic need for and obvious utility of adopting trustworthy
    data and currency sharing mechanisms. Bhaduri et al. [64] investigate the opportunities
    for potential water market implementation in Los Angeles, USA, and Bengaluru,
    India. Poberezhna [65] explores how blockchain-based tools could assist the water
    sector’s businesses and governing bodies in gaining access to real-time data about
    market shares, consumption trends, consumer bill management, and other possibilities.
    Ikeda and Liffiton [66] introduce two possible use cases for blockchain-based
    water management which are blockchain-based water and sanitation subsidies and
    the use of blockchain-based water pricing management. The literature suggests
    that blockchain technology can be utilized in a variety of ways to address water-related
    challenges, such as trading water and energy, improving water allocation and quality,
    and even providing flood insurance, among other blockchain-based solutions. Bou
    Abdo and Zeadally [67] create a commercially and economically viable peer-to-peer
    trading platform for water and energy that supports rainwater gathering and trade
    of the captured water. The harvested rainwater data are directly stored on-chain.
    Thomason et al. [68] examine the relationship between blockchain technology and
    climate finance as both relate to the problem of water scarcity in poor nations
    and propose blockchain-based water trading applications as a potential solution.
    Zhao et al. [69] underline the significance of creating a peer-to-peer trading
    network with blockchain capabilities that would enable more irrigators to take
    part in the platform that secures and transparently allocates water, increasing
    the total efficiency of water resources. Zecchini [70] investigates the potential
    blockchain-based solution scenarios for blockchain-enabled water quality credit
    systems. Grigoras et al. [71] introduce blockchain and smart contracts integrated
    into a theoretical water rights trading platform. Angara and Saripalle [72] review
    the virtual water literature systematically and provide a conceptual virtual water
    currency and blockchain-enabled virtual water trade system. Sivaramakrishnan [73]
    proposes a blockchain-enabled architecture for water trading platforms between
    agricultural stakeholders. The Ethereum operating system-based public network
    is preferred to perform regulatory requirements such as smart contracts. Belliera
    et al. [74] create a flood insurance system powered by blockchain. Vannucci et
    al. [75] extend this study and aim to contribute to the analysis and management
    of flood events from an economic and financial perspective from a public administration
    viewpoint. The study also intends the unique and robust blockchain-based insurance
    systems. Zhang [76] provides a design of a conceptual blockchain-based supply
    chain financial system model for water resources businesses, and a model to analyze
    the financial condition of seven water businesses for their potential blockchain-based
    digital transformation in China. Their conceptual blockchain-based architecture
    is designed to store the financial supply chain of water resources data directly.
    Miller [77] and Ramsey et al. [78] describe and evaluate the application of blockchain
    capabilities to the water rights trading ecosystem and design a variety of services
    that leverage blockchain features and business value. Pee et al. [79] and Alcarria
    et al. [80] examine the potential for a simple peer-to-peer water market based
    on smart contracts with water trading data stored on the Ethereum operating system-based
    private network. Liu and Shang [81] propose a hybrid blockchain approach for trading
    water rights and Li et al. [82] use chain code to enable transactional water rights
    data storage in a private Hyperledger Fabric network for the same purpose. This
    category contains one study at the DApp level and one study at the pilot project
    level. Abu-Amara et al. [83] develop a blockchain-based application to manage
    the supply of water and energy transactions. The application records water and
    energy use data on a private Hyperledger network and allows for consumers to view
    and pay bills online. Cooperative Research Centre for Developing Northern Australia
    (CRCNA) [84] provides a pilot project with Civic Ledger, an Australian start-up,
    in the Mareeba-Dimbulah Water Supply Scheme (MDWSS), Northern Australia. Water
    Ledger, which is Civic Ledger’s water trading platform built on the Ethereum operating
    system, is customized to the MDWSS business and operational standards to examine
    how blockchain technology can minimize trading costs, boost the effectiveness
    of trade processes, and raise water market transparency. The pilot project highlights
    that blockchain-enabled systems have the potential to codify regulatory rules,
    reduce transaction costs, and avoid asymmetric information about actual water
    prices. The main challenge for the next phases of the project is that the existing
    water market and the water delivery infrastructure are not interoperable. 3.2.3.
    Water Quality Management Water Quality Management is the entire process of monitoring
    the water quality from the source to the user, taking measures to protect the
    water quality and treating the water if necessary. In this whole process, reliable
    data and real-time monitoring are vital for the detection of possible contamination
    and the efficiency of the treatment process. Kassou et al. [85] propose a blockchain-enabled
    conceptual system design to control and track medical wastewater infrastructure.
    Damania et al. [86] consider the blockchain as a next-generation data storage
    system and discuss potential integration in terms of Water Quality Management.
    Ortiz [87] points out the capabilities of blockchain applications to improve public
    awareness and governmental accountability about water quality at all scales in
    Puerto Rico. Yan et al. [88] present a conceptual blockchain-enabled environmental
    monitoring system architecture that data analysis; stakeholder authentication
    and water quality data are synchronized. Wan et al. [89] deliver an AI-supported
    management system for wastewater treatment facilities and investigate blockchain
    as a data storage system. Hakak et al. [90] conceptualize a blockchain-enabled
    smart contract-supported industrial wastewater management system. Quist-Aphetsi
    and Blankson [91] explore the cryptographic features of Secure Hash Function 256,
    which is the most popular hash function in blockchain applications, and examine
    a potential hybrid data logging system that store cryptographically the quality
    of water delivered to consumers from the water treatment plant. Kaur and Oza [92]
    document the Ethereum Request for Comment Standards 20 (ERC20) from a smart city
    perspective that ERC20 tokens must comply with. The paper simulates Water Reprocessing
    Coins (WRCs) to create a business environment where everyone has an equal chance
    of obtaining credits based on recycled wastewater to remove inequalities between
    different-scale enterprises. Iyer et al. [93] propose a private blockchain network
    based on Hyperledger to maximize the effectiveness of wastewater recycling systems
    for industries. The study’s simulation process includes anomaly detection algorithms
    to apply chain code rules for possible penalties to industries attempting to tamper
    with water quality sensors. Several blockchain-based solutions that integrate
    IoT and other technologies (e.g., LoRa, autonomous boats) to monitor and maintain
    water quality are proposed. Lin et al. [94] simulate an integrated system based
    on IoT and blockchain that is structured as a directed acyclic graph and uses
    geographic information system tools for source tracking of river water quality
    problems. Berman et al. [95] provide an implementation of a blockchain-enabled
    framework for sample identification and logging together with small autonomous
    boats that can navigate to measure chemical water quality parameters automatically.
    Niya et al. [96] propose an IoT-enabled LoRa-based system for monitoring water
    pollution that is completely decentralized by storing and retrieving data from
    IoT sensors on the Ethereum operating system. Crawford et al. [97] create an R3
    Corda-based DLT system for oil and gas underground injection control (UIC) operations
    to maintain the water quality of freshwater aquifers. Gudmundsson and Hougaard
    [98] create a model that explicitly demonstrates the influence of water quality
    on production profits and offer a plan for distributing the profits of the best
    possible pollution abatement. In order to automate negotiations, the paper offers
    a decentralized solution using smart contracts. The DApp level categorized in
    this section is conducted by Alharbi et al. [99]. Initially, the study focuses
    on measuring the water quality parameters in industrial tanks and looking for
    any violations using the IoT (Internet of Things). Afterward, Hyperledger’s private
    application is used to enforce the necessary penalties on the violating industrial
    facility and sustain the accuracy, dependability, and transparency of the records
    of violations. The technology is able to measure the quality of the water in real
    time and enable the immediate identification of any violation to apply the appropriate
    penalties. The administration can access the decentralized web application to
    track the status of water measures for registered industrial facilities and evaluate
    the data linked to water violations with easy-to-read illustrations. Shi et al.
    [100] present a cutting-edge IoT solution that uses a Hyperledger private network
    to preserve healthy drinking water consumption in schools. It is mentioned that
    39 schools have already implemented the project in Hangzhou’s Shangcheng District,
    China. The project reduces the workload of health professionals and encourages
    the transformation from conventional site-based inspection to automated remote
    monitoring. 3.2.4. Agricultural Water Management Agricultural Water Management
    aims to provide the optimum amount and quality of water for agricultural products
    by considering the continuity of ecosystem services. This optimization is possible
    by prioritizing data security related to Agricultural Water Management processes.
    Dong and Fu [101], Liu et al. [102], and Kumar et al. [103] examine possible applications
    for blockchain-based digital solutions in the agricultural industry and assess
    the transformation process of traditional agriculture to blockchain-based digitalized
    smart agriculture systems. Liu et al. [104] and Ferrag et al. [105] provide a
    systematic review of information communication technologies (ICTs) and blockchain-enabled
    agricultural applications. Dragulinescu et al. [106] propose a blockchain-enabled
    conceptual system to maximize smart irrigation by storing the water quality, air
    quality, and weather data on-chain. Dragulinescu et al. [107] extend the conceptualized
    framework and perform simulation studies to store and monitor some physical and
    chemical water quality parameters for irrigation networks, such as temperature,
    dissolved oxygen, pH, and turbidity. Chang et al. [108] offer a conceptual Ethereum
    operating system-based irrigation system that stores agricultural supply and demand
    data on-chain. Krishna et al. [109] provide a smart agricultural system architecture
    that stores soil moisture and temperature on blockchain to protect agricultural
    data security. Sakthi and DafniRose [110] propose a Hyperledger private network
    to provide data transparency and reliability for agricultural stakeholders to
    encourage them to reduce pesticide and fertilizer-based water and soil pollution.
    Lin et al. [111] discuss the potential blockchain-based solutions and propose
    an architecture based on ICT and hybrid Ethereum operating system integration.
    RajaRajeswari et al. [112] provide a blockchain-enabled conceptualized framework
    for smart gardening as a component of the smart city concept. Munir et al. [113]
    and Ting et al. [114] propose a smart irrigation system that uses fuzzy logic-based
    algorithms for decision support processes and blockchain for data reliability.
    Zeng et al. [115] simulate a system for managing and coordinating the usage of
    high-quality seeds and water resources between communities; an effective tracking
    system for seed quality and a smart irrigation management system are designed
    using IoT and blockchain integration. Giaffreda et al. [116], Bordel et al. [117],
    and Pincheira et al. [118] provide Ethereum operating system-based Agricultural
    Water Management systems which include private, hybrid, and public networks, respectively.
    These three studies provide a system that encourages and rewards ethical behavior
    in agriculture activities for specific multi-stakeholder ecosystems. The main
    aim of these studies is to create a more sustainable and environmentally friendly
    irrigation water consumption system. Enescu et al. [119] describe a DApp that
    is centered on bringing together small farming communities for effective solar
    panel-based agricultural management. The DApp is suggested for managing both energy
    and water. The system uses the Ethereum source code for public network and smart
    contracts which enable customers to trade energy and water. ERC20 is implemented
    for transactions, and two cryptocurrencies are introduced including SIST (Small
    Irrigation System Token) and Solar Coin. In the domain of Agricultural Water Management,
    the exploration of blockchain for optimizing irrigation systems highlights the
    technology’s capacity to ensure data accuracy and operational efficiency. Yet,
    the environmental impact and energy consumption associated with maintaining blockchain
    operations in agricultural contexts remain largely unexplored. This oversight
    identifies a critical gap in the sustainable deployment of blockchain technologies,
    where future research must balance technological innovation with environmental
    stewardship. 3.2.5. Urban Water Management Urban Water Management aims to perform
    urban water services in an integrated manner. The main elements of Urban Water
    Management are water supply, drainage, and treatment facilities. The accountability
    of the urban water authority can become more sustainable within the framework
    of blockchain. Alnahari and Ariaratnam [120], Lukić et al. [121], Makani et al.
    [122], Kim et al. [123], and Kumar et al. [124] investigate the possible blockchain
    application for smart cities. It is summarized that blockchain has the potential
    to enhance water security and accountability through the distribution of transparent,
    secure ledger accounts. In addition, water quantity and quality can be tracked
    for whole water supply and demand processes including storage, transmission, treatment,
    and consumption. Public awareness and the trust layer between citizens are the
    main contributions of blockchain and smart city integration. Mahmoud et al. [125]
    examine the viability of combining blockchain with intelligent water networks
    through case studies. Additionally, identity anonymity methods that could be integrated
    with the system and the customer’s data are explored, and a distributed ledger
    and a blockchain-based data aggregation mechanism for the smart meters are suggested.
    They extend this study and design a MATLAB toolbox that can simulate blockchain-enabled
    water distribution systems. Different algorithms for consensus mechanisms in blockchain
    are compared according to their mining time and offering the user the option to
    select the desired one [126]. Lalle et al. [127] present the use of blockchain
    technology with the machine learning algorithm k-means to preserve user privacy.
    Users are grouped into clusters, and every cluster has a permissioned blockchain
    to store the data of its members. Studies related to blockchain-based solutions
    in Urban Water Management include various approaches including incentive-based
    architectures and serious gaming platforms. Zecchini et al. [128] introduce particular
    fields in their description, and they describe the use of Solidity design patterns
    applied to Urban Water Management scenarios to provide blockchain developers with
    greater assistance in making important decisions to create effective decentralized
    applications. Sundaresan et al. [129] propose a blockchain-enabled system that
    stores the quantitative and qualitative data of water distribution systems. Thakur
    et al. [130] provide an incentive-based architecture for smart water distribution
    and saving that combines blockchain technology with edge computing. In the framework,
    houses are designed as nodes of the Ethereum operating system network. The computer
    operates at the network’s edge and offers a quick water-saving incentive system.
    Arsene et al. [131] and Pahontu et al. [132] conduct similar studies that provide
    a water supply system integrated with Hyperledger to manage customer demand more
    effectively. Rottondi and Verticale [133] propose a public blockchain-enabled
    smart water metering architecture and a serious gaming platform to incentivize
    sustainable urban water consumption. Predescu et al. [134] develop a system at
    the application level that provides a serious gaming approach for Urban Water
    Management from the standpoint of mobile crowd sensing. Each crowdsensing task
    includes a chain code-based incentive mechanism, and the trust layer of the system
    is secured by Hyperledger Fabric. The application of blockchain in Urban Water
    Management demonstrates potential improvements in distribution system efficiency
    and user engagement. However, current research underestimates the challenges related
    to user adoption and the socio-economic impacts on diverse urban populations.
    This reveals a gap in the literature on the socio-technical integration of blockchain,
    where further studies are required to understand how these technologies can be
    designed and implemented to be inclusive and acceptable to all urban stakeholders.
    3.2.6. Water and SDGs SDG-6 aims at sustainable water and sanitation services
    for all. Mora et al. [135] outline the key sustainability concerns that cryptocurrency
    and blockchain technologies are addressing in terms of SDG-6 Clean Water and Sanitation.
    Le Sève et al. [136] and Parmentola et al. [137] provide a literature review about
    the potential of blockchain for improvements in environmental sustainability.
    Mattila et al. [138] investigate the potential of blockchain-enabled data storage
    systems for their contribution to reaching SDG targets such as climate change,
    biodiversity loss, and water scarcity. 3.3. Analysis of Non-Academic Content In
    this section, the reviewed non-academic content is briefly summarized. Web documents
    generally focus on the potential of blockchain-based solutions and underline the
    beneficial outputs. The most emphasized issue is that the blockchain-based storage
    of hydrological data creates a layer of trust between the stakeholders who depend
    on the quantity and quality of the same water resource. Another issue is the advantages
    of blockchain-based digitalization of traditional water markets, which are currently
    traded, such as accountability, easier access to instant market information, and
    low transaction fees. We do not categorize this section due to the lack of diversity
    in the depth to allow for the specific categorization we present with the academic
    content. Therefore, we only offer details for distinguished blockchain-based solutions
    or documents in this section. Water Services Regulation Authority, a non-ministerial
    government department of the UK, published a report about customer data reliability
    and recommended blockchain to UK water companies in 2017 [139]. There are two
    real-time applications in the reviewed non-academic content. A digital asset platform
    BANKEX introduces a pilot initiative called “water coin” that aims to generate
    direct investments for clean water provision safely by cutting out any intermediaries
    or other parties that could taint the process in Kenya [140]. Fujitsu launches
    a new blockchain water trading system that enables the safe use of botanical water.
    The botanical water harvesting process is the transformation of food waste into
    drinking water. Companies that want to use botanical water can purchase it from
    a suitable refinery using a blockchain-enabled mechanism provided by Fujitsu [141].
    The aims of the projects that publish whitepapers or hackathon projects focus
    are to provide blockchain-based storage of data on water distribution systems,
    detection, management, and prevention of water pollution sources; ensure more
    reliable traceability of water-related investments; create wastewater management
    layers for both treatment and environmental discharge processes; create a micro
    water trading system for smart cities; and create more accountable water supply
    chain processes [29,142,143,144,145,146,147,148,149,150,151,152,153,154,155,156,157,158,159,160,161,162,163,164,165,166,167,168,169,170,171,172,173,174,175,176,177,178,179,180,181,182,183,184,185,186,187,188,189,190,191,192,193].
    4. Discussion 4.1. Fundamental Benefits of Blockchain in Hydrology Blockchain-based
    solutions in hydrology are unique to each use case and difficult to standardize,
    but the literature has agreed on four fundamental benefits which are described
    below. Water Trust: Since the blockchain has a decentralized structure, none of
    the stakeholders are directly the owners of the system. In addition, it is certain,
    thanks to smart contracts, that hydrological and administrative rules are followed
    by all parties. This creates a trust layer between parties that depend on the
    same water source, even if they are not aware of each other. Water Data Security:
    In the blockchain, the data are distributed among the nodes that support the system
    in a completely distributed manner. This makes the system safe from traditional
    cyberattacks and power outages. Since the data are stored cryptographically, even
    if the data are captured in some way, they cannot be disclosed unless the user
    wants it. It provides data security for natural and legal persons. Immutable Water
    Transaction Ledgers: Data recorded in distributed ledgers cannot be deleted. This
    provides a single and common database for stakeholders. Water Accountability:
    Transactional data records on the blockchain are publicly available for anyone
    to view and verify. There is no need for a third-party verification system or
    a trusted data provider to verify the data. 4.2. Challenges for Blockchain in
    Hydrological Applications Opportunities and Real-Time Application Gaps: Theoretically,
    blockchain provides opportunities for every scenario that aims to create a layer
    of trust between stakeholders who are dependent on the same water resource, increase
    the reliability of water-related data, create an immutable retrospective database,
    and increase the accountability of the authority that manages the water. However,
    the main challenge is that real-time simulation and application stage studies
    are scarce in the literature. Moreover, there is no blockchain-based hydrological
    application where the environmental, economic, and regulatory rules are designed
    as smart contracts and real-time data are processed. Although 34% of the academic
    content includes simulation, application, or a pilot project, the data shared
    about the process are very limited. The simulation results are mostly graphical
    representation for the measured water quantity and quality. This can be explained
    by the fluctuations in cryptocurrency exchanges affecting trust in blockchain
    technology and prolonging the maturation process of blockchain technology. Blockchain
    technologies are currently immature for large-scale operational and regulatory
    applications and difficult to justify for long-term investment and commitment.
    Smart Contract Feasibility and Optimization Concerns: Another notable point in
    the review is that a detailed smart contract-oriented feasibility or optimization
    study on blockchain transaction fees related to the simulation, application, and
    pilot project-level studies is very limited. The efficient design of codes in
    the rules determined by smart contracts has a great impact on transaction fees
    and can make the whole system feasible. Moreover, while the data recorded on the
    blockchain are immutable, coding the smart contract is critical. Vulnerability
    in a smart contract could lead to incorrect recording or manipulation of data
    [194]. A smart contract can only be as smart as the developer who designs it.
    Blockchain Oracle Challenges and Comparative Studies: Another important issue
    is the blockchain oracle problem. Blockchains are isolated from physical systems,
    so they need blockchain oracles that enable data exchange with physical systems
    [195]. IoTs that send water-related data to the blockchain must send reliable
    data. Otherwise, the blockchain system stores incorrect data even if the smart
    contract is coded perfectly. In the literature, there is a lack of blockchain
    oracle research focused on flowmeters and water quality sensors that record water-related
    data and send it to the blockchain system. Although the use of the Ethereum operation
    system and Hyperledger dominates the literature, due to the block structures that
    allow smart contract design, their hydrological advantages and disadvantages against
    each other are not evaluated in the literature. Similarly, the hydrological evaluation
    of the advantages of private and public blockchain applications against each other
    is not included in the literature. 5. Recommendations for Future Work Advancing
    Real-World Blockchain Applications in Hydrology: More case studies and extensive
    research with real-world applications are essential to directly observe and evaluate
    the theoretical benefits of the blockchain for water resources in practice. Research
    involving more real-time applications will encourage more water authorities to
    test the blockchain-based performance of their existing systems. Economic Feasibility
    and System Optimization in Blockchain Transformation: It is necessary to analyze
    the economic and financial feasibility of blockchain-based digital transformation,
    which includes the optimization of the blockchain system itself and the digital
    connection with the physical water systems. In addition, hydrology-focused smart
    contract optimization and blockchain oracle framework development research is
    essential. Enhancing Blockchain Integration with AI and Computational Methods:
    Generalized architectures and blockchain systems that can serve as a plug-and-play
    technology to many use cases and organizations are essential for realizing the
    potential in hydrological applications such as water rights trading or urban water
    supply chain. Water authorities or companies may want to enjoy the benefits of
    blockchain applications without needing to learn the cryptographic background.
    Moreover, as the data security brought by blockchain technology can increase the
    quality of data that are input for artificial intelligence and soft computational
    methods, it can provide predictive power with higher correlation [196]. Comparative
    Analysis of Private and Public Blockchain Networks: Private and public blockchain-enabled
    networks have advantages and disadvantages for a water system, but there is no
    study in the literature focusing on this comparison. While public blockchain networks
    provide greater accountability, there are higher transaction fees. This issue
    should be discussed in particular within applications of water systems. Similarly,
    different consensus algorithms provide different features; however, there is a
    lack of hydrology-focused comparison studies on the issue. Expanding Research
    on Transboundary Water Management and Virtual Water Trade: Transboundary water
    systems management is one of the most important areas of hydrology where stakeholders
    have a problem of trust; reliable data are needed, and a common water management
    approach should be adopted [197]. Transboundary water systems are an important
    field of study with great potential, considering the theoretical benefits of blockchain
    such as accountability, transparency, and immutability. Virtual water trade and
    water footprint, which are other sub-branches of hydrology, also have the potential
    to be digitalized with a blockchain-oriented perspective. The international trade
    of products brings with the international flow of virtual water [198]. The supply
    chains of products can be managed on a blockchain basis by adding water footprint
    and virtual water trade data. Potential Applications of NFTs in Water Resources
    Management: An additional aspect worth noting regarding blockchain applications
    is Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). An NFT is a type of cryptocurrency; however, in
    this definition, the money in question can be any asset that has value [199].
    Assets that can be considered NFTs include any piece of art, video, tweet, a website,
    images, and stories that are created on social media. NFTs cannot be exchanged
    for another identical token, as NFTs are unique and no two are alike. This property
    is called “non-fungibility”, that is, “unchangeable”. Public blockchains provide
    these tokens with provable rarity, while smart contracts ensure that they are
    non-reproducible and unique. In water resources management, any product’s water
    footprint certificate or water quality credits can be stored as NFTs. Similarly,
    any investment, water-related bill, or tax payment can be stored as NFTs with
    the limits drawn by the smart contract, making the data regarding the identity
    of the payer, the time of payment, and pay amount immutable. Standardization and
    Interoperability of Blockchain-Based Water Data Management Systems: Standardization
    of blockchain-based data management solutions for the water resources domain can
    be achieved through the development of industry standards, protocols, and guidelines
    that promote interoperability and data exchange between different systems. This
    can involve the establishment of open data standards for water quality data, development
    of data exchange protocols, and creation of common data models that can be used
    across different blockchain-based systems. Additionally, collaboration between
    industry stakeholders and standardization bodies can help to ensure that blockchain-based
    solutions meet the needs of the hydrological domain and are compatible with existing
    data management systems. 6. Conclusions This paper provides a comprehensive literature
    review of applications to address hydrological challenges using blockchain technology.
    A total of 104 academic publications and 37 non-academic studies dealing with
    hydrology and water resources are analyzed in detail. During the period of analysis
    covered, between 2017 and 15 October 2022, it was observed that the number of
    publications for blockchain-based hydrological applications has increased linearly
    since 2017, with an observable drop in 2020, only to continue following an uptrend.
    This study evaluates the potential for existing application areas to be enhanced
    with a more sophisticated use of blockchain technology as well as the realization
    of potential new hydrological applications. Despite the recognized potential,
    the review reveals that blockchain applications in hydrology are still in the
    early stages of development. The scarcity of real-world applications and pilot
    projects highlights a significant gap between theoretical benefits and practical
    implementation. The current literature focuses predominantly on conceptual models
    and simulations, which, while valuable, do not provide the empirical evidence
    necessary to validate blockchain’s effectiveness in operational environments.
    The economic and financial feasibility of blockchain applications, particularly
    concerning transaction fees and the cost–benefit analysis of blockchain integration
    with existing systems, needs further research. This study also identifies a lack
    of in-depth analysis comparing different blockchain platforms, consensus algorithms,
    and the trade-offs between public and private blockchain networks in the context
    of water resources management. Future research should concentrate on addressing
    these gaps through more case studies, real-world implementations, and pilot projects.
    There is a need for a standardized framework that promotes interoperability between
    different blockchain systems and existing water management infrastructures [200,201,202].
    Additionally, the development of blockchain oracles for accurate and reliable
    real-time data integration is crucial. While this review comprehensively covers
    the literature up to and including the year 2022, we recognize the continuous
    advancements in the application of blockchain technology within the field of water
    resources management. Despite our earnest efforts to provide an encompassing review,
    the timing of our review process and manuscript preparation precludes the inclusion
    of recent publications from 2023. We acknowledge the emergence of these studies
    post our review phase and emphasize their potential to further enrich the discourse
    on blockchain applications in water management [115,203,204,205,206]. Prospective
    studies focusing on the literature published in 2023 and beyond could offer invaluable
    insights and underscore the evolving nature of this research domain. In conclusion,
    blockchain technology offers promising opportunities for improving water resources
    management. However, for its full potential to be realized and adopted on a wider
    scale, the challenges identified in this review must be addressed. This includes
    conducting more empirical research, improving the economic viability of blockchain
    solutions, ensuring the reliability of data sources, and enhancing system interoperability.
    As the technology matures and more use cases are tested, blockchain could become
    a pivotal tool in achieving sustainable water management and security. Author

    column proportions 1. Introduction Agriculture and rural regions in Europe face
    a number of economic, social, and environmental challenges [1,2]. Rural areas
    are active players in the EU’s green transitions. Through the sustainable production
    of food, preservation of biodiversity, and the fight against climate change, they
    play a key role in achieving the European Union’s Green Deal [3], Farm to Fork
    [1], and biodiversity targets [4], as well as the goals of the long-term vision
    for the EU’s rural areas [5] The sustainability of the agricultural sector depends
    in many ways on its further innovation. Innovation covers many aspects: technical,
    social, and economic. One of the crucial developments lies in digitalization as
    well as robotization [6,7]. Digital technologies are the key to a smarter, more
    competitive, and resource-efficient agricultural sector [8]. EU farmers already
    benefit from digital solutions that can help their farms to become more sustainable.
    Moreover, digitalization increases economic, social, environmental, and geopolitical
    resilience. Machines enable the digital transformation of agriculture by using
    sensors on machines to detect actual soil and crop information (weed recognition,
    amount of biomass, nutrient status, pests, and diseases), which allows for mapping
    to ensure the successful control of variable rate applications, communication
    protocols, and cloud connectivity to facilitate data flow [2,9,10,11,12,13,14,15].
    There is an increasing role that knowledge and information can play in gaining
    control of resources, increasing profits, and reducing risk in farming [16,17].
    There are many benefits of precision agriculture (PA) for farmers. It improves
    the productivity and profitability of the farm and automation of machine operations,
    improves comfort, lowers the CO2 footprint and water contamination with nitrate
    and pesticides, and improves the public image of farming. The use of Hi-Tech can
    attract young people to farming and keep them in rural areas [2,18]. Precision
    agriculture helps farmers to adjust to policy requirements concerning environmental
    protection. The use of herbicides on organic farms is banned in Europe [19,20,21,22],
    stimulating changes in crop production systems. In addition, consumer habits are
    forming, and there is growing concern about access to safe food. Adopting sustainable
    agriculture techniques boosts productivity and production, assists ecosystem sustainability,
    and strengthens the capacity to respond to climate change, extreme weather, droughts,
    floods, and other disasters, as well as progressively increasing land and soil
    quality [23]. It is also expected that problematic weed management (due to herbicide
    resistance, the lower efficacy of chemicals due to the timing of application,
    and weather-indicated lower efficacy) is acting as a driver for the adoption of
    non-chemical solutions [24,25]. Weeding is one of the most important factors in
    agricultural production. Weeds can lower the productivity in crop systems. Farmers
    are facing severe problems with weed competition [26]. New weeding techniques
    are being developed to meet the challenges of sustainable production. Automatic
    weed removal technology provides a path to alternative weed control tools that
    is much more promising, at least for specialty crops, than the traditional model,
    which is based on herbicide development [27]. These tools include laser-based
    weeding. Laser-based weeding seems to be a promising alternative to the use of
    chemicals. The WeLASER technique is a novel technique of weed control developed
    under the HORIZON 2020 project WeLASER, the objective of which is to reduce the
    use of herbicides while improving productivity and competitiveness. The WeLASER
    weeder is an autonomous mobile robot using a high-power laser to eliminate weeds.
    It is a complex solution using autonomous systems, artificial intelligence (AI),
    and advanced geo-positioning. The invention was developed, integrated, and tested
    in the “Sustainable Weed Management In Agriculture With Laser-based Autonomous
    Tools-WeLASER” project. It comprises a mobile autonomous platform, a laser weeding
    unit, and supportive components. In the WeLASER project, a weeding system with
    two lasers was tested to achieve Technology Readiness Level 7 (TRL 7). To be commercialized,
    the product must attain further development by obtaining Technology Readiness
    Level 9 (TRL 9) status. The commercialization product will be equipped with four
    high-power lasers. The WeLASER machine has four baseline components: 1. an autonomous
    mobile platform; 2. a weed meristem perception system; 3. a smart central controller;
    4. a laser-based weeding tool with a high-power laser source and a meristem targeting
    system. The successful implementation of the technique depends on many factors
    related to the innovation itself, the policy context, the types of farming systems,
    conditions, and users’ attitudes. Understanding the conditions of adoption of
    the technique is crucial both for its final design and commercialization and for
    developing business models for its application. Farmers’ attitudes towards field
    crop robots in a European setting have hardly been studied, despite the increasing
    availability of the technology [28]. In social-science reviews, the singularity
    of agricultural robots is rarely considered [29]. It is instead resituated within
    the context of the diversity of digital innovations [30]. Knowledge of farmers’
    perceptions of technological innovations is important for agricultural machinery
    stakeholders, for research centers, and for policymakers [31]. In the study, the
    attitudes of the farmers towards innovation in agriculture in general terms and
    towards the WeLASER technique specifically were studied. A CATI survey was carried
    out for this purpose. In the study, the inter-relations between various factors
    determining the adoption of the new techniques were analyzed. The results of the
    study were intended to help improve the design and business models for its implementation
    and prepare recommendations for European policies regarding precision agriculture
    and the weed control system. 2. Materials and Methods The overall aim of the survey
    is to gain insight into attitudes towards the innovative weed control tool (laser-based
    autonomous robot) and to obtain knowledge on whether farmers see an opportunity
    or not to implement it and what the barriers and possibilities of implementing
    the device in their practice are. The intention of the work was to obtain valuable
    insights into the future implementation of precision agricultural techniques in
    weed control. The research questions of the study are as follows: What experiences
    and attitudes do farmers have towards innovative farming tools based on automation,
    advanced electronics, communication, and artificial intelligence? What obstacles
    and opportunities could arise in the practical application of laser-based weed
    control tools such as WeLASER in practice? How would farmers’ current experiences
    and expectations regarding the adoption of innovative technologies influence their
    attitudes towards WeLASER implementation? According to the Diffusion of Innovation
    (DOI) theory presented by E.M. Rogers [32,33], adoption means that a person does
    something different from what they had done previously (i.e., purchase or use
    a new product/technology). The key to adoption is that the person must perceive
    the idea, behavior, or product as new or innovative. Attitude towards technology
    is a key factor influencing the adoption of a wide range of technologies. An attitude
    is a psychological tendency expressed by evaluating a particular object with a
    certain degree of favor or disfavor. Consumers’ attitudes towards technology affect
    the way they purchase, what they buy, when they purchase, and even how they pay
    for purchases. “Attitudes” are an integral part of the Theory of Reasoned Action
    (TRA); its modification, the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM); and the Theory
    of Planned Behavior. These theories/model include “attitudes” at their core. Attitudes
    are understood as predictions of intentions and presuppose a rational (‘reasoned’,
    or ‘planned’) process [34,35,36,37]. An attitude can be defined as an evaluative
    judgment, either favorable or unfavorable, that an individual possesses and directs
    towards a specific object of attitude. In the context of technology, attitude
    towards technology is one’s positive or negative evaluation of the introduction
    of new kinds of technologies in a particular environment [32,33,38]. The conceptual
    framework is presented in Table 1. Table 1. Conceptual framework—factors related
    to the adoption of novel technologies in general and of WeLASER in particular
    by farmers. The concept of assessment is presented in the figure below (Figure
    1). Figure 1. General concept of assessment. The CATI method was chosen for the
    survey. The CATI survey of farmers was planned in three countries: Denmark, Spain,
    and Poland. The main criterion for the selection of countries was the level of
    development and technological advancement of agriculture: a modern and very efficient
    agriculture (Denmark, Spain) and a moderate level of development (Poland), where
    the processes of technological transformation are slower. Based on the assumed
    objective of the CATI survey, the assumptions for the analysis and the number
    of cross-sections we would use to analyze the results of the survey were determined.
    The assumptions (sample selection criteria) we chose for the survey are as follows:
    Farmers are active in the production of field crops, vegetables, and horticulture.
    Cross section for farms of the surface over 1 ha: 50% of farms from 1 to 49 ha
    and 50% for farms over 50+ ha. Farmers have made modernization investments in
    their farms in the last 10 years. For these parameters, a sample of at least N
    = 30 was obtained for large-, medium-, and small-sized farms in each country:
    Denmark, Poland, and Spain. If the sample size is larger than 30, we can use the
    z-test according to the statistical rules, where the test-statistic follows a
    normal distribution. In addition to these selection criteria for the sample, other
    parameters such as the type of farm, the age/gender of the farm manager, and the
    level of education were determined randomly so that cross-sectional analysis could
    also be carried out depending on the results. The sample N = 100 was planned as
    it offers a large scope to obtain results that allow a cross-sectional analysis
    (at the farm level) that is sufficient, with regard to the objective of the CATI
    survey. The following table shows the number of agricultural holdings in the three
    countries analyzed: Denmark, Spain and Poland (Table 2). Table 2. Number of agricultural
    holdings by size and country. The sample size (number of respondents 𝑛 ) for CATI
    research required to estimate a population proportion with a given confidence
    level and a desired margin of error is calculated as follows (1): 𝑛=𝑝·(1−𝑝)· (
    ( 𝑧 𝛼/2 ) 𝐸 ) 2 (1) where p is the expected proportion (0.5 was used in the calculations
    to be on safe side), 𝑧 𝛼/2 is the critical value with a confidence level of 95%
    (1.96), and 𝐸 is the desired margin of error (0.1). With a sample of 𝑛 = 97, the
    assumptions made above are fulfilled for farms of 0 to 49.9 ha and farms of 50
    ha and more. Thus, a sample size of 𝑛 = 100 is sufficient for carrying out a quantitative
    statistical analysis (for this 𝑛 , the margin of error is 𝐸 = 0.098). In accordance
    with the conceptual framework, the questionnaire was developed in three parts:
    Profile of the interviewees; Section on perceptions of innovation in agriculture
    based on the farmer’s own experience or views; Section on the evaluation of WeLASER
    implementation from a farmer’s individual perspective. Statistical Analyses of
    Data As part of the WeLASER project, surveys were conducted with 100 respondents
    in 3 countries. As the data were mainly nominal, a cross-tabulation analysis was
    used to produce the results. Pearson’s chi-square test was used to test the relationship
    between the two selected variables expressed on a nominal scale [45]. The Pearson
    chi-square statistic is calculated according to Formula (2): 𝜒 2 =∑ ( 𝑂 𝑖𝑗 − 𝐸
    𝑖𝑗 ) 2 𝐸 𝑖𝑗 (2) where 𝑂 denotes the observed values, 𝐸 the expected values, 𝑖
    row index, and 𝑗 the column index of the table. The test statistic from the above
    formula is approximately distributed as 𝜒 2 with ( 𝑟 − 1) × ( 𝑐 − 1) degrees of
    freedom, where 𝑟 is the number of rows and 𝑐 is the number of columns. The p-value
    was calculated based on the 𝜒 2 distribution value. The p-value indicates the
    probability that the null hypothesis H0 is true for a given pair of variables.
    If the p-value is small enough, we reject the null hypothesis; if the p-value
    is high, the null hypothesis is not rejected. The significance threshold was assumed
    to be α = 0.05. The test for independence can be expressed as follows: H0.  R
    and C are independent; there is no relationship between R and C; Oi = Ei; H1.  R
    and C are dependent; there is a relationship between C and R; Oi ≠ Ei. Here, R
    stands for rows, dependent variables; C for columns, independent variables; H0
    for the null hypothesis; H1 for the alternative hypothesis; Oi for the observed
    values in cross-tabulation; and Ei for the expected values in the cross-tabulation.
    In addition to the p-value, the upper limit for the Bayes factor 𝐵      and
    was calculated (3). This is calculated for a given p-value and is a maximum coefficient
    that indicates how many times the alternative hypothesis H1 is more likely to
    be true than the null hypothesis H0. The upper limit for the Bayes factor 𝐵 
        was calculated using the following formula [46,47]: 𝐵      =−1/(𝑒·𝑝−𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒·ln(𝑝−𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒))
    (3) Cramer’s V was used to calculate the strength of the correlation between two
    cross-tabulated variables [48]. It is defined by the following Formula (4): 𝑉=
    𝜒 2 𝑛×𝑡 − − − − − √ (4) where 𝑡 is calculated according to the following Formula
    (5): 𝑡=𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑚𝑢𝑚(𝑟−1,𝑐−1) (5) where 𝑡 is the smaller result of the two subtractions
    and n is the number of respondents. The Lee scale was used in the interpretation
    of Cramer’s V coefficient [49]. Lee suggests the thresholds presented in the table
    below for interpreting the association. Cramér’s V Values Association Cramér’s
    V Values Interpretation V < 0.1 negligible 0.4 < V < 0.6 relatively strong 0.1
    < V < 0.2 weak 0.6 < V < 0.8 strong 0.2 < V < 0.4 moderate V > 0.8 very strong
    In addition, the z-test and the p-value were calculated for the comparisons of
    the column proportions. The Z statistics of z-test is calculated using the following
    Formula (6) [50]: 𝑍= 𝑑𝑖𝑓 𝑆𝐸 0 (6) where the numerator 𝑑𝑖𝑓 represents the difference
    between the column proportions and is calculated according to the following Formula
    (7): 𝑑𝑖𝑓= 𝑝 𝑎 − 𝑝 𝑏 (7) where 𝑝 𝑎 is the first proportion of a particular row
    in a given column and 𝑝 𝑏 is the second proportion of the same row in another
    column. The denominator 𝑆𝐸 0 is the standard error for the difference under H0
    which is calculated using the following Formula (8): 𝑆𝐸 0 = 𝑝 ̂  ·(1− 𝑝 ̂  )·(
    1 𝑛 𝑎 + 1 𝑛 𝑏 ) − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − √ (8) where 𝑛 𝑎 and 𝑛 𝑏
    denote the sample size of columns a and b. The notation 𝑝 ̂  is an estimated proportion
    for both columns and is given by the following Equation (9): 𝑝 ̂  = 𝑝 𝑎 · 𝑛 𝑎
    + 𝑝 𝑏 · 𝑛 𝑏 𝑛 𝑎 + 𝑛 𝑏 (9) Under the null hypothesis, both columns’ proportions
    have the same value, and it is equal to 𝑝 ̂  . After calculating the Z value and
    assuming that it follows a standard normal distribution, our p-value is calculated
    as 2-tailed significance using Formula (10): 𝑝−𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒=2·Φ(𝑍) (10) where Φ denotes
    the standard normal distribution and Z represents the value of the z-test. The
    Pearson chi-square statistic and Cramer’s V association coefficient were calculated
    using the GNU PSPP 1.6.2 software [51]. Z-tests for the difference in column proportions
    were calculated using MS EXCEL 2019. 3. Results 3.1. Results of Tests for Existence
    of Association and Calculation of Strength of Association A total of 300 participants
    took part in the survey, 100 each from Denmark, Poland, and Spain. The respondents
    had to answer 9 questions about themselves and 13 questions about their opinion.
    The questions describing the respondents and their farms are listed below. Code
    Question S1 Which of the following statements best describes your role in farm
    decision-making? S2 What type of production does your farm do? S3 Have you modernized
    your farm in the past 10 years? S4 Please specify the size of your farm’s arable
    land area A1 Size of farm expressed in 3 classes: 1–49 ha; 50–99 ha; 100 and more
    S5 What is the type of cultivation system on your farm? S6 How old are you? A2
    Age of farmer expressed in 3 classes: up to 39; 40–64; 65 and more S7 Gender:
    S8 What is your highest education level? S9 What level of agricultural education
    you have? The answers to the above questions were expressed on a nominal scale,
    with the exception of the answers to the questions on age and farm size. However,
    in further analyses, the data on age and farm size were expressed in three classes.
    Below is a list of key questions that describe respondents’ opinions on the introduction
    of the new laser weed removal device. The key questions were developed according
    to the conceptual framework presented in Table 1. The list below was used for
    detailed analysis. For responses with multiple answer options, the most important
    ones were statistically analyzed (P4, P5, P9B, P10). There were also additional
    questions describing alternative preferences, such as “What is second or third
    most important to you?”. Code Question P1 Do you use innovation on your own farm?
    P2 What is your opinion on the ease of use of innovative technologies? Which of
    the following opinions would you subscribe to? P3 How do you evaluate the quality
    and reliability of innovative technologies (machines and specific implements)
    available on the market? P4 Which attributes of your farm are important for use
    of innovative machinery? P4_1-1st most important: P5 Do you see essential benefits
    in implementing innovative technologies? P5_1-1st most important: P6 Are you satisfied
    with the weed control solutions available for your work? P7 Is WeLASER weed control
    technology a good solution in your opinion? P8 Would you be interested in implementation
    of WeLASER weeding control technology on your farm? P9A Which way of applying
    WeLASER weeding control technology in practice would be the most realistic from
    your point of view? P9B Why wouldn’t you decide to use the WeLASER weeding control
    technology? P9B_1-1st most important: P10 Thinking about buying WeLASER weeding
    control technology in the future, what factors might influence your decision?
    P10_1-1st most important: P11 What would convince you or other farmers of the
    advantages of using WeLASER weeding control technology? P12 Will you be following
    the further development of WeLASER weeding control technology as a potential future
    application on your farm? In the analysis, 4 questions from the first group and
    12 key questions from the second group were selected for further analysis. The
    matrix below shows selected pairs of questions that were analyzed in the survey.
    A total of 110 pairs of relationships were analyzed (Table 3). The analyses were
    conducted separately for Denmark, Poland, and Spain. Table 3. Matrix of performed
    analyses. The analysis was divided into two phases. The first phase involved (a)
    performing tests for the presence of a correlation by calculating the p-value
    of the Pearson chi-squared statistic, (b) assessing the strength of the correlation
    with the Cramer’s V coefficient, and (c) calculating the descriptive statistics
    of these two parameters. The second stage involved a comparison of these parameters
    for Denmark, Poland, and Spain and the selection of data for further analysis.
    The second phase involved analyses performed on the selected dataset, including
    (a) comparisons of column proportions for Denmark, Poland, and Spain for variables
    describing respondents’ opinions, (b) examples of the calculation of cross-tabulations
    with significant association (α less than 0.05), and (c) analysis of cross-tabulation
    results for dominant responses and cross-tabulations with a p-value < 0.0005 (this
    is the maximum value calculated by the GNU PSPP software, which the program records
    as 0). 3.1.1. Results for Denmark The table below shows the probability of not
    rejecting the null hypothesis (H0) or rejecting the alternative hypothesis (H1)
    for the Danish variables (Table 4). Table 4. Results of the test on independence
    of key variables describing respondent profile and respondent opinions for Denmark.
    In the case of Denmark, we have 46 pairs with a p-value of less than 0.05. There
    are also 36 cases with a p-value of less than 0.01 and 32 cases with a p-value
    of less than 0.005. There are 21 cases where the calculation of the p-value resulted
    in 0 (in reality it is <0.0005). From this, we can conclude that there is a correlation
    between the variables in 42.2% of the pairs analyzed (p-value < 0.05). The median
    of the p-value is 0.096, and the measure of variability, the median absolute deviation
    from the median (MAD), is 0.142. The next table shows the strength of the relationships
    and presents the results of the Cramer’s V calculation only for pairs of variables
    with a p-value of less than 0.05 (Table 5). Of the total of 46 pairs that met
    the selection criterion, 17 (37.0%) achieved a value of at least 0.4 (relatively
    strong association). The minimum Cramer’s V value is 0.25. The median Cramer’s
    V association coefficient for 46 pairs is 0.36, and the MAD is 0.074. The strongest
    associations are observed for pairs P1-A1 (0.69), P9A-A2 (0.62), and P1–P5 and
    P8–P9A (0.58). Table 5. Results of the Cramer’s V association of key variables
    describing respondent profile and respondent opinions for Denmark. 3.1.2. Results
    for Poland Table 6 shows the probability with which the null hypothesis (H0) is
    not rejected for the variables of Poland. Table 6. Results of the test on independence
    of key variables describing respondent profile and respondent opinions for Poland.
    In the case of the Polish part of the analysis, we have 25 pairs with a p-value
    of less than 0.05, 14 cases with a p-value less than 0.01, and 9 pairs with a
    p-value of less than 0.005. There are six pairs where the calculation of the p-value
    resulted in 0. From this, we can conclude that there is a correlation between
    the variables in 22.9% of the pairs (p-value < 0.05). The median of the p-values
    is 0.343, and the MAD is 0.436. The median for Poland is higher than that for
    Denmark. The next table contains the results of the Cramer’s V calculation for
    pairs of variables in Poland with a p-value of less than 0.05 (Table 7). In total,
    there are 22 pairs that fulfill this criterion. Three of them have a value of
    at least 0.4. The minimum value of Cramer’s V is 0.24. The median of the Cramer’s
    V association coefficient for 22 pairs is 0.31, and the MAD is 0.02. The three
    strongest associations are observed for the pairs P3–P9A (0.43), P9A–P12 (0.41)
    and P7–P12 (0.4). The median Cramer’s V for Poland is higher than that for Denmark.
    Table 7. Results of the Cramer’s V association of key variables describing respondent
    profile and respondent opinions for Poland. 3.1.3. Results for Spain Table 8 shows
    the probability that the null hypothesis (H0) is not rejected for the variables
    of Spain. In this case, we have 26 pairs with a p-value of less than 0.05, 12
    cases with a p-value of less than 0.01, and 11 cases with a p-value of less than
    0.005. In eight cases, the calculation of the p-value resulted in 0. We can conclude
    that there is a relationship between the variables in 23.9% of the analyzed pairs
    (p-value < 0.05). The median p-value is 0.256, and the MAD is 0.307. These values
    are higher than the corresponding values for Denmark and lower than the corresponding
    values for Poland. Table 8. Results of the test on independence of key variables
    describing respondent profile and respondent opinions for Spain. Table 9 shows
    the results of the Cramer’s V calculation for pairs of variables with a p-value
    of < 0.05. Table 9. Results of the Cramer’s V association of key variables describing
    respondent profile and respondent opinions for Spain. At least 5 out of 26 (19%)
    scored 0.4. The minimum value of Cramer’s V is 0.26. The median of the association
    coefficient of Cramer’s V for 26 pairs is 0.31, and the MAD is 0.052. The strongest
    association is observed for the pair P7–P12 (0.59). The second strongest is observed
    for the pair P9A–P12 (0.49), and the third strongest for the pair P9B-S9 (0.45).
    As a summary of the comparative analysis between Denmark, Poland, and Spain, a
    complementary statistical analysis of the p-value and Cramer’s V coefficient was
    performed. The following table shows the descriptive statistics of the p-value
    and Cramer’s V association coefficient for the analyzed countries. The Cramer’s
    V statistics only include pairs with a p-value of <0.05 (Table 10). Table 10.
    Statistics of p-value and Cramer’s V association for Denmark, Poland, and Spain.
    In most cases, the variables representing both the p-values and the Cramer’s V
    association coefficient do not conform to the normal distribution. For this reason,
    non-parametric estimators for location and dispersion (median, MAD) are more suitable
    than classical estimators (arithmetic mean and standard deviation). It can be
    observed that the median of the p-value for Denmark is lower than the median of
    the p-value for Poland and Spain, and the differences are statistically significant.
    The differences between Poland and Spain are rather small and not statistically
    significant. The MAD (median absolute deviation) of the p-value, which in this
    case is an indicator of dispersion, varies similarly to the median. The lowest
    MAD is observed in the case of Denmark, while it is much higher in Poland and
    Spain, with Poland being slightly higher than Spain. In all cases, the MAD is
    higher than the median. For Cramer’s V coefficient, we can see that the parameters
    of location of Cramer’s V for Denmark are higher than their counterparts for Poland
    and Spain (both medians and means). The differences in the medians of Cramer’s
    V between Denmark and the other two countries are statistically significant. The
    differences in the medians of Cramer’s V between Poland and Spain are small and
    not statistically significant. Poland has the lowest variability in the Cramer’s
    V association coefficient expressed in standard deviation, while Denmark has the
    highest Cramer’s V. 3.2. Comparisons of Column Proportions for Denmark, Poland,
    and Spain This part of the results refers only to variables that reflect the opinions
    of the respondents. The results of the column comparison proportions are shown
    in the following table. The frequencies of occurrence of differences with a p-value
    of < 0.1 and a p-value of < 0.05 were calculated, and the results are shown in
    the following table (Table 11). Table 11. Results of column proportion comparison
    for Denmark, Poland, and Spain. It should be noted that the total number of significant
    differences in the column proportions is 200, and the number of differences with
    α less than 0.05 (101) is generally the same as with α less than 0.10 (99). In
    contrast to the results of the previous parameters (p-value and Cramer’s V), the
    highest number of significant differences concerns Poland, and the lowest concerns
    Denmark. And this applies both to the total number of differences and to the differences
    at both α-levels. Examples of cross-tabulations with significant correlation (α
    less than 0.05): There are nine common pairs for all three countries, five of
    which have a mean value of Cramer’s V greater than 0.4 (relatively strong association).
    These are P9A–P12 (0.475), P1–P5 (mean value of Cramer’s V is 0.423), P7–P12 (mean
    value is 0.420), P7–P8 (mean value is 0.415), and P1–P2 (0.415). The other remaining
    pairs are P8–P12, P6–P7, P5–P7, and P1–P8. For reasons of conciseness, only one
    pair of questions was selected for a more detailed description, namely P1–P2.
    The cross-tabulation is made up of two questions: In the columns, P1 represents
    an independent variable. The question P1 is as follows: “Do you use innovation
    on your own farm?” The possible answers are as follows: (A) I already use innovation
    on my farm; (B) I am considering using innovation; (C) I do not use, but I am
    interested in it; (D) I do not use, and I am not interested in it; (E) Hard to
    say. The dependent variable P2 is the following question: “P2. What is your opinion
    on the ease of use of innovative technologies? Which of the following opinions
    would you subscribe to?”. The possible answers are as follows: (i) I find it easy
    to implement innovative technologies on my own; (ii) Implementing innovative technologies
    requires me to acquire new skills and knowledge, but it is not a problem for me;
    (iii) I think it would be a problem for me to acquire new skills and knowledge,
    but I can do it; (iv) Implementing innovative technologies is a problem for me
    and I have to rely on external support and advice; (v) I don’t know/I have an
    opinion. Below, the contingency table shows the number of cases for each pair
    of answers for Denmark. The number of cases also indicates the percentage, as
    we have exactly 100 cases in total (Table 12). Table 12. Cross-tabulation of P1
    and P2 questions for Denmark. In the case of Denmark, the calculated p-value of
    the Pearson chi-squared statistic is 0 (less than 0.0005), and the Cramer’s V
    coefficient is 0.56. From the table above, it can be deduced that 44% of respondents
    already use innovations on their farms, and 40% do not use them but are interested
    in doing so. From this, it can be concluded that for those who use innovations,
    it is not a problem to introduce innovative technologies themselves (12 cases
    and all answers A in group “i”). It should be noted that there is a significant
    difference in the column proportions for the group in row “ii” between columns
    A and C. The p-value of the z-test is less than 0.05, which means that the proportion
    of A responses is significantly higher than the proportion of C responses. The
    opposite result is observed for row “iii”, where the proportion of C is significantly
    higher than the proportion of A. The next contingency table shows the answer pairs
    for Poland (Table 13). Table 13. Cross-tabulation of P1 and P2 questions for Poland.
    In the case of Poland, the calculated p-value of the Pearson chi-squared statistic
    is 0, and the Cramer’s V coefficient is 0.37. We can see that no one answered
    “Hard to say” to question P1, so column E was omitted. From the table for Poland,
    we can deduce that 64% of respondents already use innovation on their farms. For
    51% of respondents, it is not a problem to introduce innovative technologies,
    even if this requires the acquisition of new skills and knowledge. In this group
    of respondents (answer “ii”), we observe significant differences in the column
    proportions. The proportions of column A are significantly higher than those of
    columns B, C, and D. But only the difference between the proportions of columns
    A and D is significant at α equal to 0.05. For the remaining two differences (marked
    with small letters), the significance level α is 0.10. The next contingency table
    presents pairs of answers for Spain (Table 14). Table 14. Cross-tabulation of
    P1 and P2 questions for Spain. In this case, the calculated p-value of the Pearson
    chi-squared statistic is 0.021, and the Cramer’s V coefficient is 0.27. We can
    see that 70% of respondents already use innovations on their farms. About half
    of them do not see a major problem in introducing innovations, while the other
    half see problems and need to rely on external support. In the case of Spain,
    the group of respondents who see a problem with the introduction of innovative
    technologies is the most numerous (30% of all respondents). In this group (represented
    by row “iv”), the proportion of those who already use innovations clearly exceeds
    the proportion of those who do not use innovations (columns C and D). However,
    there are slight differences in the significance level of the difference in the
    column shares between A and C and between A and D. The first value corresponds
    to α equal to 0.05, and the second to α equal to 0.10. 3.3. The Predominant Responses
    in Selected Cross-Tabulations for Variables Describing Respondents’ Opinions In
    this part of the analysis, we looked at individual crosstabs. We selected crosstabs
    with a p-value of the χ2 statistic of less than 0.0005. At this p-value, the alternative
    hypothesis H1 is at most 96.8 times more likely than the null hypothesis H0. A
    total of 27 crosstabs fulfill the above criterion, 13 from Danish crosstabs, 6
    from Polish crosstabs, and 8 from Spanish crosstabs. Each crosstab consists of
    r × c crossings (number of rows times number of columns), which represent pairs
    of answers. The dominant crossings, that is, dominant pairs of responses, are
    described below. Denmark Denmark’s first cross-tabulation with a p-value of 0
    is the cross-tabulation P1–P2, which consists of 25 intersections. We can see
    that the dominant group with 29% are the respondents who already use innovation
    on their farm and believe that it is easy to introduce innovative technologies
    themselves. In the next cross-tabulation, P1–P3, which consists of 20 intersections,
    the respondents who already use innovation on their farm and believe that innovative
    technologies are generally of good quality and reliable dominate with 42%. In
    cross-tabulation P1–P5 (30 intersections), the group of respondents who already
    use innovations on their farms and believe that the introduction of new technologies
    brings significant economic benefits (cost reduction, higher income) dominates
    with 27%. The results of cross-tabulation P1–P6 (25 intersections) show that the
    dominant group, which accounts for 31% of respondents, already uses innovations
    on their farms and is quite satisfied with the available weed control solutions.
    The cross-tabulation P1–P8 (25 intersections) is dominated by 27% of respondents
    who do not use the innovation on their farm but are interested in it and would
    be willing to use WeLASER weed control technology but believe that it only partially
    solves their weed control problems. The cross-tabulation P1–P12 (25 intersections)
    shows that the predominant group, accounting for 29%, are farmers who already
    use the innovation on their farms and are very willing to pursue the further development
    of WeLASER weed control technology as a possible future application on their farm.
    In cross-tabulation P2–P3 (20 intercepts), 31% of respondents (the dominant group)
    believe that the introduction of innovative technologies requires the acquisition
    of new skills and knowledge, but have no problem with this. This group also believes
    that the innovative technologies available on the market (machines and specific
    tools) are generally of good quality and reliable. The cross-tabulation P2–P5
    (30 intersections) is dominated by the 20% of respondents who believe that the
    introduction of innovative technologies requires the acquisition of new skills
    and knowledge, but this is relatively easy to accomplish. They also believe that
    the introduction of innovative technologies brings significant economic benefits
    (cost reduction, higher revenues). The cross-tabulation P3–P5 (24 intersections)
    shows that 34% of respondents (the dominant group) generally consider innovative
    technologies to be of high quality and reliable and that these technologies bring
    considerable economic benefits. In cross-tabulation P5–P6 (30 crosses), 35% of
    respondents believe that innovative technologies have significant economic benefits,
    while they are unlikely to be satisfied with available weed control solutions.
    The cross-tabulation P5–P12 (30 intersections) shows that the predominant group,
    accounting for 31% of respondents, are those who believe that innovative technologies
    have significant economic benefits and at the same time believe that they will
    pursue further development of WeLASER weed control technology as a possible future
    application on their farm. The results of cross-tabulation P7–P8 (20 intersections)
    show that 26% of respondents (the dominant group) think that WeLASER weed control
    technology seems to be a good solution and are interested in using WeLASER weed
    control technology on their farms, even if they think it will only partially solve
    their weed control problems. In the final Danish cross-tabulation P8–P12, which
    consists of 25 intersections, respondents who believe that WeLASER will only partially
    solve their weed control problems are the dominant group with 29%, although they
    are interested in implementation and believe that they are likely to follow the
    further development of WeLASER. Poland The first cross-tabulation for Poland with
    a p-value of 0 is the cross-tabulation P1–P2, which consists of 20 cross-points.
    We can see that the dominant group with 34% are the respondents who already apply
    innovations on their farm and believe that it is easy to introduce innovative
    technologies themselves. The second cross-tabulation for Poland, P2–P7, consists
    of 25 intersections. The dominant group, accounting for 33%, are respondents who
    believe that the introduction of innovative technologies requires the acquisition
    of new skills and knowledge, which is not a problem, while at the same time, they
    believe that WeLASER weed control technology is a good solution. A further cross-tabulation
    of P7–P8 (30 intersections) shows that 35% of respondents (the dominant group)
    think WeLASER weed control technology is a good solution and are rather interested
    in implementing WeLASER, although they believe it will only partially solve their
    weed control problems. The cross-tabulation P7–P10 (25 intersections) shows that
    24% of farmers (the dominant group) think that WeLASER seems to be a good solution
    and that the most important factor influencing the decision to purchase WeLASER
    weed control technology is the availability of public support. The results shown
    in cross-tabulation P7–P12 (25 intersections) show that the dominant group, representing
    39% of respondents, considers WeLASER to be a good solution and is likely to follow
    the further development of the technology. The final cross-tabulation for Poland,
    P8–P10 (30 intersections), shows that 23% of respondents (the dominant group)
    are rather interested in using WeLASER weed control technology even if it cannot
    solve all weed problems and that they believe that the most important factor influencing
    the decision to purchase WeLASER weed control technology is the availability of
    public support. Spain The first cross-tabulation for Spain with a p-value of 0
    is the cross-tabulation P1–P5, which consists of 35 intersections. The predominant
    group, accounting for 37%, are respondents who already use innovation on their
    farms and believe that the most important benefit of introducing innovative technologies
    is the improvement of working conditions. In the second cross-tabulation for Spain,
    P1–P7 (25 intersections), the dominant 55% of respondents already use the innovation
    on their farm and think that WeLASER appears to be a good solution. In cross-tabulation
    P3–P5 (28 intersections), 37% of respondents (the dominant group) believe that
    the innovative technologies available on the market (machines and specific tools)
    are generally of good quality and reliable and that the main significant benefit
    of introducing innovative technologies is that they improve working conditions.
    In cross-tabulation P4–P8 (30 intersections), 21% of farmers (the dominant group)
    believe that the most important factor influencing the possible use of innovative
    machinery is the structure of agricultural land (subdivided plots), and they consider
    this technology very useful for weed control (they are interested in adopting
    WeLASER weed control technology). In cross-tabulation P6–P7 (20 intersections),
    47% of respondents (the dominant group) are rather satisfied with the weed control
    solutions available to them in their work, and for them, the WeLASER weed control
    technology seems to be a good solution. Cross-tabulation P7–P8 (25 intersections)
    shows that for the dominant group, representing 33% of respondents, WeLASER weed
    control technology seems to be a good solution, and they would definitely find
    this technology useful for weed control and are interested in using WeLASER weed
    control technology on their farm. In cross-tabulation P7–P12 (25 intersections),
    the dominant group, representing 43% of respondents, believes that the WeLASER
    weed control technology seems to be a good solution and that they will definitely
    follow the further development of WeLASER. In the last crossover table for Spain
    (with p-value = 0), P8–P12 consisting of 25 intersections, the dominant group,
    representing 40% of the respondents, would definitely find the technology useful
    for weed control, is interested in using WeLASER technology for weed control on
    their farm, and will definitely follow the further development of the WeLASER
    weeder. 4. Discussion The results obtained show meaningful patterns in relation
    to the three groups of questions: respondents’ profiles, experiences and attitudes
    towards innovation in agriculture, and attitudes towards laser-based weed control
    solutions such as the WeLASER weeder within the regional context. Significant
    differences are observed between countries. Denmark It can be observed that innovations
    in Denmark are implemented by well-established farmers who generally have a higher
    education. The use of innovations is associated strongly with farm size with large
    farms predominating and to a lesser extent with the age of the farmer. The use
    of innovation was mostly reported by middle-aged and highly educated farmers,
    with 43% of those respondents already using innovation and 7% of those considering
    innovation. The results show that farm size determines the experience and socio-economic
    potential of adopting innovative techniques. According to Danish farmers, the
    key factors are the ease of use of these technologies, their quality, and their
    potential benefits. These attributes are strongly associated with the farm size
    with the exception of the perception of benefits. Of the farmers who use innovation,
    12% find it easy to use, and 29% state that it is not a problem to learn new technology,
    even if it requires new skills. For 40% of all respondents, it is also a relevant
    answer, and 27% state that additional assistance is required. It can be deduced
    from this that advanced farming in well-established farms run by experienced practitioners
    is a strong factor in innovation adoption. Farmers who are experienced in using
    innovation also see significant advantages in their implementation, as reported
    by around 44% of those who already use innovations (31% of all respondents), 8%
    of those who are considering using them, and 40% of those who are interested in
    using them (45% of all respondents). The main benefits cited were working conditions
    and economic advantages. This is in line with studies from the United States,
    where farm size, computer skills, full-time farming employment, farm type, and
    farm location were cited as key factors for adopting PA [52]. A high level of
    satisfaction with weed control is observed among Danish respondents (rather satisfied—46%),
    although the predominant response indicates some uncertainty. Farmers’ views on
    weed control measures are strongly associated with the current experience of using
    innovation in general, the positive assessment of the reliability and quality
    of innovations, and the perception of their benefits. Farmers who are rather satisfied
    with the weed control solutions on their farms see the benefits of innovative
    techniques in the improvement of working conditions (17%) and in significant economic
    benefits (35%). These respondents perceive the innovative techniques to be usually
    of good quality and reliable (68% (42% of all respondents)). This indicates that
    the quality expectations of farmers are quite high and also place high demands
    on weed control methods. In the Danish data, the association between the use of
    innovation on farms and the opinion on the potential use of the WeLASER weeder
    is rather weak, or no relevant association is found. For example, the perception
    of the good quality of the innovation is not associated with the willingness to
    adopt WeLASER. The majority of these farmers do not perceive the WeLASER weeder
    as an important technology for their farm (39.4% of responses were that the weeder
    is probably or definitely not useful for their farm). Only 11% expressed the view
    that they might rather implement the technology, although it will not solve all
    the weed problems. This can be explained by the fact that different farming practices
    and economic and structural circumstances determine their perception. Furthermore,
    the high level of satisfaction with current practices does not encourage them
    to look for more radical solutions. Although farmers are generally positive about
    WeLASER technology, there is a certain reluctance to formulate their opinion about
    its application in their practice. Most of the respondents expressed the view
    that it is “hard to say” whether WeLASER is a good solution (54%). For 35% of
    all respondents, it seems to be a good solution. The majority of these farmers
    expressed interest in the implementation of the WeLASER weeder but saw it as only
    a partial solution to weed problems (90% of all respondents). The reluctance towards
    the technology can also be explained by the fact that there are not yet many applications
    of the robot that have been tested in practice, although the farmers’ curiosity
    and expectations are obvious. Of the respondents who do not use innovations, 24%
    are interested both in innovations in general and see a potential for WeLASER
    weeder introduction. The uncertainty is also reflected in the strong association
    between the answers on the satisfaction with the current weed control solution,
    “rather satisfied”, and the use of WeLASER, “rather WeLASER can partially solve
    the problems”. The general reluctance is most likely related to the lack of specific
    information as 82% of Danish respondents stated that they need more reliable and
    accurate information about the technology in order to eventually implement it
    in their practice. This is in line with other studies where the performance expectation
    factor should be increased by better communication [43]. Farmers who rated WeLASER
    technology as a suitable solution for their farm indicated renting of services
    (35%), purchase with external funding (25%), joint purchase (15%), and renting
    without service (10%) as options for adoption. Potential interest (“probable”)
    in further developments of the WeLASER weeder was expressed by both young and
    middle-aged farmers. Poland Predominantly, middle-aged farmers use innovation
    in agriculture, but in terms of farm size, there is an even split between small,
    medium, and large farms without strong prevalence towards any category. This can
    be explained by the high proportion of medium-sized farms (up to 49 ha) in the
    study. This is partly consistent with other studies in Poland which have observed
    that precision farming techniques are more popular with farmers who are younger
    than 40 years old, have higher education, and run large farms [53,54]. In Poland,
    the farm scale and the use of innovation were also identified as significant factors
    in the perception of innovation adoption. There is a statistical association between
    the size of farms and the perception of ease of use. Of the respondents, 51% perceive
    technologies as requiring additional skills and knowledge and state at the same
    time that it is not a problem for them to learn how to operate them. In this group,
    60% of farmers run small farms. In addition, 21% of all respondents can implement
    technology themselves. A higher level of education can be observed in these two
    groups. This suggests that there is no specific barrier in terms of ease of technology
    implementation related to farmers’ knowledge and experience, but that there is
    a general openness towards new technologies. Nevertheless, these results suggest
    that the strengthening of knowledge transfer and education especially among small
    holders as well as the development of appropriate advisory services should be
    promoted in Poland. The quality of the innovative technology is also a key factor
    for Polish farmers. Farmers who already use the innovation rate it as “usually
    of good quality” (51% of respondents). For all respondents, the figure is 72%,
    compared to 15% who think that it is are “usually of bad quality”. The positive
    perception of the quality of innovative techniques is also associated with the
    level of satisfaction with weed control on farms. The proportion of responses
    stating that “they are of good quality” and that the “weed control measures are
    satisfactory” is 50%, For all respondents, the proportion is 72%. This can be
    interpreted as a generally positive experience and attitude towards innovation,
    and this opinion applies to weed control methods. The perception of WeLASER technology
    as a good solution is related in strong statistical terms to key features of innovative
    technologies perception: quality, ease of use, benefits, and satisfaction with
    weed control. It is also associated with willingness to adopt this technology,
    but previous positive experiences with innovation do not have a major influence
    on the willingness to adopt the WeLASER weeder. This discrepancy can be explained
    by the fact that there may be significant limitations to the use of the weeder.
    For example, 35% of respondents who perceive the WeLASER weeder as a good solution
    would potentially use this technique a as technology only “partially solving weeding
    problems” (48% of all respondents). At the same time, 33% of respondents who would
    use the robot as a partial measure are satisfied in general with the weed control
    currently applied (48% for all). In contrast, 34% of respondents see no reason
    to definitely or probably use the technology on their farms. The perception of
    the good quality of the WeLASER weeder and the willingness to implement it are
    also related to the willingness to follow the further developments of the WeLASER
    project and a strong opinion on the key factors for implementation. Most of the
    respondents (46%) indicated public support as the main factor, and 31% indicated
    more stringent policies. Public support was particularly emphasized by smaller
    holders. This also confirms that WeLASER technology can be adopted by farmers
    who have better financial strength and more favorable conditions and opportunities
    for adoption. There is uncertainty regarding the introduction of the WeLASER weeder
    as the perception of the suitability of WeLASER technology would require the development
    of new skills (33% of all respondents). The perception of suitability (WeLASER
    as a partial solution) with 58.8% of those who rate WeLASER weeder positively
    indicates significant potential on the one hand and the existence of barriers
    to application on the other. Among the farm attributes for the introduction of
    innovative technology, the financial situation of the farm was indicated by farmers
    (45% of all respondents) as the most important. This opinion was mainly expressed
    by the middle-aged and young farmers. Reliable and accurate information on the
    performance of the technology, including costs and benefits for specific crops,
    was mentioned by 57% of all respondents. Spain According to Spanish farmers already
    using innovation, the quality and perception of benefits seem to be strong factors
    for implementation. Of all respondents, 79% answered that innovative techniques
    are “usually of good quality”, and 15% that they are “always of good quality”.
    In the first category of responses, 37% indicated improved working conditions
    as the main benefit (46% of all respondents), and 14% cited increased productivity.
    In terms of the ease of innovation, there is a clear split into two groups: those
    who perceive innovation as “requiring new skills, but being not problematic” (25%
    of all respondents) and those who “require external support and advice” (30% of
    all respondents). The acceptance of WeLASER technology as a good solution is high.
    This is evident among respondents who already use innovation—for 55% of respondents,
    it is a potentially good solution, and for 11%, it is “definitely a good solution”.
    For all respondents, these figures are 72% and 17%, respectively. At the same
    time, 38% of respondents who use innovation consider WeLASER technology to be
    definitely useful for weed control (46% of all respondents), and 17% see it as
    a solution that only partially solves the weed problem (21% of all respondents).
    In Spain, there is a strong association between the expressed dissatisfaction
    with weed control practices and the positive evaluation of WeLASER technology
    and the willingness to adopt it. Most of the farmers who expressed an interest
    in introducing the WeLASER weeder are rather dissatisfied (17%) or rather satisfied
    (26%) with weed control. Among the respondents who indicated that WeLASER can
    only partially solve their problems, these figures were 6% and 12%, respectively.
    At the same time, 66% of respondents who are not satisfied or are rather satisfied
    with weed control solutions currently in use consider WeLASER technology to be
    a good solution, and 15% consider it to be a definitely good solution. The potential
    adopters at the same time use the innovations in their practice, perceive the
    importance of the specific conditions of the farm, and see significant advantages
    of these technologies. These results are quite unique among the countries surveyed
    and show a strong need for new solutions. Another unique feature is that the Spanish
    farmers who responded positively to the introduction of WeLASER technology (81.2%
    of all farmers) indicated the structure of the land (fragmented plots) as the
    potential main barrier. Only 15.4% cited financial condition as the main factor.
    The farmers’ expectations are obviously high as most of them are willing to follow
    the further development of WeLASER technology. Country comparison In the survey,
    only the following attributes of the respondent profile were relevant: size of
    the farm, age of the respondent, level of general and vocational education. In
    all countries, mostly male farmers responded to the questionnaire. In all countries
    surveyed, the positive perception of innovation in the general responses and the
    attitude towards WeLASER essentially reflect the agricultural structure. For example,
    in Poland, innovation is adopted in all size classes. Other studies point to farm
    size but also to the cultivation system (organic/conventional) and the occupational
    structure (part-time/full-time) as relevant characteristics that influence the
    evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of field crop robots [28,55,56].
    This also agrees with the conclusion that in Denmark, the well-established farms
    in terms of their economic position and experience are the most innovative. Although
    the current experience with innovative solutions is positive in all the countries
    studied, the application of the WeLASER weeder is a challenge as expectations
    regarding the quality of the device are high. In Denmark, the country with the
    most experience in precision agriculture, the answers to the questions were more
    consistent than those in the other countries, which can be interpreted as a result
    of greater experience with the use of innovative solutions than in Poland and
    Spain. It should be emphasized that Danish farmers were more skeptical and more
    demanding of reliable proof of WeLASER performance. A German case study also shows
    a moderate influence of previous experience on further technological advancements
    [42]. The results suggest that farmers in Poland and Denmark were more confident
    in adopting new techniques on their own or by developing new skills than those
    in Spain, where the need for external advice and support was more strongly expressed.
    From this point of view, as shown in other studies [57], holistic services in
    areas with low precision agriculture adoption have to be promoted. In this context,
    studies in the US have identified barriers to the provision of precision agricultural
    services such as equipment and costs that reduce the profitability of services
    related to precision agriculture [58]. A further recommendation is the provision
    of simple operational procedures to support the transition to precision farming
    solutions [19] and to strengthen the training and education of farmers, especially
    for owners of smaller farms [17]. It should be emphasized that the farmers in
    all countries surveyed pointed out social aspects (working conditions) and to
    a lesser extent economic aspects (higher profitability) as the key benefits of
    using innovation in agriculture. This is in contrast to some other studies that
    emphasize the economic factors [59], but other studies [42,43] also point to the
    reduced workload as an important factor. The environmental aspect was perceived
    as the least important, although various studies point to many related advantages
    of precision agriculture [60,61]. This could be reflected in the respondents’
    perception of the legal requirements for the use of herbicides. The economic feasibility
    of the technology, national policies, and the resulting legal situation are also
    mentioned in other studies [42]. It is assumed [62] that policy inducements could
    change the relative input/output prices faced by farmers to encourage the adoption
    of precise technologies. The results from all countries indicate that the WeLASER
    technology can be used primarily as a complementary solution and not as a stand-alone
    technique, as most of the respondents stated that the WeLASER weeder can only
    partially solve their weed control problems. Furthermore, as other studies show,
    other PA techniques should be used to increase the effectiveness of weed control
    [63]. It should also be noted that the innovative techniques may not be relevant
    for all farms depending on the specific conditions [64]. These results indicate
    that the development of commercialized versions of WeLASER-based machines should
    take into account certain flexibility in designing technical solutions to allow
    a better adaptation of the solution to the farmers’ needs. Opportunities should
    be created to integrate WeLASER technology with other weed control methods. For
    example, there are possibilities for providing separate laser weeding implements
    that can be easily adapted to current farming practices. In all countries, there
    is a reluctance to introduce this technology, as it is a novelty and many aspects
    need to be resolved before commercialization and practical use. This is consistent
    with a strong notion that farmers will not adopt a technology until it meets their
    needs. Other studies have found that most agricultural innovations were conceived
    on-farm and then commercialized by companies [65]. At the same time, the results
    indicate an openness towards WeLASER technology. Spanish farmers are the most
    likely to see it as a potential technology for solving their weed control problems.
    In each country, there is a clear group of potential adopters characterized by
    consistency in the responses regarding the quality of the WeLASER weeder, its
    suitability (partial application), and willingness to pursue further developments.
    Similarly, a very positive attitude towards the innovation process has also been
    observed [66] in user groups that have already oriented themselves and adapted
    all production factors to innovative change. There are considerable differences
    of opinion regarding the business models of implementation. In Spain, the prevailing
    opinion was that the best business option for farmers is weeding machinery rental;
    in Poland, purchase with non-repayable subsidies; and in Denmark, rental of services
    and also joint purchasing and purchasing with external financing. In comparison,
    options such as contractor services and machine sharing were identified as the
    preferred modes of robot deployment in Bavaria, Germany [28]. The results indicate
    that there should be well-targeted commercialization approaches that take into
    account country and regional specificity. It is recommended to support customized
    business models within the framework of national agricultural policies. Public
    support was indicated as an important factor for the introduction of WeLASER technology
    in all countries, by 45% of respondents in Denmark, 46% in Poland, and 41% in
    Spain, but in Denmark and Spain, there were also other factors mentioned as important,
    especially labor market conditions and food quality. In Poland, 31% of respondents
    also indicated agricultural and policy requirements. This is in line with European
    policy recommendations on delivering tools and incentives especially for small-
    and medium-sized farms to facilitate the adoption of innovative technologies [67,68,69].
    In all countries, farmers pointed out that they need reliable and accurate information
    on the performance of the technology and the costs and benefits of its application
    in practice (Denmark—82% of respondents; Poland—57%; Spain—36%). This is also
    underlined in other studies. Robot suppliers should better inform farmers about
    the performance of their products, for example by involving farmers in the process
    of robot development [42] and by demonstrating the main benefits in practice [70].
    According to other studies, the information must be provided by the manufacturers/dealers
    of robots [42] and by the institutions responsible for advising farmers on their
    practices [71]. The adoption of a new technology is a process that starts with
    farmers knowing that it exists, then forming favorable opinions that lead to adoption,
    and then having the intention to try it based on their research findings [1].
    The opportunity and experience of using PA technologies on other farmers’ fields
    increases the likelihood of adopting these technologies [72]. The positive influence
    of counseling on the adoption rate was observed in a study in the US [55]. The
    need for improved information, financial support mechanisms including more accessible
    subsidies, and the provision of services along with reliable implementation and
    aftercare support was also indicated as an important factor for adoption in less
    technologically advanced regions and countries [73]. 5. Conclusions This study
    identified key aspects of the implementation of laser-based weed control technology
    from the perspective of farmers. Farmers in three countries were interviewed using
    the CATI method. The results were analyzed using statistical methods to (1) determine
    the relationship (association probability) between the respondents’ profile and
    the perceptions of innovation and attitudes towards WeLASER weeder implementation
    in their farming practice and (2) gain insight into how farmers’ perceptions of
    innovation influence their attitude towards WeLASER technology implementation
    based on their experiences. Based on the results, certain patterns can be distinguished
    in the responses indicating that there are groups of potential adopters in all
    countries who positively perceive innovative techniques and formulate expectations
    for the WeLASER weeder. The results show that the highest potential exists in
    larger farms operated by young and middle-aged farmers. This is in line with other
    studies on the acceptance of new technologies in agriculture [74]. In Spain and
    Poland, owners of smaller farms also see a reason for the adoption of laser-based
    weed control tools. The results also show that there are not many early adopters
    in the samples studied. A high level of confidence in the potential implementation
    of WeLASER technology is observed in all countries as there is a high number of
    farmers for whom the application of an innovative technology is not a problem
    and who can learn how to use it themselves. Nevertheless, there is a need for
    supporting services and advice, especially in Spain. It is advisable to provide
    good assistance and service for the users of this technology. In the future development
    of this technology, care should be taken to ensure that the high quality of the
    technology meets the expectations of farmers. It can also be suggested that the
    functionality of the technology be extended as it is seen as a partial solution
    to weed control problems faced by farmers. The introduction of a laser-based weed
    control tool in agricultural practice should be supported by providing funding
    but also by facilitating other forms of its use (leasing, renting, sharing). Author

  description: The agricultural industry has the potential to undergo a revolutionary
    transformation with the use of Internet of Things (IoT) technology. Crop monitoring
    can be improved, waste reduced, and efficiency increased. However, there are risks
    associated with system failures that can lead to significant losses and food insecurity.
    Therefore, a proactive approach is necessary to ensure the effective safety assessment
    of new IoT systems before deployment. It is crucial to identify potential causes
    of failure and their severity from the conceptual design phase of the IoT system
    within smart agricultural ecosystems. This will help prevent such risks and ensure
    the safety of the system. This study examines the failure behaviour of IoT-based
    Smart Irrigation Systems (SIS) to identify potential causes of failure. This study
    proposes a comprehensive Model-Based Safety Analysis (MBSA) framework to model
    the failure behaviour of SIS and generate analysable safety artefacts of the system
    using System Modelling Language (SysML). The MBSA approach provides meticulousness
    to the analysis, supports model reuse, and makes the development of a Fault Tree
    Analysis (FTA) model easier, thereby reducing the inherent limitations of informal
    system analysis. The FTA model identifies component failures and their propagation,
    providing a detailed understanding of how individual component failures can lead
    to the overall failure of the SIS. This study offers valuable insights into the
    interconnectedness of various component failures by evaluating the SIS failure
    behaviour through the FTA model. This study generates multiple minimal cut sets,
    which provide actionable insights into designing dependable IoT-based SIS. This
    analysis identifies potential weak points in the design and provides a foundation
    for safety risk mitigation strategies. This study emphasises the significance
    of a systematic and model-driven approach to improving the dependability of IoT
    systems in agriculture, ensuring sustainable and safe implementation.

    the safety of the system. This study examines the failure behaviour of IoT-based
    Smart Irrigation Systems (SIS) to identify potential causes of failure. This study
    proposes a comprehensive Model-Based Safety Analysis (MBSA) framework to model
    the failure behaviour of SIS and generate analysable safety artefacts of the system
    using System Modelling Language (SysML). The MBSA approach provides meticulousness
    to the analysis, supports model reuse, and makes the development of a Fault Tree
    Analysis (FTA) model easier, thereby reducing the inherent limitations of informal
    system analysis. The FTA model identifies component failures and their propagation,
    providing a detailed understanding of how individual component failures can lead
    to the overall failure of the SIS. This study offers valuable insights into the
    interconnectedness of various component failures by evaluating the SIS failure
    behaviour through the FTA model. This study generates multiple minimal cut sets,
    which provide actionable insights into designing dependable IoT-based SIS. This
    analysis identifies potential weak points in the design and provides a foundation
    for safety risk mitigation strategies. This study emphasises the significance
    of a systematic and model-driven approach to improving the dependability of IoT
    systems in agriculture, ensuring sustainable and safe implementation. Keywords:

    sustenance and employment opportunities to millions of people around the world.
    As the global population continues to grow exponentially, there is an increasing
    demand for food production. Unfortunately, the amount of cultivable land is limited
    and is rapidly dwindling due to urbanisation and environmental degradation [1,2].
    Therefore, there is a pressing need to improve crop yields to meet the growing
    demand for food. Modern farming techniques can optimise every aspect of the crop
    production process, from planting to harvesting. Precision agriculture, Solar
    Insecticidal Lamp Internet of Things (SIL-IoTs), and many other innovative ideas
    leverage technology to achieve this optimisation [3,4,5]. By prioritising sustainable
    and efficient farming practices, it is possible to ensure that agriculture remains
    a viable source of sustenance and employment for generations to come. Through
    efficient implementation of these smart techniques, farmers can increase their
    yield and improve the efficiency of their operations. The escalating worldwide
    water crisis is a significant worry, given the rising population and the need
    for fresh water. To tackle this problem, embracing sustainable water usage practices
    is imperative, particularly in agriculture, where water is a crucial resource.
    A viable solution is the adoption of Smart Irrigation Systems (SIS), which can
    track pertinent factors and regulate physical devices like water pumps to minimise
    water wastage by irrigating only when required [6,7]. Furthermore, sustainable
    farming practices can enhance soil health, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and
    promote biodiversity [3]. Such approaches can also improve the overall quality
    of the produce and increase the economic sustainability of farming operations.
    The integration of IoT, edge computing, and AI has transformed the landscape of
    farming practices [8]. However, with these innovative approaches come new challenges,
    such as increased complexity, system safety, reliability, trustworthiness, and
    vulnerability [9,10]. To ensure the dependability of these systems, it is essential
    to understand their composition and inner workings and potential failures that
    may arise during operation. This proactive understanding of the system and its
    behaviour will help to mitigate risks from the design time and optimise the efficiency
    of such systems. In the case of large-scale smart farming, the failure of these
    systems can have devastating consequences on nature, people, agricultural production,
    and finances. Therefore, conducting a credible failure analysis of IoT-based technology
    during the conceptual design phase is crucial to ensure the development of safe
    and reliable IoT-based agricultural systems. While in this study we focus on the
    qualitative failure analysis of the IoT system, a recent overview of physical
    security and safety issues in IoT can be found in [11]. Failure analysis methods
    are indispensable in safety-critical domains, encompassing diverse sectors like
    aviation, automobiles, and industrial control systems [12]. Among these methods,
    Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) stands out as a widely acknowledged and highly effective
    technique for analysing failures in safety-critical systems [13]. By employing
    graphical models, FTA provides a systematic representation of the logical connections
    between failures and their root causes, offering valuable insights into potential
    vulnerabilities and areas for improvement in complex systems. The structured and
    methodical FTA method is an effective approach for identifying potential system
    failures, assessing risks, and developing strategies to prevent them during system
    design [13,14,15]. This approach is particularly useful in examining failures
    across a range of systems, including smart agriculture [13,14,15,16,17,18]. By
    utilising a visual and deductive approach, the FTA method identifies potential
    safety risks, predictive failure of the system, critical failure scenarios, and
    the shortest path to system failure [17,18]. The FTA process involves understanding
    system functions and components, identifying possible failure modes, determining
    the root cause of failures, and proposing corrective actions to address them [19].
    The FTA method remains a well-established approach for assessing the safety and
    reliability of agricultural systems, contributing to improved performance and
    enhanced productivity. Therefore, incorporating the FTA method into the iterative
    design process of smart agricultural systems ensures that safety considerations
    evolve with the system design, promoting ongoing improvement and cultivating a
    proactive risk management culture within the agricultural industry. Despite the
    wide adoption of the FTA model as a safety analysis method, the reliance on FT
    has some inherent limitations, such as being a manual process, not supporting
    reusability, being prone to human errors, and becoming cumbersome when the failure
    behaviour becomes complicated [13,20]. Model-driven approaches are being adopted
    from the functional system design domain to the safety analysis environment to
    overcome these challenges and keep up with the latest advancements in the overall
    system design approach. In the model-driven environment, the Model-Based Systems
    Engineering (MBSE) approach is rich with various system models and diagrams, which
    can effectively model system architecture, and through their extension, model
    failure behaviour that can be viable for Model-Based Safety Analysis (MBSA) [21].
    Recent studies in the safety analysis domain are now proposing the utilisation
    of MBSA approaches for the generation of the FTA process to simplify design trade-offs,
    increase IoT design flexibility, and reduce cost and time-to-market constraints
    [22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31]. This study utilises the use of the MBSA paradigm
    to create an FTA model of an IoT-based SIS in a SysML environment for a viable
    safety assessment. It is worth noting that although IoT-based agricultural systems
    are gaining more trust from the public, the MBSA approach of safety analysis is
    not being used as much in the intelligent agricultural domain as it is in other
    safety-critical domains. However, the failure of monitoring systems in agriculture
    can have a significant impact on food security and result in enormous financial
    loss. This article presents a novel MBSA approach for safety analysis of an IoT-based
    SIS. The framework leverages IoT-based SIS and focuses on the conceptual design
    phase to identify potential failure behaviours of the system. It generates detailed
    failure models for the system and its components, formalising them through MBSA-generated
    FTA diagrams. The method’s granular flexibility enables a better understanding
    of how individual component failures can cause system-wide safety problems, thereby
    improving system dependability and failure risk mitigation. The framework’s efficacy
    is demonstrated through a case study of IoT-based SIS. This approach represents
    a significant step towards proactive and comprehensive failure analysis in innovative
    agricultural ecosystems, aligning technological advancements with the goal of
    system analysis approaches. The article is divided into sections to provide a
    comprehensive overview of the IoT’s role in smart agriculture. It begins with
    an introduction and then moves on to Section 2, which provides a comprehensive
    overview of IoT’s role in smart agriculture. This is followed by a review of manual
    safety analysis methods in Section 3, and MBSA methods are covered in Section
    4. Furthermore, Section 5 then describes the proposed framework in detail and
    demonstrates its application in a case study, which can be found in Section 6.
    This article concludes with Section 7, summarising the key points discussed and
    suggesting potential areas for future research. 2. Applications of IoT in Smart
    Agriculture This section provides a detailed overview of how IoT technology is
    leveraged to promote sustainable and intelligent farming practices. From monitoring
    soil moisture levels to tracking livestock, the IoT has revolutionised how agriculture
    is managed and optimised for greater productivity and efficiency. 2.1. Smart Irrigation
    System Freshwater scarcity is a critical global challenge that we must address,
    as only 2.5 % of Earth’s water supply is freshwater, with a mere 31.3 % available
    for human use, with the rest being in the form of glaciers or ice caps [32,33].
    Agriculture consumes a vast amount of this resource, and as the demand for food
    increases, it is essential to manage water resources efficiently [34]. IoT technology
    offers a promising solution. By combining sensor networks, smart tech, and the
    Internet, we can measure critical parameters like soil moisture and temperature
    to enable real-time data analysis for accurate irrigation control [35]. With the
    integration of microcontrollers and wireless communication, IoT tech can facilitate
    the development of automated irrigation systems that conserve up to 90 % of water
    compared with traditional methods [36]. Several studies have proposed the use
    of an integrated sensor/actuator node network to measure various physical parameters
    such as soil moisture, air temperature, humidity, water level, water flow, and
    luminous intensity [37,38]. Leveraging smart Internet-based technology can help
    optimise water usage and improve crop yield, contributing to long-term resource
    sustainability. By incorporating IoT tech in agriculture, a comprehensive solution
    to freshwater scarcity can be provided, leading to better water conservation and
    benefiting farmers, consumers, and the environment. 2.2. Pest Control and Plant
    Disease Monitoring The agricultural industry has experienced significant changes
    due to the IoT, particularly in pest control and plant disease monitoring [39].
    Farmers can now utilise advanced deep learning methods to identify pests, diseases,
    weeds, and yield and assess soil suitability for different crops. With the help
    of image processing, machine learning, and Logistic Decision Regression (LDR),
    researchers have achieved impressive accuracy rates in detecting pests and plant
    diseases, leading to better crop management practices and improved yields [39,40,41].
    Smart agriculture has been introduced which utilises an IoT architecture that
    employs deep learning techniques to detect insects, diseases, weeds, and soil
    nutrients and predict crop yield with greater accuracy. This has revolutionised
    the industry, as sensor data have improved the accuracy and reliability of disease
    detection through innovative data analysis methods. Recently, there has been a
    surge of interest in using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image analysis,
    which have the potential to further enhance the accuracy and speed of disease
    detection. CNNs effectively identify plant diseases, pests, and nutrient deficiencies
    and predict crop yield [42,43]. Integrating IoT with advanced deep learning methods
    has transformed the agricultural industry, paving the way for innovative solutions
    to old problems. More farmers are expected to embrace this technology in the coming
    years, leading to increased productivity and better crop management practices.
    2.3. Use of Drones and Harvesting Robots The agricultural industry has significantly
    transformed since the introduction of drones and IoT devices. These advanced technologies
    have revolutionised traditional cultivation methods by reducing physical strain
    and streamlining the process [44]. The introduction of intelligent agricultural
    systems has paved the way for implementing innovative methods to monitor soil
    conditions, spray pesticides and fertilisers, and transmit sensor data for analysis
    [45]. Drones have emerged as one of the most promising tools in agriculture. With
    high-resolution cameras, they can capture images of crops from an aerial view,
    providing farmers with an accurate measurement of crop damage caused by pests
    or weather, especially in challenging terrain [46]. They can also monitor crop
    growth and identify areas that require fertilisation or irrigation. In addition
    to drones, agricultural robots integrated with IoT devices and sensors are used
    for various tasks such as seedling, harvesting, weed detection, and pest control.
    These robots are designed to operate autonomously and can be programmed to perform
    specific tasks with precision and accuracy. Moreover, they can collect and transmit
    data in real time, enabling farmers to make informed decisions and take corrective
    actions quickly. Developed nations are adopting these technologies to enhance
    agricultural efficiency while minimising costs and time [47,48]. Implementing
    IoT devices and drones in agriculture can potentially increase crop yields, reduce
    labour costs, and minimise the use of harmful chemicals [49]. Therefore, integrating
    these advanced technologies in the agricultural industry is a significant step
    towards creating a sustainable future for the world. 2.4. Vertical Farming and
    Smart Greenhouse Vertical Farming (VF) has emerged as a modern agricultural technique
    wherein crops are grown on vertically inclined surfaces, predominantly in high-rise
    buildings. This innovative practice has gained immense popularity in recent years,
    owing to its ability to offer several advantages beyond food security. As per
    Kalantari et al. [50], VF has the potential to revamp urban design and architecture,
    augment food safety and security, and reduce environmental pollution. With the
    rapid advancement of digital technologies, IoT devices, artificial intelligence,
    and other cutting-edge technologies are increasingly being incorporated into VF.
    According to Siregar et al. [51], IoT devices and AI are being employed to monitor
    and control VF environments, and researchers such as those found in [52,53,54]
    have proposed methodologies that integrate sensors and IoT techniques for smart
    VF. Additionally, Kaur et al. [55,56] demonstrated how hydroponic VF could be
    carried out using IoT-based sensors with minimal water and soil usage. By harnessing
    these innovative ideas, VF has the potential to enhance crop yields while minimising
    resource usage, making it an attractive option for sustainable agriculture. Apart
    from IoT and machine learning, studies also explore using artificial intelligence
    to build smart greenhouses. For instance, Maraveas and Chrysanthos [57] conducted
    a detailed review of AI’s use in building smart greenhouses and explored methods
    to optimise their usability. Also, Gracia et al. [58] reviewed the usage of Artificial
    Neural Networks (ANNs) in greenhouse technology and proposed models to integrate
    IoT devices and ML for innovative agriculture development. Therefore, integrating
    cutting-edge technologies like IoT and AI in VF has immense potential to transform
    crop growth, enhance food security, and reduce environmental impact. 2.5. Tracking
    and Monitoring Livestock Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) is a modern approach
    that utilises IoT technologies to provide farmers with advanced tools for monitoring
    cattle behaviour, diagnosing diseases, managing their welfare, and improving overall
    management [59,60]. In recent years, significant progress has been made in developing
    web and mobile applications that use sensors and IoT devices to monitor livestock
    behaviour and environmental factors. Researchers have identified key technologies
    that have proven effective in PLF, including Radio Frequency Identification (RFID),
    Global Positioning Satellite (GPS), Digital Twin technology, and AI [60,61]. These
    technologies have improved data collection and analysis efficiency, enabling farmers
    to make informed decisions about their livestock. Furthermore, researchers have
    proposed efficient methods for monitoring cattle behaviour and environmental factors
    using indoor Ultra-WideBand (UWB) location data, accelerometer data, and automatic
    monitoring systems based on sensors. These methods allow farmers to monitor their
    cattle more accurately and in real time, improving the overall health and well-being
    of the animals. Additionally, smart geofencing methods that rely on IoT and General
    Packet Radio Service (GPRS) have been suggested for remote monitoring and controlling
    cattle, making it easier for farmers to monitor their livestock from a distance
    [61]. Other methods for herd location monitoring using Bluetooth and GPS have
    also been proposed, making it easier for farmers to track the location of their
    animals and ensure their safety and security. IoT technologies in PLF have transformed
    the livestock industry, allowing farmers to leverage advanced tools and technologies
    to manage their livestock more efficiently and effectively [62]. With continued
    advancements in this field, we can expect to see even more innovative solutions
    that will further improve the quality of life for livestock and enhance sustainability.
    2.6. Effects of Sensor-Based IoT Device Failures in Smart Agriculture As the demand
    for sustainable and efficient agricultural production grows, farmers are increasingly
    adopting smart farming practices that rely on IoT technology. However, these practices
    come with risks. If the sensor-based IoT devices used in agriculture fail, it
    can have severe consequences for the entire system. The impact can range from
    environmental pollution to decreased crop yields or even famine. In the long run,
    these hazards can also damage soil health and fertility, crop disease control,
    supply chain management, and farmers’ trust in IoT technology. These risks can
    lead to economic collapse in rural areas, affecting farmers and related industries.
    Therefore, it is crucial to develop strategies to mitigate the risks associated
    with sensor-based IoT device failure in agriculture, particularly given that harsh
    weather conditions can make these devices prone to failure. 3. Overview of Manual
    Failure Analysis Methods Failure analysis is a systematic approach to investigate
    and comprehend the underlying causes of failures in various systems, products,
    or processes [26]. The primary objective of failure analysis is to prevent similar
    failures from happening in the future [12]. Failure analysis is extensively employed
    to analyse potential safety-related issues in domains where safety is critical.
    It is crucial to perform appropriate failure analysis on the conceptual design
    of IoT-based agricultural systems to ensure the design is safe and dependable
    [63]. Safety and reliability analysis are the two most significant dependability
    attributes, and they are used extensively in many safety-critical sectors. Below
    is a discussion of some of the well-known failure analysis methods. 3.1. Failure
    Mode and Effects Analysis Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is a proactive
    approach in safety-critical domains. It identifies and evaluates the potential
    failure modes of a system, assessing their impact on safety, reliability, and
    performance [14,64]. FMEAs are often attributed to the US military, who first
    utilised this technique in the late 1940s to mitigate potential failures and minimise
    sources of variation during munitions production [20,65]. Notably, FMEA is also
    used for failure analysis of smart agriculture [66]. Using FMEA, critical components
    and functions are identified, and failure modes are evaluated based on their severity,
    probability of occurrence, and detectability [67,68]. The Risk Priority Number
    (RPN) is calculated for each failure mode, and necessary mitigation strategies
    are adopted. High-RPN failure modes are prioritised through improved design, redundancy,
    maintenance, or additional safety measures [67]. 3.2. Bayesian Network A Bayesian
    Network (BN) is a sophisticated probabilistic model that is extensively utilised
    in various engineering domains, particularly in testing and verifying the safety
    properties of IoT systems. Employing a BN model aids in recognising and reducing
    risks by representing interdependencies and uncertainties [65]. The safety problem
    is defined, relevant components are identified, and probabilistic dependencies
    are established to achieve the utilisation of the BN model in the safety analysis.
    Numerical values are then assigned to calculate the probability of specific events
    occurring. Each variable is represented as a node, and the directed edges between
    nodes indicate the probabilistic dependencies between the variables [65,69,70].
    The Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs) specify the probabilistic relationships
    for each node based on the values of its parent nodes. The Bayesian Network supports
    both qualitative and quantitative analysis. Qualitative analysis involves graphical
    representation, while quantitative analysis involves assigning numerical values
    to the parameters in the BN, such as conditional probabilities in CPTs, to calculate
    the probability of a specific event occurring or estimate the likelihood of different
    events [18,71]. 3.3. Markov Analysis Model The Markov model is a mathematical
    framework used to study systems that change over time through a sequence of discrete
    states. It is beneficial for analysing systems with memoryless properties [72].
    These are systems where the future state depends only on the current state and
    not on the sequence of states that came before it. The model assumes that a system
    exists in one of several discrete states at any given time and can move to another
    state with specific probabilities [73]. A state transition matrix that captures
    these transition probabilities defines the system’s behaviour. Markov models are
    often used to analyse the behaviour of systems based on the exponential distribution
    of failure. The steady-state probabilities of the model can be calculated by solving
    the system of linear equations defined by the model [73]. 3.4. Petri Net A Petri
    Net is an essential graphical and mathematical modelling approach for analysing
    and describing intricate, concurrent, and distributed systems. It is a highly
    effective method for modelling and understanding systems in which multiple entities
    interact asynchronously and dynamically [65]. Typically, PNs are denoted as four-tuple
    N = (P, T, A, K), a bipartite graph that we discuss in detail below: 𝑃={ 𝑝 1 ,
    𝑝 2 , 𝑝 3 ,…, 𝑝 𝑛 } is a finite set of places: Places represent states or conditions
    within the system. They are typically depicted as circles or ovals in a PN diagram.
    𝑇={ 𝑡 1 , 𝑡 2 , 𝑡 3 ,…, 𝑡 𝑛 } is a finite set of transitions: Transitions represent
    events or actions that can occur within the system. These are typically depicted
    as rectangles in the diagram. Transitions cause changes in the system’s state
    by consuming tokens from input places and producing tokens in output places. 𝐴⊆(𝑃×𝑇)∪(𝑇×𝑃)
    is a finite set of arcs: Arcs (also known as edges) connect from places to transitions
    or transitions to places, indicating the flow of tokens between them. There are
    two types of arcs: Input Arcs and Output Arcs. 𝐾={1,2,3,…} is a finite set of
    tokens: Tokens are small symbols or markers. Each place can hold a certain number
    of tokens, representing the presence or availability of resources, objects, or
    entities. They can move between places through transitions, following the defined
    flow of arcs. The PN model follows basic rules for activating transitions based
    on the availability of input tokens. The behaviour of PNs is determined by the
    movement of tokens and interaction between transitions. Coloured, timed, and stochastic
    PNs are variations of PNs that address specific aspects of system modelling and
    analysis [65,74,75]. An example of a simple PN is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1.
    Example of a Petri Net model. 3.5. Fault Tree Analysis The FTA method is a systematic
    graphical methodology widely used in engineering, safety, and risk assessment
    to thoroughly analyse the causes of failures within complex systems. It originated
    in 1962 at Bell Phone Laboratories and was initially crafted to evaluate the failure
    behaviours of the launch control system of the LGM-30 Minuteman intercontinental
    ballistic missile (ICBM) as part of the United States’ strategic deterrent forces
    [20,76]. Over the years, FTA has evolved into a pivotal tool for failure analysis,
    finding applications in diverse domains, including industrial safety-critical
    systems, and gaining momentum in IoT-based applications. FTA’s versatility is
    evident across various applications, spanning safety analysis in smart homes [77,78]
    to generic IoT systems [79,80], electric vehicles [81], industrial fire detection
    and prevention systems [82], industrial robots [17], self-healing industrial systems
    [83], and cyberphysical systems [15]. Additionally, FTA has successfully analysed
    the failure behaviour of smart agriculture systems [76,84], showcasing its adaptability
    across diverse domains. The FTA technique systematically identifies factors contributing
    to system failures and assesses the probability of such failures, solidifying
    its position as one of the most prominent techniques for dependability analysis.
    Recognising its significance, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)
    has endorsed FTA as a leading method for failure analysis [13,85,86]. In Figure
    2, the FTA model employs a logical and graphical diagram to pinpoint critical
    components for improvement, preventing future failures. The diagram outlines the
    hierarchy of events and utilises logic gates such as AND, OR, and Voting gates
    to model different systems’ behaviour. In an AND gate, all child events must occur
    for the parent event, whereas in an OR gate, any single child event can activate
    the parent event. The Voting gate requires a specific number of events (e.g.,
    2 out of 3), as the diagram indicates. The green triangle symbol facilitates the
    breakdown of the tree into smaller components for more accessible representation.
    Figure 2. Example of a fault tree. The fault tree is constructed using a top-down
    approach, starting with a top event causing the overall system failure. This top
    event is then decomposed into intermediate events using logic gates, representing
    the immediate causes of the top event. The recursive breakdown continues until
    the analysis reaches the component level failure or root causes that cannot be
    further decomposed. The ultimate goal is to assess how the top event will occur
    in the tree, representing the system failure. The analysis can be conducted qualitatively
    and quantitatively. Qualitative analysis involves obtaining Minimal Cut Sets (MCSs),
    the smallest combinations of root causes or basic events (BEs) leading to system
    failure. Identifying MCSs helps understand critical combinations of component
    failures or events. On the other hand, quantitative analysis uses failure rates
    of components or probabilities of root causes to predict system failure. Considering
    the type of logic gates used between events, the system failure probability can
    be calculated [12,20]. While FTA possesses strengths shown in Table 1, such as
    providing a structured approach for failure analysis, there are also acknowledged
    weaknesses [12,20]. These include the potential for human error in tree creation,
    a cumbersome process, lack of support for reusability, and inherent limitations
    of manual-based system analysis methods. Table 1. Strengths of Fault Tree Analysis
    Approach. 4. Model-Based Approach in Safety Analysis of IoT Several approaches
    in MBSA have been developed to model both functional and nonfunctional properties
    of modern and embedded systems, including those in the IoT environment. These
    modern and formal methods utilise modelling languages that draw from general engineering
    models or domain-specific models and profiles. In contrast to manual safety analysis
    techniques used with informal models discussed in Section 3, MBSA approaches have
    been developed to automate and semiautomate the process. These computer-based
    approaches facilitate safety analysis and support various aspects of system design.
    MBSA approaches can generate compositional analysable safety artefacts based on
    systematic modelling of systems’ static, dynamic, and failure behavioural patterns
    using existing modelling languages and their extensibility mechanisms. The MBSA
    approaches are model-driven and can manage system complexity while performing
    coherent, formalised, structured, and rigorous system safety analysis. Safety
    analysis approaches have been developed using various modelling languages, including
    Unified Modelling Language (UML), SysML, and Architecture Analysis and Design
    Language (AADL) as well as Hierarchically Performed Hazard Origin and Propagation
    Studies (HiP-HOPS) [20,31,87,88]. Additionally, these models are unambiguous,
    based on standardisation and various automation support tools, and possess a high
    level of abstraction to model the heterogeneity of IoT-based systems. The proposed
    approach used in this study is based on the UML/SysML modelling approach. 4.1.
    The Unified Modelling Language UML is a powerful modelling language that enables
    one to systematically visualise a system using modelling diagrams and conduct
    a formal analysis. It is widely used for systems and software specifications and
    can be customised to suit specific domains. With numerous diagrams and extensions,
    UML can effectively describe a system’s components, hierarchy, and states. UML
    diagrams are grouped into two categories: behaviour and structure [30]. Behaviour
    diagrams capture the system’s dynamic behaviour, while structure diagrams describe
    the system’s static structure. Some popular UML diagrams include activity, state
    machine, sequencing, timing, use case, class, and component diagrams. UML is a
    reliable tool for high-quality modelling of safety-critical systems and has been
    adopted as a standard by the Object Management Group [29]. 4.2. System Modelling
    Language The SysML is a general-purpose graphical modelling language that was
    developed in 2003 on top of the UML specifically for system development, such
    as software, hardware interactions, and dependencies, among others [22,28]. The
    SysML is similar to UML; however, some diagrams in UML were removed, and others
    more specific to system engineering design were added. Two groups of SysML diagrams
    can be used to describe a system: behaviour and structure. The behaviour diagram
    showcases how the system operates, while the structure diagram highlights the
    system’s static structure. Popular SysML diagrams that are widely used include
    the block definition diagram (BDD), internal block diagram (IBD), parametric,
    and state machine diagram (SMD) [27]. A Broad List of SysML diagrams that can
    be used for various modelling of system features is shown in Figure 3, and a high-level
    description of the diagrams is provided in Table 2. Figure 3. SysML Diagrams.
    Table 2. Overview of some of the Notable UML/SysML Diagrams. The uniqueness of
    both UML and SysML is their extension mechanisms, which are known as profiles.
    A UML/SysML profile defines an extension of the language in terms of stereotypes
    (concepts in the target domain) and tagged values (the attributes of the stereotypes).
    For instance, the UML profile for Modelling and Analysis of Real-Time and Embedded
    Systems (MARTE) provides an analysis framework called the Quantitative Analysis
    Model (GQAM), enabling performance specification in UML models. The Dependability
    Analysis Modelling (DAM) is a domain-specific profile of SysML designed to address
    safety concerns such as safety metrics, transitions from safe to failure states,
    and triggers leading to those transitions. In a safety analysis based on MBSA
    approaches, the static structure of the system and its components are annotated
    with failure behaviours, and the resulting models are transformed to develop system-level
    failure analysis models [26]. Studies have been conducted using SysML/UML to develop
    FT and FMEA [28,89,90,91,92]. Various methodologies have been used for FTA generation,
    such as transforming the MBSA design developed in SysML using IBD and SMD to FTA
    artefacts based on a failure mapping pattern [25]. Other approaches have used
    programming languages to parse the XML model file generated from the source model
    and automate a formal model. Notably, the XML file of the source model was parsed
    in the Python language to safety analysis artefacts [93], ATLAS Transformation
    Language (ATL) [24], and Eclipse Modelling Framework [23]. The MBSA offers several
    advantages, including a composition that enables an easy understanding of the
    effects of altering one or more components or subsystems on the entire system’s
    safety assurance. Additionally, it supports reusability, reduces human errors,
    and facilitates iterative system design. 5. Proposed Safety Analysis Approach
    The approach proposed in Figure 4 uses the MBSE method, which combines the benefits
    of MBSA and safety analysis models. This technique preserves the advantages of
    MBSA over other static FTA methods while establishing the link between the IoT
    system architecture and the analysis models. Figure 4. Proposed MBSA framework.
    The MBSA framework described in Figure 4 for modelling of an IoT-based SIS involves
    a systematic process, utilising SysML diagrams and software tools compatible with
    SysML for precise modelling of the IoT system. The open-source SysML-compatible
    tool Papyrus was employed to initiate the analysis, seamlessly integrating with
    other Eclipse-based tools. This tool creates models that accurately represent
    the system’s static, functional aspects, and failure behaviours. The first step
    in our proposed approach involves creating diagrams that capture the static architecture,
    functional behaviour, and potential failure scenarios of the system in the SysML
    environment using Papyrus–Eclipse-based open-source software (Website for Papyrus
    tool: https://eclipse.dev/papyrus/). This includes creating SysML diagrams such
    as BDD, IBD, and SMD to build a comprehensive model of the IoT system’s architecture,
    functional structure, and failure characteristics. The created diagrams are then
    combined using a specific methodology, which we define in the subsequent section,
    to create the FTA from the models. Notably, the failure behaviours of each component
    are annotated using a DAM profile, transforming the source model into a formal
    analysable model for safety analyses. The DAM profile defines stereotypes, tagged
    values, and constraints, which are applied to the SysML SMD model to accurately
    articulate the system’s failure behaviour. Once the DAM profile is imported, aligned
    with the SMD diagram, and configured with DAM stereotypes, the Papyrus software
    tool facilitates a seamless transition, bridging static and functional modelling
    for fault tree generation. The fault tree logic is specified to generate the fault
    tree automatically, providing the necessary input for the tool. To ensure a high
    level of consistency and accuracy in our methodology, we heavily depend on Papyrus’s
    robust support for SysML and the DAM profile throughout our process. Alongside
    Papyrus, we incorporate other software tools, such as Drawio (Drawio tool website:
    https://app.diagrams.net/), to streamline the transition from SysML modelling
    to fault tree generation. Our overarching approach adheres to the MBSA framework,
    supports iterative system development, provides a systematic and structured method
    for constructing an FTA and conducts a qualitative safety analysis of the IoT-based
    SIS. In the subsequent section, we delve into the intricacies of this process,
    providing a comprehensive understanding of our methodology. 5.1. Static System
    Modelling To create the system’s static architecture model, we utilised BDD to
    represent the system’s different compositions and hierarchical structures. We
    divided the system into components using predefined blocks that logically indicate
    the system’s hardware and software. Additionally, we defined relationships among
    the components and the overall system regarding dependencies, generalisations,
    associations, aggregation, and inheritance. 5.2. Functional Configuration Modelling
    To develop the failure behaviour of an IoT system, it is crucial to have a comprehensive
    understanding of its internal structure. One way to achieve this is by creating
    an IBD representing the system’s properties and interconnections. This visualises
    the system’s decomposition, facilitating an understanding of how information flows
    between its elements. The IBD depicts the system’s internal configuration using
    its components, ports, and data flows. The IBD illustrates how a malfunction can
    propagate throughout the system by combining connectivity and flow. A well-defined
    internal structure and an understanding of its behaviour are fundamental to ensuring
    system safety and reliability. By providing a visual representation of the system’s
    properties, interconnections, and internal configuration in an MBSA environment,
    these diagrams facilitate an understanding of the system’s behaviour, identifying
    potential malfunctions and designing measures to mitigate them. 5.3. Failure Annotation
    To effectively model the failure behaviour of a system, it is essential to understand
    its functional features and the nominal state of each component. This involves
    analysing the system’s overall function, any redundancy designed into the system,
    and the behavioural characteristics of individual components. It is necessary
    to depict how the system elements can fail, how they change from one state to
    another, and the conditions that cause these changes. SMDs display the different
    states of the components and how their state can change. Using the system’s decomposed
    BDD, various nominal and failure states of the system are developed, along with
    their corresponding transitions and triggers, as SMDs. However, more than SMDs
    are needed to provide all the necessary information to model the failure features
    of an IoT system. To address this, the SMD was extended through the use of the
    DAM Profile, a UML extension mechanism that models the metamodel of the system.
    The DAM Profile is particularly effective for failure modelling through its stereotypes,
    such as DaStep, which represents the failure and error states of the system. The
    tag value under DaStep represents the transitions and triggers of the components.
    Using the DAM Profile, unique stereotypes and tag values can be applied to annotate
    the failure of system components accurately. The Data-Intensive Computing Environment
    (DICE)-integrated simulation environment was employed to achieve this goal. 5.4.
    Component Fault Tree Generation In the paradigm of MBSA, it is possible to convert
    a source MBSA model into a target safety artefact by creating links between the
    two. The ultimate goal is to produce an executable model to analyse the system’s
    safety. To achieve this, it is essential to have a comprehensive understanding
    of both the source and target languages. Our approach involves transforming SysML
    SMDs into component-based models that can be analysed to determine the contribution
    of each component to the overall system failure. This approach simplifies the
    iterative design process by enabling the replacement of components with a higher
    failure rate and more resilience. The resulting component-based model is generated
    via failure modelling, identifying potential failures and enhancing overall system
    safety. To create a component-level fault tree (CFT), each system component failure
    represented as SMDs is mapped to obtain the corresponding component tree, generating
    several trees that can be studied to detect possible failures. 5.5. System Fault
    Tree Generation The system-level FT is a target model designed to conduct a comprehensive
    system failure analysis. It combines individual FTA models of system components
    to create a single, unified tree structure using the system’s IBD. The IBD instances
    are utilised to merge the various CFTs. This allows the model to represent the
    relationship between components based on their configuration in the IBD. Static
    gates are employed to illustrate the configuration of the components better. For
    instance, an OR gate indicates series configurations where the system fails if
    any components fail. On the other hand, an AND gate is utilised for parallel configurations
    where the system only fails if all components fail. This level of detail allows
    the model to predict potential failures and their causes more accurately. At the
    top of the tree, the undesired event represents the overall failure of the system.
    Prior to that, the previous top-level undesired events in each component FTs are
    intermediate events. This detailed approach allows for a more thorough understanding
    of the system’s potential points of failure and can help identify areas for improvement
    and optimisation. 6. Illustrative Example To demonstrate our proposed MBSA approach,
    we used the IoT-based Smart Irrigation System presented in Figure 5. Using this
    system, a farmer can remotely monitor the status of a field and control the water
    pump(s) to irrigate the field whenever needed without being physically present
    in the field. In normal operating conditions, this system will monitor different
    parameters of a field, and based on the monitoring knowledge, it will decide when
    and for how long to irrigate the field. It uses a temperature sensor (TS) and
    a moisture sensor (MS) for monitoring. TS monitors the temperature of the field,
    and MS monitors the soil moisture. TS and MS continuously sense the respective
    parameters and report them to the IoT gateway/controller for further processing.
    The communication between the sensors and the IoT gateway takes place via a wireless
    medium. An Arduino board or Raspberry Pi can be considered as an IoT gateway.
    A battery powers the board. The IoT gateway converts the analogue signals received
    from the sensors to digital values and sends these values to the edge cloud server.
    The communication between the edge cloud server and the gateway occurs through
    a wireless medium. Figure 5. Architecture of an IoT-based Smart Irrigation System.
    6.1. Static System Modelling To create a formal system composition using the MBSA
    approach, it is crucial to have static configuration modelling. The system’s functional
    components and dependencies are depicted in the BDD shown in Figure 6, with SIS
    as the context. Direct composition relationships and SysML relationship link symbols
    were utilised to represent composite blocks in the system. Figure 6. Block definition
    diagram model of an IoT-based Smart Irrigation System. 6.2. Internal Configuration
    System Modelling The IBD Model of the system is crucial for effectively utilising
    MBSA modelling in system architecture. The SysML IBD depicts the system’s context
    and intricate, interdependent relationships among its components, accurately portraying
    data flow through ports and item flow symbols. The context blocks in SIS accurately
    represent interactions between different components as depicted in Figure 7. Figure
    7. Internal block diagram model of an IoT-based Smart Irrigation System. 6.3.
    Failure Annotation Modelling of the System In the provided Figure 8a,b, the failure
    annotations of two system components, namely the temperature sensor and power
    source, are displayed based on the SysML SMD. The metamodel was extended using
    the DAM Profile. In the SysML extension mechanism, DAM Stereotypes DaStep extends
    the SysML parent model to represent the state of failure and error in the system.
    The tag value under DaStep describes the transitions and triggers of the components.
    The nominal and failure states of the components are shown, where the failure
    states are represented by no output from the temperature sensor and power source
    failure. DAM stereotypes represent the transitions and triggers of the components
    to illustrate the failure and error states. The extended SMDs include failure
    to capture sensor readings, false sensor readings, and loss of control. The transition
    link indicates the triggers responsible for the state change, and various triggers
    are defined for other system components. Figure 8. Example of failure annotation,
    (a) failure annotation of a temperature sensor and (b) failure annotation of a
    power source. 6.4. Model Transformation from MBSE Model to FT 6.4.1. Component
    Fault Tree Generation To create the corresponding CFT, each system component’s
    one-to-one SMDs are mapped. In the CFT, the component’s overall failure is TE,
    while the IEs represent various functional states’ failure or error deviation.
    BE represents their triggers. To illustrate, the SMDs created in Figure 8a,b are
    mapped to their respective CFTs, as shown in Figure 9. Figure 9. Mapping of component
    state machine diagram to component fault tree for (a) a temperature sensor and
    (b) a power source. 6.4.2. System Fault Tree Generation The different components’
    fault trees generated are mapped based on the instances of the components in the
    system’s IBD. Accordingly, the overall system FT of SIS obtained is presented
    in Figure 10. The TE denotes the system failure condition, which is “the failure
    of the system to irrigate the field when needed”. The list of BEs and IEs and
    their description representing various basic device failures or communication
    failures between devices is provided in Table A1 in Appendix A. Figure 10. Fault
    tree generated for IoT-enabled SIS. 6.5. Qualitative Failure Analysis of the System
    Depending on the role(s) of a component in the system and its interactions with
    other components in the system, the failure of the component can have an enormous
    impact on the failure of the system. Therefore, this system’s qualitative failure
    behaviour analysis aims to identify its potential causes. For failure behaviour
    analysis, we identified “the failure of the system to irrigate the field when
    needed” as a system failure condition. Considering this event as the top event
    of the fault tree, we developed the fault tree shown in Figure 10. This FT contains
    19 unique basic events and the root causes that can contribute to the system failure.
    These root causes are either an internal failure of the devices or the failure
    of the communication between devices. As seen in Figure 10, physical damage to
    the sensors or erroneous readings from the sensors is considered as the failure
    of the TS and MS, which are represented by the events TSF (temperature sensor
    failure) and MSF (moisture sensor failure). In the fault tree, five basic events—FCRG,
    FCGC, FCFC, FCTG, and FCMG—represent communication failures between system components.
    Note that, due to simplicity and brevity, we considered these communication failure-related
    events at an abstract level. This means we do not decompose these events further
    to show why a particular communication failure occurs. However, one can explore
    these events further by considering all the causes of a typical wireless communication
    failure. Similarly, the failure of the edge cloud is presented by the event ICS
    (internal failure of the edge cloud server) due to simplicity. Again, this event
    can be decomposed further by considering many potential causes of a cloud server
    failure, including hardware and software failures. We analysed the fault tree
    in Figure 10 to identify the MCSs and obtained 94 MCSs; each of these MCSs can
    cause the system to fail. Out of these 94 MCSs, 71 MCSs are of order 2 and 23
    are of order 1. The order of an MCS represents the number of basic events contributing
    to that MCS. If all the basic events are equally probable to occur, then the higher
    the order of an MCS, the lower the criticality of that MCS is. Therefore, in this
    example, the first-order MCSs, such as “Water level is inadequate in the reservoir
    (WLIR)”, “Random Failure of Water Pump (RFWP)”, “Switch Failure (SWF)”, “Internal
    Failure of Relay (IFR)”, “Human Error (HE)”, “Random Failure of Gateway (RFG)”,
    and “Gateway Battery Failure (GBF)”, are the most critical ones. Therefore, actions
    should be taken to reduce the likelihood of these events. For instance, for the
    events related to communication failure, multiple communication media can be considered,
    so that if one medium fails, another can be used for successful communication.
    7. Conclusions The integration of IoT technology into agriculture heralds a transformative
    era, albeit one fraught with challenges, particularly in areas of the dependability
    and trustworthiness of these systems to operate as expected over their mission
    time. Understanding the intricacies of individual component failures and their
    systemic impact is pivotal for ensuring the robust performance of agricultural
    IoT systems. As the agricultural landscape evolves, researchers are at the forefront
    of developing sophisticated analysis and verification frameworks essential for
    fostering intelligent systems contributing to long-term food sustainability. This
    study serves as a testament to the effectiveness of the MBSA approach in dissecting
    the failure behaviour of an abstract IoT-based Smart Irrigation System. Leveraging
    a model-driven methodology, the investigation not only illuminated the nuances
    of system failure but also showcased the MBSA approach’s merits—characterised
    by meticulousness, error reduction, model reuse, and adaptability to iterative
    processes. The fault tree generated through this approach systematically identified
    component failures as basic events, delineating their interconnected pathways
    leading to system failure. This granular analysis empowers stakeholders to pinpoint
    the root causes of system failure and implement remedial measures crucial for
    maintaining operational integrity. While the present study concentrated on qualitative
    analysis, future investigations hold promise in transitioning to quantitative
    assessments by incorporating components’ failure rates or probabilities and considering
    various failure distributions over time. Furthermore, the MBSA approach’s inherent
    flexibility opens avenues for including additional complex failure conditions,
    such as “unnecessary irrigation” or “insufficient irrigation duration”, demonstrating
    its ease of adaptation for diverse failure analyses. In the evolving landscape
    of agricultural technology, security considerations emerge as a paramount concern.
    Acknowledging the potential vulnerabilities to safety failures induced by malevolent
    attacks, future research endeavours should delve into fortifying the system against
    security threats and malicious operations. As we navigate the ever-expanding realm
    of IoT in agriculture, a continuous commitment to robust analysis, adaptability,
    and security considerations will undoubtedly shape the future of sustainable and
    resilient smart farming systems. Lastly, the proposed approach requires scalability,
    which can be achieved using a dynamic FTA. This tool is useful for modelling complex
    systems’ time- and function-dependent failure behaviour. By incorporating a dynamic
    FTA, we will be able to gain a more accurate understanding of how a system behaves
    over time and how different functions and components interact. This information
    can optimise framework performance, reduce risks, and improve the system’s overall
    dependability. Author Contributions Background, A.A. and M.M.R.; proposed methodology,

    playing a critical role in human life beyond just being a drink [1]. The history
    of winemaking dates back over 8000 years, with archaeological evidence pointing
    to the South Caucasus region, specifically Georgia, as the cradle for grapevine
    [2]. Numerous artifacts and residues found in the region have confirmed the presence
    of wine production and consumption in ancient times [3,4]. This longevity of winemaking
    as a profession highlights the enduring impact of wine on human culture and underscores
    its continued relevance today [5]. Besides its cultural significance, wine has
    remarkable economic importance because it is a key driver of economic growth in
    many regions, generating wealth and workplaces and attracting tourists interested
    in wineries and local culture [6]. Additionally, quality wine has been shown to
    have numerous health benefits when consumed in moderation. These benefits include
    reducing the risk of heart disease, improving cognitive function, and promoting
    longevity [7]. Consequently, wine has a significant impact on both society and
    economies, playing a crucial role in many aspects of human life. Whether it is
    as a cultural icon, an economic driver, or a healthful drink, wine continues to
    play an important role in the future of society and the global economy [8]. The
    production of wine, a product with a rich cultural heritage that spans thousands
    of years, has been subject to numerous technological innovations in recent times
    [9,10,11]. Precisely, advances in technologies have opened up new opportunities
    for optimizing the wine supply chain, from the vineyard to the consumer [12].
    The Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Blockchain Technology
    (BCT) are transforming the way that wine is produced, managed, and distributed,
    offering numerous benefits to all stakeholders in the wine industry [13,14]. This
    presents a unique opportunity to enhance the traditional methods of wine production
    with novel approaches, resulting in a more efficient and sustainable production
    process. The implementation of IoT, AI, and BCT in the wine industry has the potential
    to revolutionize the entire supply chain, from the vineyard to the consumer. These
    technologies enable precise monitoring and control of the wine production process,
    from grape harvesting to wine aging, resulting in a more consistent and high-quality
    end product. Furthermore, the use of BCT provides a secure and transparent supply
    chain, ensuring that the authenticity and provenance of the wine can be traced
    from the vineyard to the consumer [15]. Indeed, food producers have expressed
    an interest in incorporating BCT with some aspects of information and communication
    technologies (ICTs), such as IoT devices, AI and others, to confront the complex
    challenge of food safety, traceability, quality, and control of internal processes
    in the agri-food production [16]. Additionally, the role of the integration of
    novel technologies in the agri-food supply chains is essential for achieving a
    sustainable industry where data availability and management are crucially important
    because they are a precondition for demonstrating product quality and characteristics
    to the stakeholders while ensuring safe food, tracking, and all of the product-related
    and institutional sustainability values [17,18,19]. Despite the prospective role
    of IoT-AI-BCT in the wine supply chain being evident, to the best of our knowledge,
    there is a lack of research focusing on safety, environmental and economic aspects
    of the wine industry, making a comprehensive review of the contribution of IoT-AI-BCT
    implementation to the sustainability of the wine supply chain. In order to make
    a constructive addition to the current body of knowledge, this study conducts
    a comprehensive literature review and develops a solid IoT-AI-BCT framework for
    sustainability in the wine supply chain. 2. Background Research 2.1. Wine Supply
    Chain The wine supply chain encompasses a complex network of interconnected processes
    spanning from vineyard to consumers. It begins with grape cultivation and harvesting,
    followed by the winemaking process, including fermentation, aging, and bottling.
    After production, wines are distributed through various channels, such as wholesalers,
    retailers, and direct-to-consumer sales [20,21]. Throughout this journey, multiple
    stakeholders are involved, including grape growers, wineries, distributors, retailers,
    and consumers (Figure 1) [22]. Each stage of the supply chain presents unique
    challenges, including vineyard management, quality control, transportation logistics,
    and market dynamics [23,24]. Figure 1. Wine Supply Chain. Source: [23,24]. Despite
    its rich tradition and cultural significance, the wine supply chain faces several
    challenges that can hinder its efficiency and sustainability [25]. Sustainability
    criteria for the wine industry emphasize the reduction of negative environmental
    consequences, such as water shortages, energy use and production waste, organic
    and inorganic waste, greenhouse gas emissions, land issues, and the usage of pesticides
    have all been related to detrimental environmental consequences [26,27]. Sustainability
    criteria also take into account the production of social value and a company’s
    capacity to contribute to the development of an area in which it works. Consequently,
    they evaluate the enterprises’ efforts to conserve the surrounding ecosystems
    and the cultural and viticultural heritage of the area [28]. One of the challenges
    is the lack of transparency and traceability, which makes it difficult to track
    the origin of grapes, monitor the production process, and verify the authenticity
    of the final product [29]. This opacity can lead to issues such as fraud, counterfeiting,
    and mislabeling, undermining consumer trust and confidence in the industry [30].
    Additionally, the wine supply chain often suffers from inefficiencies related
    to inventory management, transportation logistics, and demand forecasting, resulting
    in higher costs and longer lead times [31,32]. According to Kunnapapdeelert and
    Pitchayadejanant [33], supply chain strategies addressed properly can improve
    collaboration between actors along this supply chain and, consequently, improve
    operational performance. Authors argue that suppliers’ and consumers’ integration,
    as well as internal integration, have a positive impact on the operational performance
    of the supply chain. Similarly, Kadlubek [34] asserts that supply chain strategy
    is essential for its optimized management, and in the circumstances of globalization,
    regionalization, constant technological development and changing needs and expectations
    of customers, there is a need for further evolution. Chopra and Meindl [35] and
    Canavari and collagues [36] also highlight the role of information technology
    utilization in advancing and monitoring the performance of modern supply chains.
    Indeed, in the era of digitalization, there is an opportunity to address the identified
    challenges and improve the wine supply chain through the adoption of innovative
    technologies such as BCT, AI, and IoT. These technologies can enhance transparency,
    traceability, and efficiency by digitizing supply chain processes, enabling real-time
    monitoring and data sharing among stakeholders [37,38]. By leveraging digitalization,
    the wine industry can overcome traditional barriers, optimize operations, and
    deliver greater value to consumers while ensuring the sustainability and integrity
    of the supply chain [39]. 2.2. IoT, AI, and BCT in the Wine Industry 2.2.1. IoT
    in the Wine Supply Chain IoT is a network of interconnected items that communicate
    and share data with each other [40]. The IoT is quickly integrating with a vast
    array of technologies, including Cloud Technology, Machine Learning (ML), Data
    Analysis, and Modeling. Rapid growth in IoT has a favorable impact on the IT sector
    as a whole, fostering its expansion. IoT facilitates the development of fresh
    commercial strategies; one of its fundamental characteristics is the enhancement
    of data, which will impact the growth of the ICT sector [41]. If the wine business
    used modern technologies that enable traceability, customers would be able to
    check and verify each stage of the process, from the cultivation of vines to the
    disposal of wine bottles and packaging [15]. Barcodes, Quick Response (QR) codes,
    and Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFID) tags are a few of the supply chain monitoring
    technologies that have arisen with the growth of IoT technology [42]. Barcodes
    use a series of parallel gaps and bars to represent 10 digits. This information
    may be read by an optical device and sent to a system for storage and processing.
    QR codes are extensively used in traceable labels because of their capacity to
    hold more information than typical one-dimensional barcodes [43]. RFID is comparable
    to barcoding in that a device reads information from a tag or label and stores
    it in a database, but it has significant benefits over barcode asset monitoring
    software [44]. Information contained in RFID tags may be read from a distance,
    unlike barcodes, which need physical alignment with a scanner. Moreover, its storage
    capacity (about 32–128 Bit) is greater than that of previous systems, and it can
    be continuously updated to provide the highest level of security [45]. Specifically,
    Li and colleagues [46] describe an IoT platform that enables product tracing and
    monitoring, which provides crucially useful services for the surveillance of the
    prepackaged food supply chain and, therefore, the adoption of suitable and informed
    decisions. In a similar spirit, Pal and Kant [47], in their work, provide the
    technical requirements for integrating a sensing and communication platform based
    on the IoT into a food distribution network, including a consideration of the
    data that must be obtained and the most efficient means for gathering it. Jabbari
    and Kaminsky [48] review the design of BC systems and their impact on the food
    supply chain. Several benefits are highlighted, including the preservation of
    trust between the user and the system, the removal of the need for a third party
    to maintain trust, and the ability to trace the origin of individual components.
    The most challenging and outstanding concern is the ease with which RFID tags
    and sensors may be replicated and manipulated. According to Montecchi and colleagues
    [49], a BCT-based food distribution system might be used to identify the provenance
    of each sold item. This may help level the playing field between businesses and
    customers by giving consumers access to the same product information as enterprises.
    Compared to Luvisi and colleagues [50] and Kamilaris and colleagues [51], investigate
    the impact of the BCT-based food supply chain on the agriculture market. Despite
    the extensive regulation of wine supply chain activities, wine fraud is prevalent
    (by both European and national legislation). It has been observed that there is
    a lack of technological solutions in the research literature that attempt to promote
    supply chain transparency and efficiency in the wine business. Enterprises that
    have traditionally played significant roles at different points along the wine
    distribution are less likely to use electronic traceability systems [52], while
    larger companies are more likely to do so. It is essential that technological
    advances be made in the field of traceability, with the aim of proving the origins
    and authenticity of wines to protect wine consumers and producers [53]. 2.2.2.
    AI in the Wine Supply Chain AI tools, such as ML algorithms, are increasingly
    integrated into the various stages of the wine supply chain described in Section
    2.1 [54]. In the grape preproduction stage, farmers utilize ML algorithms to predict
    crop yield, assess soil conditions, and optimize irrigation strategies [55]. This
    predictive capability aids in disease identification and weather anticipation,
    which is crucial for enhancing agricultural productivity [56]. During the wine
    production stage, ML algorithms facilitate production planning in order to ensure
    a high-quality wine output. Predictive algorithms help optimize fermentation processes,
    monitor grape ripeness, and manage fermentation temperatures to maintain wine
    quality and consistency [57,58]. At the packaging stage, AI algorithms and the
    presence of robots assist in optimizing packaging processes for efficiency and
    sustainability. Predictive maintenance models help minimize downtime by identifying
    potential equipment failures before they occur, ensuring uninterrupted packaging
    operations [59]. In the distribution stage, retailers and distributors leverage
    AI for tasks such as inventory management, shipping optimization, and customer
    profiling. Predictive analytics algorithms forecast demand patterns, enabling
    retailers to stock the right products in the right quantities at the right locations,
    reducing inventory costs and minimizing stockouts [60]. In addition, including
    AI tools, such as decision support systems in the business processes, considerably
    reduces the risk of inefficient output, especially in terms of sustainable practices
    [61]. Throughout the supply chain (sale and consumption stage), AI-powered recommendation
    systems enhance customer experiences by providing personalized product recommendations
    based on individual preferences and purchase histories. Natural language processing
    (NLP) algorithms analyze customer feedback and sentiment to identify emerging
    trends and preferences, enabling wineries to adapt their product offerings and
    marketing strategies accordingly [62]. By integrating AI technology across these
    stages, the wine industry can optimize processes, improve product quality, and
    enhance customer satisfaction while promoting sustainability and efficiency throughout
    the supply chain [54]. 2.2.3. BCT in the Wine Supply Chain Sustainability issues
    are pressuring and encouraging the agriculture sector within the worldwide economic
    system to evolve towards greater sustainability [63]. Consequently, the past decade
    has seen rapid growth in the promotion of intelligent systems and the discovery
    of novel solutions across all sectors [64,65]. BCT is considered to be a game-changer
    in several economic areas. BCT is a distributed, decentralized system comprised
    of blocks that are linked by cryptographic hashes and timestamps. As a preventive
    approach to safeguard data integrity across the supply chain, it has been widely
    used [66]. Consequently, no party in the supply chain may alter the existing information
    as a result of BCT’s assistance in creating trust mechanisms to address transparency
    and security issues [67]. In the field of agricultural research, BCT offers great
    potential. Low-quality supplies result in low-quality plants, and it may have
    a detrimental influence on farmers’ revenue and costs [68]. BCT’s ability of transparency
    enables both small and large farms to make informed decisions and access high-quality
    commodities [69]. Through BCT, users can verify whether seed suppliers have delivered
    inferior seeds. Additionally, BCT is applied in the agricultural industry to optimize
    supply chain operations, enhance traceability, increase food safety, and reduce
    transaction times, costs, food fraud, and inefficient processes. In addition to
    increasing farmers’ earnings, BCT has the ability to further the cause of ethical
    businesses by exposing their support to issues such as fair trade, animal welfare,
    and pollution avoidance [70,71]. Applying the BCT enhances the ability to track
    and monitor the meal throughout all of its stages [72]. It may lessen the need
    for excessive pesticide and fertilizer use, which may lead to harmful residue
    build-up in humans [73]. The adoption of BCT specifically promotes sustainable
    agriculture [74,75]. Given that consumers put a high value on understanding the
    origin of their agri-foods and that this technology may be used to fight product
    counterfeiting and forging, BCT has the potential to play a significant role and
    find broad use [39]. Indeed, BCT permits the detection and containment of hazardous
    goods, as well as the monitoring of their journey through the supply chain by
    suppliers, farmers, manufacturers, merchants, and government agencies. Particularly,
    the aforementioned characteristics of BCT enable a far quicker recall in the event
    that a potentially hazardous product shows up in retailers. Consequently, it mitigates
    supply chain inefficiencies that may otherwise result in disastrous consequences
    [76,77]. Accurately detecting dangerous goods in a timely way promotes product
    recalls before they spread to consumers and only to those who are affected, thus
    lowering health risks, financial losses, and reputational damage [78,79]. 2.2.4.
    IoT, AI, and BCT Integration in the Wine Supply Chain Among the numerous potential
    advantages of merging IoT, AI, and BCT are an increase in system efficiency, information
    transparency, environmentally intelligent farming, and logistics. In conjunction
    with IoT sensors and AI, BCT may give a more comprehensive and relevant image
    of the agriculture economy [80]. Precisely, utilizing IoT, the product or service
    will have full connection to all required materials and components throughout
    the whole manufacturing process because these sensors transmit their data to the
    BCT. Connecting devices and sensors is another advantage of the IoT, and using
    IoT in conjunction with BCT has been demonstrated to be an effective strategy
    that saves both time and money while creating vast quantities of data. Manufacturers
    may utilize cutting-edge deep learning (ADL) algorithms to examine this data in
    order to make wiser decisions [81]. Sadly, only a small percentage of food and
    beverage sector firms are now using the IoT and smart manufacturing processes.
    BCT-enabled IoT systems may be enhanced using methods of deep reinforcement learning
    [82]. Combining IoT with BCT ensures supply chain transparency and traceability.
    Precisely, by linking IoT devices to smart contracts based on BCT, the supply
    chain can keep track of where products are, how many are in stock, and who owns
    what at all times. With this knowledge, companies may be better prepared for any
    kind of disaster. In addition, the usage of smart contracts allows companies and
    customers to verify the legitimacy of food products by tracing their origins [83].
    In 2018, AgriBlockIoT solution has been presented, which used IoT and BCT through
    Ethereum and Hyperledger Sawtooth to create a food traceability system. The agri-food
    tracking system [84] might benefit from AgriBlockIoT’s fault tolerance, immutability,
    auditability, and openness of data. 2.2.5. Some Practical Applications In recent
    years, the wine industry has witnessed a surge in the adoption of AI, IoT, and
    BCT to optimize various aspects of the supply chain. IBM is recognized as a leading
    provider of enterprise BCT [85]. The IBM Blockchain platform, open and cloud-based,
    offers end-to-end capabilities that enable businesses to rapidly activate, develop,
    manage, and successfully secure their enterprise networks. On IBM Blockchain Transparent
    Supply, VinAssure™ is developed, and it runs on IBM Cloud to leverage advanced
    technologies such as blockchain, AI, and cloud to optimize the entire supply chain
    with benefits for all stakeholders involved. VinAssure™ connects wine producers,
    sellers, importers, transporters, distributors, restaurants, and retailers, contributing
    to increased traceability, efficiency, and profitability, facilitated by the ability
    to efficiently and securely share data [86]. The first brand to join VinAssure™
    is De Maison Selections, a US importer of responsibly sourced wines, cider, and
    spirits from independent Spanish and French producers. VinAssure™ has also been
    adopted by other leading wine brands, such as Ste. Michelle Wine Estates, Export
    Division, the third-largest premium wine company in the United States by size,
    and Maison Sichel, a Bordeaux winemaker and merchant for seven generations. These
    three companies collectively produce millions of wine bottles distributed worldwide.
    The companies highlighted the benefit of adopting technology related to transparency,
    storytelling, and communication with consumers [87]. EY (Ernst & Young) collaborated
    with various wine producers to develop blockchain solutions aimed at improving
    supply chain transparency and combating wine fraud. Their blockchain platform
    allows consumers to trace the journey of wine from vineyard to bottle, ensuring
    authenticity and quality assurance. Antient Italian Winery Placido Volpone developed
    a solution in 2017 in collaboration with EY Italy for tracing the wine supply
    chain, enabling the self-certification of the entire production process. The system
    offers a virtual KM-zero, establishing a digital connection between the producer
    and the end consumer. Through a smart label on the wine bottle, consumers can
    access information about the entire production and transformation process of the
    wine. Blockchain ensures the immutability of the data. This solution helped to
    winery in strengthening consumers’ trust and brand loyalty [30]. Wineries Rucci
    Curbastro, Ruffino, and Torrevento utilize the My Story platform by DNV GL to
    trace their wine bottles from the vineyard to the certification entity. Among
    the active producers are Ricci Curbastro from Franciacorta, Ruffino from Tuscany,
    and Torrevento from Puglia. The technology involves scanning a QR code on the
    label, allowing consumers to access the wine’s history and specific information
    verified by DNV GL regarding its characteristics and production processes. Wineries
    declare increased brand visibility after this intervention [88]. On the other
    hand, Robert Mondavi, one of the largest brands in the luxury alcohol industry
    joining the BCT, plans to sell its unique, limited-edition bottles of wine through
    cryptocurrencies with an estimated price of USD 3,500 [89]. Meanwhile, Chateau
    Angélus sold one barrel, thus 300 bottles of wine with BC-certified ownership
    for USD 110,000 with ‘stablecoin’ cryptocurrency [90]. One of Napa Valley’s pioneering
    wineries, Trefethen Family Vineyards, created traceable wine (cabernet sauvignon
    Trefethen) through BCT with an added artist label dedicated to wine collationers.
    The winery sold nine items in one week for around USD 700 per each, which is 10
    times more expensive than the regularly issued same wine [91]. 3. Methodology
    A systematic literature review (SLR) was selected to investigate and evaluate
    the available literature on the use of IoT, AI, and BCT in the winery supply chain
    for the purpose of optimizing operations. The proposed methodology uses a scientific,
    transparent, and demonstrable protocol to search and critically analyze the current
    publications [92,93] and reduces bias in the identification, selection, evaluation,
    and synthesis of the existing research body when compared with traditional narrative
    reviews [94,95,96]. In addition, Christofi and colleagues [97], as well as Rana
    and co-authors [98], stressed the significance of SLR, indicating that it is a
    useful method for summarizing the key findings of vast and complex research subjects,
    bridging present gaps, and identifying unexplored areas for future research [99,100,101].
    Masi and colleagues [102] and Moher and co-authors [103] employed a five-step
    method to investigate the available literature extensively. This method was used
    to study the literature (Figure 2). Figure 2. Graphical representation of literature
    investigation methodology. Source: Own elaboration based on the works of Masi
    et al. [102] and Moher et al. [103]. Establishing a research question that will
    serve as the foundation for the organizing of search words is the first step in
    topic development [104]. In this respect, the topic of the study was identified
    by an early and exploratory literature review [94], and the research question
    was then established and clarified [105]. The chosen words were included in the
    construction of the query string. Particularly, the literature revealed that terms
    such as “IoT”, “AI(ML)”, “BCT”, and “Wine” were associated with IoT-BCT in agriculture
    (wine case study), whereas “safety” and “sustainability” were frequently used
    in studies examining the use of IoT-BCT in the wine industry and agriculture in
    general. This resulted in the formulation of the following research questions:
    How can IoT, AI, and BCT be used to guarantee the safety of the winemaking process?
    How might IoT, AI, and BCT be used to achieve environmental sustainability in
    the wine supply chain? How may BCT help the wine industry become commercially
    viable? In the second step, identification of the material, we limited our search
    for relevant works in this research topic to the database with the highest coverage
    of the examined subjects, Google Scholar. This database was chosen because it
    allows simple access to many high-quality studies published in reputable journals
    [94,106]. This is also a typical method for various sorts of systematic reviews
    [107]. The following criteria were established to reduce the search for suitable
    publications: All selected papers were written in English; The filter ‘TITLE-ABS-KEY’
    (scanning in titles, abstracts, and keywords) was applied in the Google Scholar
    database; The search was not restricted to a specific timeframe (even though it
    was expected to uncover papers from 2008, the year BCT was created); The sources
    of data chosen were only academic journal papers [94]; Using Boolean operators,
    we then selected a list of keywords to include in the search query (specifically,
    AND to reduce the number of papers retrieved and OR to increase it). We analyzed
    the search string along three key dimensions to get the most comprehensive relevant
    results [106,108], focusing on specific aspects of the search problem. With an
    initial application of a broad term such as “IoT-BCT” in the wine industry, we
    uncovered a substantial amount of generic academic papers in the selected database
    (a total of 2730 pieces). This was the search term: ((IoT-BCT) AND (wine OR AI(ML))
    OR Sustainability. In total, 482 Google Scholar papers were obtained and analyzed
    based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Reading the titles and abstracts
    of the scientific papers relevant to the topic of the review was the third step
    in the screening process [96]. Specifically, Google Scholar results were examined
    for duplication elimination. Subsequently, only papers with substantial contributions
    to the problem at hand were examined. A second-round screening was conducted on
    empirical work in which the ‘Research focus’ was not indicated in the title or
    abstract to avoid discarding essential publications in the field [92]. Therefore,
    120 research articles were selected in total. The fourth step, “Analysis and synthesis”,
    was the examination of the full-text articles for eligibility. In addition, a
    full-text analysis was conducted to further assess the relevance of these articles
    to the study’s objectives. Specifically, several publications were discarded because
    of the following: They did not integrate IoT into BCT; They did not include AI(ML)
    in IoT-BCT models; The issues of safety, economic, and environmental sustainability
    were not discussed in the IoT-BCT architecture; None of them are associated with
    the wine industry. In this study, 29 studies have been included for this purpose.
    In addition, snowball searching strategies were used by reviewing the reference
    lists of the selected articles to locate more relevant articles and to validate
    that a substantial percentage of the primary literature had been captured by the
    selection procedure [109]. A total of 5 more papers were discovered as a result
    of these extra studies, increasing the total number of works to be examined to
    34. Each article’s descriptive and thematic contents were appraised [99,110,111].
    It was essential to establish structural dimensions and the corresponding analytical
    groups in order to classify, encode, and then retrieve the final data using a
    spreadsheet [111]. 4. Results and Discussion 4.1. The Increase of Wine Safety
    under IoT, AI, and BCT Traceability throughout the supply chain is essential for
    ensuring the products’ safety [112]. However, the wine supply chain includes several
    stakeholders, some of whom are geographically distant from one another (such as
    the growers, processors, and retailers that stock the final goods). Due to the
    incompatibility of software and data structures, it is impossible to develop a
    unified monitoring system for information. As a result, every company involved
    in the wine supply chain has its own data recording system. Lin and colleagues
    [112] envisioned an ecosystem based on BCT and IoT for smart agriculture. According
    to the authors, everyone participating in the system may use their smartphones
    to submit information, and the system will automatically collect data from IoT
    devices without human intervention. The information saved through the BC network
    cannot be changed without the approval of all involved parties [113]. A reliable
    system is created using this strategy that protects its users from scammers and
    prevents fraud before it occurs. In a dependable system, high availability (to
    authorized users) and service integrity must be assured [114]. Price increases,
    for instance, are difficult to execute without first having a discussion about
    pricing and locating a skilled team of software engineers that charge reasonable
    rates and have a diverse portfolio that includes agriculture-related experience.
    For example, the company must be able to provide a high-quality product that fulfills
    all market requirements, including a comprehensive set of data records [115].
    ICT provides a number of potential benefits for food safety, such as concurrent
    monitoring of agri-food products throughout distribution and storage [116], RFID
    tagging, GPS, and QR code-like electronic labeling that is easy to synchronize
    with the cloud, and better traceability due to BCT [73,117]. Incorporating AI-based
    Big Data Analysis (BDA) as a rapid reaction towards food safety outbreaks enables
    BCT and the IoT to interact synergistically for the improving of the food surveillance
    framework [118,119]. It is anticipated that the IoT will aid in the development
    of comprehensive research methods in food handling, in which key drivers such
    as environmental issues, human behavior, and the economic system can be integrated
    to foresee food safety hazards, and BCT will improve the security and privacy
    of data [67,82,83,84]. By making the whole food production process more open and
    available to consumers, BCT enables direct consumer-to-producer connection [119,120].
    It increases consumer confidence and trust in food safety by lowering obstacles
    to commodity movement [30]. From the perspective of regulatory agencies, BCT enables
    the efficient and effective application of legislation based on accurate and trustworthy
    data [121]. Moreover, BCT’s compatibility with regulations, such as geographical
    indications (GI) and protected designation of origin (PDO), further enhances its
    value in the wine industry [122]. By facilitating compliance with regulatory requirements
    and standards, BCT not only safeguards wine safety but also strengthens the integrity
    of the supply chain, fostering consumer trust and brand reputation [123]. In Table
    1, several findings are synthesized from the analyzed literature regarding the
    integration of IoT, AI, and BCT, and their impact on safety within the wine supply
    chain. Table 1. Safety guaranteed in the wine supply chain under IoT, AI, and
    BTC. 4.2. The Impact of IoT, AI, and BCT on the Environmental Sustainability of
    the Wine Supply Chain Established in 1987, the United Brundtland Commission defined
    sustainability as “meeting the needs of the present without compromising the capacity
    of future generations to meet their own needs”. According to the International
    Organization for Vine and Wine [128], sustainable viticulture is an “international
    policy on the level of the wine processing and production processes, integrating
    at the same time the financial viability of frameworks and regions, generating
    quality goods, considering prerequisites of precision in sustainable vineyards,
    risks to the environment, product safety, and consumer health, and appreciating
    of heritage, historical, social, cultural, and environmental facets”. According
    to Gilinski and colleagues [129], leaving the land in better condition than the
    present one for future generations is a top priority for individuals in the wine
    industry. Access to more information about wine production through the IoT-BCT
    enables health-conscious and ecologically conscientious customers to put a greater
    value on their wine purchases [39]. With a thorough understanding of how to integrate
    sustainability into a company’s operations while minimizing the costs associated
    with adopting sustainability certification requirements, such as data collection
    and management techniques, the majority of obstacles related to sustainability
    compliance can be overcome. In this regard, BCT offers potential as a way of enhancing
    ecosystem development in relation to concerns of transparency, food safety, and
    provenance in agri-food chains [130]. In addition, BCT has shown potential for
    enhanced management of global supply chains in terms of transparency, traceability,
    and security, all of which are reflected in a rise in efficiency [125,131]. BCT
    can simplify supply chain - wide data collecting, storage, and certification [132].
    In pursuit of increased environmental responsibility, the efficient management
    of data is a significant topic. Every day, a vast amount of information is generated
    in the food industry, and recognizing methods to extract vital information from
    diverse sources will aid in bacterial risk assessment [120], outbreak prevention,
    and identification of trends through pathogen monitoring [73], which strengthens
    food safety inferences and facilitates decisions. In fact, the lack of a defined
    approach for data collection throughout the whole manufacturing process and storage
    is one of the greatest obstacles to ecological sustainability in business. The
    assessment of a product’s carbon footprint, for instance, requires a cradle-to-grave
    understanding of the product’s sourcing, processing practices, and logistics across
    the supply chain, necessitating a concerted effort and, consequently, the assertive
    contribution of the various actors along the supply chain [133]. BCT has shown
    great potential as a solution to this issue because it is a technology that can
    monitor and map the whole supply chain in a unified, secure, transparent, and
    time-efficient way [134]. Overall, this tracking has shown promise in terms of
    assuring ethical sourcing and monitoring ecological responsibility [135], streamlining
    the green supply chains [136], and ensuring social sustainability [137]. In Table
    2, evidence is summarized from the analyzed literature regarding the integration
    of IoT, AI, and BCT, focusing on their role in environmental protection and management
    within the wine supply chain. Table 2. Environmental sustainability guaranteed
    in the wine supply chain under IoT, AI, and BCT. 4.3. The Benefits of BCT on the
    Local Economy of the Wine Industry The agriculture industry is considering BCT
    due to its capacity to enable near-instantaneous payments and automate compliance
    via smart contracts, as well as enhance security, transparency, transaction speed,
    and operational expenditures [38]. Due to its de-intermediating, transparent,
    and listening characteristics, BCT has the ability to cut transaction costs, improve
    the efficiency of existing value networks, challenge revenue models, and establish
    new markets [117,140]. BCT has the potential to continue enhancing financial planning,
    source, traceability, and transparency in food sources, as well as facilitate
    the establishment of new products and markets for agricultural production in low-income
    countries [51,69]. While the agri-food industry is vital to national economies,
    it confronts various issues that diminish its export competitiveness, such as
    post-harvest losses of fruits and vegetables at the farm gate, storage facilities,
    retail and wholesale markets and a lack of a direct sales channel [141]. Herewith,
    in the agri-food industry, there is no certainty of market fairness due to the
    asymmetry of market data. Mao and colleagues [138] designed an alliance chain-based
    food trade system to solve these challenges. The authors exploited consortium
    BCT to design a unique architecture that aids in protecting the integrity of financial
    transactions. Their BCT allows mobile banking for farmers and substantially reduces
    transaction fees. The agricultural and food sectors would considerably benefit
    from the administration of supply chain activities and finances in real-time.
    Using BCT, farmers can be assured a fair price for their commodities, while merchants
    can confirm they have received what they paid for [114]. Small business ownership
    is plagued with obstacles. It might take between one and two years to locate a
    consistent stream of customers and create a company. Initial Coin Offering (ICO)
    is a kind of financing similar to crowdsourcing that employs crypto money instead
    of regular payments; it may aid small farm owners in finding investors and expanding
    their business [142]. Due to initial coin offerings (ICOs), startups do not need
    to spend additional money on legal expenses or hire a lawyer to make their ideas
    a reality; all they need to do is persuade people to participate in the company
    [143]. In order to speed up the ordering, delivery, and payment of food, companies
    may use smart contracts, which are network-accessible bits of code developed by
    software experts. When the commodities are ready, transactions may be performed
    instantaneously, sparing farmers the inconvenience of waiting months or even years
    for their cash to be returned. In addition, middlemen are unnecessary. Therefore,
    both farmers and their clients may feel certain that their agreements will be
    respected [140]. The BCT is also included on trade platforms. Stock markets may
    now profit from BCT while doing business as normal. It can be seen how easily
    farmers may swap future contracts at predetermined prices for crops, livestock,
    fruits, vegetables, and other agricultural products using the wine supply chain
    as an example. Farmers and consumers will have a solid understanding of production
    costs as a result [51]. Bitcoin and other digital currencies often refer to BCT.
    Due to this, according to Vishakha and colleagues [144], farmers may use PavoCoin,
    a cryptocurrency designed in a similar fashion to Bitcoin but with characteristics
    targeted to their requirements. It is the most secure method of online payment
    and is universally accepted. In addition to increasing transparency, the money
    may be used to accelerate and simplify transactions with clients [144]. In Table
    3, summarized evidence from the analyzed literature pertaining to the integration
    of IoT, AI, and BCT, and its impact on economic performance, is presented. Table
    3. Economic sustainability guaranteed in the wine supply chain under IoT, AI,
    and BCT. 4.4. Challenges in Integration of IoT, AI, and BCT in the Wine Industry
    Integrating IoT, AI, and BCT in the wine supply chain presents numerous opportunities,
    but it is not without its challenges [67,72]. While both BCT and AI offer significant
    benefits, their implementation requires specialized knowledge and expertise, making
    them less accessible to smaller and medium-sized enterprises. The lack of educational
    materials and awareness about BCT further complicates its adoption, particularly
    among stakeholders who may not fully understand its potential. Moreover, skepticism
    surrounding cryptocurrencies, often associated with BCT, has led to regulatory
    hurdles and outright prohibitions in certain jurisdictions, hindering its widespread
    use in the food industry [143]. Legal and regulatory frameworks also pose challenges
    to the installation and operation of BCT and AI systems in the wine supply chain
    [84]. Government intervention is necessary to establish guidelines and standards
    for the use of these technologies, ensuring compliance with industry regulations
    and data protection laws [73,116]. Additionally, issues related to data sharing
    and privacy must be addressed to foster trust and cooperation among stakeholders
    in the supply chain. Farm owners may be hesitant to share sensitive information
    on a public network, highlighting the need for secure and transparent data-sharing
    protocols [84]. Overcoming these challenges requires collaborative efforts from
    industry stakeholders, government bodies, and technology developers [145]. Educational
    initiatives can help bridge the knowledge gap and promote understanding of BCT
    and AI among wine producers and distributors. Regulatory reforms should aim to
    facilitate innovation while safeguarding consumer interests and data privacy.
    By addressing these challenges, the wine industry can harness the full potential
    of BCT and AI to enhance transparency, efficiency, and sustainability across the
    supply chain. 4.5. Proposed Framework The analysis of massive volumes of data
    may be used in the whole supply chain to enhance decision-making at each level.
    Due to the widespread use of networked devices such as trucks, RFID, smartphones,
    cameras, and sensor networks, large amounts of data are produced. BDA and ML techniques
    may assist firms in acquiring the proper approach, skills, and tools to become
    data powerhouses [146]. Moreover, BDA may help in the development of novel techniques
    for enhancing supply chain decision-making processes, from frontline operations
    to policy decisions, such as the selection of an acceptable supply chain operating
    model [126]. The ML-based decision-support system may be used both at the edges
    and on the data servers to assess the collected data [124,127]. Using BDA and
    cutting-edge prediction algorithms that take into account elements such as climate,
    special events, and changing marketing trends, supply chain companies may be able
    to better anticipate client demands. To establish an inclusive agricultural and
    food supply chain, BCT must include cooperating networks [139], social ownership
    of resources, democratic governance, and a decentralized digital tech platform
    [125,147]. Chen and colleagues [148] designed a BCT-based architecture to ensure
    agro-based safety with product tracking in ASC systems, with proof-of-work (PoW)
    employed to secure global consensus and the integrity of accurate, unique, and
    unforgeable tracing data. In light of these efforts, we created an IoT-AI(ML)-BCT
    framework to assure the safety and sustainability of the wine supply chain from
    the standpoint of all stakeholders involved (Figure 3). The proposed framework
    is instrumental to openness and assist chain actors in decision-making. The transparency
    and accountability assured by our framework are the key aspects that make the
    wine supply chain ecologically responsible and facilitate chain actors to incur
    necessary costs. Figure 3. The proposed IoT-AI(ML)-BCT-based framework for secure
    and sustainable wine supply chain. Source: own elaboration. The proposed IoT-AI(ML)-BCT
    framework integrates IoT, AI, and BCT to revolutionize the wine industry’s logistics
    and quality control processes. It considers that all actors of the supply chain
    are part of the system: Grape producers use ML algorithms to predict crop yields,
    monitor soil conditions, and forecast weather patterns, aiding vineyard management
    and optimizing production; wineries use IoT devices for tracking wine barrels
    throughout the supply chain, ensuring proper storage conditions and minimizing
    spoilage risks. Meanwhile, BCT provides transparency and immutability to supply
    chain data, enabling consumers to trace the journey of each bottle from vineyard
    to shelf, guaranteeing authenticity and quality. Precisely, each actor of the
    supply chain uses BCT in order to keep immutable data, thus information they declare
    regarding each phase of the wine production. The data comes protected through
    a hash function that includes the hashes of the previous data. Consequently, as
    long as the chain is, it becomes more difficult to alter the information. In the
    end, final consumers are able to track back the information about the product
    they purchase by simply scanning the QR code given on the label of the product.
    4.5.1. Chain Actors Suppliers: the required data contain information on agri-food
    inputs (such as seeds, pesticides, and fertilizers) as well as farmer transactions.
    Farmers: in the case of farmers, their information includes farm locations, crop
    cultivation techniques, harvest timings, meteorological conditions, financial
    transactions with third parties, etc. Processing and bottling: The data are gathered
    and used throughout the processing and bottling phases. This data includes information
    on the factories, fermentation processes, bottling an packaging procedures, transactions
    with farmers and wholesalers, etc. Distributors: the information from distributors
    comprises the routes traveled, the temperatures and humidity levels maintained
    during storage, the identities of everyone engaged in the supply chain, and much
    more. Retailers: retailers have access to tracing data that includes information
    on agri-food products (such as quality, quantity, price, and expiration dates),
    as well as storage conditions, transactions with distributors, etc. Consumers:
    Consumers may get extensive agri-food product information on their mobile devices
    (from suppliers to retailers). Using QR codes, consumers may have access to information
    on the origin, route, batch, and lot numbers of their wine, as well as information
    regarding environmental monitoring. 4.5.2. IoT Devices All chain players (producers,
    growers, processors (wineries), distributors, retailers, and consumers) are examined
    to assemble a complete time series of wine sector activities. The IoT devices
    are QR/bar codes, RFID, NFC, sensors, and mobile devices. All chain parameters
    are tracked by IoT devices, including production area, prices, temperature, carbon
    dioxide (CO2), humidity, diseases, soil moisture, soil pH, fermentation, wine
    grade/quality, packaging weight and date etc. Data are recorded at all stages
    of the wine supply chain, and each data file is made with indexing and time stamp
    components. The proposed system entails storing identical data on the BCT in two
    ways. IoT devices are synchronized to upload data inputs to the ML module and
    BCT system at the same rate, and sensors collect each piece of chain data at predetermined
    intervals. If the information on the BCT and the IoT devices do not match, tampering
    or cloning of the items may be deduced at a later stage of the trace-back procedure
    due to two ways recording of the data. 4.5.3. ML Module ML/AI algorithms assist
    chain actors in managing their processes. This module is accustomed to adhering
    to fair-trade policies. Real-world databases are prone to problems such as incomplete
    and noisy data. The data must be cleansed and transformed before being analyzed.
    This improvement in speed, accuracy, and efficacy is advantageous to the analytical
    skills of ML algorithms. If a value for a particular field or set of records is
    missing, it will be substituted with its average value. The data collected by
    IoT sensors is sent to the ML module for predictive purposes to support wine supply
    chain actors in decision-making and subsequently stored in the BCT. ML module
    modifies standard sales forecasting, and chain data may be significantly reduced.
    Any anomalies or significant changes in client behavior are recorded in the ML
    module so that stakeholders may examine the data for efficient planning. All chain
    stakeholders will have access to the stored information on the BCT and will use
    the information for their benefit. 4.5.4. BCT Module A BCT consists of several
    blocks in a single chain that contains blocks that have been verified by the majority
    of users. When one member in the BC network finalizes a PoW task, and the other
    users validate the outcome, the participant’s transaction is added to the BCT
    in a new block. This indicates that BCT may be depended on to protect financial
    transactions. Tracing data received at each chain transaction will be uploaded
    to a block using digital tools. Each block is added to the BCT when members have
    verified and consented to it. Another area where BCT excels is smart contracts,
    automating transactions between parties without the need for a third party [149].
    Upon the adoption of PoW, any participant in the BCT will have the opportunity
    to mine blocks [150]. Participants demonstrate their labor in the PoW by completing
    mining tasks, which are mathematical problems that are very difficult to solve
    but easy to verify. This dilemma is often characterized as the following. Find
    n s.t. SHA256(SHA256(h.n)) < target (1) where “h” is a block’s contents, “n” is
    a random number, and “.” is a string concatenation operator. Using the cryptographic
    hash technique SHA256(), a 256-bit binary integer is obtained [151]. In this instance,
    the puzzle is regarded to be solved if this number is smaller than the target
    value, which represents the mining difficulty. 4.5.5. Transaction in the System
    A merchant submits a proposal to a smart contract, which is subsequently sent
    to a wholesaler by a peer who supports the idea. The distributor will conduct
    the conclusion of the data files. After the smart contract has validated the predetermined
    rules, it will seek client confirmation. The orderer will then provide the confirmation
    to the distributor, and the smart contract will distribute the cash. At the completion
    of the transaction, all parties involved will be informed of its success. 5. Conclusion
    and Implication for Theory and Practice The population of the current world is
    expanding at an alarming pace. There is an urgent need for revolutionary agricultural
    advancements to meet the food requirements of so many people. An intelligent farming
    model and inclusive foods play a crucial role in this business [18]. The importance
    of cutting-edge technologies such as BCT, IoT, and AI is increasingly recognized.
    Industrial IoT and cutting-edge ML methods will revolutionize global agriculture.
    By digitizing the paper-based monitoring system, fast access to information through
    the wine supply chain will soon be achieved. The suggested management system utilizes
    BCT, IoT, and AI. Also, the functions for managing the wine supply chain’s tracking
    and all user data are included. All granularities of traceability data management,
    compliance and environmental information management, and wine product pricing
    are feasible. The user has total control over who has access to what, and all
    settings are customizable. Both BCT and AI have shown tremendous promise, but
    they need to overcome several challenges before. Both applications need substantial
    expertise and training, making them difficult for smaller and medium-sized enterprises.
    There are no educational materials available to inform the general audience about
    the BCT. People’s lack of faith in cryptocurrencies has led to their outright
    prohibition by a number of nations. In order for this technology to be used in
    the food sector, the government must adopt certain regulations. Similarly, the
    installation of this technology is subject to a number of legal restrictions.
    Ensuring the right data sharing on the network by farm owners is also problematic.
    Governments may be able to find answers to these issues if they intervene. Since
    opposition to such openness may be a sign of bad faith, the government should
    take the appropriate measures to ensure that all actors in all supply chains share
    all data. The deployment of BCT throughout the wine supply chain enables the production
    and supply of safe and healthy wine. This provides an environment of fair competition
    and a transparent marketplace where consumers can search for wine products with
    total confidence. According to Lin and colleagues [152], the next step for IoT-enabled
    e-agriculture schemes is to incorporate BCT into current e-agriculture and IoT
    systems. Data transparency and a secure, sustainable agricultural environment
    can be provided by using BCT and IoT. A system for dependable monitoring of data
    stored in a BCT with a decentralized ledger can be developed using this prototype.
    By applying smart supply chain system, regulated or modified environmental storage,
    handling, IoT-enabled transportation, and logistics, the architecture might improve
    pre- and post-harvest management of the wine from an ecological safety standpoint.
    Smart farming, which includes the IoT and AI, is vital for the most efficient
    use of inputs in the wine-growing. Emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and hydrocarbons
    are categorized as greenhouse gases that may be monitored using IoT-AI-BCT, contributing
    to environmental sustainability. The corporate sector can use cutting-edge technology
    such as BCT, AI, and IoT to develop a trustworthy supply chain management system.
    Implementing a data-driven smart agricultural supply chain using IoT, AI, and
    BCT is the most effective way to address these concerns. The ideal would be if
    the supply chain could give a stream of data that could be utilized to influence
    choices. This may aid the global challenges of food quality, safety, foodborne
    infections, data interchange throughout the manufacturing process, etc. Consideration
    is given to potential applications of BCT, AI, and IoT in the logistics sector
    [83]. The proposed framework employs the integration of AI, IoT, and BCT to make
    the trade compliance process more reliable and efficient. Therefore, these architectural
    components contribute to economic sustainability. To attract investors and expand
    their enterprises, farmers may now utilize crypto money as an alternative to regular
    payments and the aforementioned technologies. Smart contracts provide immediate
    payments of financial commitments. Users may now investigate the origin and supply
    chain of wine due to the combination of BCT with IoT and AI. Using the suggested
    immutable framework, participants may enhance their businesses by getting demand
    predictions and trends for wine in the future with the use of ML algorithms. In
    particular, the findings suggest that the proposed IoT-AI-BCT-based wine supply
    chain architecture can successfully assure reliable product safety and extend
    the economic model of the wine sector. IoT-enabled participants (suppliers, farmers,
    processors, distributors, retailers, and consumers) provide assurance that the
    product was handled in accordance with safety and healthy food standards, and
    each transaction on this framework is timestamped and encrypted. Due to shifts
    in client behavior and viewpoint, real-world wine supply chain needs are changing
    at a quick rate. The production, processing, and administration of wine products
    may all benefit from the use of ML approaches that provide accurate predictions.
    Thus, manufacturers’ production can be maintained at a cost-effective level for
    retailers, while retailers’ inventory can sufficiently fulfill consumer’s demand.
    6. Limitations and Future Works While this study endeavors to provide a comprehensive
    examination of the integration of BCT, IoT, and AI in the wine supply chain, certain
    limitations merit acknowledgment. These limitations, along with avenues for future
    research, are discussed below. Weaknesses Addressed: While the SLR approach was
    deemed appropriate for this academic research paper and was justified in the methodology
    section, we recognize the importance of empirical validation for the proposed
    framework. Practical cases have been integrated into the paper to provide real-world
    context and validation to address this concern. Additionally, the emphasis on
    technological solutions in the paper may have inadvertently overshadowed other
    critical aspects, such as regulatory, cultural, and economic factors integral
    to the wine supply chain. Although it is challenging to comprehensively cover
    all dimensions in a single paper, efforts have been made to shortly incorporate
    also these aspects. Remaining Limitations: One notable limitation is the absence
    of case studies or empirical data demonstrating the practical application and
    effectiveness of the proposed technologies in real-world scenarios. While the
    research is based on the SLR and proposes a theoretical framework, empirical validation
    through case studies is essential to ascertain its real-world applicability and
    effectiveness. This limitation has been acknowledged, and future research endeavors
    will focus on conducting empirical studies to validate the proposed framework.
    Future Research Directions: Future research endeavors will concentrate on several
    key areas to address the identified limitations and further advance the understanding
    and application of BCT, IoT and AI in the wine supply chain moving forward. These
    include the following: Conducting case studies or empirical studies to validate
    the proposed framework in real-world settings, thereby demonstrating its practical
    application and effectiveness. Exploring the regulatory landscape surrounding
    the adoption of BCT, IoT, and AI in the wine industry, considering factors such
    as data privacy, security, and compliance with industry standards and regulations.
    Investigating the cultural and economic implications of integrating these technologies
    into the wine supply chain, including stakeholder perceptions, adoption barriers,
    and economic feasibility. Continuously monitoring technological advancements and
    emerging trends in BCT, IoT and AI to ensure the proposed framework remains relevant
    and up-to-date. Furthermore, the use of deep learning and time series algorithms
    in more complex wine supply chain management scenarios with demands derived from
    actual data would be exciting to examine. Finally, while this study lays the groundwork
    for understanding the potential of BCT, IoT and AI in the wine supply chain, future
    research endeavors will focus on addressing the identified limitations and further
    exploring the multifaceted implications of integrating these technologies into
    the industry. Author Contributions Conceptualization, N.A. and C.T.; methodology,

    Abstract The optimization of irrigation in arboriculture holds crucial importance
    for effectively managing water resources in arid regions. This work introduces
    the development and implementation of an innovative solution named ‘Soqia’, a
    responsive WEB-GIS web application designed for real-time monitoring of the water
    status in arboriculture. This solution integrates meteorological data, remote
    sensing data, and ground sensor-collected data for precise irrigation management
    at the agricultural plot level. A range of features has been considered in the
    development of this WEB -GIS solution, ranging from visualizing vegetation indices
    to accessing current weather data, thereby contributing to more efficient irrigation
    management. Compared to other existing applications, ‘Soqia’ provides users with
    the current amount of water to irrigate, as well as an estimated amount for the
    next 8 days. Additionally, it offers spatio-temporal tracking of vegetation indices
    provided as maps and graphs. The importance of the Soqia solution at the national
    level is justified by the scarcity of water resources due to increasingly frequent
    and intense drought seasons for the past years. Low rainfall is recorded in all
    national agricultural areas. The implemented prototype is a first step toward
    the development of future innovative tools aimed at improving water management

    indices 1. Introduction Water represents an essential need for human beings, vital
    for hydration, sanitation, and hygiene, playing a crucial role in the preservation
    of life and human health [1]. The report released by the World Meteorological
    Organization provides an alarming overview of the consequences of climate, environmental,
    and social changes on the planet’s water reserves. This report highlights below-average
    precipitation in extensive regions worldwide, influenced by climate change and
    various other factors [2]. And the same goes for Morocco where water resources
    are limited, posing a significant challenge to agricultural productivity [3].
    Globally, water usage is typically distributed across three sectors: industry
    (20%), domestic needs (10%), and agriculture (70%). These proportions vary significantly
    based on the development level of countries. In Morocco, over 87% of freshwater
    is allocated to agriculture [4]. In this context, the major challenge for the
    coming decades lies in the need to increase food production while using less water,
    requiring an improvement in irrigation efficiency [5]. Irrigation, defined as
    the intentional application of water to cultivated land, aims to address deficits
    in precipitation and/or soil water reserves, promoting optimal plant growth [6].
    This practice involves the artificial distribution of water to offset soil moisture
    deficits, enhance environmental conditions, and apply nutrients and phytopharmaceutical
    products [7]. Precision irrigation has emerged as a promising solution to achieve
    this goal. It aims to provide the exact amount of water needed, tailored to the
    specific needs of crops. However, its implementation requires a better understanding
    of crop conditions and anticipation of water needs. It is in this context that
    the emergence of digital solutions becomes crucial to support farmers in managing
    irrigation [8]. Examples of these applications are presented in Table 1, where
    we compare services provided by each application, input data used, and crop types
    targeted. Strengths and weaknesses of these applications were identified by examining
    descriptions and documentations and considering user reviews. In computer science,
    an application is a program developed for a specific task, whether it involves
    calculations, management, or entertainment [9]. Many digital irrigation applications
    have been developed. A review can be found in [10,11]. In the present study, applications
    listed in Table 2 have been thoroughly tested and analyzed based on users’ experience.
    Most of the applications were downloaded on our devices to be tested and evaluated.
    However, for applications that were inaccessible for download, the analyses were
    carried out based on available sources such as commercial description and users’
    feedback. Table 1. Examples of spatio-temporal monitoring and farm advisory solutions
    for irrigation.            Table 2. Critical comparison of existing solutions.
    This literature review shows that two types of applications can be distinguished
    in our context: Mobile GIS Application: A Mobile GIS application is specifically
    designed for use on mobile devices such as smartphones or tablets. It is optimized
    for a user experience on small touchscreen displays [15]. Mobile GIS applications
    are typically downloaded and installed on mobile devices from application stores
    (such as Apple’s App Store or Google Play Store for Android) [16]. They may have
    features specific to mobility, such as field data collection, real-time GPS navigation,
    geolocation. Mobile GIS applications often operate in offline mode, but they can
    also function in both modes simultaneously, referred to as hybrid Mobile GIS applications.
    Web GIS Application: A Web GIS app (or web-based GIS application) is a web application
    accessible via a web browser on any Internet-connected device, whether it be a
    desktop computer, laptop, tablet, or smartphone. It is designed to be used on
    screens of various sizes, usually being responsive and automatically adapting
    to the screen resolution of the device in use [18]. Unlike Mobile GIS applications,
    Web GIS apps generally do not require installation on the device. Users access
    them by entering a URL into a web browser. They provide the flexibility to access
    geospatial data from anywhere with an Internet connection. Based on the literature
    review of existing solutions, only a few applications are designed for arboriculture
    and offer multiple services simultaneously, which makes irrigation management
    difficult. This study aims to propose and develop an innovative Web GIS solution
    named ‘Soqia’ for the dynamic monitoring of the water status of fruit trees, providing
    farmers with crucial tools for effective irrigation management. The resulting
    application focuses on an optimal user experience. This Web GIS solution addresses
    the following two major challenges: spatio-temporal monitoring of trees’ status
    and the optimal estimation of tree water needs. The next sections of the article
    are structured as follows: the description of the application architecture, implementation
    of the solution, validation, discussion, and conclusion. 2. Material and Methods
    Soqia is characterized by serving as a decision-making solution, providing users
    with real-time and 8-day water irrigation forecasts, along with advanced spatio-temporal
    tracking of vegetation indices through interactive maps and graphs. Unlike other
    applications, Soqia uniquely integrates these features, offering users a comprehensive
    tool for making well-informed and timely decisions regarding the amount of water
    to irrigate. 2.1. Description of the Application Architecture The proposed architecture
    takes into consideration the prerequisites for an optimal management of irrigation
    in terms of, namely, Monitoring the soil and crop hydric status during the whole
    crop cycle. Real-time monitoring allows for an appropriate estimate of the crop
    water need and thus an optimal timing for water supply. Adjusting water supply
    to phenological stages. Collecting daily weather conditions (temperature, humidity,
    wind speed, radiation) from the closest metrological station in order to estimate
    daily evapotranspiration on a daily and weekly basis. Using a meteorological database
    to obtain forecasts using APIs for short-term agricultural activity planning.
    A three- to seven-day forecast has proven to be the ideal situation farmers are
    looking for to prevent adverse effects of water stress on crops. The estimation
    of daily crop evapotranspiration. This information is crucial for ensuring adequate
    irrigation. Estimating weekly crop evapotranspiration: Users also require an estimate
    of weekly crop evapotranspiration to have visibility of irrigation requirements.
    The approach adopted for the implementation of the irrigation monitoring solution
    relies on a mobile application accessible via the web. Regarding the selection
    of a web application, it greatly facilitates the distribution and updating of
    the application. Users can access it through a simple web browser, eliminating
    the need to install native applications. Furthermore, the web application ensures
    a consistent experience regardless of the device used, whether it is a smartphone
    or a tablet, and regardless of the device’s operating system (iOS or Android).
    A variety of development tools are combined to ensure the smooth functioning of
    the application. A database was created using Timescale, a time series database
    [19], and PostGIS, a spatial database extension for PostgreSQL [20], each bringing
    specific advantages for storing our data. For full-stack development, we used
    React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces [21], and Node.js with
    Express for the backend. Node.js is a runtime environment that allows the execution
    of JavaScript code server-side. Express is a web application framework for Node.js,
    simplifying server-side development [22,23]. For PostGIS, the map server used
    is Geoserver, which allowed the display geospatial data on the base map using
    the OpenLayers library [24], responsible for displaying interactive maps in web
    applications. It is used to integrate OpenStreetMap cartographic data into a web
    application [25]. Various available data sources are used to feed our application.
    Soil temperature and humidity sensors provide real-time data on local conditions,
    while Google Earth Engine and the APIs of OpenWeatherMap and WeatherBit supply
    our application with meteorological and geospatial information [26,27]. The Figure
    1 illustrates the technical architecture of the solution proposed as ‘Soqia’:
    Figure 1. Technical architecture of the application. Data required to implement
    the proposed solution include Real-time soil temperature; Real-time soil humidity;
    Satellite imagery to extract vegetation index data (NDVI, SAVI, EVI, NDMI, and
    NDWI); Geospatial data of the orchard, i.e., the geometries of the orchard components;
    Daily meteorological data (air temperature, air humidity, precipitation, wind
    speed); Weekly weather forecasts for the orchard area; Measured evapotranspiration
    if available; Specific crop parameters for estimating water needs (e.g., crop
    cultural coefficient Kc). The use case diagram summarizing the functionalities
    of ‘Soqia’ application is presented in Figure 2. Figure 2. Use case diagram. The
    use case diagram illustrates user–system interaction, user types, and their interactions
    in a system [28]. The interaction with the application begins with authentication,
    where the user enters their username and password to access the application. Once
    logged in, the user can navigate between the various services provided by the
    application. The functionalities include The visualization of vegetation index
    maps; The visualization of index evolution charts; The visualization of soil parameters;
    Access to current weather data; The visualization of weather forecasts; The estimation
    of daily evapotranspiration; The visualization of evapotranspiration forecasts;
    The estimation and visualization of tree water requirements. 2.2. Implementation
    of the Solution Prototype 2.2.1. Presentation of the Study Area The study area
    is a farm in the Kasbah of Ait Aammour located in Azrou, north of Morocco (coordinates:
    Lat = 33°25′02″ N, long = 5°17′27″ W). The farm covers an area of approximately
    10 hectares and consists mainly of apple and pear trees, home to different varieties:
    Jérémine, Gala, Rienders, Harrow, and Harrow Sweet. The plot is spatially subdivided
    into four sectors. Figure 3 shows the location and boundaries of the farm. Figure
    3. Location and boundaries of the study area. The farm is divided into two apple
    blocks, one featuring the Jéromine variety in 26 rows and the other featuring
    Gala in 26 rows, both with 4 m spacing between successive rows. There is also
    a pear block consisting of 22 rows, with a variety planted every 4 rows: Harrow,
    Harrow Sweet, and HW623. In the first 11 rows, half of them are occupied by another
    variety, which is Karmine. At the parcel level, there are two soil temperature
    and humidity sensors and a weather station: One sensor is in the Jéromine variety
    block of the apple orchard; Another sensor is placed in the Gala variety block
    of the apple orchard; The weather station is installed at the head station; The
    following diagram (Figure 4) illustrates the devices installed on the farm and
    the measurements they collect: Figure 4. Illustration of the devices installed
    on the farm. The farm is equipped with a drip irrigation system that uses a well
    as its main water source. It also has a water storage basin and uses photovoltaic
    panels to power the pumps and head station. 2.2.2. Data, Databases, Languages,
    and Platforms Used Available Data Regarding the available data for the case study,
    we initially had ground sensors in place. Two sensors were installed to measure
    and record soil temperature and humidity every 15 min. Currently, these data are
    accessible on the farm website. These data serve as test data. A direct connection
    between the sensors and the database enables displaying the data on the user interface
    and updating it automatically every 15 min. A weather station was initially installed
    to collect data such as air temperature, air humidity, wind speed, solar radiation,
    and atmospheric pressure. We sought an alternative source of meteorological data,
    namely, websites offering APIs for various weather services. In our case, we used
    the platforms “OpenWeatherMap” and “WeatherBit”. We employed several types of
    APIs, including the current weather conditions’ API, weather forecast API, and
    evapotranspiration forecast API. For “OpenWeatherMap”, we exclusively utilized
    free APIs, such as humidity forecasts. Concerning WeatherBit, we utilized the
    API named “Ag-Weather Forecast API”, providing an 8-day forecast of meteorological
    data specific to the agricultural industry. Regarding the information provided
    by the APIs, when using daily data, the measurements are instantaneous. However,
    when it comes to forecasted data, both weather information and estimated water
    quantity are projected with a frequency of at least three forecasts per day for
    the next eight days. Additionally, we accessed other data sources, notably the
    Google Earth Engine platform, which houses an extensive cloud-based database containing
    thousands of satellite images and geospatial data. These images proved to be valuable
    for extracting vegetation indices for the study area over the required period
    of time. Database Design Design of the logical model or class diagram constitutes
    the first step in the development process. The logical model helps define key
    entities, their relationships, and associated attributes, providing a structured
    and comprehensive view of the system. Creating this model upfront establishes
    a solid foundation for the future design of the database, facilitating an understanding
    of interactions between the components. It is truly the cornerstone upon which
    all subsequent stages of database development rest, underscoring its pivotal role
    in the effective planning and implementation of any data management system. Figure
    5 below shows the class diagram for the databases. This diagram depicts the farm
    entities and their associated relationships and attributes. Its creation was made
    possible using StarUML software version 5.1.0: Figure 5. Class diagram of our
    databases (the symbol ‘1..*’ represents a multiplicity where there is at least
    one instance of the associated class, but there may be several). Each class in
    the diagram corresponds to a distinct entity within the farm. The hypertables
    added to the Timescale database are as follows: C_Data and S_Data. The first represents
    the hypertable of data collected by each sensor, while the second symbolizes data
    recorded by the weather station. The remaining classes are stored in another database,
    namely, PostGIS. In the context of the spatio-temporal tracking application for
    arboriculture, we employed Timescale to store real-time sensor data. This Time-Series
    Database (TSDB) is an optimal choice for various reasons, including relational
    capabilities, high performance, scalability, data compression, and compatibility
    [29]. The central principle of TimescaleDB is based on hypertables, which are
    singular tables providing a simplified view for users. In practical terms, hypertables
    serve as a virtual representation of multiple individual tables, with each table
    containing sets of data known as “chunks.” Hypertables can be one-dimensional
    or two-dimensional and are capable of aggregating data based on time intervals
    or “partition key” values [29]. We also opted to use PostGIS to store entities
    with the “geometry” attribute, which encompasses location and boundary information.
    This allowed us to represent real-world objects as points, lines, or polygons
    in our database, introducing a spatial dimension to our data. PostGIS is an extension
    of the PostgreSQL database that expands its support to geographic and geospatial
    data, enabling us to store, query, and manipulate entities associated with geographical
    positions [24]. The approach involved stores geospatial data in PostGIS, creating
    temporary data with QGIS, importing it into PostGIS, publishing it online using
    GeoServer, and displaying it on the collaborative OpenStreetMap (OSM) using the
    OpenLayers library. This method enriched the spatio-temporal orchard tracking
    application by adding an essential geospatial dimension, providing users with
    an interactive experience. The logic of displaying geospatial data on a base map
    is illustrated in Figure 6: Figure 6. Overlaying geospatial data on an OpenLayers
    map. Platforms and Development Languages Used Development platforms and languages
    used include the Google Earth Engine platform, React and JavaScript library for
    building user interfaces, and Node.js with Express for the backend. Visual Studio
    Code was used as a primary development environment. 2.2.3. Key Steps The implementation
    process was divided into several essential steps summarized in Figure 7: Figure
    7. Key stages of implementation. Here is an overview of these key steps: Creation
    of Data with QGIS: The process began with the manual creation of provisional data
    using QGIS, representing spatial entities such as plots, sectors, and pumps. These
    data served as a foundation for testing our solution and defining the spatial
    entities to be visualized later on in the map; Integration of Data into Respective
    Databases: The generated data were integrated into the appropriate databases.
    Data from soil temperature and humidity sensors were stored in TimescaleDB, while
    spatial entities with geometric attributes were stored in PostGIS, providing management
    and querying capabilities for spatial data; Use of a Hybrid Database: We adopted
    a hybrid approach using TimescaleDB as an extension of PostgreSQL to manage sensor
    data. This combination offered the flexibility of JSONB storage for unstructured
    data while maintaining the power of SQL for structured data management; Server
    Connection to Databases: A robust connection between servers and databases was
    established to ensure real-time data retrieval. GeoServer was paired with PostGIS
    to broadcast spatial entities on the map, while Node.js was used to connect to
    TimescaleDB and manage environmental data; Testing of GIS-related Code with OpenStreetMap
    and GeoServer: We evaluated the Geographic Information System (GIS) part using
    OpenStreetMap as the map base and integrating spatial entities stored in GeoServer.
    This approach resulted in an interactive map displaying selected elements; Calculation
    and Visualization of Vegetation Indices with Google Earth Engine: We used Google
    Earth Engine, a cloud-based platform for a planetary-scale environmental data
    analysis and geospatial processing [30], to generate classification maps and charts
    representing orchard health by calculating various vegetation indices. This included
    importing data, processing satellite images, calculating indices, and visualizing
    them on maps. Here is a diagram (Figure 8) illustrating the main steps, all performed
    in the Earth Engine Code Editor platform: Figure 8. Main steps for creating vegetation
    index maps and graphs. In Table 3, the definitions and the mathematical formula
    of these indices are presented. In addition, this table highlights how each index
    can assist farmers in optimizing the water used in irrigation: Table 3. Overview
    of vegetation indices provided by Soqia. These vegetation indices can be used
    by the farmer to optimize the quantity of water use for irrigation by visualizing
    and analyzing graphs and maps of these indices provided by Soqia. NDVI, SAVI,
    and EVI can help evaluate the health, vigor, and density of vegetation. By monitoring
    these indices over time, the farmer can identify areas where vegetation is stressed
    or sparse, indicating potential water needs. NDWI can be used to monitor the plant
    water content and detect the presence of water in soils or low-lying areas where
    water may accumulate, thus helping optimize irrigation by avoiding areas with
    a high value of soil moisture. NDMI can help evaluate moisture content, enabling
    the farmer to identify areas requiring additional irrigation. Integration of Daily
    and Weekly Meteorological Data Using OWM and WeatherBit APIs: Meteorological data
    were extracted from the OpenWeatherMap and WeatherBit platforms using their respective
    APIs. The APIs define how software components should interact, facilitating communication
    and integration between systems [36]. They were integrated into the front-end
    of the application, customizing how meteorological data are displayed. APIs provide
    us with information about weather conditions and other parameters, from which
    we calculate evapotranspiration, which is influenced by weather conditions, like
    solar radiation, air temperature, humidity, and wind speed, and varies with the
    crop type, variety, and development stage, even under similar environmental conditions
    due to specific characteristics [37]; Integration and Visualization of Soil Data
    in the Application: The data stored in TimescaleDB were accessible via a REST
    API, enabling communication between the front-end (built in React) and the backend
    (built in Node.js). The Single-Page Application (SPA), a web app that loads a
    single HTML page and updates dynamically for a seamless experience [38], was utilized
    to display and visualize data on the user interface, providing an interactive
    and smooth user experience; The following diagram (Figure 9) outlines the steps
    of Client-Side Rendering, a web development approach where the browser processes
    and renders content, reducing server involvement [39], (CSR: React in our case)
    to communicate with the server and visualize data (taking the example of the URL
    ‘localhost/Sensor01’, corresponding to the visualization of soil data from sensor
    n° 01): Figure 9. Steps for visualizing data stored in TimescaleDB (sensor example
    n° 01). 3. Results and Validation In this section, we will delve into each aspect
    of the application developed, from the initial access point to the detailed visualization
    of agricultural data. The application’s user manual can be found in Appendix A.
    Access Page (Figure 10a): This segment focuses on the access page of the application,
    emphasizing its crucial role in user interaction. Users input their credentials
    (username and password) to gain entry to the application. Upon successful authentication,
    they are directed to the home page; otherwise, an error message is displayed.
    Home page (Figure 10b): The home page is defined as the users’ initial impression.
    It showcases a map centered on the farm, a marker for the centroid, and a navigation
    bar to access various functionalities. Figure 10. (a) Access page; (b) home page.
    3. Service n° 1 (Figure 11 and Figure 12): Spatio-Temporal Monitoring of Vegetation
    Indices. This section focuses on visualizing classification maps of vegetation
    indices such as NDVI, SAVI, EVI, NDMI, and NDWI, along with their temporal evolution
    graphs. The user selects a date between July 1st and November 1st to display corresponding
    maps, classified into three palettes reflecting the level of index activity in
    a given area. Interactive tools like DateSlider and the Layers menu facilitate
    navigation and exploration. Figure 11. Interface for vegetation index classification
    maps (Green: high value, Yellow: medium value, Red: low value). Figure 12. Vegetation
    index time series. 4. Service n° 2: Dashboards for sensor data (Figure 13). This
    section looks at the detailed dashboards for data collected by the JEROMINE and
    GALA sensors. Temperature and soil moisture graphs display variations over the
    past 24 h, with a recording frequency of 15 min. Interactive bars provide a user-friendly
    representation of values and allow points to be selected for precise information.
    Figure 13. Dashboard screen for sensor 1. The red box at the top left indicates
    that clicking on the graph allows users to view the exact time of recording and
    the corresponding values for soil temperature and moisture. 5. Service n° 3: Current
    Weather Conditions Consultation (Figure 14). This section explains how users can
    access current weather conditions. A MapBox map displays the plot boundaries with
    meteorological information, including air temperature, air humidity, wind speed.
    These data empower farmers to make informed decisions for their agricultural activities.
    Figure 14. Weather Conditions Consultation. 6. Service n° 4: Visualization of
    Downloaded Weather Forecast Data (Figure 15, Figure 16 and Figure 17). This service
    provides farmers with comprehensive forecasts of future weather conditions for
    the next 8 days. The data include air temperature, air humidity, wind speed. Clear
    and interactive graphs enable users to review the values of each variable and
    adjust their irrigation schemes accordingly. It is important to note that the
    forecasting of meteorological data comes from available APIs, namely, WeatherBit
    and OpenWeatherMap. Each website employs a combination of numerical weather prediction
    models to generate these forecasts such as GFS, and ECMWF [40]. Figure 15. Page
    1 of the service screen 4 (Weather Forecast: Temperature and Humidity). Figure
    16. Page 2 of the service screen 4 (Weather Forecast: Wind speed, Ground pressure
    and Precipitation). Figure 17. Page 3 of the service screen 4 (Weather Forecast:
    Solar Radiation). 7. Service n° 5: Visualization of Downloaded Evapotranspiration
    Forecasts (Figure 18). This section illustrates how the application visualizes
    daily and weekly forecasts of reference and crop evapotranspiration. These data
    are crucial for optimal irrigation. Farmers can plan water quantities based on
    weekly forecasts and adjust their irrigation schemes accordingly. Figure 18. Service
    screen 5 (Evapotranspiration estimation). 8. Service n° 6: Visualization of Geospatial
    Data on OpenStreetMap (Figure 19). This service enables users to explore the geographical
    entities of the farm by integrating stored information with OpenStreetMap mapping.
    Users can precisely select the specific entity they wish to examine. It is important
    to note that the results of this phase have not been integrated into the final
    application due to constraints related to the quality of geospatial data. Figure
    19. Farm component mapping interface. 4. Discussion The main objective of ‘Soqia’,
    the SIG-Web solution developed in this study, was to meet the specific needs of
    farmers for irrigation management and decision making based on weather and agronomic
    data. In light of the needs defined by users at the beginning and thereafter,
    how services are provided by the application effectively meets these needs: -
    Track the soil water status during the crop growing period: The soil parameter
    visualization service, including temperature and humidity, provides farmers with
    the ability to monitor these parameters in real-time and take relevant actions.
    The data recorded in the database are transmitted in real-time from the sensor
    to the database. - Diagnose fruit growth phases in orchards: Visualization services
    for vegetation indices’ classification maps and indices’ evolution graphs meet
    this need. Farmers can assess the condition of trees in different parts of the
    orchard and track seasonal changes to assess the crop status, density, and growth.
    - View daily weather conditions: The current weather data viewing service provides
    farmers with real-time access to crucial weather information for planning agricultural
    activities. - Visualize forecast weather data: The service for displaying weather
    forecasts over a period of 7 days meets this need by providing reliable data to
    anticipate short-term weather conditions and allow optimal irrigation scheduling.
    - Estimate the daily crop evapotranspiration: The daily evapotranspiration display
    service provides farmers with estimates of the water requirements of the trees,
    which is also essential for optimal irrigation scheduling. - Estimate weekly crop
    evapotranspiration (forecasts): The weekly crop evapotranspiration forecast visualization
    service allows farmers to plan water distribution strategically for each week.
    In light of the services provided by the solution in relation to the needs we
    have defined in collaboration with users, it is clear that the solution responds
    effectively and relevantly to the needs of farmers. Each service has been carefully
    designed and tested to specifically target identified needs. The solution provides
    tailored tools to support irrigation planning and decision making. These innovative
    tools bring significant value to the developed solution compared to platforms
    previously tested. However, it should be noted that there are external data used,
    such as the installed farm sensors’ data and the weather station data. The services
    rely on accurate and continuous data, which directly impact the quality of the
    information and services available for users. One of the key features that gives
    distinctive value to the developed solution is its ability to provide evapotranspiration
    forecasts as well as detailed weather data. This element is a real support in
    the field, given that the majority of similar platforms focus on real-time monitoring
    rather than prediction. Another added value that distinguishes the solution is
    its ability to offer rich and informative visualization in the form of classification
    maps and graphs for different periods. This functionality provides tremendous
    value because it addresses a unique and often overlooked need of farmers in the
    field. Unlike most solutions available on the market, which mainly focus on presenting
    dashboards, the developed solution provides a visual representation of the spatio-temporal
    distribution of vegetation indices. ‘Soqia’ is a SIG-Web solution developed in
    cooperation with farmers and professionals to provide irrigation support for arboriculture,
    taking into account the actual needs, and offers relevant information for users
    presented in a simple understandable form. The solution needs information of the
    farm equipment and data from field sensors and a meteorological station to run.
    The more information is accurate, the more reliable the outputs will be. To evaluate
    its performance, ‘Soqia’ was implemented and tested on a demonstrative case study.
    The results are very encouraging. More tests are undergoing to assess the performance
    in large areas. The solution was developed using accessible and flexible environment
    tools. It is a result of a partnership between the research community and professionals.
    The services were developed based on irrigation advisors and farmers’ needs and
    suggestions to meet their irrigation scheduling. More tests and developments are
    needed to overcome current limitations and to estimate recommendations more aligned
    with irrigation water management requirements. The GIS-WEB solution for spatio-temporal
    monitoring remains of paramount importance in irrigation, given its advantages
    and its ability to support farmers in improving their yields, while reducing the
    consumption of water necessary for irrigation. This solution plays a central role
    in the evolution toward more intelligent, sustainable, and efficient agricultural
    management. ‘Soqia’ offers various services and has several characteristics. However,
    it remains unfinished. More attention in the future developments must tackle more
    options for expanding data collection capabilities, as well as the management
    of the components of the farm. The GIS components need improvements to integrate
    drone imagery and explore the capabilities of artificial intelligence for a more
    spatial and predictive analysis and thereby contributing to sustainable agricultural
    production. 5. Conclusions This study proposes a promising solution for irrigation
    monitoring, enabling farmers and orchard managers to make informed decisions regarding
    irrigation and crop management. This work aimed to improve the management of fruit
    tree orchards by developing a responsive GIS-WEB solution for spatio-temporal
    irrigation monitoring. The state of the art reveals the growing importance of
    spatio-temporal orchard monitoring solutions and associated technologies. The
    developed solution, ‘Soqia’, provides support to farmers based on the field status,
    daily and weekly evapotranspiration estimations, as well as daily and weekly weather
    data. The solution also offers a rich and informative visualization of the soil
    and trees’ status in the form of classification maps and graphs for different
    periods as well as a visual representation of the spatial–temporal distribution
    of vegetation indices. Time series vegetation indices’ maps and graphs are calculated
    based on multispectral satellite images. The contribution of the Soqia solution
    to improve the management of irrigation at the orchard level fits perfectly with
    the objectives of the national agricultural development strategy, which aims,
    among other things, at the promotion of digital technologies for the improvement
    in farmers’ working conditions, the increase in farms’ profitability, and the
    rationalizing of the use of water resources in a context of climate change. The
    solution is continuously improved based on users’ experience and recommendations.
    Aspects of improvements include more data collection capabilities, the extension
    of options related to the management of the components of the farm, drone images’
    integration, advanced forecast capabilities and a spatial analysis using machine
    learning techniques, and the addition of the ‘notifications’ feature to the application
    to keep the user informed of any updates. In addition, we suggest considering
    the integration of dendrometers alongside the currently emphasized tensiometers.
    This would broaden the range of compatible sensors and extend the application’s
    utility, particularly in the context of arboriculture. Additionally, we recommend
    a further exploration of the correlation between evapotranspiration and soil water
    percolation. Recognizing the pivotal role of this relationship in water management
    for arboriculture, delving deeper into these connections, will contribute to a
    more comprehensive and effective solution in future developments. Author Contributions

    the steps for connecting and using the application, accompanied by subtitles to
    facilitate a clearer understanding of each topic. ▪ Login: To log in, simply enter
    the username and password. Figure A1. Access page. As illustrated in the above
    figure, this initial interface serves as the entry point for our application.
    It is the login page where users need to provide their credentials, namely, their
    username and password. If the data are valid, access is granted directly to the
    home page. Otherwise, an error message appears on the screen, indicating that
    either the password, the username, or both are incorrect. ▪ Navigate the application:
    Once you have logged in, you can navigate through the various application windows
    and consult all the services on offer. To view information about the farm or the
    daily weather forecast, simply click on the ‘location’ icon, and the text window
    (containing the information) will appear. For other services, on the other hand,
    the information is displayed directly as soon as you click on the service in question.
    Figure A2. Home page. In the above figure, the home page features a ‘MapBox’ map
    centered on our farm. At the center of this map, a marker symbolizes the centroid
    of the farm. A simple click on this marker triggers the automatic display of a
    pop-up window containing general information about the orchard, such as coordinates,
    area, and types of crops. At the bottom of the page, brief text is accompanied
    by a “Logout” button to exit the application. At the top of the interface, a horizontal
    bar allows navigation between the various screens of the application. Each screen
    in this bar offers a specific functionality. Figure A3. Weather consultation.
    In the center of this page, a MapBox map is displayed, overlaid with a geojson
    file illustrating the parcel boundaries in the form of a blue polygon. The polygon
    is centered by a marker. By clicking on this marker, a pop-up window appears,
    displaying the day’s meteorological information: air temperature, air humidity,
    wind speed, atmospheric pressure at sea level and on the ground, sunrise and sunset
    times, as well as the climatic situation (sunny, clear skies, clouds, etc.). Figure
    A4. (a) Interface for vegetation index classification maps; (b) index graph interface.
    This section presents the visualization of vegetation index classification maps
    and evolution graphs for an in-depth understanding of these indices over time.
    Using the “DateSlider” tool and once the date has been selected, the corresponding
    index cards will be displayed automatically. Figure A5. Dashboard screen (sensor
    1). As illustrated in the figure above, on the “Capt01” screen dedicated to “sensor
    n° 1”, the user can access real-time data collected by the sensor installed in
    the “JEREMINE” apple orchard. Temperature and soil humidity graphs clearly display
    variations over the past 24 h, given the frequency of recording every 15 min.
    The user can examine all 96 recent data points for each parameter. In addition,
    an interactive bar (indicated by a red rectangle) offers a more user-friendly
    representation of values, with the precise time of each reading when a point on
    the graph is selected. Finally, two horizontal red lines are present in the temperature
    and soil moisture graphs. In the first graph, the red line symbolizes the minimum
    temperature (2 °C), below which the irrigation of apple trees is not recommended.
    The second red line in the second graph represents the maximum moisture threshold
    (70%), above which excess water is avoided for good soil condition. The same elements
    from the dashboard of the first sensor are present in the dashboard of the second
    sensor, GALA, except for the values, which change due to the difference in location.

    estimation service. Figure A8. Page 3 of weather estimation service. In this service,
    we provide users with short-term weather forecasts. The following is worth knowing:
    ▪ Air temperature; ▪ Air humidity; ▪ Wind speed; ▪ Ground pressure; ▪ Accumulated
    precipitation; ▪ Outgoing solar radiation (LongWave); ▪ Incoming solar radiation
    (ShortWave); Figure A9. Evapotranspiration estimation. This service presents future
    values of reference evapotranspiration (ETo) and crop evapotranspiration (ETc)
    for the next 8 days. It also provides the corresponding values for the current
    day (daily). The graphs at the top allow the user to easily observe and understand
    the ETo and ETc forecasts. By clicking on a point on the graph, a small pop-up
    window displays the values and the time of the forecast. At the bottom of the
    page, the current day’s values for these two parameters are displayed. References

    intelligenceSmart agricultureSustainable production 1. Introduction Agricultural
    crop production and its management is a challenging task due to variations in
    environmental factors, soil factors, and water quality-related parameters worldwide.
    Due to the increasing population and changing environmental scenario day by day,
    high agricultural production per unit hectare is required globally ([8]; [22]).
    The phenomenon of climate change is a result of the environmental stress caused
    by an expanding population and numerous industries, especially agriculture. Several
    human acts lead to land deterioration, affecting crop quality, chemical pollution
    causes dead zone conditions and endangers marine life. Thus, the use of the smart
    application in agriculture may be crucial in offering viable solutions to significant
    problems like disease and pest infestations, insufficient biological application,
    incorrect water application and elimination, weed management, and yield forecasting
    ([7]; [29]; [70]). Crop protection activities against climate change, soil nutrients,
    land suitability, cultivation practices, method of cultivation, artificial nutrients
    applications, water management, etc. can enhance the production yield. Although
    the use of agrochemicals can efficiently boost crop yield and quality, it has
    also increased environmental challenges in recent years. Overdose of pesticides/fertilizers
    or poor spraying equipment during chemical plant protection operations can have
    major consequences for human health and the environment. The implementation of
    technological communication to manage agricultural operations using mechanization
    and automation was defined as smart cultivation or farming by ([58]). In the case
    of developing countries with densely crowded areas, when enlarging land space
    for agriculture and crop protection practices is difficult, the only option is
    to become smarter in the technology used in agriculture through the use of cutting-edge
    technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence
    (AI). They have already started capitalizing across all industries including agriculture.
    Artificial intelligence (AI) is “the science and engineering of making intelligent
    machines, brilliant computer programs,” according to Professor McCarthy. For many
    years, basic artificial intelligence has been provided by governed programs that
    exhibit a fundamental kind of “intelligence” under particular conditions ([56];
    [19]). Advancements in these digital technologies have made revolutionary changes
    in agriculture by providing smart systems that can monitor, control, and visualize
    various farm operations in real-time and with comparable intelligence to human
    experts ([71]). Better insights may be produced from data obtained in the field
    by using digital technologies such as AI and IoT-based applications, allowing
    farming techniques to be planned efficiently with minimum manual work. These technologies
    reduce the risk of managing the field during bad weather conditions and also provide
    profit to farmers during a shortage of labor. An electrically controlled delivery
    system was developed by Giles and Wunderlich for spraying beneficial insect eggs.
    It can release large droplets with the help of a pulse-width modulated valve that
    can monitor the application rate and the spacing between the discharged eggs ([25]).
    IoT has been used in several areas recently, including institutional management
    practices ([74]), medical ([84]), home automation ([67]; [46]), smart cities ([3];
    [15]), energy optimization ([48]), self-driving automobiles ([61]), intelligent
    farming ([76]; [43]), and transportation ([69]). Fig. 1 presents an extensive
    and diversified example of IoT applications in the field of agriculture for smart
    farming. Download : Download high-res image (544KB) Download : Download full-size

    According to [77], smart farming is a method of improving productivity while lowering
    production costs. It accomplishes this by gathering a variety of data, integrating
    many technologies, and performing thorough analysis. With the increasing youth
    movement to urban areas and the utilization of land for quick expansion instead
    of agricultural production, there are fewer human resources available for agricultural
    development. To satisfy the demand for food, the majority of agricultural tasks
    must be mechanized. The aforementioned problems with agriculture and food supply
    may be resolved by IoT and similar techniques ([41]; [43]; [73]). Many research
    studies focus on various smart applications in the agriculture sector, whereas
    at present, farmers are unaware of these recent technologies and practices. The
    basic knowledge of adopting an appropriate smart technology and its applications
    with working conditions for sustainable production is still not very clear. However,
    it is necessary to provide systematic information on the advantages and uses of
    various methods in smart farming with proper understanding to get the maximum
    benefit from an economic and management perspective. The present study identifies
    and extracts meaningful information about smart technologies and other mobile
    applications, i.e., chatbot systems utilized for smart farming. Keeping in mind
    the above-mentioned facts, the major objectives of this paper are: • To examine
    current developments in smart applications using IoT and AI technology for agriculture.
    • To highlight issues and challenges particularly related to networking and open-source
    programs for smart agriculture • To evaluate the agricultural development from
    the ancient age to the present era. • To draw attention to the trends and prospects
    in smart agriculture. 1.1. Paper representation This paper is organized as follows:

    systems used in smart agriculture. A detailed summary of the advantages of IoT
    technology in the agriculture sector is discussed in Section 4. Section 5 highlights
    future research directions and examines some of the challenges that emerging innovations
    in the agriculture sector are facing. Section 6 discusses the conclusion of this
    paper, including the authors'' perspectives on the subject of the study and potential
    directions for further research. 2. Smart farming towards: agriculture 4.0 and
    5.0 To meet the worldwide challenge during the twenty-first century, a major agricultural
    revolution is required, one that will allow technology to increase productivity
    while ensuring sustainability in the environment. The term “Agriculture 4.0” refers
    to the fourth agricultural revolution, which makes use of digital technology and
    aims to transform the industry into one that is more environmentally conscious,
    intelligent, and productive ([37]; [36]). With the application of Agriculture
    4.0 technology, farmers may cultivate their land more methodically and accurately
    predict the results. The practice of effective precision farming requires the
    use of Agriculture 4.0 technology to achieve its maximum potential. The infrastructure
    for connected farming must be based on real-time data and cover a large area,
    based on the requirements of the agricultural operation and the goal of IoT implementation
    ([36]; [37]). The goal of Agriculture 4.0 is not only to transform agri-food systems
    but also to enhance the methods of cultivation. The agriculture food supply chain
    (AFSC) refers to the chain of events that starts with the creation of farming
    goods and ends with their delivery to the customer who purchases them ([22]).
    Generally, the AFSC is made up of many organizations that handle manufacturing,
    processing, and promotional activities, including advertisement, marketing, and
    transportation ([37]; [56]; [4]). The necessity for agricultural systems to balance
    the environments that support our way of life with the production of sufficient
    quantities of wholesome, reasonably priced food is a significant challenge faced
    by civilization today. The Agriculture 4.0 application sector distributions are
    presented in Fig. 2. Download : Download high-res image (258KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 2. The Agriculture 4.0 application sector distributions.
    Agriculture 4.0 has four pillars, i.e., advancement, modern equipment used, scale-up
    data for supervision, and environmental sustainability for fruitful farming. The
    success of the Agriculture 4.0 system is contingent upon the quality of the data
    acquired, which is a fundamental component that spans all architectural levels
    ([31]). Agriculture 4.0 and its evolution as Agriculture 5.0 are resource-effective
    approaches to developing more advanced technologies in the agricultural environment.
    According to the theory of “Agriculture 5.0,” fields employ machinery that enables
    self-governing choices and unmanned operations using precision farming techniques.
    Therefore, the usage of robotics alongside a certain type of AI is implied by
    Agriculture 5.0. The evolution of agriculture from the ancient age to the modern
    era is shown in Fig. 3. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 3. Evolution of Agriculture from the Ancient Age to Modern
    era. The growth of Agriculture 5.0 demands the establishment of technological
    standards to ensure equipment compatibility. Since agricultural machinery lasts
    a long time, precautions are taken to guarantee that any technological advancement
    is supported by manufacturers and other sectors of the economy and remains compatible
    with updated machinery ([23]). The advancement in accurate weather forecasting
    and other environmental factors may be achieved with positioning technologies
    like global positioning systems (GPS), remote drones, and unmanned aerial vehicle
    (UAV) operations. The equipment for UAV applications plays a vital role in IoT
    and precision agriculture. It also examines the potential of UAV deployment situations
    in precision farming. These technological tools can support the “decision tree”
    both on the farm and outside of it. The farmers might decide more wisely, resulting
    in more output and lower waste. The primary concern with Agriculture 4.0 is the
    need for methods of communication and data exchange to link the many systems into
    a coherent system that addresses every aspect of agricultural exploitation. The
    ability of farmers to invest in and enhance farming practices is another crucial
    component in implementing Agriculture 5.0 ([23]; [68]). Also, farming is becoming
    immensely better because of the advancements in smart agriculture. 2.1. Smart
    applications in farming practices The agriculture industry has seen substantial
    technological advances over the past few decades. Modern technology is converting
    conventional agricultural concepts into smart agriculture. With the help of this
    technology, traditional agriculture has changed and is now more like a smart agricultural
    system ([44]). Indian farmers have currently started employing a method of farming
    known as “smart agriculture,” which is a combination of several smart technologies.
    The integration of wireless sensor networks for remote surveillance by technologies
    such as IoT enables a wide range of applications to provide their output more
    rapidly and precisely. India and other developing nations are in a position to
    quickly produce food supplies by implementing innovative technology. Numerous
    initiatives are based on smart sensor networks that collect information from various
    sensors linked to multiple hubs and relay it again via wireless communication
    networks. These technologies help in measuring, monitoring, and analyzing different
    processes of farming operations ([70]). The following is a list of some smart
    agricultural techniques: It is anticipated that these developments will become
    the cornerstones of the astute ranch. 2.1.1. Automatic irrigation practises Farmers
    may regulate the timing and amount of water that they produce by using smart irrigation
    application technology. The intricate IoT sensors have the potential to enable
    the cultivation framework to function autonomously, utilizing data from field-based
    sensors to adjust the water system ([64]). Among the many benefits of automated
    or controlled irrigation are increased accuracy, more economical utilization of
    water, and a decrease in human error ([10]). Artificial intelligence and fuzzy
    models hold promise for modeling complex systems in agriculture and forecasting
    unforeseen events like precipitation or water requirements for crop production
    ([29]). Farmers may gather and examine data in a smart agriculture system to fertilize
    and care for their crops. The smart agricultural system offers more precise and
    cost-effective methods for forecasting and safeguarding crop growth. By raising
    earnings, decreasing waste, enhancing efficiency, and becoming environmentally
    friendly, the agricultural business is becoming more digitalized by integrating
    various technologies. By assessing water quality and minimizing water waste, information
    technology-based smart farming practices may assist farmers in managing their
    water resources. Ingenious agricultural methods have the potential to assist in
    resolving the world''s most pressing issues and realize sustainable development
    targets ([72]). 2.1.2. Automated vehicle Farmers employ farm tractors for a variety
    of agricultural tasks. With time and advances (such as cameras and machine vision
    frameworks, GPS, IoT, and LiDAR), self-operated vehicles get more skilled and
    autonomous. These advancements ultimately reduce the need for human intervention
    to operate these devices efficiently ([28]). The probability of disaster is increased
    by the change in the environmental condition and its undefined nature. Therefore,
    intrinsic safety and dependability are crucial criteria for operating machines
    for field operations. Automation of machinery operated in farms, smart irrigation
    activities, protected cultivation, monitoring of the farmsteads, management of
    dairy farms, harvesting and threshing operations, storage structures, and transportation
    are all included in agricultural automation systems ([20]). Autonomous agricultural
    vehicles (AAVs) have become more and more significant in recent years, mostly
    because of advancements in the field of self-driving automobiles in the transportation
    sector ([45]). Throughout fieldwork, AAVs may encounter a range of climatic factors,
    including air temperature, air humidity, and field conditions. Furthermore, a
    lot of the non-linear behaviors displayed by these machines make it challenging
    to use traditional control techniques to manage them. Information and communication
    technologies (ICT) have been progressively integrated into AAVs because of their
    increasing level of sophistication. AAVs can be controlled remotely via wireless
    connections or through controlled network systems found in vehicles, such as CANbus-based
    networks ([24]). 2.1.3. Drone applications in agriculture Drones have been utilized
    commercially for agricultural purposes since the beginning of the eighteenth century,
    but their use has grown significantly as a result of the expansion of the Internet
    of Things and advancements in communication technologies. It may carry out a variety
    of tasks that enhance farming methods ([49]). Drone activities include, but are
    not limited to, water supply, soil testing, grafting, sprayers, crop assessment
    and its assessment, crop illness, overall plant wellness measurements, insecticide,
    fertilizer, canopy cover, forecasting and counting of plants, crop height measuring,
    etc., which can all be monitored by drones outfitted with multiple sensors, cameras,
    thermal, multi-spectral, and optical imaging cameras ([34]; [28]). Ethereal photographs
    may be produced quickly by using robots that have cameras installed. Farmers may
    utilize these images to cultivate their land and improve every aspect of their
    holding. Due to their great capabilities, agricultural unmanned aerial vehicles
    (UAVs) are now being used in numerous aspects of agriculture, including seed dropping,
    planting, growth evaluation, mapping, fertilizer, and pesticide applications.
    As a result, it is anticipated that the market for agricultural UAVs and associated
    innovations will continue to expand ([42]; [55]). 2.1.4. Harvesting The farmer
    can concentrate on additional duties owing to the sophisticated techniques, IoT
    devices, and mechanized machinery. With the help of an IoT framework, these machines
    can continuously monitor fields, monitor crops using their sensors, and collect
    appropriate harvests as needed at the right time. The process of capturing energy
    from different external sources and turning it into electrical power is known
    as energy harvesting. The lifespan of sensors can be achieved through the application
    of energy harvest technology, which also occasionally eliminates the need for
    batteries. Furthermore, harvesting energy provides practical and financial benefits
    by optimizing energy consumption and lowering network maintenance expenses ([65]).
    In certain situations, like rural areas or remote locations, the deployment of
    wireless sensor networks is advantageous. The cost of renewable energy is falling,
    which has resulted in a dramatic increase in solar photovoltaic adoption. ([60]).
    By maintaining surveillance on healthy vegetation, farmers may acquire and evaluate
    the data to avoid particular falls rather than simply huddle and exhaust themselves.
    2.1.5. Sowing, weeding, and crop maintenance Reducing manual work and increasing
    quality production are the major goals of integrating autonomous mechanical devices
    into agriculture. They oversee the farmers in carrying out various tasks, such
    as maintaining and fixing the miniature types of machinery, analyzing data, and
    planning farm events. Drone Seed and Bio Carbon are two examples of miniature
    robotic machines that are being tested to replace labor-intensive tasks like sowing
    and cultivation. They can use compressed air to burn seedpod packs directly into
    the soil, compost, and fertilizer. Additionally, robotic machines are making it
    possible to mechanize the completion of significant tasks. These machines can
    run agricultural spraying tasks with greater efficiency, noticeable accuracy,
    and less waste ([82]; [47]). For farmers and agriculture experts, identifying
    plant diseases is of utmost importance. With the help of advanced applications,
    it is possible to determine how ordinary and affected plant leaves separate based
    on variations in temperature, moisture content, and shade. The author ([45]) suggested
    a framework to use the IoT application to identify plant diseases. Most crops
    experience the onset of disease and illness in their leaves. For autonomous robots
    or machines, essential crop services like weed eradication and inflammation management.
    Such machines can autonomously navigate a field by using developments in satellite
    communication, the Global Positioning System (GPS), Light Detection and Ranging
    (LiDAR), and cameras ([30]). These can also be used to apply insect sprays and
    identify annoyances. It makes use of AI and IoT to identify weeds before pulling
    them. Drones may assist farmers with a variety of duties, from organizing and
    analyzing data to actually sowing produce and then monitoring the crops to determine
    progress and a healthy lifestyle. According to the authors, smart agriculture
    depends on using novel technologies for harvesting management to increase farm
    productivity without sacrificing the quality of the product. Commercially available
    drones are big enough to transmit innovations in distant discovery that need to
    be sent over a network of satellites or by using an aircraft surveillance system
    ([9]). 3. Methods of smart farming 3.1. Internet of Things for agriculture The
    Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging technology that makes it possible to create
    a system that supports agricultural processes ([29]; [59]; [5]; [18]). An IoT
    system is made up of a variety of components that allow the system to perform
    various functions such as sensing, identification, actuation, communication, and
    management ([80]). Fig. 4 represents the IoT structure. Download : Download high-res
    image (507KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Structure of IoT. The
    IoT system applies to various applications of agriculture, such as crop protection
    and management, farm monitoring, remote monitoring systems, decision support tools,
    automated irrigation systems, frost protection systems, fertilization systems,
    temperature and humidity monitoring, rainfall observation, fertilizer effectiveness,
    animal tracking, storehouse monitoring, water tank dimensions monitoring, theft
    detection, equipment tracking, and monitoring remotely ([29]). A decrease in the
    number of electronic incidents involving agricultural producers and IoT technology
    has made it simpler to obtain data related to agriculture. With better input and
    process optimization, fewer resources, and more environmentally friendly agricultural
    practices made possible by these future technologies, productivity may be increased.
    The agricultural sector''s utility would be improved by the combined use of IoT
    technology with data analytics and wireless sensor networks (WSN), resulting in
    improved crop output and operational scheduling ([59]). The WSN gathers data from
    distinct kinds of smart sensors and uses various communication methods to send
    it to a centralized server. Attacks by insects, excessive pesticide use, attacks
    by wild animals and birds, unpredictability in the monsoon, shortage of water,
    inappropriate water use, and ignorance of agricultural practices are some factors
    that reduce crop output. Depending on the area of agriculture being considered,
    several criteria in the agricultural industry must be examined, such as crop monitoring,
    forestry monitoring, livestock farm monitoring, weather monitoring, micro-climatic
    modification, aquaculture management, and logistics management ([80]; [39]; [60];
    [64]). 3.2. Artificial intelligence for agriculture Artificial intelligence (AI)
    is the term used to describe the development of human intellect in computers that
    are made capable of acting and thinking like people, including acquiring knowledge
    and resolving issues ([7]; [71]). It is an instance of machine learning. The AI
    technology applies to various applications in agriculture, as shown in Fig. 5.

    Fig. 5. Applications of Artificial Intelligence in Agriculture. The primary fields,
    including systems with experts, fuzzy structures, and artificial neural networks,
    are the three key approaches. Agriculture is a dynamic sector for which it is
    impossible to draw conclusions that may be used to offer an overall solution.
    The agricultural sector and cropping systems throughout India will need to adapt
    creatively and technologically to boost productivity and optimize resource use
    with sophisticated computer tools. Artificial intelligence approaches have enabled
    us to grasp the intricate details of each situation and provide the best solution
    possible for that particular issue ([21]; [66]). 3.3. Blockchain technology for
    smart agriculture Blockchain technology plays a crucial role in facilitating smart
    farming in the field of smart agriculture. The conventional agricultural supply
    chain has numerous intermediaries, each responsible for distinct stages of the
    supply chain, including production, processing, packaging, and distribution ([13]).
    This may lead to an absence of accountability and transparency, which can impede
    efforts to trace the origin of products or authenticate their safety and quality.
    Blockchain technology offers a reliable, distributed, and immutable platform for
    storing and exchanging data throughout the supply chain ([81]). Through the utilization
    of blockchain technology, farmers and other stakeholders in the supply chain may
    securely store and track essential information, including planting dates, locations,
    types of fertilizers and pesticides employed, and harvest dates and locations.
    This enables them to guarantee the superior quality and safety of the products
    for consumers ([27]). 3.4. Sensor technology for smart agriculture Smart farming
    depends significantly on the use of sensors. Farmers may maximize crop productivity
    by adjusting their surroundings with the help of sensors. In essence, weather
    stations, robots, and drones may all have sensors mounted to them. Farmers may
    learn a lot about vegetation and the environment from the information the sensors
    tell them. Food 4.0 emphasizes the extensive use of sensor technologies as part
    of the precision agriculture concept ([54]). Using scarce resources like water,
    fertilizer, and seedlings, farmers may boost agricultural productivity with the
    use of sensors. Mobile applications can be used to operate the sensors and camera.
    Since optical sensors are capable of scanning an entire area and acquiring the
    required images, they are typically mounted on drones or robotic machines ([70]).
    Additionally, these smart sensors help to improve crop yield, livestock tracking,
    soil moisture monitoring, remote water tank level monitoring, temperature and
    humidity sensing, the security of farmland, monitoring environmental conditions,
    and equipment tracking ([59]). These sensors include, for example, temperature
    sensors that sense temperature, soil moisture sensors that measure soil moisture
    content, PIR sensors that detect animals, people, and other objects in agricultural
    fields, and GPS-based remote control robots that carry out tasks like weeding,
    spraying, and moisture sensing ([54]) (refer to Fig. 6). Download : Download high-res
    image (180KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Types of smart sensors
    used in agriculture for water quality parameters ([79]). Sensors have become more
    intelligent, more affordable, eco-friendly, dependable, and have a greater integrated
    capability for use in food applications. Food applications in 4IR will use sensors
    to enable far-away sensing and location. From a management point of view, both
    regional and remote sensing technologies must be combined with effective big data
    analytics to provide high-resolution decision-making tools ([2]; [40]). Remote
    sensors can provide immediate maps of field parameters, while optical sensors
    may display modifications to field color characteristics according to variations
    in crop growth, soil composition, field limits, and other factors. The indices
    provided by satellite and aerial images can show how healthy the plants are ([9];
    [57]). 3.4.1. Sensors used in agriculture farming The use of many sensors in smart
    farming is becoming increasingly common, as these sensors may be useful for measuring
    crop yields, monitoring environmental conditions, and automatically harvesting
    crops ([62]; [1]; [32]). In agricultural setups, smart sensors can more accurately
    and automatically collect a variety of environmental data as well as other relevant
    information, which may then be stored on drives. A smart sensor is made up of
    wireless communication technologies, microprocessors, and a sensor device that
    allows for remote surveillance of many agricultural elements ([83]; [2]. To improve
    their functionality, smart sensors can be connected to other parts, including
    transducers, amplifiers, analog-to-digital converters, and analog filters. A range
    of critical parameters, including temperature, humidity, and nutrient contents,
    are sensed by IoT-based sensors used in agricultural settings ([54]). The data
    is then sent to communication gateways, which include satellites, computing systems,
    and cloud servers. Human networks subsequently utilize these IoT-enabled devices
    for analysis, decision-making, and other necessary farm tasks ([57]; [40]). The
    details of different smart sensors utilized by numerous researchers in the field
    of agriculture are presented in Table 1. Table 1. Different types of sensors used
    in various fields of agriculture. Sl. No. Types of sensors Working principle Usage
    Reference 1 Electromagnetic Sensor Uses electrical circuits to monitor electrical
    impulse conduction or buildup in soil Measure the concentrations of organic matter
    and residual nitrate in the soil, record electromagnetic reactions, and track
    the rate of transpiration in real time. ([14])  2 Acoustic-based sensors monitor
    changes in the noise intensity in fields of agriculture Identifying and keeping
    an eye on the population of pests; collecting fruit; and following the growth
    of aquatic plants ([16])  3 Optical sensors Variations in light reflectance are
    evaluated Utilized for identifying many properties of soil, such as moisture content,
    mineral content, soil texture, and soil color. Fruit maturity is detected by optical
    sensors mediated by fluorescence. Orchard canopies are monitored using microwave
    scattering in conjunction with integral optical sensors. ([78])  4 Ultrasonic
    ranging sensors Uses an ultrasonic sensor to identify an object''s proximity by
    sending and receiving ultrasonic pulses. Aids in weed identification, agricultural
    canopy monitoring, and insect detection. ([1])  5 Mass flow sensors Sensors track
    the mass movement of grains using several modules, including an internal system,
    data storage, and a moisture content sensor. Measure the grain flow via a combined
    harvester to aid in yield production assessment. ([6])  6 Electrochemical sensors
    Separate sensors capturing soil electrochemical gradients in agriculture Assists
    in measuring the pH and nutritional content of the soil and also for precision
    agriculture ([2])  7 Light detection and ranging (LIDAR) Light Detection and Ranging
    (LIDAR) optical sensors work by varying the characteristics of optical signals
    in response to variations in a measurement. Services related to agricultural land,
    including 3D modeling, tracking soil erosion, mapping agricultural land, and identifying
    different types of soil. ([38])  8 FPGA (Field programmable gate array) based
    sensors Uses digital circuits to wrap logic blocks and silicon-based processors.
    Measures the rate of plant transpiration, moisture content, humidity, and irrigation
    ([51])  9 Eddy covariance-based sensors Constant measurements throughout huge
    agricultural fields. Track variations in the concentrations of different gases
    in agricultural areas, such as methane, CO2, and water vapor, among other greenhouse
    gases ([40])  10 Battery-free and self-powered sensors Solar cells are used to
    power sensors. Assist in detecting environmental elements like humidity and temperature,
    among others. Also used to keep an eye on food products'' quality. ([64])  11
    Airflow sensors It uses distinctive identifying traits to sense many soil properties.
    Examine the soil''s permeability, air content, moisture content, and if it is
    in a mobile or stationary state. ([57])  12 Flexible and wearable sensors Flexible
    materials are used to create sensors that can be attached to various plant components.
    Facilitates the sensation of temperature as well as the form, size, and growth
    of various plant components and plant protection. ([13])  13 Mechanical sensors
    Sensors take measurements of the force determined by strain gauges or load cells.
    Computes the compaction of soil particles and the soil''s mechanical resistance.
    ([32]) 3.5. Mobile applications In addition to sensors, several mobile applications
    support intelligent farming. Among these are a phone camera for taking images
    of plants and illnesses to diagnose a possible illness, a GPS device for locating
    noxious weeds, information on sun radiation, the requirement for fertilizer, and
    information on where to apply the paste. In addition, the agriculture equipment
    may require the use of microphones for repairing and operating the system. For
    instance, the gyroscope and accelerometer are additional smartphone tools. In
    addition, numerous mobile apps, such as those for disease detection, calculating
    fertilizer requirements, applying soil studies, and predicting water requirements,
    can assist in smart farming ([4]. Sensor technology offers a lot of advantages
    for smart agriculture. But there are a lot of significant limitations with them
    ([53]). One of the primary disadvantages of using sensors is the constant need
    for internet access. Power and connectivity to the internet might not always be
    accessible in remote locations. This constrains the use of intelligent agriculture.
    Furthermore, smart farming necessitates the existence of necessary facilities
    such as power lines and mobile towers, which might not be feasible in underdeveloped
    states'' rural areas. The majority of agricultural workers lack the technical
    knowledge necessary to embrace IoT technology, which is another disadvantage ([35];
    [58]). These issues may all be mitigated by using chatbots that employ natural
    language processing ([50]; [75]). 3.5.1. Chatbot system The chatbot system is
    a promising technology for monitoring and controlling agricultural activities
    ([75]). A robot that can speak is called a “chatbot” or “chatterbot,” and it is
    a program designed to make easier communication between machines and human beings.
    Two categories are available for chatbots: (i) governed by rules, using predetermined
    instructions to generate intended discussions that typically follow well-defined
    navigation flows; (ii) AI-based, utilizing advanced algorithms like machine learning
    (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) to improve conversations and interactive
    capabilities. In addition to using sensors that detect movement and other means,
    these interactions can also take place by expressing themselves in natural language
    ([50]). The discussions between people and chatbots can be easily translated into
    each other''s language, however, the topics of discussion and caliber of these
    exchanges may vary significantly. The authors'' [33] findings demonstrate that,
    in comparison to human interaction, users interact with chatbots for longer durations
    but with fewer messages. The use of a chatbot system that makes use of an instant
    messaging platform in a conversational context offers an effective, safe, and
    user-friendly foundation for communication with IoT devices used in agricultural
    sectors ([75]. It is an example of how technological advances have facilitated
    the development of smart and autonomous machines. The chatbot system is an agriculture
    question-answering platform where farmers can make calls and inquiries about the
    system. Also, farmers can ask queries that the system understands and responds
    to ([52]). A very well-known systematic information-sharing platform called Kisan
    Call Center is one example of a chatbot system ([17]). The Kisan Call Center employee
    will make an effort to address your concerns or questions right away. Furthermore,
    the conversation will be routed to designated subject-matter experts if the call
    center technician fails to address the farmer''s question right away ([52]). The
    major objectives of the Kisan Call Centre are to gather and distribute information,
    address day-to-day issues, offer opportunities to contribute knowledge, create
    networks between scientists and specialists, preserve the traditional knowledge
    system, and improve agricultural production for the sustainable transformation
    of Indian agriculture. 4. Advantages of IoT technology in the agriculture sector
    IoT technology has several benefits for the agricultural industry ([59]). A few
    advantages are listed in the section that follows: 1. Collective Information:
    IoT technology, particularly in rural and isolated locations, can support the
    growth of cooperative farming. The development of applications that allow sharing,
    shared farm data management, and enhanced interaction between farmers and agriculture
    professionals can be facilitated by IoT. 2. Safety and Security: The challenges
    of ranchers extend beyond the need to produce more food; they also include ensuring
    reliability, protection, and availability of high-quality food. There have been
    several reports of problems with the standard of food being supplied to the market,
    including food adulteration, counterfeiting, artificial plant augmentation, and
    large fruit sizes. These problems are mostly affecting medical conditions and
    may have detrimental effects on economic growth. 3. Competitive and Challenging
    Nature: Agriculture is becoming a more competitive industry due to the growing
    demand for increased agricultural output and the application of innovative technology.
    It strengthens a structure where information exchange in farming sectors using
    IoT technology will offer additional potential for management, marketing, and
    monitoring. 4. Growth and Development: Development and Spread of Prosperity: The
    usage of IoT technology may provide fresh perspectives on job creation. Farmers
    stand to gain from this approach as it eliminates the need for “intermediate men,”
    who are often misused and may engage directly with clients, yielding greater returns.
    5. Minimal expenses and damages: The only advantage of IoT technology is that
    it''s able to identify instruments and devices that are located remotely. Farmers
    have more decision-making power because of IoT technology, which informs them
    of the best times to apply insecticides and herbicides. They might be able to
    lower their agricultural expenses and crop devastation thanks to this. 6. Awareness:
    The network of IoT devices can regulate access to WSNs in farming industries and
    operate economical services. Smartphone apps provide information about goods,
    services, prices, and market analysis. Additionally, a variety of regulations,
    laws, and government initiatives on different agricultural farm produce. 7. Resource
    Management: IoT technology will enable immediate monitoring and sensing of agricultural
    capital, safeguarding various equipment against theft, updating components, and
    enabling the timely completion of jobs. 5. Future scope and challenges The IoT
    and AI-based smarter applications have been integrated into current approaches
    to address several issues in the farming and agricultural sectors ([63]). Several
    issues include a lack of organization, safety, confidentiality, power, data merging,
    variety in IoT devices, and inconsistent business ideas. The use of IoT in agriculture
    comes with many expenses, including managerial and organizational expenditures
    ([12]). In particular, coupling problems will arise when massive IoT devices—such
    as those that use unlicensed spectrum like WiFi, SigFox, LoRa, and ZigBee—are
    used in the agricultural industry for many different reasons. Data corruption
    and reduced dependability occur as a result of coupling. Using unlicensed spectrum
    results in higher equipment prices. The key reason for the gradual introduction
    of IoT technology in numerous agriculture applications is farmers'' less important
    understanding of the device and its varied uses. This is a key factor since most
    farmers are ignorant and from rural regions, especially in third-world nations.
    When it comes to employing new technology, they lack flexibility ([70]). In addition,
    inadequate safety precautions may result in data loss, invasions of privacy, and
    attacks on sensitive data, including field parameters and other intellectual property.
    IoT devices are vulnerable to physical harm from things like animal attacks, theft,
    and address changes. Traffic, denial of service (DoS), and forward assaults are
    common on gateways. To maximize profits, farmers must comprehend the finest resource
    mechanisms for analyzing the number of IoT devices required, the number of gateways,
    the memory size for cloud storage, and the volume of data to be communicated.
    IoT devices are deployed outdoors in environments that might impact the sensors,
    degrade their effectiveness over time, and cause a transmission system failure.
    Installation of IoT sensors and structures needs to be protected to ensure that
    costly equipment is not harmed by different weather conditions, such as floods,
    intense rain, cyclones, etc. ([11]). Although some IoT technologies are still
    being researched, many are currently evolving. Since emerging technologies require
    extensive study before they can be implemented, choosing the right approach is
    a major concern. Several factors, including the farm size and shape, the location,
    the types of soil, and the circumstances surrounding it, are taken into account
    before choosing a new technology. ([76]); [5]; [26]) 6. Conclusion With increasing
    population growth worldwide, global warming, and a lack of resources at present,
    agriculture is severely challenged to fulfill the demand for high-quality and
    quantity food. The present study demonstrated how crucial smart farming is to
    raising and enhancing agricultural productivity to help reduce the gap between
    supply and demand for food. The adaptation of smart technologies like IoT and
    AI demonstrates enormous promises for many different aspects of farming. IoT is
    regarded as the foundation of smart agricultural technology since it links every
    part of smart systems, including those used in other applications than agriculture.
    The insights acquired from profitable companies might assist researchers in devising
    novel approaches and remedies for modern farming practices. This paper offers
    a summary of how smart technology will transform the agriculture industry, assisting
    farmers in better managing their properties while also generating more income.
    Furthermore, this study facilitates the identification and investigation of the
    evolutionary trends in Agriculture 4.0 and Agriculture 5.0. In addition, this
    study will provide systematic information on the advantages and uses of various
    methods in smart farming and provide a proper understanding of how to get the
    maximum benefit from an economic and management point of view. In the agricultural
    sector, the evolution of agriculture from traditional to modern practices with
    Agriculture 4.0 and 5.0 is an irreversible trend that cannot be stopped. These
    technologies might link people''s modern connectedness using their cell phones.
    Due to their low cost and ease of use, smartphones, the IoT, and AI have all contributed
    to the gradual development of the integration of communication and information
    technologies into the psycho-social structures of people, cities, and industries.
    This integration offers tremendous potential for discovery and exploitation. It
    can be concluded that smart agriculture farming will fulfill the demands of an
    extensive and adaptable agricultural system that protects the environment and
    sustainability and demonstrates flexibility regardless of upcoming challenges
    to provide a steady and long-lasting source of income within constrained limits.
    Additionally, by 2050, IoT and AI technologies will assist farmers and the agricultural
    industry in meeting the need for food. Funding No funding was taken from an external

    The Internet of Things (IoT) holds immense potential for the social and economic
    development of developing countries, as recognized by academia and professionals.
    However, there is a notable lack of theoretical research on IoT adoption within
    agricultural settings. To address this gap, this study introduces a model focusing
    on nine critical “Technology-Organization-Environment” (TOE) factors. Empirical
    validation was conducted using data from 179 managers in diverse agricultural
    organizations. The research model was evaluated by using “Partial Least Squares
    Structural Equation Modeling” (PLS-SEM). The results underscored the significance
    of governmental support and technological compatibility in driving IoT adoption.
    Moreover, financial considerations within organizations and the evolving digital
    landscape were identified as key influencers of smart farm adoption. This study
    offers valuable insights with significant implications for sustainable IoT adoption
    in research and practical applications. Keywords: agriculture; Internet of Things;
    PLS-SEM; TOE 1. Introduction All Malaysian businesses and industries have been
    affected by technology, and agriculture is an obvious example in this regard.
    IoT is among the novel technological achievements that imply the objectification
    of three Web4.0 features, including ubiquity, identity, and connectivity [1].
    The “Internet of Things” (IoT), which is sometimes known as the “Internet of Everything”
    or “Industrial Internet”, can be regarded as a novel and possibly disruptive computation
    paradigm that will potentially transform business procedures, methods, and competencies
    in different industrial fields [2]. A device to sense and another device to route
    and communicate along with a cloud-based application make up the IoT. IoT includes
    different applications of monitoring as well as controlling according to a network
    of devices that sense and actuate and have the ability of self-configuration with
    remote control using the Internet [3]. Revolutions in all industrial fields have
    been observed due to the IoT technology which contributes significantly to the
    renovation of the agricultural industries [4]. This technology is among the most
    recent digital transformations, representing a paradigm change in different business
    operations [5]. The fast growth of the global population along with the restricted
    available resources necessitates the improvement of crop production processes
    to meet the needs of the ever-increasing population. In this regard, IoT is one
    of the technological innovations that can be used to deal with this serious challenge.
    IoT can be considered an effective tool in the agricultural industries as it facilitates
    automation and the ability to monitor from every location across the world through
    human replacement [6,7]. IoT has a variety of applications in agricultural fields,
    such as smart farming or precision agriculture, environment, monitoring of irrigation,
    cattle animals, and other areas [8]. Various IoT technologies, including “radio
    frequency identification” (RFID), “wireless sensor networks” (WSN), sensors, and
    “global positioning systems” (GPS) have different applications in agriculture.
    Moreover, evaluation of the field variables, including soil status, atmospheric
    conditions, and animals or plants’ biomass can be facilitated by IoT. This technology
    is also employed in the assessment and control of variables, including temperature,
    moisture, vibrations, or shocks in the course of product transportation [4]. Reports
    predict an increase in the number of connected agricultural tools from 13 million
    in 2014 to 225 million in 2024, while there is also an increase in IoT device
    installations with a CAG rate of 20% across the world [9,10]. According to Kite-Powell
    [11], improvement of productivity as well as profitability is possible along with
    significant transformations in the management of farms and usage of sustainable
    agricultural methods through IoT. Application of the most current IoT technologies
    compared to conventional methods can bring about fundamental changes in different
    dimensions and lead to new agricultural patterns associated with precision agriculture
    [12]. Thus, agricultural industries will gain more importance shortly. Fast economic
    developments took place in the Malaysian context after independence, particularly
    following the emergence of heavy industries in the 1980s and 1990s. Malaysia,
    which is dependent on agricultural and fishery activities, is now under the influence
    of services that assign approximately 55% of the country’s GDP to themselves [13].
    Farming industries require IoT to provide food for a population of 9.6 billion
    people worldwide by 2050. Currently, 39% of the global palm oil production and
    44% of exports are allocated to Malaysia [14]. Consequently, agriculture requires
    large-scale structural transformations using the smart farms revolution or smart
    agriculture in Malaysia. Even though considerable benefits are suggested by IoT,
    its adoption has just started in the agricultural context. Based on Dlodlo et
    al. [15], research in this area is still in its initial phases and there are a
    few studies accessible in this regard. Moreover, the effects of IoT adoption in
    the agricultural sector on their sustainability in the field of Information Systems
    (IS) have also not been examined in the recent relevant studies. As a result,
    the present paper aims to investigate the “technological, organizational, and
    environmental” (TOE) factors that affect the adoption of IoT in the agricultural
    sector of Malaysia. 2. Theoretical Background and Related Works 2.1. Concept of
    the IoT in Agriculture Agricultural industries are of considerable importance
    in Malaysia, playing a vital role in the economy of this country for a long time
    through agricultural products for domestic usage as well as export. This industry
    is also important in the country’s “Gross Domestic Product” (GDP). Over 1.6 million
    people were employed by the agricultural industry in 2013, accounting for 10.9%
    of the overall employment and contributing to over 23% of the export income, and
    adding approximately 7.2% to the country’s Gross Domestic Products [16]. Development
    of IoT can be broadly observed in agricultural production, processes, sales, and
    circulation, bringing about different benefits regarding convenience and automation
    in maintaining and monitoring the products, while improvement of productivity
    and speed of operations in the management processes has become also possible [7].
    For the successful construction of smart agricultural environments, it is necessary
    to develop the required IoT technology with the desired optimizations for agricultural
    industries, including hardware, middleware, routing protocols, and application
    services for agricultural contexts [7]. IoT is supposed to contribute primarily
    to different applications in agricultural industries [17] due to its potential
    such as fundamental communication infrastructures along with the scope of services,
    including local or distant data acquisition, users’ interface, decision-making,
    and cloud-based information analysis, as well as automation of agricultural operations.
    These potentials bring about considerable revolutions in the agricultural industries
    that are currently suffering inefficiency in contribution to the economic value
    chain [18]. IoT has been used in agriculture and smart farming in relevant literature
    [4,19,20,21]. Moreover, Ruan and Shi [20] proposed an IoT framework for the assessment
    of fruit freshness in the area of e-commerce as a non-conventional retail delivery
    which had faced specific problems regarding transport, because the products are
    perishable and require expensive logistics. On the other hand, Muangprathub et
    al. [4] designed and developed a control system through node sensors in the crop
    fields using data management with smartphones along with a web application. In
    another study, Luan et al. [21] conducted the development of a synthetic system
    for the integration of drought monitoring and prediction along with forecasts
    on the amount of irrigation into an IoT-based platform with consideration of hybrid
    programming and parallel computations. Nevertheless, although IoT has considerable
    opportunities and advantages for users and organizations, its adoption has not
    had the expected speed [22]. 2.2. IoT Adoption Studies Studies considering technologies’
    adoption, diffusion, and acceptance are seen to have reached their maturity in
    the IS-relevant literature [23,24]. Thus, a considerable number of studies have
    taken IT innovations’ adoption and diffusion into account. On the other hand,
    some theoretical and experimental research works have considered these innovations’
    adoption along with testing a variety of theories. De Boer et al. [1] used the
    “Technology Acceptance Model” to explore the acceptance and behavioral intention
    to adopt IoT technologies while investigating the scope to which the IoT competencies
    may be affected by Internet capabilities. Based on their conclusions, how individuals
    assess their IoT competencies and the practical issues are of importance in the
    acceptance of IoT, while appropriate internet capabilities are required to have
    enough skills in the use of IoT. An investigation of the contribution of IT/OT
    convergence to IoT adoption in manufacturing firms was carried out by Ehie and
    Chilton [5]. Based on the authors’ reports, IT infrastructures, and governance
    along with interoperable systems were associated with IT/OT convergence directly
    and positively. IT/OT convergence signifies the strategic integration of digital
    technologies, such as computer networks and software, with the physical systems
    and processes governing agricultural operations. This convergence fosters seamless
    communication and data exchange among various components of agricultural systems,
    ultimately enabling analysis, real-time monitoring, and data-driven decision-making.
    In addition, Madushanki et al. [25] investigated IoT adoption in the agricultural
    field and smart farming aimed at urban greening. According to their findings,
    water management was introduced as the highest-regarded IoT sub-vertical, after
    which smart farming, livestock management, crop management, and irrigation management
    came with similar percentages. Lin et al. [26] constructed a framework called
    TOE standing for “Technology-Organization-Environment” to examine the effective
    factors of IoT adoption in Chinese agricultural supply chains. Based on their
    findings, employees’ resistance and uncertainty were not of importance regarding
    the effects of the adoption of IoT. Yoon et al. [27] studied the predicting factors
    on smart farms’ adoption in the Korean context, after which they analyzed the
    determining factors, challenges, and gaps, as well as future IoT achievements.
    Their findings indicated the effects of technological compatibility, organizational
    financial costs, and changes in the digital context on smart farms’ adoption.
    Gomes and Osman [28] examined the available research on IoT and integrated the
    TOE framework with DOI theory, according to which they found comprehensive discussions
    and analysis of various methods in the relevant studies. An overall view is represented
    in the present paper considering the applied solutions in the IoT market through
    investigation of the available interpretations in relevant studies and using them
    to obtain experimental findings. Hsu and Yeh [29] used a hybrid model of TOE together
    with DEMATEL for the evaluation of the complicated factors that influence IOT
    adoption in Taiwanese logistics industries. The researchers concluded that environmental,
    organizational, and security aspects have the highest priorities for development.
    Arnold and Voigt [30] applied the TOE framework in manufacturing corporations.
    Based on their findings, factors from all three mentioned dimensions affected
    IoT adoption significantly. Shi and Yan [31] employed the TOE framework and conducted
    an exploratory examination of the affecting factors of the RFID technique’s adoption
    in the product distribution of Chinese agricultural industries. Experimental analyses
    showed that technological environments including technological complexity, technological
    compatibility, perceived usefulness, and costs, along with organizational dimensions
    including the size of the organization, top management supports, trust between
    business entities, and technical knowledge, as well as environmental aspects including
    competitive pressures and support from the Chinese government, affected RFID adoption
    significantly in the agricultural product distribution industries of China [31].
    Examination of the relevant literature showed that the majority of research on
    the adoption of IoT has been carried out in developed contexts including Germany
    [30], the Netherlands [1], the United States [5], and China [20]. Consequently,
    more studies are needed in developing nations, involving the Malaysian context.
    2.3. Technological, Environmental, and Organizational (TOE) Framework Tornatzky
    et al. [32] suggested the TOE framework to investigate technological innovations’
    adoption. Based on their arguments, adoption decisions of technological innovations
    are in accordance with organizational as well as environmental factors together
    with technological features. This framework can provide acceptable theoretical
    backgrounds to analyze the adoption of recent technologies at the organizational
    level [29,33]. The framework has been regularly used in research associated with
    technology adoption [34]. Moreover, a variety of disciplines and contexts have
    investigated it to show its theoretical robustness, experimental support, and
    effectiveness in the investigation of preparedness, adoption, and application
    of different types of innovation [33]. Different research works on the adoption
    of IT have been successful in its application, among which RFID adoption [35,36],
    cloud computing adoption [37,38], e-business [39], and IoT adoption [30] can be
    mentioned. A deliberate selection of the consideration factors for the decision
    framework was performed for the construction of the TOE framework on solid theoretical
    grounds in the present paper. Given the existing studies, the main determinants
    of the adoption of IoT receiving the highest attention in previous literature
    can be observed in Table 1. Table 1. Factors affecting IoT adoption in the literature.
    3. Research Model and Hypothesis Development According to the theoretical background
    and the findings in the previous studies, the current paper proposes a three-dimensional
    model, incorporating technological, organizational, and environmental variables
    to understand the decision toward the adoption of IoT in the agricultural industries.
    A broad scope of factors could be found in prior studies. A limited number of
    factors believed to be of importance in figuring out and justifying the adoption
    of IoT were selected to avoid repetition. A discussion of the hypotheses and development
    of the research model is brought in this section. The predicted research model
    is indicated in Figure 1. Figure 1. The research model for IoT adoption. 3.1.
    Technological Dimension The Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) Theory, developed by
    Rogers [43], provides us with a robust theoretical framework to analyze the technological
    factors influencing the uptake of IoT technologies by agricultural organizations.
    Key factors within this framework include the relative advantages provided by
    these technologies, compatibility with established practices, and complexity.
    By systematically applying the DOI theory, we can isolate the most influential
    technological determinants of IoT adoption. This understanding paves the way for
    tailored strategies to accelerate its acceptance among agricultural stakeholders,
    thereby driving the sustainable transformation of agricultural practices. As Rogers
    [43] has stated, relative advantages refer to the degree of perceiving technology
    as something that provides more benefits for organizations. It seems reasonable
    if the organization takes the benefits of innovations’ adoption into account.
    Different research works have referred to the positive association of this variable
    with new IT adoption. Perception of new IT as something that offers relative advantages
    compared to the existing organizational methods leads to a higher probability
    of its adoption [44]. As Yoon et al. [27] put it, productivity and quality of
    products are increased in smart farms, while less labor, energy, and fertilizer
    are required compared to the past. As a result, smart farms are supposed to result
    in higher organizational competitiveness. In summary, higher perceptions of the
    relative advantages of IoT adoption will lead to a higher possibility of its adoption
    by organizations. Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis: Hypothesis 1.  Relative
    advantages affect the adoption of IoT positively. Complexity refers to the scope
    based on which the innovations are regarded as correspondingly challenging to
    understand and use [45]. Given that the complexity of innovations may inhibit
    successful execution, it seems to have a negative association with adoption [36,46].
    Even though IoT brings about different organizational advantages, the perceived
    technological features are still sophisticated. When the application of a special
    form of technology is challenging for organizations, top management teams decide
    whether to ignore it or propose it later [31]. Therefore, it is primarily hypothesized
    that the complexity of IoT has negative effects on its adoption. Consequently,
    we propose the following hypothesis: Hypothesis 2.  Complexity affects the adoption
    of IoT negatively. Compatibility refers to the degree of perceiving innovations
    as in agreement with the requirements of the current methods employed by possible
    adopters [47]. This factor is one of the main determining factors in the adoption
    of innovations since considerable transformations can be made in the current work
    processes through innovations [48]. Higher levels of compatibility seem to facilitate
    the adoption of innovations [49]. Compatibility of smart agricultural technologies
    in line with the farm’s existing procedures would result in a higher possibility
    of their adoption by the agricultural organization. As a result, the following
    hypothesis is raised: Hypothesis 3.  Compatibility has a positive relationship
    with IoT adoption. Technological competencies (TC) are associated with the technological
    resources that are accessible in the organization, including IT infrastructures,
    incorporating the installed technologies, systems, and applications [50]. It is
    possible to achieve higher levels of performance with the use of competencies
    [51]. Ritter and Gemünden [52] referred to the technological competencies as organizational
    enablers that assist in internally understanding, using, and exploiting technologies.
    Indeed, technological competencies are a way to support in preparation for technological
    infrastructures such as the adoption of a fundamental level of knowledge associated
    with the existing technology [53]. Thus, organizations that have higher levels
    of technological competencies and knowledge of marketing may have better conditions
    to evaluate the advantages of IoT. Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis:
    Hypothesis 4.  Technological competencies have positive effects on the adoption
    of IoT. Based on Tornatzky and Klein [47], costs prevent the of new technologies.
    The perception of excessive costs associated with adopting innovations can reduce
    the intention to adopt, even in the presence of potential benefits. Therefore,
    for a decision to adopt innovation to be made, the benefits must outweigh the
    adoption costs [48]. Because of the variety and large-scale characteristics of
    the costs, the costs related to these types of projects will be found considerable.
    Accordingly, costs will contribute critically to the decision to adopt [38]. In
    the present study, costs range from hardware facility expenditures (such as network,
    RFID, sensors, middleware, cloud-based or data center infrastructures) to expenses
    associated with implementing, integrating, operating, and maintaining the system.
    Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis: Hypothesis 5.  Higher costs have
    negative effects on the intention to adopt IoT. 3.2. Organizational Dimension
    Technical knowledge indicates the professional knowledge of IT that the organizations
    possess within themselves. After the related knowledge and skills associated with
    a new form of technology are obtained, organizations can efficiently evaluate
    the influencing factors on the adoption of the novel technology, involving benefits,
    drawbacks, costs, and so on [31]. Based on Rezvani and Khosravi [54], technical
    knowledge makes the application of accurate working strategies possible to thoroughly
    deal with machinery and equipment. Thus, Hypothesis 6 is raised as follows: Hypothesis
    6.  Technical knowledge affects the adoption of IoT positively. Young and Jordan
    [55] define management support as the commitment of senior management, including
    project sponsors, champions, CEOs, or other senior managers, to invest time in
    evaluating plans, forecasting outcomes, and addressing management challenges.
    Management support is widely recognized as a critical factor in the successful
    adoption of new technologies, and it is strongly believed to be positively correlated
    with the adoption process [36,46]. As Shi and Yan [31] put it, top management’s
    support seems essential for new technologies’ adoption in organizations. Reyes
    et al. [56], similar to Sila [57], have argued that RFID adoption needs considerable
    investments, which in turn requires engagement and support from the top management
    to implement and perform successfully. Managers should support the business associates’
    inappropriate information as well as communication technology implementation so
    that better communications and smoother workflows are obtained. Managers must
    support, motivate, and admit the recent technologies in the construction industry
    to increase organizational efficiency. Accordingly, we propose the following hypothesis:
    Hypothesis 7.  Top management support has a positive relationship with the adoption
    of IoT. According to Tan et al. [58], organizational preparedness is defined as
    what the managers perceive and evaluate of the levels of organizational awareness,
    resources, commitments, and governance toward IoT adoption. This concept aims
    at measuring whether the organizations are capable of adopting the innovations
    [59]. Based on prior studies on the adoption of electronic data interchange, this
    factor considers whether the firms have enough ICT complexity and financial resources
    or not [60]. Ramdani et al. [61] found that organizational preparedness is a key
    factor that determines the adoption of business applications through SMEs. It
    is argued here that organizations with more efficient infrastructures, expert
    staff, and financial support will have higher levels of awareness regarding technology
    adoption. Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis: Hypothesis 8.  Organizational
    preparedness affects the adoption of IoT positively. Company size can also affect
    novel technologies’ adoption, as indicated in prior literature [30]. Large organizations
    can often have more resources available to evaluate the novel technological forms,
    helping them to decide on their adoption. Meanwhile, achievement of the scale
    economies will be more possible for these organizations, while the risks related
    to the adoption of novel technologies will be also reduced [31]. Raguseo [62]
    investigated French firms and stated that the size of organizations affects RFID
    adoption significantly. According to Low et al. [63], organizational size is a
    determining factor that affects the adoption of cloud computing in high-tech industries.
    Matta et al. [64] concluded that organizational size had an important contribution
    when innovations were experimented and implemented. Positive effects of a firm’s
    size can be because large firms can access more resources as well as qualifications.
    Therefore, the following hypothesis is proposed: Hypothesis 9.  Organizational
    size has positive effects on the adoption of IoT. 3.3. Environmental Dimension
    Competitive pressures indicate the amount of pressure felt by organizations from
    competitors in the same industries [63]. Competitive pressures are regarded as
    considerably significant determining factors in the adoption of IT [36,65]. Competitive
    pressures put by competitors and other entities in supporting industries can mainly
    direct the organizations toward innovation [29]. With the increase in market competition,
    organizations may be required to look for competitive advantages with the use
    of innovations. According to Oliveira and Martins [66], the use of innovations
    can reinforce organizational competitive capabilities and create novel strategies
    to perform better than competitors. The first-mover organizations in the application
    of novel technologies tend to obtain the highest degree of benefits. Lin and Lin
    [67] indicated that competitive pressures are critical factors that impact e-business
    diffusion. Adoption of novel technologies is usually a strategic requirement for
    competition in the marketplace. For example, through the adoption of cloud computing,
    organizations can take advantage of more operational productivity, better market
    visibility, and higher correct availability of real-time data [68]. Accordingly,
    we propose the following hypothesis: Hypothesis 10.  Competitive pressures have
    positive effects on the adoption of IoT. Governmental support refers to the initiatives,
    policies, legal domains, and agencies set up by the government to support novel
    technologies or innovations adoption [27,69]. Prior literature shows that governments
    can mainly affect the adoption of special information technologies in small and
    medium-sized business entities [70]. Thus, policies and regulations recommended
    by the government of Malaysia, along with the financial support provided can contribute
    significantly to the promotion of recent technologies’ adoption. Consequently,
    we propose the following hypothesis: Hypothesis 11.  Governmental support has
    a positive relationship with IoT adoption. Information is essential and critical
    in every entity that exists in a dynamic business context. Information intensity
    is associated with the degree of information presence in the products or services
    [71]. Organizations that are in environments with higher information intensity
    will experience a higher possibility of new IT adoption compared to those that
    are in contexts with lower intensities of information [36]. Thus, the information
    intensity of the products in businesses can affect the innovations’ adoption [72].
    Wang et al. [36] mentioned that information intensity would affect RFID adoption
    positively. Consequently, businesses selling information-intensive products or
    services may have a higher potential toward adoption of IoT technology. Thus,
    we propose the following hypothesis: Hypothesis 12.  Information intensity has
    positive effects on IoT adoption. 4. Research Methodology 4.1. Construct Measures
    The fundamental construct measures were chosen according to the available instruments.
    Modification of the items was performed for their fitness to the IoT context.
    Items for the relative advantages were taken from [27], while the items considering
    complexity were obtained from Wang et al. [36] as well as Savoury [73]. Five items
    associated with the compatibility construct were adapted from Arnold and Voigt
    [30] as well as Oettmeier and Hofmann [74]. Items for the support by top management
    were obtained from Sila [57] and Matta et al. [64]. The items associated with
    competitive pressures were acquired from Wang et al. [36], Bhattacharya and Wamba
    [48,75]. Three items of governmental support were taken from Yoon et al. [27].
    The items regarding technological competencies were taken from San-Martín et al.
    [53]. Items associated with the size of organizations were adapted from Wang et
    al. [36]. Four items influencing the costs were obtained from Yoon et al. [27]
    and Shi and Yan [31]. Items related to the technical knowledge as well as information
    intensity were taken from Shi and Yan [31] and Wang et al. [36]. Five items associated
    with the preparedness of the organizations were adapted from [76]. A five-point
    Likert scale with a range from 1 indicating “complete disagreement” to 5 indicating
    “complete agreement” was employed for all items. A summary of the measurement
    items of the independent variables can be observed in Table A1. 4.2. Data Collection
    and Sample Agriculture contributes significantly to the Malaysian economic conditions.
    The agricultural industries have remained critical for the Malaysian government
    for distinct reasons, especially as a source of export income and provision of
    raw materials for industries and to ensure a degree of food security, while increasing
    the levels of income in rural regions, providing employment opportunities, and
    creating new tourist attractions. Qualified respondents, including senior managers
    and decision-makers in Malaysian agricultural organizations, received online questionnaires.
    Most of the organizations belonged to Malaysian agricultural supplies, services,
    products, and farming companies. A random sampling method was employed in this
    paper, through which 630 invitations consisting of the information on the aim
    and scope of the study and direct links to the questionnaires were distributed
    to the respondents by email. Following a two-month interval, 202 completed questionnaires
    were sent back. Detailed checking of the total items of the questionnaires led
    to the removal of some of them, after which 179 questionnaires were regarded to
    have acceptable validity to be used and analyzed for the study purpose. Details
    of the descriptive statistics of the study sample can be observed in Table 2.
    Table 2. Respondents’ characteristics. 5. Data Analysis and Results A two-step
    procedure was considered for data analysis [77]. In this regard, an examination
    of the fitness and construct validity considering the suggested model was conducted
    through the assessment of reliability and discriminant and convergent validity.
    In the next step, the structural model was investigated in terms of the direction
    and strength of associations of the theoretical constructs. 5.1. Measurement Model
    The assessment of measurement item reliability in this study utilized Cronbach’s
    alpha coefficient, composite reliability, and convergent validity for the constructs.
    As shown in Table 3, Cronbach’s α coefficients for all constructs were above 0.70,
    indicating a strong internal consistency. Additionally, the composite reliability
    values surpassed the recommended threshold of 0.70 [77]. This further affirms
    the constructs’ reliability. Based on these results, it is reasonable to assume
    a satisfactory level of reliability for the measurement items [78], This suggests
    strong convergent validity for all measurement items associated with the constructs.
    Table 3. Reliability and convergent validity. According to Fornell and Larcker
    [78], discriminant validity can be observed when the loads of the items on their
    respective constructs are higher than the loads on other constructs, and when
    the square root of AVE values is higher than the inter-construct correlations.
    In Table 4, it is evident that the square roots of AVE values shown on diagonals
    exceed the inter-construct correlations, indicating acceptable discriminant validity.
    To further evaluate discriminant validity, the loadings of the indicators and
    their cross-loadings were examined [79]. The ranges of cross-loadings and factor
    loadings for the constructs are displayed in Table 5, demonstrating that the loads
    on their respective constructs are higher than the cross-loads on other constructs.
    In summary, these analyses illustrate the satisfactory fit of the proposed model
    to the data, confirming the good validity and reliability of the measurement model.
    This lends support to the application of the constructs for evaluating the structural
    model. Table 4. Fornell–Larcker criterion. Table 5. Cross-loading and factor-loading.
    5.2. Structural Model The evaluation of path coefficients using Partial Least
    Squares (PLS) results, along with p-values and t-statistics obtained from bootstrapping,
    was conducted as presented in Table 6 to assess the research hypotheses. The structural
    model was evaluated to scrutinize the hypotheses. Out of the twelve effects assessed,
    nine exhibited statistical significance. Specifically, relative advantages, compatibility,
    technological competencies, costs, technical knowledge, top management’s support,
    organizational preparedness, competitive pressures, and governmental support significantly
    and positively influenced the adoption of IoT. Table 6. Hypothesized relationships.
    Additionally, based on the acquired results, factors like complexity, organization
    size, and information intensity did not show significant contributions to the
    adoption of IoT. It is important to note that a substantial portion of the variance
    in adoption intention, 81.4% (R2 = 0.814), can be explained by the independent
    variables. Figure 2 provides a visual representation of the paths among the constructs
    and their respective coefficients in the structural model. Figure 2. Results of
    the structural model. (The red dash lines indicate insignificant hypothesis).
    6. Discussion and Conclusions 6.1. Key Findings Analysis of the research hypotheses
    indicated that IoT adoption in agricultural industries was affected by relative
    advantages, compatibility, technological competencies, and costs from the technological
    dimension, technical knowledge, top management support, organizational preparedness
    from the organizational dimension, and competitive pressures and governmental
    support from the environmental dimension. Nevertheless, the size of the organization,
    complexity, and information intensity had no impact on IoT adoption. The following
    points can be discussed according to the research results. First, the adoption
    of IoT is positively affected by relative advantages, as shown in a considerable
    number of prior studies [30,68,75]. Accordingly, IoT advantages contribute significantly
    to deciding on the adoption of this novel production approach. Considering IoT,
    innovation is seen as bringing relative advantages from the perspective of automation,
    effectiveness, immediate data availability, and saving costs [80]. Furthermore,
    the present study showed significant effects of compatibility on the adoption
    of IoT, which is consistent with the findings obtained in the relevant literature,
    confirming that perceived compatibility of innovations affects their adoption
    positively [36,81]. Thus, IoT is regarded in line with the current values, demands,
    and previous experiences of the probable adopters. Overall, the application of
    a form of IT is usually more convenient if higher degrees of technological compatibility
    are offered. As the empirical results show, technological competencies affected
    the adoption of IoT positively. Technological resources have been systematically
    regarded as a significant contributing factor in the success of adopting information
    systems [82]. As Jaafar et al. [83] have stated, higher rates of managerial as
    well as technical skills will lead to higher effectiveness in technological preparedness
    and support. Meantime, Lin and Lee [84] have pointed out that organizations having
    staff with the required skills and technical knowledge will potentially have more
    successful development of e-business applications. Moreover, [85] indicated that
    technological competencies have significant contributions in e-business applications.
    Consequently, the implementation of IoT applications needs novel IT skills and
    components, along with adaptation of the available information systems. Therefore,
    it is argued that higher levels of technological competencies lead to more favorable
    conditions for the adoption of IoT, while a lack of these competencies is supposed
    to prevent IoT adoption. According to the results, costs had negative effects
    on the adoption of IoT in the agricultural sector. Perceived costs refer to all
    kinds of expenses that organizations need to pay to adopt novel technologies,
    including hardware, software, and system integration [86]. Prior research has
    considered this factor and concluded that it is one of the primary drivers that
    influence organizational willingness toward IoT adoption [26,87,88]. Based on
    the findings, technological knowledge affected the adoption of IoT significantly.
    This finding is consistent with the results of Shi and Yan [31] according to whom
    technical knowledge affects the adoption of RFID positively in the distribution
    industries related to agricultural products. As Cicibas and Yildirim [89] have
    stated, technical knowledge is important for the decision-makers in the adoption
    processes. Kleinveld and Janssen [90] also indicated that technical knowledge
    relevant to business fields and performance contributes significantly to the IT
    departments and is considered one of the central capabilities in the coordination
    of sourced IT functions. In addition, Priyadarshinee et al. [91] mentioned that
    organizations that have been previously successful in the implementation of information
    technologies will benefit from better technical knowledge, fostering skills to
    implement novel IT solutions and developing a more in-depth perception of the
    economy as well as organizational effects of the novel IT. Consequently, the present
    paper assumes that technical knowledge planning is necessary for the adoption
    of IoT so that the risks of adopting innovations are decreased and special production
    systems can be operated at competitive levels, which will in turn lead to the
    improvement of operational capabilities. This paper indicated that top management
    support and adoption of IoT were positively associated. This result is consistent
    with [73,81]. In addition, Reyes et al. [56] also referred to the fact that higher
    levels of managerial support result in higher levels of RFID adoption. Thus, this
    factor contributed critically to the adoption of IoT because it can affect the
    integration of services, resource sharing, and re-engineering procedures [92].
    Besides, as Wang and Wang [93] stated, with no support and assistance from the
    executive managers, the organization would show more resistance against the adoption
    of IoT. In this regard, top management support can ensure the appropriate allocation
    of the necessary financial resources to implement the recent technologies successfully
    across organizations. Organizational preparedness affected the adoption of IoT
    significantly. This is in line with previous studies on the implementation of
    IT innovations [44,94,95]. Accordingly, the establishment of appropriate organizational
    preparedness seems necessary in the process of recent programs, methods, or policy
    implementation across the organization. Moreover, Iacovou et al. [96] found that
    organizations that are more ready to adopt electronic data interchange face a
    higher possibility of adoption and would benefit more than those that are less
    ready. As a result, with no appropriate technological as well as financial resources,
    organizations are not capable of adopting IoT. Competitive pressures affected
    the adoption of IoT positively and significantly. This is in line with the findings
    of previous literature relevant to innovative technologies’ adoption [31,73,93].
    According to the results obtained in this paper, competitive pressures imposed
    by competitors and other industries result in organizational innovation. As was
    found in the study, intense competitive conditions lead organizations toward technology
    adoption to remain competitive, since they think that IoT adoption helps in these
    competitions. The present paper also indicated that governmental support and adoption
    of IoT were positively associated. This is both reasonable and in line with the
    previous studies [97,98]. The government contributes significantly to the support
    for organizations to adopt new technologies regarding regulations as well as initiatives
    in technologically developing countries [97]. Besides, the government’s understanding
    and planning may have direct or indirect impacts on the expansion of IT/IS and
    accelerate technology adoption [99]. Surprisingly, the technological dimension’s
    complexity did not have significant effects on the adoption of IoT in an agricultural
    context. The complexity of IoT adoption is associated with immature IoT technologies,
    lack of common standards, and difficult integration of this technology with the
    current organizational information systems as well as business processes. Based
    on Zhong et al. [100], the broad scope of IoT devices makes the technology more
    complex across the selection of the product and planning. Thus, complex IoT implementation
    contributes as a significant inhibitor of its adoption. As indicated, information
    intensity was not a significant predicting factor in the adoption of IoT. This
    finding is consistent with the findings of Wang et al. [36], according to whom
    information intensity inhibited the adoption of RFID. Yap [101] stated that organizations
    with higher levels of information intensity will face a higher possibility of
    new IT adoption compared to organizations with lower levels of information intensity.
    Based on Lim Junn [102], businesses in different areas typically indicate a variety
    of information processing requirements, while higher levels of information intensity
    result in a higher possibility of IoT adoption compared to businesses with lower
    levels of information intensity. In other words, agricultural organizations in
    Malaysia need higher levels of information to adopt IoT and enhance their information
    processing capabilities, supporting the information processing perspective. Eventually,
    it was found that the size of the organization does not affect its decision toward
    the adoption of IoT significantly or directly. This is in line with the results
    of Arnold and Voigt [30], who investigated the determining factors of IoT adoption
    in Germany’s manufacturing industries and concluded that organizational size was
    not a significant predicting element in the adoption of IoT. However, it is interesting
    to note that in prior research on technology adoption, this factor had been regarded
    as a significant determinant [63,103]. 6.2. Theoretical Implications IoT represents
    an era of disruptive technologies that offer both advantages and disadvantages
    to organizations. However, its adoption has not been widespread across organizations,
    necessitating a deeper understanding, particularly in the agricultural sector
    [23]. Hence, comprehending the determining factors of IoT adoption in these industries
    is essential. The “Technology-Organization-Environment” (TOE) framework has been
    utilized in previous research to identify technology adoption in various contexts.
    However, IoT adoption in the agricultural industries of Malaysia has not been
    explored using this framework. Thus, the present study undertook the development
    and validation of a research model, applying the TOE framework, to investigate
    the impacts of nine contextual constructs on IoT adoption in agricultural industries.
    This research contributes to the relevant literature in the following ways: This
    paper presents significant results and insights into the factors affecting IoT
    adoption in an agricultural context. Technological, organizational, and environmental
    conditions determine whether organizations employ IoT in the agricultural field.
    Nine factors, namely relative advantages, compatibility, technological competencies,
    costs, technical knowledge, top management support, organizational preparedness,
    competitive pressures, and governmental support, were found to be significant
    in influencing IoT adoption. Governmental support emerged as the most significant
    factor in the adoption of IoT technology in Malaysian agricultural industries,
    followed by compatibility as the second influencing factor. Moreover, this paper
    provides empirical validation affirming the feasibility and effectiveness of TOE
    frameworks in understanding IoT adoption within an organizational context. IoT
    adoption decisions are influenced by technological dimensions on the one hand
    and organizational and environmental factors on the other. The paper also investigates
    two significant predictive factors, governmental support, and compatibility, which
    have rarely been examined in prior research on IoT adoption. 6.3. Practical Implications
    The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technology in agriculture holds immense
    potential to transform farming practices, promoting sustainability, diversification,
    and high yields while minimizing environmental impact. IoT sensors and devices
    enable precision agriculture, allowing farmers to monitor crop health and conditions
    in real time. This data-driven approach optimizes resource use, such as water
    or fertilizer, minimizing waste and reducing costs. By tailoring practices to
    specific crop varieties, climates, and soil conditions, IoT fosters diversification,
    promoting biodiversity and making agricultural systems more resilient. Furthermore,
    IoT-enabled supply chains increase efficiency, match diverse crop distribution
    with consumer demand, and reduce food waste. This combination of data-driven decision-making,
    resource efficiency, and optimized production ensures high agricultural yields
    without compromising long-term sustainability, making IoT a key tool for resilient
    and adaptable farming in the face of global challenges. This paper offers vendors
    and managers a reference framework to analyze organizational conditions before
    embarking on IoT adoption, considering key factors affecting adoption and assimilation.
    The suggested model can be adopted in developing strategies aimed at improving
    an organization’s readiness to use innovations, with a focus on overall organizational
    outcomes. Strategies can be devised to support the successful adoption of innovations
    in agricultural organizations concerning IoT. 6.4. Limitations and Future Directions
    Although this study holds promising implications, it is limited in several aspects.
    The sample comprised agricultural organizations in Malaysia. Given that IoT can
    be applied in various organizational settings across different countries, these
    diverse organizations should be considered in future research. Additionally, the
    determinants investigated here only represent a limited number of probable adoption
    factors. Therefore, future research should concentrate on other factors that have
    been deemed important in previous works, such as technological infrastructures,
    trading partner pressures, and other areas relevant to IoT adoption. Future research
    should also explore alternative methods of data collection, such as grounded theory
    or case studies, to gain a deeper understanding of the influencing factors on
    IoT adoption in new contexts. Author Contributions Conceptualization, M.B. and

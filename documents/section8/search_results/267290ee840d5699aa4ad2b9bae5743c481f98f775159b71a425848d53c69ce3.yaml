    1. Introduction In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the use
    of technology to improve agricultural practices and address the challenges facing
    the farming community. Monitoring and managing soil quality is an essential aspect
    of agriculture, as it directly influences soil yield, resource allocation, and
    environmental sustainability. For farmers to make informed decisions about irrigation,
    fertilization, and other management practices, accurate and timely soil condition
    data is essential. However, conventional soil analysis and monitoring methods
    are frequently time-consuming, labor-intensive, and require specialized knowledge
    sets (Fan et al., 2022, Liu et al., 2020, Toth et al., 2020). Tiny Machine Learning
    (TinyML), an emerging field, offers promising solutions to overcome these limitations.
    TinyML involves deploying machine learning models on Internet of Things (IoT)
    ecosystem devices with limited resources, such as microcontrollers. Real-time
    deployment of complex machine learning models is difficult on these devices due
    to their limited computational memory, and power. Due to the requirement for real-time
    decisions, energy efficiency, and low-latency operations, deploying TinyML models
    for the monitoring and management of soil quality in agriculture presents unique
    challenges. Conventional machine learning techniques, such as Convolutional Neural
    Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Q Learning, are often unsuitable
    for deployment on TinyML devices due to their high computational complexity and
    memory requirements via Information Theory Modelling (ITM) (Micheli et al., 2022,
    Wu et al., 2022, Wu et al., 1 Sept. 1, 2020,) process. In this paper, a power-aware
    and delay-aware TinyML deployment strategy is proposed for the monitoring and
    management of soil quality in agriculture. Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling
    (DVFS), Sleep/Wake Strategies based on Genetic Algorithms, Energy Harvesting,
    and Task Partitioning comprise proposed method reduce energy consumption, reduce
    delay, and maintain accuracy comparable to existing CNN, RNN, and Q Learning algorithms
    by employing these techniques. This research''s primary objective is to develop
    a practical and efficient solution for real-time monitoring and management of
    soil quality, which will enable farmers to optimize resource utilization, increase
    soil yield, and promote sustainable agricultural practices. By deploying TinyML
    models directly on the field using low-power microcontrollers and integrated sensors,
    farmers can continuously monitor key soil quality parameters, such as moisture
    content, pH level, and nutrient levels. This real-time data allows farmers to
    make decisions based on data, respond quickly to changing soil conditions, and
    implement targeted irrigation, fertilization, and pest control interventions.
    The proposed power-aware and delay-aware TinyML model has great potential for
    a variety of real-time agricultural scenarios. Its compatibility with advanced
    machine learning techniques such as CNNs, RNNs, and Q Learning enables the analysis
    of spatial and temporal soil data, thereby facilitating soil disease detection,
    weed identification, and yield prediction. Farmers can efficiently manage agricultural
    operations while minimizing chemical inputs and environmental impact sets by utilizing
    the model''s reduced energy consumption and low-latency capabilities. This paper
    concludes by addressing the need for a power-aware and delay-aware TinyML model
    for the monitoring and management of agricultural soil quality. Combining DVFS,
    Sleep/Wake Strategies based on Genetic Algorithms, Energy Harvesting, and Task
    Partitioning, the proposed model reduces energy consumption, decreases delay,
    and maintains precision. By enabling real-time decision making, this model has
    the potential to revolutionize agricultural practices, increase soil productivity,
    and promote sustainable resource management. The following sections of this paper
    will describe the methodology, experimental setup, results, and implications of
    our proposed approach, thereby providing valuable insights into the application
    of TinyML for agricultural soil quality monitoring and management scenarios. 2.
    Review of existing methods for deploying efficient soil quality monitoring & management
    techniques Numerous models are proposed for deploying monitoring and management
    techniques for soil quality in real-time scenarios. These consist of: Conventional
    Soil Analysis Techniques Conventional soil analysis techniques involve laboratory-based
    techniques that require collecting soil samples, transporting them to a laboratory,
    and conducting various tests to evaluate soil quality parameters and scenarios.
    Although these methods are accurate, they have time, cost, and scalability limitations
    (Agarwal et al., 2021, Chen et al., 1 Sept. 1, 2021,, Hänsch et al., 2021). They
    are not suitable for monitoring and managing soil conditions in agricultural fields
    in real time (Gopalakrishnan et al., 1 March 1, 2021,, Leanza et al., 2022, Tang
    and Yan, 2022). Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs): WSNs are widely used in agriculture
    for soil quality monitoring. These networks consist of sensor nodes that are spatially
    dispersed and collect data on soil moisture, temperature, and other relevant parameters.
    However, there are obstacles regarding energy consumption and scalability. High-power
    sensor nodes and frequent data transmission can rapidly deplete the network''s
    energy resources, resulting in limited deployment range and maintenance issues
    (Efremova, Seddik, & Erten, 2022; Yuan, 2020) through the use of CycleGAN (Generative
    Adversarial Networks) and similar modeling techniques. Remote Sensing: Techniques
    for remote sensing, such as satellite imagery and aerial surveys, provide valuable
    information on soil conditions on a large scale. These techniques can detect large-scale
    patterns of soil quality, plant health, and water stress. Nevertheless, they frequently
    lack the spatial resolution necessary for detailed site-specific monitoring applications.
    Moreover, delays in data acquisition and processing can impede real-time decision-making
    (Li et al., 2023, Ren et al., 2020). Cloud-based systems employ machine learning
    algorithms to analyze vast quantities of soil data gathered by distributed sensors.
    These systems provide a high level of computational power and storage capacity,
    allowing for advanced analytics and decision support. The dependency on cloud
    infrastructure for processing and analysis, however, introduces latency, rendering
    it unsuitable for real-time applications. In addition, it necessitates constant
    connectivity and may be subject to data security and privacy concerns (Lin and
    Hao, 15 April 15, 2021,, Luo et al., 2022). Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):
    CNNs have been implemented in soil image analysis for tasks such as identifying
    soil contaminants and classifying soil types. They are difficult to deploy on
    resource-constrained devices & sets (Cui, 2021, Wong, 2021) due to their high
    accuracy, which necessitates significant computational resources. RNNs have demonstrated
    promise in time-series analysis for soil moisture prediction and soil yield forecasting.
    Nevertheless, their computational complexity and memory requirements can limit
    their deployment on low-power devices and in low-power scenarios (Hong et al.,
    2022, Monsiváis-Huertero, 2022). Reinforcement Learning (RL): In precision agriculture,
    RL algorithms such as Q Learning have been used to optimize irrigation scheduling
    and nutrient management. Despite their efficacy, these methods frequently require
    substantial computational resources and extensive training of temporal instances
    with the Double Instrumental Variable Method (DIVM) for various scenarios (Bannari
    et al., 2020, Yang et al., 2022). To address the limitations of deep learning
    methods, lightweight machine learning algorithms have been investigated. Decision
    trees, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and support vector machines (SVM) are examples
    of algorithms that are computationally efficient and suitable for resource-constrained
    devices and situations. (Carnier, de Abreu, & de Andrade, 2023) These algorithms
    can achieve acceptable levels of precision while minimizing computational complexity.
    Existing methods for deploying efficient monitoring and management techniques
    for soil quality encompass a variety of approaches. Traditional methods of soil
    analysis are precise, but time-consuming and therefore unsuitable for real-time
    applications. WSNs and remote sensing techniques provide valuable data, but energy
    consumption and scalability continue to be obstacles. The machine learning techniques
    CNNs, RNNs, and RL provide accurate predictions, but their use cases can be computationally
    intensive. Cloud-based systems provide a high level of computational power, but
    introduce latency and network connectivity dependency levels. Since crop production,
    resource optimization, and environmental sustainability are all directly influenced
    by soil quality, monitoring and maintaining soil quality in agriculture is an
    essential area of research and development. The accompanying literature review
    provides a synopsis of recent studies and innovations in the field, emphasizing
    the need for a fast, energy-efficient, and secure TinyML model for controlling
    and monitoring soil quality in real time scenarios. Quality control and management
    of soil: Soil quality has a major impact on crop yields, nutrient availability,
    water retention, and agricultural sustainability as a whole (Ren et al., 2022,
    Xu et al., 15 March 15, 2022,, Zhou et al., 1 June 1, 2022,). Efficient methods
    of soil monitoring and management are needed for resource allocation, irrigation,
    and fertilizer optimization in order to boost agricultural growth while minimizing
    environmental repercussions. Monitoring soil by methods like hand sampling and
    laboratory analysis may be laborious and time consuming, and it often fails to
    give real-time datasets & scenarios (Akrasi-Mensah, 2023, Qian et al., 2023, Saputhanthri
    et al., 2022, Wang et al., 15 June 15, 2023,). Therefore, there is a growing need
    for reliable soil monitoring devices that can collect data in real time scenarios.
    New opportunities for agricultural decision-making and real-time soil monitoring
    have emerged as a result of recent advancements in machine learning, data analytics,
    and sensor technologies (Alrubei et al., 2022, Bataineh et al., 2022, Ma et al.,
    2022). Tools like this facilitate the collection of detailed information and the
    development of prediction models for assessing soil quality levels. The deployment
    of machine learning models on resource-constrained devices, such as low-power
    microcontrollers, allows local data processing and real-time analytics at the
    network''s edge. This is known as TinyML. TinyML has attracted a lot of attention
    in the agricultural industry because of its potential for on-site analysis, less
    reliance on cloud computing, and increased battery life of deployed devices &
    scenarios. Several studies have investigated TinyML''s potential uses in agriculture,
    particularly in the areas of crop production prediction, disease detection, and
    irrigation management (Hao et al., 2022, Sadawi et al., 2022, Zheng et al., 2022).
    These studies demonstrate the viability and utility of using machine learning
    models for use in agricultural applications on low-power hardware. TinyML Models
    with Low Energy Consumption: Energy efficiency is crucial when deploying TinyML
    models in low-resource environments. A farm''s viability and battery life are
    both directly tied to how much energy is used. Numerous strategies for enhancing
    TinyML models'' power effectiveness have been proposed by the research community.
    Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) (Deebak et al., 2023, Kaur et al.,
    2022, Zhang et al., 2023) adjusts the processor''s voltage and frequency to suit
    the workload. As per (Goh et al., 2022, Wan et al., 2023) Sleep/arousal Energy
    consumption may be decreased by optimizing the device''s sleep and wake cycles
    using genetic algorithms. TinyML devices may be powered autonomously using energy
    collecting techniques like as solar or kinetic energy (Mishra et al., 2023, Zhang
    et al., 2022) levels. Algorithms for task partitioning distribute workloads over
    a network of computers to cut down on power usage levels. Combining TinyML and
    the IoT Internet Safety: Since they collect, analyze, and transfer sensitive data,
    TinyML and IoT networks need the highest level of security. Any vulnerability
    in a network raises the prospect of hostile assaults, unauthorized access, and
    compromised data. Validation attacks including Finney, Sybil, Masquerading, and
    Man-in-the-Middle attacks are among the many IoT network security challenges that
    have been examined in (Ayub Khan et al., 2022, Li et al., 2022) for real-time
    scenarios. Attacks like this exploit holes in our current systems of identity
    verification, trust, and network infrastructure sets. Researchers have proposed
    using Proof-of-Energy-Efficiency (PoEE), a lightweight consensus mechanism, to
    reduce the energy requirements of blockchain-based systems and, in turn, improve
    their security (Alshehri et al., 2023, Li et al., 2022) levels. Sidechain creation
    using reinforcement learning methods, such as Q Learning, improves network throughput
    and security levels. Methods Currently Available for Assessing and Controlling
    Soil Quality Various approaches to measuring and controlling soil quality have
    been proposed for use in agricultural settings. Data integrity is ensured by using
    ITM (Insertion Through Mining) technologies built on the blockchain. CycleGAN
    (Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Network) generates synthetic soil images
    using deep learning techniques. The DIVM (Decentralized Intelligent Voting Model)
    takes into account soil management decisions. Energy efficiency and security in
    TinyML and IoT networks, soil quality monitoring and management in agriculture,
    the potential of TinyML for real-time analytics, and existing methodologies are
    all highlighted at the end of the literature review. Given this requirement and
    impetus for further study, here propose a TinyML model that is low-energy, secure,
    and quick to run in order to address the drawbacks of existing approaches and
    provide viable solutions for real-time soil quality monitoring and management
    in agriculture process. Thus, researchers have investigated lightweight machine
    learning algorithms and techniques for deploying TinyML models in order to overcome
    these obstacles. These strategies aim to reduce energy consumption, minimize latency,
    and preserve acceptable levels of precision. Utilizing low-power microcontrollers,
    task partitioning, DVFS, genetic algorithm-based sleep/wake strategies, and energy
    harvesting, agriculture scenarios can deploy efficient and real-time soil quality
    monitoring and management systems. 3. Discussion on deploying an efficient power-aware
    & delay-aware TinyML for soil quality monitoring and management in agriculture
    This section discusses the design of a power-aware and delay-aware TinyML model
    for soil quality monitoring and management in agricultural scenarios. As shown
    in Fig. 1, the proposed method combines an enhanced fusion of Dynamic Voltage
    and Frequency Scaling (DVFS), Sleep/Wake Strategies based on Genetic Algorithms,
    Energy Harvesting, and Task Partitioning processes. The goal is to reduce energy
    consumption, minimize delay, and keep precision comparable to existing methods.

    and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) is a power management technique that dynamically
    adjusts the processor''s operating voltage and clock frequency based on the load.
    By adjusting these parameters, the system''s power consumption can be optimized
    while performance requirements are met. DVFS is commonly used to reduce power
    consumption in real-time scenarios for devices with limited resources. In this
    instance, the DFVS Model initially estimates device power using Eq. (1), (1) The
    power consumed by a device is the product of its operating voltage and current,
    thus, by reducing either voltage or current, the power consumption can be reduced
    for different scenarios. Similarly, the energy is estimated via Eq. (2), (2) Similarly,
    the performance level of the device can be observed from Fig. 3, (3) Where, represents
    total instructions executed per cycle, while represents the clock frequency levels.
    Performance is a measure of how many instructions can be executed per clock cycle
    for the clock frequency sets. Download : Download high-res image (413KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Soil Yield Levels used for training the model
    under real-time scenarios. To maintain adequate performance levels while reducing
    power, the clock frequency can be adjusted accordingly for different scenarios.
    Thus, in terms of clock frequency, the energy levels of the device can be estimated
    via Eq. (4), (4) Consequently, the energy consumption of a device is proportional
    to the square of its voltage and clock frequency. By decreasing voltage or clock
    frequency, energy consumption can be reduced significantly for various workloads.
    Voltage and clock frequency are dynamically adjusted based on workload and performance
    requirements to reduce power consumption via DVFS. When the workload is light
    or the computer is idle, the voltage and clock frequency can be decreased to reduce
    energy consumption. In contrast, voltage and clock frequency can be increased
    to ensure adequate performance levels during periods of high computational demand.
    Eq. (5) is used to estimate the Q Level for each classification on the TinyML
    Model in order to accomplish this task, (5) Where, represents total number of
    classifications that were performed on the TinyML Device, while tc & T represents
    total number of correctly classified samples, and total number of samples used
    during the classification process. Similar classifications were done for different
    samples, and a reward value was estimated via Eq. (6), (6) Where, represents a
    discounting factor for the learning process. If the reward value , then there
    is need to modify the Voltage & Frequency levels via Eqs. (7), (8), otherwise
    the Voltage & Frequency is modified via Eqs. (9), (10), (7) (8) Else, (9) (10)
    Based on this process, the model is able to optimize operating frequency for efficient
    DVFS operations. By optimizing the voltage and clock frequency based on the workload,
    DVFS allows for power reduction in TinyML deployments. This technique is crucial
    for resource-constrained devices as it helps extend battery life, reduce energy
    consumption, and enhance energy efficiency without sacrificing performance levels.
    Similar to this, an efficient Genetic Algorithm-based Sleep/Wake Strategy is employed
    to conserve power during idle temporal instance sets. Genetic algorithms are used
    to optimize the sleep/wake scheduling based on historical data and environmental
    conditions. The genetic algorithm iteratively evolves a population of potential
    solutions and selects the fittest individuals for the next generations. To perform
    this task, initially a set of Solutions are generated, and each solution has stochastic
    values of Sleep Cycles (SC), which are estimated via Eq. (11), (11) Based on this
    Sleep Cycle, the TinyML Model is evaluated, and its fitness is estimated via Eq.
    (12) (12) Where, represents the delay needed to perform given classifications.
    Using this fitness value from all solutions, the fitness threshold is calculated
    via Eq. (13), (13) Solutions with are ‘mutated’ and regenerated via Eqs. (11),
    (12), while other solutions are passed directly to the next set of iterations
    via ‘crossover’ operations. This process is repeated for Iterations, and Solution
    with minimum fitness is selected for the final estimation of sleep cycles. This
    process allows for identification of optimal sleep cycles for efficient processing
    of data samples with high-speed levels, and is cascaded with an efficient energy
    harvesting process. Energy harvesting techniques involve capturing and converting
    ambient energy sources (such as solar power, kinetic energy, or thermal energy)
    into electrical energy to power the TinyML devices & samples. This reduces dependence
    on batteries and extends the operational lifetime of the devices under different
    scenarios. Energy harvesting is a technique that involves capturing and converting
    ambient energy sources into electrical energy to power TinyML devices for different
    scenarios. By utilizing energy harvesting, the dependence on batteries can be
    reduced or eliminated, thereby extending the operational lifetime of the device
    and reducing power consumption levels. The power harvested ( ) is initially calculated
    via Eq. (14), (14) Where, is the power efficiency of a given source, while represents
    current levels from that set of sources. The power harvested from the ambient
    energy source is determined by the energy conversion efficiency of the harvesting
    system and the intensity of the available energy sources. The energy conversion
    efficiency represents the effectiveness of the energy harvesting system in converting
    the captured energy into usable electrical power levels. Based on this, the energy
    stored (ES) on the device is estimated via Eq. (15), (15) The harvested energy
    is stored for future calculations. Total stored energy is equal to the product
    of the amount of energy harvested and the amount of time it has been accumulating
    for the given source sets. This stored energy can be used to power TinyML devices
    while they are in operation. The proposed energy harvesting system takes advantage
    of Solar Energy, Thermal Energy, and Radiofrequency Energy, as it is connected
    to farms with abundant Solar Radiation, Heat, and RF signals. Rechargeable batteries
    store the harvested energy. During operation, the stored energy is used to power
    the TinyML device, reducing the need for external power sources. By incorporating
    energy harvesting techniques into TinyML deployments, power consumption was decreased
    and the device''s operational lifetime was increased for various scenarios. This
    allows for continuous and autonomous operation, making it ideal for applications
    in remote or inaccessible environments where frequent battery replacements are
    impractical under real-world conditions. Similar to Sleep Cycle optimizations,
    an effective Task Partitioning Method was implemented, which assisted in reducing
    energy & delay levels for various TinyML operation sets. The power & delay-aware
    task partitioning equation aims to minimize the TinyML system''s energy consumption
    while maximizing task execution levels. The model uses Genetic Algorithm to partition
    tasks stochastically, and then estimates Task Partitioning Fitness using Eq. (16),
    (16) Where, represents Number of Stochastic partitions which were done during
    generation of GA solutions. Based on similar ‘mutation’ & ‘crossover’ operations,
    this model is able to identify efficient value of which can minimize the delay
    & energy levels during execution on TinyML device sets. A combination of these
    methods was deployed on the TinyML device, which assisted in reducing energy consumption,
    reduce delay needed for processing, while maintaining higher accuracy levels for
    different scenarios. The model is able to efficiently perform communications with
    different sensors, and process their data samples with high precision, accuracy
    & recall levels. To further strengthen the deployment capabilities of the model,
    all processed data samples are stored on blockchains. To maintain better energy
    performance, an effective Proof-of-Energy-Efficiency (PoEE) based consensus is
    used while addition of new blocks. The PoEE Model requests an augmented cluster
    of nearby nodes with higher energy efficiency to perform consensus. This is facilitated
    via Eq. (17), where an augmented consensus score (CS) is calculated for each node,
    (17) Where, represents energy consumed by the node during the communication, while
    represents residual energy of the current node, and represents number of communications
    that are done by the node during temporal evaluation process. Nodes with lower
    value of are used for the mining process, which ensures that nodes that have consumed
    lower energy during previous communications, and have higher residual energy are
    selected for the consensus process. These nodes are used to add new blocks to
    the chain, which assists in securing the model from data modification attacks.
    But as the number of blocks increase, the energy requirement for adding these
    blocks also increases. To overcome this issue, an iterative Q Learning based model
    is used to form multiple sidechains. This model estimates an iterative Q Value
    after a stochastic set of communications. The number of stochastic communications
    is evaluated via Eq. (18), (18) Where, is a reward value, which is estimated by
    the Q Learning process (initially set to 1), while is the previous number of communications
    used for the evaluation process. After each set of communications, a Q Value is
    estimated via Eq. (19), (19) Where, THR & d represents the throughput obtained
    and delay needed during these communications. After estimation of this value consecutively
    for more than 2 set of communications, a reward value is estimated via equation
    (20), (20) Where, represents Learning Rate for the model, while represents discount
    factor for the evaluation process. If the value of , then it indicates the current
    set of communications required lower energy consumption, and had higher throughput,
    thus the current blockchain configuration is not modified, else, the blockchain
    is split into 2 equal sidechains. New blocks are added to any of the sidechains.
    This allows the model to securely communicate different data samples while maintaining
    lower delay and lower energy consumption for different communications. Evaluation
    of this model was done in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, delay and energy
    levels in the next section of this text. 4. Comparative result analysis The proposed
    secure, delay-aware & energy-aware model for TinyML deployments uses a fusion
    of DVFS, Energy Harvesting, Sleep Cycle Optimization, Task Partitioning & Q Learning
    with PoEE, which assists in reducing the delay & energy during classification,
    while maintaining higher Precision (P), Accuracy (A), & Recall (R) levels even
    under attacks. To validate performance of this model, this section is segregated
    into 2 parts. Part 1 demonstrates the QoS & classification performance of the
    model under non-attack ideal conditions, while part 2 showcases the QoS performance
    of the model under attacks. This will assist readers to identify model’s performance
    under real-time scenarios. 4.1. QoS & classification performance under non-attack
    (ideal) scenarios In this section, the proposed model is estimated under non-attack
    (ideal) scenario, and levels of precision (P), accuracy (A), and recall (R), were
    estimated under these scenarios. These levels were estimated via Eqs. (21), (22),
    (23) as follows, (21) (22) (23) Where, represents the standard true & false rates
    for different operations. Similar to this, the delay & energy levels were estimated
    via Eqs. (24), (25) as follows, (24) (25) Where, represents timestamps for completion
    & starting the classification operations, while represents residual energy levels
    of the node during different communication operations. These metrics were estimated
    using Mini VGGNet, Tiny ImageNet, and Tiny GoogLeNet Models, each of which were
    tested on the following datasets & samples, • Soil Geographic Databases (https://www.isric.org/explore/soil-geographic-databases).
    • European Soil Datasets (https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/resource-type/datasets).
    • NLDAS Soils Datasets and Illustration (https://ldas.gsfc.nasa.gov/nldas/soils).
    A fusion of these sets resulted in 500 k different image samples, out of which
    400 k were used for training, while 50 k each were used for validation & testing
    use cases. A sample of these images can be observed from Fig. 2, Fig. 3, where
    different disease types, and soil yield levels can be observed for multiple scenarios.
    The model was deployed on a Raspberry Pi Board, and the ensemble techniques were
    integrated in it for multiple classification scenarios. Based on this strategy,
    the precision of classification was estimated and compared with ITM (Wu et al.,
    2022); CycleGAN (Efremova, Seddik, Erten, & Using, 2022), & DIVM (Yang et al.,
    2022), which can be observed from Fig. 4 as follows, Download : Download high-res
    image (128KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Precision levels obtained
    during the classification process. On the basis of this evaluation, it can be
    concluded that the proposed model is capable of predicting soil yield with high
    precision under real-time conditions. Due to the use of true-positive levels during
    the Genetic Algorithm optimization process, this precision is maintained. Similarly,
    the accuracy obtained during these evaluations is depicted in Fig. 5 as follows,

    Fig. 5. Accuracy levels obtained during the classification process. Based on this
    assessment, it can be seen that the suggested model can continue to predict soil
    yields with high accuracy levels in real-time scenarios. Due to the use of true-positive
    levels during the Genetic Algorithm & DVFS Q Learning optimization process, this
    accuracy is preserved. Similar to that, Fig. 6 shows the recall obtained during
    these evaluations as follows, Download : Download high-res image (169KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Recall levels obtained during the classification
    process. This evaluation shows that the suggested model can consistently predict
    disease and soil yield with high recall levels in real-world scenarios. The use
    of true-positive levels during the Genetic Algorithm & DVFS Q Learning optimization
    process ensures that this recall is maintained for different scenarios. Similar
    to Fig. 6, the following can be seen from Fig. 7 regarding the delay required
    during these evaluations, Download : Download high-res image (227KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 7. Delay needed during the classification process.
    On the basis of this evaluation, it can be concluded that the proposed model can
    reduce soil yield prediction delay by 8.5 % compared to ITM (Wu et al., 2022),
    10.0 % compared to CycleGAN (Efremova et al., 2022), and 15.4 % compared to DIVM
    (Yang et al., 2022) under real-time conditions. This delay is decreased due to
    the utilization of ensemble Models that employ Genetic Algorithm & Q Learning
    in conjunction with harvesting optimizations, which aids in high-seed yield prediction
    for various soil types. Similarly, the energy required for these evaluations is
    depicted in Fig. 8 as follows, Download : Download high-res image (291KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 8. Energy needed during the classification process.
    On the basis of this evaluation, it is clear that the proposed model can reduce
    the energy required for soil yield prediction by 15.5 % compared to ITM (Wu et
    al., 2022), 18.3 % compared to CycleGAN (Efremova et al., 2022), and 16.5 % compared
    to DIVM (Yang et al., 2022) in real-time scenarios. Multiple optimizations, such
    as Task Partitioning, Energy Harvesting, Sleep Scheduling, and DVFS operations,
    reduce this energy consumption in real-time scenarios. Consequently, the proposed
    model exhibited optimal levels of accuracy, precision, and recall while maintaining
    a higher rate of operation and reduced energy consumption levels. These features
    enable the model to be deployed for a wide range of TinyML use cases and real-time
    scenarios. 4.2. QoS performance of the model under different attacks To further
    validate the model’s performance under real-time scenarios. It was evaluated under
    Finney, Sybil, Masquerading, and Man-in-the-Middle attacks. The Finney attack
    is illustrative of the kind of validation attacks that may be launched against
    IoT networks. An enemy who is also a miner on the blockchain network conceals
    a valid transaction inside a fraudulent one. The attacker operates in concert,
    launching a network transaction and mining a block that includes it concurrently.
    An adversary may then use the extracted block in a transaction, such as making
    a purchase or sending money. This allows the opponent to gain from the exchange
    without bearing any of the burdens. The Sybil attack is another common kind of
    validation attack in IoT networks. A bad actor creates a network of fake nodes,
    each of which is an identity. The network may be manipulated or controlled using
    these bogus identities. By adopting several false identities inside the network,
    an adversary might trick other nodes into believing false information or taking
    part in malicious activities by exploiting the network''s trust mechanisms. This
    kind of attack has the potential to cause a wide range of security and integrity
    problems, including tampered with data, interrupted communications, and unwanted
    access to sensitive information sets. Masquerade attacks, sometimes called impersonation
    attacks, target IoT networks by assuming the identity of a trusted actor. In this
    kind of attack, sensitive information or resources are accessed by pretending
    to be a trusted device or user. By masquerading as a trusted entity, an attacker
    may bypass protections and carry out malicious activities including taking complete
    control of a device, stealing sensitive information, or executing illegal commands.
    The need of secure access control and authentication mechanisms in IoT networks
    was brought home by this assault. MitM refers to a “man-in-the-middle” assault.
    This validation attack takes advantage of the insecurity of IoT network communication
    channels. An attacker changes legitimate communication between two parties in
    this attack. An attacker may do harm by intercepting communications, tampering
    with the data in transit, or even injecting harmful orders or data. The confidentiality,
    integrity, and validity of the communication might be jeopardized by this assault,
    which could lead to data breaches, unauthorized device control, or other undesirable
    outcomes in the Internet of Things. Secure communication mechanisms, such encryption
    and digital signatures, are needed to combat this risk and safeguard the confidentiality
    and authenticity of information shared across IoT networks. After application
    of these attacks, values of end-to-end communication delay, energy needed during
    communications, throughput during communication and PDR levels were estimated
    for evaluation purposes. A total of 10 % of all network communications were stochastically
    simulated as attacks, and average levels of delay, energy, throughput & PDR were
    estimated for each of these attack scenarios. Based on this strategy, the delay
    levels under attack can be observed from Fig. 9, Download : Download high-res
    image (136KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 9. Average level of delay
    under different attacks. On the basis of this evaluation, it can be concluded
    that the proposed model can reduce delay during communication under attack for
    soil prediction scenarios by 4.5 % compared to ITM (Wu et al., 2022), 12.4 % compared
    to CycleGAN (Efremova et al., 2022), and 8.3 % compared to DIVM (Yang et al.,
    2022) under real-time conditions. This delay is decreased due to the utilization
    of Q Learning for the formation of sidechains, in conjunction with PoEE based
    consensus, which aids in higher-speed of the network even under multiple attacks.
    Similarly, the energy required for these evaluations is depicted in Fig. 10 as
    follows, Download : Download high-res image (235KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 10. Average level of energy under different attacks. On the basis of
    this evaluation, it is clear that the proposed model can reduce the energy required
    for communication by 4.5 % compared to ITM (Wu et al., 2022), 16.4 % compared
    to CycleGAN (Efremova et al., 2022), and 18.5 % compared to DIVM (Yang et al.,
    2022) in real-time scenarios. Multiple optimizations, including Q Learning & PoEE
    consensus, reduce this energy consumption in real-time scenarios. Similarly, the
    throughput levels can be observed from Fig. 11 as follows, Download : Download
    high-res image (181KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 11. Throughput
    levels for different communication scenarios. On the basis of this evaluation,
    it is clear that the proposed model can improve the throughput during communication
    by 10.5 % compared to ITM (Wu et al., 2022), 12.5 % compared to CycleGAN (Efremova
    et al., 2022), and 18.3 % compared to DIVM (Yang et al., 2022) in real-time scenarios.
    This is due to use of throughput during Q Learning optimizations, which assists
    in formation of sidechains. Similarly, the PDR levels can be observed from Fig.
    12 as follows, Download : Download high-res image (153KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 12. PDR levels for different communication scenarios. On
    the basis of this evaluation, it is clear that the proposed model can improve
    the PDR during communication by 1.9 % compared to ITM (Wu et al., 2022), 2.4 %
    compared to CycleGAN (Efremova et al., 2022), and 2.5 % compared to DIVM (Yang
    et al., 2022) in real-time scenarios. This is due to use of PDR during Q Learning
    optimizations, which assists in formation of sidechains. Due to these optimizations,
    the proposed model is capable of deployment for an augmented & wide variety of
    real-time scenarios. 5. Conclusion and future scope In conclusion, this paper
    presents an innovative method for deploying an energy-efficient, secure, and high-speed
    TinyML model designed specifically for agricultural soil quality monitoring and
    management. The proposed model addresses the urgent need for precise and sustainable
    agricultural practices by enabling real-time decision-making in environments with
    limited resources. Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS), Sleep/Wake Strategies
    based on Genetic Algorithms, Energy Harvesting, and Task Partitioning are among
    the optimization techniques incorporated into the model. In comparison to cutting-edge
    techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks
    (RNNs), and Q Learning, these techniques effectively reduce the model''s energy
    consumption by 8.5 % and delay by 10.4 % without compromising accuracy. To ensure
    the security and integrity of the model, a consensus mechanism based on Proof-of-Energy-Efficiency
    (PoEE) is utilized. The model employs a lightweight consensus supported by sidechain
    formation based on Q Learning, which increases security without significantly
    increasing energy needs. The performance of the model is rigorously evaluated
    under multiple attack scenarios, such as Finney, Sybil, Masquerading, and Man-in-the-Middle
    attacks, demonstrating its resilience and efficacy in real-time scenarios. Significant
    practical implications result from the proposed model in the agricultural field.
    By continuously monitoring soil quality parameters like moisture content, pH level,
    and nutrient levels, farmers can optimize irrigation, fertilization, and resource
    allocation, leading to an increase in soil yield and a decrease in environmental
    impact. Incorporating sensors and low-power microcontrollers into the model enables
    on-site analysis and immediate feedback to farmers, thereby facilitating timely
    interventions and treatments. The performance evaluation of the model demonstrates
    its superiority to existing techniques. The proposed model reduces communication
    delay by 4.5 % relative to ITM, 12.4 % relative to CycleGAN, and 8.0 % relative
    to DIVM under real-time conditions. Furthermore, its energy consumption is reduced
    by 4.5 % compared to ITM, 16.4 % compared to CycleGAN, and 18.0 % compared to
    DIVM. The model also demonstrates an increase in throughput of 10.5 % versus ITM,
    12.5 % versus CycleGAN, and 18.3 % versus DIVM, as well as an increase in Packet
    Delivery Ratio (PDR) of 1.9 % versus ITM, 2.4 % versus CycleGAN, and 2.5 % versus
    DIVM. The proposed energy-efficient, secure, and high-speed TinyML model provides
    an innovative solution for real-time monitoring and management of soil quality
    in agriculture. By reducing energy consumption, minimizing communication delay,
    and increasing throughput and PDR levels, the model enables farmers to make timely
    decisions, allocate resources efficiently, and practice sustainable agriculture.
    The model''s efficacy, dependability, and applicability to a vast array of real-world
    scenarios are ensured by the incorporation of advanced optimization techniques
    and robust security measures. With the potential to revolutionize soil management
    practices, the proposed model holds great promise for future agricultural productivity,
    environmental impact reduction, and food security promotion process. CRediT authorship

    resources and agriculture Article 07 June 2021 1 Introductions During the recent
    decades, human activities have changed the environment more significantly and
    largely than in any same period of time in history of the world [1]. Food supply
    process is one of the most resource and energy demanding activities in all societies
    [2]. The sugar industry is one of the most important agri-food industries in the
    world. Similarly, the beet sugar industry plays an important role in the economy
    of Iran by way of farming and creation of employment. Sugar beet cultivated areas
    in Iran in 2020 totalled 93,658 ha, and sugar beet production for the same year
    was 6,225,795 tons [3]. Sugar beet is the third major crop in terms of total tonnage
    produced after fodder corn and winter wheat in Iran. Sugar beet is cultivated
    in 21 provinces of Iran. Most of the farms are located in the West-Azerbaijan,
    Khuzestan, Khorasan-Razavi, Kermanshah, and Hamadan Provinces of Iran on the flat
    areas. During the 2020/2021 production year, Hamadan Province harvested 407,851
    tones sugar beet from 7250 ha of farming area [4]. However, the cultivation of
    sugar beet in farm and processing of sugar in a factory, like all agri-food systems,
    creates environmental impacts through the loss of natural habitats, intensive
    use of land and water, inappropriate use of farm inputs especially chemicals,
    discharge and runoff of polluted effluent, and air pollution. Such environmental
    issues have become increasingly important for the sugar industry as a consequence
    of pressure from conservationists and local communities [5]. Hence, it is important
    for us to understand the details and gain insights on what is happening with our
    products and what we should do to improve them in the long run. One of the main
    tools for the evaluation of food systems is life cycle assessment (LCA) that stems
    from the life cycle thinking paradigm and is intended as a means of holistically
    evaluating such systems from an environmental point of view [6]. Nowadays, LCA
    is an internationally recognised environmental accounting tool which offers a
    standardised framework and methodology for quantifying the environmental impacts
    of a product or a production system throughout its life cycle, which is also known
    as a “cradle-to-grave analysis” [7]. In fact, for crop production, not only on-field
    activities but also all impacts related to the production of farm inputs, such
    as emissions and resource consumption due to the production of fertilisers, are
    included. All impacts are related to one common unit (e.g. 1 ton of white sugar
    in this study) and summarised into environmental effects (such as global warming
    or eutrophication) or even aggregated into a summarising environmental index.
    Such an index allows the ranking of different product or production alternatives
    according to their overall environmental performance [8]. Several studies have
    focused on evaluating the environmental impacts of sugar production from sugar
    beet or sugar cane in recent years. Sugar production in Khorasan Province of Iran
    was assessed using an LCA alongside an energy analysis to determine the impacts
    of various management interventions [9]. This study found that impact categories
    can be managed by keeping natural gas, machinery, diesel fuel, and fertiliser
    inputs low. In another study, Marashi et al. [10] conducted a life cycle assessment
    of sugar production from sugarcane in Khuzestan Province of Iran and determined
    that the electricity and burning crop residue have the highest share of environmental
    problems. A life cycle assessment of sugarcane production and processing in Australia
    was performed to develop an environmental profile of sugarcane as a source of
    bio-products. The application examined was fermentation products from sugar. The
    sugarcane results were compared with results for other sugar producing crops US
    corn and UK sugar beet to gauge its relative environmental performance [11]. Meza-Palacios
    et al. [12] analysed the environmental damage attributable to cane sugar production
    following the life cycle assessment methodology in Mexico. System boundaries include
    sugarcane growing and harvesting, sugarcane transportation, sugar milling, and
    electricity cogeneration from bagasse. The study was carried out by SimaPro software.
    Ramjeawon [13] investigated the life cycle of cane sugar on the Island of Mauritius.
    The study includes the stage of cane cultivation and harvest, cane burning, transport,
    fertiliser and herbicide manufacture, cane sugar manufacture, and electricity
    generation from bagasse. Another study belongs to Mashoko et al. [14] in South
    African cane sugar industry. The system studied includes sugar cane farming, fertiliser
    and herbicide manufacture, cane burning, sugar cane transportation, and sugar
    manufacture. Similar studies for cane sugar industry have been conducted by Yadav
    and Mishra [15] in Baghpat of India; Shukla and Kumar [16] in Central India; Seabra
    et al. [17] for the Brazilian Center-South Region; Hiloidhari et al. [18] in Maharashtra
    of India; Renouf et al. [19] in Australia and Ghani and Gheewala [20] in Pakistan.
    In the mentioned studies, life cycle of sugar production from sugarcane with a
    focus on sugarcane growing was assessed. Several additional studies on sugar beet/cane
    production have been conducted using LCA method; for example, Kaab et al. [21]
    in Khuzestan province of Iran, Brenturp et al. [22] in northeastern Germany, Bazrgar
    et al. [23] and Tahmasebi et al. [24] in Khorasan region in the east of Iran,
    Bennett et al. [25] in the UK and Germany, and Soheili-Fard et al. [26] in East-Azerbaijan
    province of Iran have analysed the environmental burdens of sugar beet/cane growing
    and harvesting process; however, in their studies, the environmental impact evaluation
    is rather limited and sugar milling process were not considered. Therefore, there
    are very few literature studies in which the environmental effects of sugar production
    (from sugar beet) are investigated from a complete life-cycle perspective. On
    the other hand, further research is required at local scales to address unique
    challenges and opportunities. The main objective of this paper is that of evaluating
    the sugar production system of Hamadan region (agricultural phase + industrial
    phase), via a life cycle approach, in terms of environmental indices, in order
    to identify hotspots and possible means of improving the environmental performance
    of the system. The results will be also applicable to those agri-food industries
    that are currently experiencing environmental problems similar to those in the
    studied factory. 2 Materials and methods The present study was structured according
    to the ISO standards 14,040 [27] and 14,044 [28] into four distinct steps: goal
    and scope definition, inventory analysis (LCI), impact assessment (LCIA), and
    interpretation. 2.1 Goal and scope definition, site description, functional unit,
    and system boundaries The goal of this research is to carry out a consideration
    of the important environmental impacts of the sugar production from sugar beet,
    carried out in the Iranian Hamadan Province. The approach for such task, adopted
    in this study, is one that involves the use of the LCA methodology which entails
    the calculation of indices that refer to various potential environmental impacts.
    The final scope is that of identifying the environmental problems in the production
    chain so that precautionary methods can be proposed in other to decrease the environmental
    burdens. The research concerns the Hamadan Province which is located in the west
    of Iran; within 33°59′ and 35°48′ north latitude and 47°34′ and 49°36′ east longitude.
    There is only one sugar mill in the Hamadan Province, located in the Hosein-Abad
    village. This mill is one of the oldest industries in the area with three working
    shifts a day and many worn out facilities. The nominal capacity of the plant is
    approximately 2000 tons of sugar beet and of 260 tons of sugar per day [29]. In
    this province, sugar beet is planted in March and the harvest takes place in the
    autumn of the following year. Deep ploughing is the first practice of beet cultivation.
    Chemical fertilisers and manure are usually applied 2–3 times throughout the whole
    cropping year. In addition, irrigation takes place with water extracted from local
    wells by electric pumps, applied throughout the entire vegetative cycles, depending
    on the plant demand. Grid electricity is used to pump the irrigation water. Since
    sugar beet is sensitive to weed competition, such undesired plants (and insects)
    may be chemically controlled using herbicide and insecticide or manually thinned
    two or three times a year with a hoe during the growing season. Sugar beet production
    is highly labour-intensive in the region, especially during harvesting. After
    such operation, sugar beets are typically transported to the Hamadan sugar beet
    mill. Sugar beet processing operations comprise several steps, including washing,
    slicing (the sugar beets enter the slicer where razor-sharp, corrugated knives
    cut the sugar beets into long, white, french-fry looking strings called cossettes),
    diffusion (in the diffuser, the sugar is diffused out of the sugar beet cossettes
    by using very hot water), juice purification (the raw sugar juice leaves the bottom
    of the diffuser to go through several purifying and filtering steps), evaporation
    (through a series of evaporators, the juice is heated with steam to evaporate
    the natural water and filtered once more, concentrating it into dark caramel syrup),
    crystallisation (the sugar juice syrup is carefully boiled and seeded with microscopic
    sugar crystals to start the crystallisation process), dried-pulp manufacture,
    and sugar recovery from molasses. During the sugar production, process molasses
    and pulp are obtained as by-products. Pulp and molasses are often used as animal
    feed. The functional unit (FU) was defined as one ton of white sugar produced
    in the Hamadan sugar mill, which is equivalent to 6.67 tons of sugar beet production.
    The system boundaries were set from the sugar beet planting to the production
    of white sugar crystals. Figure 1 shows the flowchart of the whole sugar production
    chain divided into two main phases: the agricultural and the industrial one. Fig.
    1 Sources of environmental impacts relative to key processes and inputs in the
    processing of sugar Full size image 2.2 Data collection and assumptions, life
    cycle inventory, and impact assessment The initial data for the farm phase were
    collected from 88 sugar beet farms in Hamadan Province using a face to face questionnaire
    method. Input and output data were measured carefully by farmers and recorded.
    Their recorded data were used in this study analysis. The 88 farms were randomly
    selected from the overall farm population. The required sample size was determined
    using simple random sampling method as below [30]: $$\\mathrm n=\\frac{\\mathrm
    N\\times\\mathrm S^2\\times\\mathrm t^2}{\\left(\\mathrm N-1\\right)\\mathrm d^2+{(\\mathrm
    S}^2\\times\\mathrm t^2)}$$ (1) where n is the required sample size, N is the
    number of holding in target population, S is the standard deviation, t is the
    t-value at 95% confidence limit (1.96), and d is the acceptable error (permissible
    error 5%). Data collected concerning the agricultural phase of sugar beet cultivation
    were diesel consumption for planting operations (soil preparation, seeding, weeding,
    harvesting, and transport), water and energy consumption for irrigation system,
    use of sugar beet seed, machinery, chemicals, manure, and fertilisers. Additionally,
    the sugar beet tuber and leaves produced were considered as products. The data
    was collected from the meeting of the sugar beet producers face to face for the
    whole period of sugar beet planting. The collection of data for the life cycle
    inventory is the extremely error prone and effort-consuming action of LCA studies
    [7]. This entails quantifying and listing all the inputs and outputs entering
    and leaving the analysed system. The amounts of different emissions from inputs
    in sugar beet cultivation per hectare were calculated using emissions coefficient
    of agricultural inputs (Table 1). Specifically, emissions were estimated for the
    production and application of fertilisers (chemical and manure based ones), herbicides
    and pesticides, and burning and fossil fuels used during cultivation practices.
    NH3 emissions to air from the amount of N applied were estimated by considering
    the amount of N used and the emission factors indicated in the IPCC documentation
    [31] as listed in Table 1. The same IPCC information was also used to estimate
    CO2 emissions from urea and direct and indirect N2O emissions from the application
    of N-based fertilisers. Table 1 Some emissions factors used for calculation of
    emissions to air, water, and soil (utilisation of inputs) [31, 35] Full size table
    Common chemicals used for weeds and pest control were Organophosphorus compound,
    cyclic N-compound,and dinitroaniline (pre-emergence herbicides that prevent weeds
    from emerging through the soil surface). The chemical compounds used throughout
    this work were of analytical grade and were used as received. The inventory of
    their production is taken into account together with the cost of their transportation
    to the field. For modelling commercial chemicals, their corresponding chemical
    groups and active ingredients were applied [32]. Regarding pesticide, herbicide,
    and fungicide used in sugar beet cultivation, it was assumed that the total amount
    of active ingredients applied were emitted to soil [33, 34]. Diesel fuel (used
    in farm operations and sugar beet transportation from sugar beet farm to sugar
    mill), electricity, and lubricant consumption for tractors and withdrawal of water
    were calculated according to the recorded data from farmers. In terms of transportation,
    all materials and products involved in the sugar production system were hauled
    by different transport facilities over different distances. In this case, data
    were collected via recorded data from operators. To determine the potential NO3
    and P leaching rate associated with the cultivation of sugar beet, methods developed
    by IPCC [31] were adopted. NO3 and P leaching were estimated by considering the
    amount of N and P used and the emission factors illustrated in Table 1. For the
    industrial phase, data consisted of those collected by using questionnaires and
    of specific primary data from the Hamadan sugar mill. Emissions from fossil fuel
    utilisation, natural gas combustion, lime application, and wastewater treatment
    plant of sugar mill factories were estimated. The emission factors for this study
    were extracted from different scientific sources such as handbooks, government
    publications, and literature searches of appropriate research papers and journals
    [23, 31, 35]. These factors are shown is Table 1. Concerning emissions from wastewater,
    the estimate was based on the amount of total organically degradable material
    in wastewater (kg CODy−1), following the IPCC methodology [36]. Issues concerning
    the allocation of the environmental burdens typically arise when the process under
    study generates co-products, or a main product and by-products. Sugar is the main
    product, and molasses and pulp are by-products in sugar production process. In
    the present study, allocation was solved on an economic basis. Economic allocation
    may be the only feasible and suitable allocation method [37]; therefore, we used
    economic allocation method in the present study and other methods did not used.
    We recommend other allocation methods for future studies. To further interpret
    the data of the LCI, the life cycle impact assessment phase was carried out by
    performing a classification/characterisation, a normalisation, and a weighting
    of the results. The method used in this study was the CML-IA Baseline one (for
    classification/characterisation) and the World 2000 method (for normalisation
    and weighting), according to which the following impact categories were assessed:
    abiotic depletion, abiotic depletion (fossil fuels), global warming (GWP100a),
    ozone layer depletion (ODP), human toxicity, fresh water aquatic ecotoxicity,
    marine aquatic ecotoxicity, terrestrial ecotoxicity, photochemical oxidation,
    acidification, and eutrophication. The analysis was performed with the SimaPro
    9.2.0.1 software package since it is a widely used LCA tool, by both professionals
    and researchers. 3 Results 3.1 General characteristics of sugar beet farms in
    Hamadan The preliminary data results show that the average size of sugar beet
    farms in studied region was 3.13 ± 3.56 ha (mean ± standard deviation of the 88
    questionnaires). The overall sugar beet yield range was 15 to 120 ton ha−1 (mean = 53.47
    ton ha−1). From the interviews, the low sugar beet yield in some cases is partly
    due to the shortage of water availability in the region and irregular irrigation.
    The Hamadan Province is one of the regions in Iran that is suffering an irrigation
    crisis. On average, the farms were located 91.48 ± 35.03 km (mean ± standard deviation)
    away from the sugar mill. 3.2 Inventory analysis of farm phase Table 2 summarises
    the farm phase LCI data used to characterise typical sugar beet cultivation practices
    in the studied province. In the agricultural phase, emissions (to air, water and
    soil) were calculated for the production and use of fertilisers, herbicides, pesticides,
    fungicides, electricity, and fossil fuels used during growing activities. Table
    2 shows the average of the inventories values since the input utilisation of each
    of the 88 sugar beet farms showed a wide variability. Table 2 Inventory of sugar
    beet production (referred to 1 ton of sugar) Full size table The results revealed
    that around 35.90 kg of chemical fertilisers (22.42 kg urea, 4.80 kg diammonium
    phosphate, and 8.68 kg potassium sulphate) and 549.92 kg of farmyard manure were
    required to produce 6.67 tons of sugar beet (1 ton of white sugar, FU) in the
    farm phase. The amount of total diesel fuel and lubricant oil used per FU was
    14.55 and 3.69 L, respectively. The electricity consumption in sugar beet production
    is for irrigation purposes (1564.02 kWh per FU). The total chemical inputs for
    various weed, pest, and disease control in the farm phase (herbicide, pesticide,
    and fungicide) were calculated to be 0.62 kg per FU (Table 2). Soltanpanahi et
    al. [38] concluded that the input amount of chemical fertilisers, diesel fuel,
    and chemicals for sugar beet production in Iran were to be 136.40 kg, 16.90 L,
    and 0.89 kg per FU, respectively. In Turkish sugar beet production, Erdal et al.
    [39] have also reported similar results for chemical fertilisers (52.51 kg FU−1),
    farmyard manure (997.97 kg FU−1), and diesel fuel (18.67 L FU−1). These results
    are in line with the results described in the present study. For studied processes,
    emissions from both production and application of all inputs were computed. Emissions
    to air, water, and soil from chemical fertilisations were estimated separately
    from the manufacture and utilisation phases. Based on the amount of N inputs and
    emission factors from IPCC, the N2O emissions from direct and indirect emissions
    were estimated as 0.83 and 0.27 kg N2O per 1 ton of sugar, respectively. Totally,
    N2O emission from all sources was 1.10 kg N2O per one ton of sugar (Table 2).
    The largest emission contribution comes from fertiliser utilisation (urea and
    diammonium phosphate). N fertiliser application alone contributed 0.69 kg N2O
    (about 62% of total N2O emission). In the same manner, the N2O emissions from
    manure and residue of sugar beet (leaves) were estimated as 0.28 and 0.25 kg N2O,
    respectively. Mashoko et al. [14] reported the total N2O emissions into the air
    for the whole cane sugar life cycle were estimated to be 0.47 kg per ton of sugar
    produced. Ramjeawon [13] reported 0.26 kg of N2O per ton of sugar production from
    sugar cane. Comparing previous result with that estimated in this study (1.1 kg
    per ton of sugar) can be shown that the environmental burdens of this case study
    are greater. CO2 emissions from urea fertiliser utilisation were computed based
    on the IPCC emission factor. In total, emissions of CO2 for sugar beet plantation
    combined with that of human labour respiration and urea utilisation were 88.77
    kg CO2 per on ton of sugar. Table 2 also illustrates other emissions to air, such
    as ammonia (NH3), CO2 emissions from urea, NOx, and diesel combustion emissions.
    As with N2O emissions, NH3 emissions are strongly dependent on the N fertiliser
    rate. Specifically, approximately 4.92 kg (62%) of NH3 emissions is from N fertiliser
    and 3.02 kg NH3 (38%) is from manure. The NOx emissions were estimated from the
    emission of N2O [31]. This value mounts to 0.23 kg NOx per 1 ton of sugar. The
    results show that the average estimate of nitrate leaching per 1 ton of sugar
    produced in Hamadan was 29.79, 16.51, and 17.24 kg NO3, respectively from fertilisers,
    manure, and residue. This implies that a total of 5.11 kg of NO3 leaches per ton
    of sugar beet. Soltani et al. [40] reported 9.72 kg NO3 per ton of wheat in Gorgan,
    Iran, but Bazrgar et al. [23] reported a very low value for sugar beet production
    in Iran (0.16 kg NO3 per ton of sugar beet). Trifluralin, Diazinon, and Tridemorph
    are the three types of chemicals (herbicide, pesticide, and fungicide) that are
    used in sugar beet cultivation in Hamadan. As mentioned above, this study assumes
    a worst case scenario in which all of the active ingredients applied are emitted
    to soil. 3.3 Inventory analysis of the industrial phase The analysis consists
    of all inputs, outputs, and emissions from sugar production process in the mill.
    During this phase, the sugar beet roots brought to the mill are washed in the
    central channel and mechanically sliced into thin strips called cossettes. The
    cossettes are passed into machines called diffusers that contain long vessels
    to extract the sugar content into a juice. The products exiting the diffuser are
    raw beet sugar juice and pulp. The raw juice stays in the lower part of the diffuser,
    while the pulp moves up and out of the top of the diffuser. The cossette pulp
    that exits the diffuser has 95% moisture and a small amount of sucrose. Screw
    presses reduce the pulp moisture to 75%. The pressed pulp is dried in huge drying
    systems and sold as livestock feed. The raw sugar juice to go through several
    purifying and filtering steps. Milk of lime and CO2 are used for the juice purification.
    Coke and limestone are used for the production of CaO and CO2. After purification,
    through a series of evaporators, the thin juice is concentrated to thick juice.
    Further evaporation of water leads to crystallise and growth of crystals. The
    sugar crystals are separated via centrifuges into raw sugar and by-product molasses.
    The raw sugar, which is now 99% pure white sugar, is transported to refinery where
    it is melted to clearing any remaining impurities and then re-crystallised and
    separated according to size [41, 42]. The beet sugar industry uses natural gas
    as a main source of energy. Emissions from fossil fuel combustion were calculated
    by multiplying the amount of energy consumed with the respective emission factor.
    The inventory of the industrial phase is shown in Table 3. The beets were transported
    to the sugar factory by lorry. Table 3 Inventory of the industrial phase (transport
    and milling stages) referred to the FU (1 ton of sugar) Full size table 3.4 Life
    cycle impact assessment Table 4 shows the characterisation results, per impact
    category, of the agricultural and industrial phases of sugar production. To better
    interpret the LCA indicator values, the results are analysed separately for the
    agricultural (beet production) and the industrial (sugar production) phases. Table
    4 Characterisation results of sugar beet and sugar production Full size table
    Renouf et al. [19] for cane sugar production in Australia reported EP, AP, TEP,
    and GWP as 0.39 kg PO4 eq, 0.83 kg SO2 eq, 225.3 1,4-DB, and 77.9 kgCO2 eq. per
    1 ton sugarcane delivered to mill, respectively. Soheili-Fard and Kouchaki-Penchah
    [26] for sugar beet production in East Azerbaijan province of Iran reported ADP,
    AFDP, GWP, ODP, HTP, FAWP, MAEP, TEP, POP, AP, and EP as 6.56 × 10−4 kg Sb eq,
    8.96 × 10+2 MJ, 7.57 × 10+1 kgCO2 eq, 3.75 × 10−6 kgCFC-11 eq, 5.88 × 10+1 kg
    1,4-DB eq, 1.89 × 10+1 kg 1,4-DB eq, 4.82 × 10+4 kg 1,4-DB eq, 5.37 × 10−2 kg
    1,4-DB eq, 3.26 × 10−2 kg C2H4 eq, 4.83 × 10−1 kg SO2 eq, and 6.73 × 10−1 kg PO4
    eq, respectively. Similar results are reported by Rahimian [43] in West Azarbayjan
    Province of Iran. Comparing results of Australian sugarcane production and East
    and West Azerbaijan province with those estimated in this study (Table 4), it
    can be shown that the environmental burdens of this case study are greater. The
    global warming potential (GWP) index is a general and often used environmental
    performance index [34]. The results in Table 4 indicate that the global warming
    is 3.21 × 103 kgCO2eq per ton of sugar. In cane sugar production of India, this
    value in reported 324 to 824 kgCO2eq per ton of sugar [18]. Figure 2, which refers
    to the percentage contribution of the agricultural activities and inputs to each
    impact category indicator values referring to the agricultural phase, shows that
    most of GWP is due to electricity use (68%). Ghani and Gheewala [20] reportetd
    that GWP was predominantly caused by the production and application of mineral
    fertilisers, followed by use of diesel and electricity for irrigation at the agricultural
    stage of sugar cane production. Table 4 also indicates that this electricity use
    in the agricultural phase is also responsible for 90% of the fossil fuel depletion
    indicator, 80% of the ozone layer depletion indicator, 55% of the human toxicity
    indicator, 63% of the marine aquatic ecotoxicity indicator, and 82% of the photochemical
    oxidation indicator. Such large electricity consumption in sugar beet production
    is due to irrigation purposes. Fig. 2 Characterisation diagram of sugar beet production
    –percentage contribution of the agricultural activities to the different potential
    impact indicators of the agricultural phase (referred to 1 ton sugar) Full size
    image The results also show that on-farm emissions also give a large contribution
    to all impact categories indicator values associated to the agricultural phase,
    especially in terms of GWP (20%), fresh water aquatic ecotoxicity (67%), terrestrial
    ecotoxicity (56%), acidification (61%), and eutrophication (91%) categories. On-farm
    emissions are mainly due to the application of chemical fertilisers. Therefore,
    it can be concluded that the role of chemical fertilisers (production and application)
    in the all impact categories are critical. In order to compare the all impact
    categories, normalised and weighted values were employed. All impact categories
    have the same weight, and the unit nanopoint (nPt ton−1) was used to represent
    the weighted values in this study. Weighted results of impact categories concerning
    the agricultural phase are shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3 Weighted results of impact
    categories concerning the agricultural phase (referred to the production of 1
    ton sugar) Full size image As shown in Fig. 3, the main environmental impacts
    of beet cultivation were identified as those relating to marine aquatic ecotoxicity,
    human toxicity, acidification, and eutrophication. The dominance of the marine
    aquatic ecotoxicity impact category has been exacerbated by the electricity consumption.
    In Iranian farming systems, electricity is a subsidised input, which has encouraged
    excessive use of this energy source in sugar beet farms. Production of chemical
    fertilisers, especially urea, has the second role on score of marine aquatic ecotoxicity.
    Figure 3 also indicates that acidification and eutrophication were mainly affected
    by on-farm emissions, especially air emissions of nitrogen oxides and ammonia
    and nitrate leaching respectively. Characterisation results concerning the industrial
    phase are illustrated in Fig. 4. Specifically, Fig. 4 refers to the percentage
    contribution of the sugar producing activities to each impact category indicator
    value referring to the industrial phase. The figure indicates that use of natural
    gas production contributes considerably to the following LCA indicators: fossil
    fuels depletion (83.3%), ozone layer depletion (62.2%), human toxicity (72%),
    fresh water aquatic ecotoxicity (83.6%), marine aquatic ecotoxicity (82.6%), photochemical
    oxidation (66.1%), and acidification (68.7%). Emissions from the combustion of
    natural gas in the sugar mill are the next factor that has the highest impact
    on the environment. For example, natural gas combustion accounts for GWP due to
    combustion of natural gas was 79.5%. Other relevant factors contributing the results
    illustrated in the graph are the use of electricity use and wastewater production
    and management. Fig. 4 Contribution of production and use of inputs to environmental
    impact categories in industrial phase Full size image For all of the impact category
    indicators (except fossil fuels depletion), the share of agricultural phase is
    greater than industrial phase (Fig. 5). For example, as can be seen from Fig.
    5, 52.02% of total GWP, 78.92% of total acidification, and 95.61% of total eutrophication
    are due to the agricultural phase, while 47.98%, 20.09%, and 4.39% are due to
    the industrial phase, respectively. Similarly, Meza-Palacios et al. [12] in sugar
    production from sugar cane reported that sugarcane growing and harvesting had
    the most severe impact on the sugar production system (52%). In Mauritius, also,
    similar results are reported [13]. Fig. 5 Share of impact categories for agricultural
    and industrial phases (referred to 1 ton sugar) Full size image 4 Discussion 4.1
    Comparison of results with other studies The results of this study are in-line
    with other results found in literature. For example, the results of present study
    showed that electricity accounted for the greatest share of the impact for agricultural
    phase, followed by chemical fertilisers. Similarly, Hiloidhari et al. [18] in
    cane sugar production reported that the main emission contributors at the cultivation
    stage are the electricity consumption (mainly coal-based) for irrigation and application
    of chemical fertiliser. Khoshnevisan et al. [44] in their Iranian rice production
    study reported that electricity and chemical fertilisers have a high contribution
    to the environmental burdens. Yousefi et al. [45] in their study on sugar beet
    production of Iran concluded that most of the GWP was also derived from electricity
    and chemical fertilisers respectively. Nabavi-Pelesaraei et al. [46] in sugar
    beet cultivation reported that GWP is mainly due to the generation of electricity.
    Crutzen el al [47]. showed that the N2O emissions from chemical fertilisers contributed
    highly to the GWP indicator. Hillier et al. [48] reported values of carbon footprint
    for major crops from UK. They found that over 75% of the total emissions in crop
    production resulted from nitrogen fertiliser use. Seabra et al. [17] estimated
    a total of 234 kg CO2 eq per ton of raw sugar (from sugar cane); Meza-Palacios
    et al. [12] estimated a total of 1156.1 kg CO2 eq per ton of raw sugar, and Mashoko
    et al. [14] reported 383 kg CO2 eq per ton of raw sugar. Compared with 3210 kg
    CO2 eq estimated in this analysis, it shows that the environmental burden was
    much higher in this case study. On the other hand, around half of the acidification,
    eutrophication, fresh water aquatic ecotoxicity, and terrestrial ecotoxicity of
    sugar beet production are related to field emissions, which comprising CO2 and
    N2O released from fertiliser application, P loss in runoff, NO3 leaching, and
    NH4 volatilisation from urea. Other minor contributors are transport and machinery
    operation. These emissions are the key factor influencing variability in GWP,
    AP, EP, TEP, and FAWP. As mentioned before, the emission factors derived in this
    study are higher than those used in other studies of sugar beet/cane production
    [13, 14] that deserve serious attention. Mousavi-Avval et al. [34] in concerning
    canola production reported that the marine aquatic ecotoxicity, eutrophication,
    and acidification categories had much higher weighted indicator results compared
    to other categories. The results are also consistent with those of present study.
    4.2 Improvement options Sugar beet is a high water use crop. Sugar beet grown
    in the Hamadan conditions requires approximately 166 m3 of water per ton of cultivated
    beet. Since water in the Hamadan Province is located at deep soil sub levels and
    since out-dated methods for irrigation are used, a high consumption of electrical
    is associated to the cultivation phase. This leads to high indicator values of
    ADP, GWP, ODP, HTP, MAEP, and POP associated to the agricultural phase. Thus,
    a soil water monitoring scheme should be implemented to improve the efficiency
    of irrigation systems and reduce the associated environmental impacts. In practice,
    more appropriate irrigation practices should be used, for example, scheduling
    of irrigation to enhance water use efficiency (the most effective irrigation scheduling
    is ideally based on day-to-day monitoring of field conditions), adoption of water-saving
    irrigation methods such as drip irrigation systems, better assessment of whether
    irrigation is strictly necessary, and the adoption of general actions to preserve
    soil moisture such as mulching appear to be particularly important considerations
    in the reduction of environmental impacts. Simulation modelling, in combination
    with field trials, may be able to contribute to the formulation of useful recommendations
    for best irrigation management practices [11]. However, the implementation of
    such practices and technologies on behalf of the farmers seems difficult since
    water is free in Iran and the benefits for the farmer of upgrading the irrigation
    system are unlikely to justify the investment required. Therefore, improved irrigation
    systems will need to be accompanied by a shift in willingness of farmers to pay
    user fees for services. Such shift will need to be prompted by new agricultural/economic
    policies. Indicator values of impact categories such as EP, AP, TEP, FAWP, HTP,
    and GWP are increasingly dependent on on-farm emission due to the usage of chemical
    fertilisers. These indices can be significantly decreased by improving fertilising
    management practices and lowering crop fertilisation. Specifically, the structure
    and chemical content of the soil should be identified, and the most appropriate
    type of fertilisers should be selected. Typically soil testing is used to diagnosis
    or prognosis of nutrients in the soil before the crop is planted, and subsequently,
    fertiliser suggestions are suggested based on these data. Further reductions in
    the on-farm emissions through usage of chemical fertilisers may be achieved through
    practices that involve increasing the soil organic matter content. In a sugar
    beet crop, a greater proportion of N is found in the leaves than in the roots
    [5]. Consequently, beet tops (leaves) could be left in the field after harvest
    as a form of organic fertiliser. Such activities decrease the risk of nitrate
    leaching [49]. In the industrial phase, production and combustion of natural gas,
    electricity use, and wastewater management contribute the most to the impact categories.
    Therefore, precautions that optimise these inputs and process can help to minimise
    environmental burdens. For example, implementing mill technological upgrades,
    to reduce fossil-fuel inputs, including the use of renewable energies such as
    biogas and solar energy may help to reduce the natural gas and electrical energies
    consumption. Furthermore, in the mill, oversized pumps are installed to satisfy
    the any future requirements during renovation and expansion. This is an incorrect
    approach and may result in recurring loss of power. Therefore, pumps and motors
    should be carefully selected. There are several other actions and precautions
    that can help to minimise energy losses and environmental burdens. These include
    the following: Periodic boiler monitoring and maintenance can increase the boiler
    efficiency whilst minimising emissions. All pipe lines, tanks which convey or
    receive hot juices, steam, bled vapours, etc., should be correctly lagged to avoid
    radiation and condensation losses. Technology interventions, like employing low-voltage
    variable speed drives (VSDs) to optimise the energy efficiency of electrical equipment
    in the mill such as pumps, fans, conveyors, and centrifuges, can contribute improve
    the industry’s competitiveness by saving energy and lowering maintenance costs.
    As mentioned, wastewater in the Hamadan sugar mill is also a source of environmental
    burdens. To reduce such burden, an improvement of water efficiency in sugar-processing
    operations, via the use of technologies that use systems which recycle processing
    water, is necessary. For example, recycling of the water used in beet processing
    reduces the total volume consumed and can contribute to reducing volumes of wastewater
    effluent ultimately generated for disposal. Another available treatment option
    for the wastewater of mill is disposal on land for irrigation. But this option
    has not indicated favourable results due to accumulation of mud on the field and
    due to aspects concerning odour and large land necessity. This problem can be
    avoided by using only some part of the available field space for such irrigation
    and using that same land for the next years for growing crops and vegetables [50].
    Finally, in sugar mills, recycling of cooling and condensate water, minimising
    and prevention of spillage and leakages, and installation of efficient entrainment
    separators are approaches that can be adopted for water conservation. For example,
    Vaccari et al. [51] reported an innovative system that entails cooling, crystallisation,
    and micro-filtration of raw beet juice which can lead to considerable water reuse
    and consequent minimised use of external fresh-water. The paper focuses not only
    on identifying the environmental indices, but also contributes to recognition
    of the most effective ways to solve the environmental problem under a country’s
    real conditions. The outcomes of this study can provide critical information for
    the sustainable development of sugar production and application systems, and it
    is useful for all stakeholders, including policymakers, investors, scholars, sugar
    beet factory owners, and farmers. 5 Conclusions In this research, the environmental
    impact of sugar production in Iran was investigated by calculating indices, via
    an LCA approach, concerning potential environmental impacts associated to the
    whole life cycle of sugar beet production. Based on the findings of this analysis,
    the indices highlighted that electricity consumption had the most substantial
    effect on all impact categories in the agricultural phase. In order to reduce
    the electricity consumption, new and modern equipment of irrigation with high
    efficiency can be proposed. To avoid farmers from being discouraged to implement
    such new methods, new agricultural and economic policies need to be implemented
    that overcome the fact that irrigation water is free and electricity is subsidised
    for agricultural purposes. Chemical fertiliser use resulted as another input that
    had a notable effect on all impact categories in the agricultural phase. Many
    environmental impacts of sugar beet cultivation could be reduced by the adoption
    of what would widely and commonly be regarded as good agricultural operations.
    Using processed poultry manure, modern irrigation systems, reducing excessive
    water consumption, renewable energy sources, etc., are good practices for reducing
    environmental impacts of the cultivation phase. In the sugar Hamadan mill, natural
    gas, electricity, and wastewater had the highest contribution to indices of the
    on the impact categories. Iranian sugar mills are very old and are equipped with
    worn-out equipment in Iran. The sugar industry must strive for the substitution
    of old machinery and equipment to reduce the environmental impact of its activities.
    Furthermore, the recycling and reuse of hot condensate water can reduce the water
    consumption and wastewater burdens. Concluding, for an effective implementation
    and management of the above-mentioned improvements, needed to prevent environmentally
    damaging processes ascribable to sugar production, the respective costs should
    in principle be supported by the industry itself, but governments should intervene
    with subsidies when the costs of such actions cannot be recovered using market
    mechanisms. Data availability Not applicable. Code availability Not applicable.

    In the 21st century, the global population has become predominantly urban, with
    more than half residing in cities, marking the era of urbanization (Kabisch and
    Haase, 2011, Zhao et al., 2020, Guo et al., 2022). This trend has been fueled
    by the rapid advancements in information technology, which have accelerated urban
    growth, commonly referred to as the third wave of urbanization (Cohen, 2006).
    According to projections, urban areas are expected to accommodate more than 70
    % of the global population by the year 2050, solidifying their role as primary
    hubs for economic growth and inventive activity (Ferrão & Fernández, 2013). Presently,
    the 600 largest cities worldwide generate approximately 80 % of the global GDP
    (Cadena et al., 2012). However, urbanization has brought with it challenges such
    as air pollution, climate change, high energy consumption, and increased pressure
    on urban infrastructure, especially in developing countries (Singh et al., 2020).
    To tackle these issues, there is an urgent need for systematic integration of
    all dimensions of urbanization with smart technology while preserving urban natural
    resources. Traditional urban planning and governance approaches must be revamped
    to cater to the development of 21st-century cities with a holistic view of all
    dimensions of urbanization (Hall & Pfeiffer, 2000). The notion of smart cities
    has surfaced as a potential remedy for urban challenges in contemporary times,
    particularly in the domain of urban planning and development (Neirotti et al.,
    2014). This approach to urban planning involves incorporating the capabilities
    of both the physical and digital worlds to address urban issues. The utilization
    of sophisticated information and communication technologies, together with the
    enormous amount of data generated in urban areas, offers unparalleled prospects
    for addressing significant urban challenges. One of the key components of a smart
    city is the ability to access real-time information on citizens'' actions and
    preferences. This access enables the identification and recognition of behavioral
    and normative patterns to understand what is happening at both city-wide and individual
    levels. Currently, many countries worldwide explore virtual world approaches and
    solutions to resolve urban problems. However, due to different perspectives in
    various scientific fields, the concept of a smart city lacks an official definition
    (Lai et al., 2020; Silva et al., 2018; Yin et al., 2015). The sustainable management
    of natural resources and urban green spaces poses a significant challenge as cities
    continue to expand. Urban green spaces, including parks, gardens, and trees, play
    a vital role in providing ecosystem services such as air purification, regulation
    of microclimates, noise reduction, and opportunities for recreation and social
    interaction. However, the rapid growth of urban areas exerts pressure on these
    valuable spaces. To ensure the development of smart cities, it is essential to
    implement effective planning and management strategies for urban resources, urban
    air pollution, urban climate and green infrastructure (Shang & Luo, 2021; Guo
    et al., 2022; Ban et al., 2023; Yin, Liu, Liu, Zheng, & Yin, 2023). Economic downturns
    have been a driving force behind the trend of cities transitioning toward smartness.
    To attract skilled labor and compete on the global stage, cities began seeking
    smart and innovative solutions to overcome economic challenges. Moreover, cities
    require resources to generate wealth and become centers of global competition.
    In the present era, service-based economies dominate the global market, and cities
    play a vital role in this competitive landscape. Consequently, cities must create
    a favorable and high-quality environment to entice the creative classes and stimulate
    further wealth generation and economic competitiveness. Furthermore, cities seek
    to attract young, educated, and skilled labor, address urban challenges, and create
    high-quality living standards to appeal to the creative class. Smart cities offer
    greater resilience against economic crises. By utilizing smart technologies, cities
    can improve their economy, generate greater income, and enhance their resilience
    against economic crises. Additionally, smart systems can optimize resource management,
    improve the environment, and reduce administrative and operational costs, which
    all contribute to building resilience against economic downturns (Camero & Alba,
    2019; Chamoso et al., 2018; Meijer & Bolívar, 2016). Cognitive collective changes
    are a significant driving force behind the trend of cities transitioning towards
    becoming smart, and aim to put an end to the destruction of urban capabilities.
    This trend aims to put an end to the destruction of urban capabilities and enhance
    the quality of life for residents through technological, political, and economic
    forces. One of the main reasons for this shift is the expected global population
    growth of elderly individuals, which is anticipated to double in the next decade.
    As a result, urban infrastructure must adapt and become compatible with these
    changes, and significant transformations are expected in the healthcare and elderly
    care sectors. Smart cities play an essential role in this regard, and one of their
    key functions is to assist the elderly and people with disabilities in performing
    daily tasks (Anthopoulos, 2015; Farmanbar et al., 2019; Ramírez-Moreno et al.,
    2021). By reducing the need for in-person visits to medical centers and performing
    administrative tasks, smart cities can significantly enhance the quality of life
    for these individuals. Various technologies can be utilized to achieve this goal,
    such as smart homes, transportation services, healthcare services, and social
    engagement platforms. Smart homes are equipped with sensors and smart devices
    that can monitor the health and wellbeing of elderly or disabled residents. For
    example, sensors can detect if a person has fallen or is having difficulty moving
    around the house and alert caregivers or emergency services if necessary. Smart
    cities can also provide transportation services that are accessible and convenient
    for the elderly and disabled, including on-demand ride-sharing services, specialized
    transportation services for people with disabilities, and public transportation
    systems that are designed to be accessible to all. Moreover, smart cities can
    use telemedicine and remote monitoring technologies to provide healthcare services
    to the elderly and disabled. This can include virtual consultations with doctors,
    remote monitoring of vital signs, and medication management systems. Lastly, smart
    cities can use technology to help the elderly and disabled stay connected with
    their communities and social networks, including virtual social events, online
    support groups, and other digital platforms that facilitate social interaction
    (Kasznar et al., 2021; Mohammed et al., 2014; Razmjoo et al., 2022). In recent
    times, there has been a notable transformation in the urban paradigm due to the
    utilization of technological progress. The emergence of information and communication
    technology has brought about a revolutionary shift in the development of cities,
    enabling seamless interconnectivity among citizens, businesses, and institutions,
    reminiscent of a complex neural network. Therefore, connectivity is a crucial
    aspect of urban life that can be achieved through technological advancements.
    Various technologies can facilitate urban communication, such as the Internet
    of Things (IoT), 5 G networks, smart traffic systems, electronic payment systems,
    social networks, and smart citizen support systems. By utilizing sensors, smart
    devices, and communication technology, IoT allows cities to collect information
    about the external environment, energy consumption, and traffic, enabling better
    and more sustainable urban management (Calvillo et al., 2016; Lara et al., 2016).
    Moreover, 5 G networks provide high-speed wireless communication with less delay,
    allowing cities to use faster internet for public networks and machine-to-machine
    (M2M) communications. Smart traffic systems gather and analyze traffic information
    using sensors and smart devices, enabling cities to better manage traffic. Electronic
    payment systems allow citizens to make online payments easily and use electronic
    money transfers, while social networks enable citizens to communicate with each
    other and share information about events, locations, and urban services. Additionally,
    smart citizen support systems allow citizens to easily communicate with different
    urban departments and receive services such as reporting urban problems, viewing
    traffic status, and requesting urban services. These technologies and many others
    can enable cities to improve urban communication and provide the necessary infrastructure
    for a smart city. Through the use of advanced technologies, cities can enhance
    their economic competitiveness and create higher living standards for their citizens
    (Ammara et al., 2022; Gupta et al., 2021; Zhuhadar et al., 2017). The rapid expansion
    of urban areas in modern societies, encompassing both developed and developing
    regions, has emphasized the pressing necessity for effective urban management
    (Y. Li et al., 2023; Luo, Wang, & Li, 2023; Yin et al., 2023). Scholars have conducted
    numerous research studies aimed at identifying various parameters associated with
    the process of urbanization (Chen et al., 2022; X. Li et al., 2023; Shang & Luo,
    2021; Xiao et al., 2023). In this context, the exploration of different technological
    advancements and a comprehensive review of prior research findings can significantly
    contribute to the analysis and understanding of diverse urban challenges (Cheng
    et al., 2017; Hu et al., 2023; Li et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2022; Wang & Tao,
    2023). The extensive body of literature on the investigation of various technologies
    in recent years highlights the crucial importance of embracing contemporary technological
    advancements to effectively address the complexities of present-day urban issues
    (Ding et al., 2023; B. Guo et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2021; J. Luo et al., 2023;
    Tong et al., 2023). Consequently, harnessing a wide range of information sources
    and conducting further investigations can play a pivotal role in addressing critical
    concerns such as the expansion of information networks, the promotion of sustainability,
    and the advancement of smart city initiatives (Y.-K. Fang et al., 2023; Liu et
    al., 2023; J. Luo et al., 2023). As a result, a considerable number of studies
    have been undertaken in recent years within the fields of technology, smart cities,
    and the dissemination of information to advance our knowledge in these areas (Lv
    et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2022; Kafiliveyjuyeh & İlhan, 2017). Despite the widespread
    focus on leveraging technology for sustainable urban development, limited scholarly
    attention has been given to the integration of urban green spaces and smart technologies
    as a means of fostering sustainability. This study aims to bridge this research
    gap by examining the potential of smart cities to enhance environmental, social,
    and economic sustainability through the synergistic utilization of green spaces
    and advanced technologies (Gharaibeh et al., 2017; López-Quiles & Rodríguez Bolívar,
    2018; Xiong et al., 2012). In Europe, smart cities prioritize energy and sustainability
    concerns, which are critical for ensuring a superior standard of living in urban
    areas. The rapid pace of urban expansion calls for intelligent approaches to tackle
    forthcoming challenges. Smart cities harbor an ecological outlook, with a fundamental
    aim of utilizing technology to bolster sustainability and facilitate superior
    management of natural resources. Smart cities encounter various challenges when
    it comes to managing natural resources. One of the primary obstacles is the large
    amount of data needed to manage natural resources, efficiently (Mohamed et al.,
    2020; van Twist et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2021). Although smart cities are dependent
    on data, the management, analysis, and application of this information can be
    challenging, necessitating substantial investments in technology and infrastructure.
    Another challenge is the allocation of resources effectively and efficiently to
    achieve sustainable outcomes while balancing short-term goals with long-term sustainable
    development plans, despite the emphasis on sustainability. Developing sustainable
    infrastructure is another challenge for smart cities. Sustainable management of
    natural resources, such as renewable energy systems, requires significant investments
    and long-term planning, which can be challenging for smart cities. Citizen engagement
    in the management of natural resources is essential for the success of smart city
    initiatives. Nevertheless, achieving citizen participation can be challenging,
    necessitating effective communication strategies and the provision of relevant
    information to citizens. Furthermore, smart cities require supportive policy and
    regulatory frameworks to implement sustainable initiatives successfully. However,
    these frameworks may be intricate and require coordination across multiple government
    levels and stakeholders (Djahel et al., 2014; Kumar et al., 2018; Rodríguez Bolívar,
    2016). Smart cities are emerging as a potential solution to address various urban
    challenges, including improving efficiency, sustainability, safety, citizen engagement,
    and quality of life. By utilizing data and technology, smart cities can optimize
    the use of resources such as energy, transportation, and water, resulting in increased
    efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Additionally, promoting sustainable practices,
    such as reducing waste, utilizing renewable energy sources, and promoting green
    spaces, can help limit the adverse environmental effects of urbanization. Moreover,
    smart cities can enhance safety by utilizing sensors, cameras, and other technologies
    to monitor and detect potential hazards such as traffic accidents, crime, and
    natural disasters, facilitating faster and more efficient responses (H. Kim et
    al., 2021; Ruhlandt, 2018; Talari et al., 2017). Citizen engagement also improves
    in smart cities by using technology and data to involve them in decision-making
    processes, providing them with better information to make informed decisions on
    the development of their communities. Lastly, the concept of smart cities has
    the potential to enhance the well-being of urban inhabitants by offering improved
    access to crucial services such as healthcare, education, and public transportation,
    while concurrently establishing more habitable and inclusive urban environments.
    This renders smart cities an auspicious approach to tackling urban challenges
    by optimizing resource allocation, promoting sustainability, enhancing safety,
    engaging citizens, and elevating their quality of life through the application
    of data and technology. However, there are potential challenges to address, such
    as the high cost of implementation, data privacy and security issues, equitable
    distribution of benefits, citizen participation, and coordination between stakeholders
    to ensure the sustainability of these solutions (Hancke et al., 2012; Kummitha
    & Crutzen, 2017; Sánchez-Corcuera et al., 2019). The implementation of smart cities
    poses a range of challenges that must be tackled to effectively harness their
    potential advantages. A prominent obstacle is the considerable expense associated
    with deploying smart infrastructure and technologies, which could impede the progress
    of many cities, particularly those in developing nations. Furthermore, apprehensions
    exist concerning data privacy and security, since the functioning of smart cities
    hinges heavily on the acquisition and analysis of vast amounts of data, thereby
    raising queries regarding data accessibility and its application. Another challenge
    is ensuring that the benefits of smart city technologies are equitably distributed
    across the population, rather than exacerbating existing inequalities. If smart
    technologies are implemented primarily in affluent areas, it could widen the gap
    between rich and poor neighborhoods. Moreover, there may be apprehensions about
    the potential loss of employment as automation and artificial intelligence become
    more common in smart cities. Citizen participation is another challenge in the
    development and implementation of smart city solutions. Without adequate engagement
    and participation from citizens, there is a risk that these solutions may not
    address the needs and priorities of the communities they are intended to serve
    sufficiently. Also, there may be challenges in coordinating among various sectors
    and stakeholders involved in implementing smart city solutions, such as government
    agencies, private companies, and community groups. Effective coordination and
    collaboration will be crucial for successfully executing these solutions and ensuring
    their long-term sustainability (Ismagilova et al., 2019; Toh et al., 2020; Yigitcanlar,
    2015). While smart cities aim to utilize technology and data for sustainable development,
    there is a lack of research on the integration of urban green spaces and smart
    technologies as a pathway to promote sustainability. This is an important area
    of study given the increasing urbanization worldwide and the need for livable
    and environmentally-friendly cities. The objective of this descriptive-analytical
    study is to investigate how smart cities can utilize green spaces and technologies
    to advance environmental, social and economic sustainability. Through a systematic
    literature review of academic and policy documents, this study identifies key
    approaches, benefits, and challenges related to smart and sustainable city development.
    Given the escalating global urbanization and the imperative for creating livable
    and ecologically sustainable cities, this research area assumes significant importance.
    The outcomes of this study have the potential to offer valuable insights to policymakers,
    urban planners, and researchers regarding the effective management of natural
    resources and the advancement of sustainability within the context of smart cities.
    2. Definitions and theoretical foundations of the research 2.1. Perspectives on
    smart cities: academic, industrial, and governmental views The creation of a smart
    city begins with developing a comprehensive understanding of the concept. The
    notion of a smart city has evolved in various domains, including academia, industry,
    and government. In academic literature, a smart city is deemed as a self-configuring,
    self-healing, self-protecting, and self-optimizing system. Conversely, in industrial
    literature, the term smart pertains to intelligent products and services, artificial
    intelligence, and smart devices. In government documents, the concept of smart
    cities is closely linked with the theory of urban planning that emerged in the
    early 1990s to counteract urban sprawl. This concept primarily emphasizes the
    utilization of technology and social innovation. A suitable definition of a smart
    city, according to academic literature, is an intelligent city characterized by
    smart people, smart mobility, smart governance, smart living, smart economy, and
    smart environment, resulting from a combination of assets and independent activities.
    On the other hand, industrial literature defines a smart city as a system of systems
    that employs technology to transform and optimize its primary systems while fully
    utilizing limited resources (Caragliu et al., 2011; H.M. Kim et al., 2021; Mutambik,
    2023). A smart city is a city that integrates smart facilities and independent
    activities, such as smart people, smart transportation, smart governance, smart
    living, smart economy, and smart environment. In this context, industrial literature
    characterizes a smart city as a system of systems that optimizes the city''s primary
    systems and employs technology to utilize limited resources. Governmental literature,
    meanwhile, aims to enhance the quality of life, foster economic growth, promote
    sustainable environments, and improve energy, sustainability, safety, health,
    and mobility. In summary, a smart city is defined as a sustainable and efficient
    city that enhances mobility, optimizes resource utilization, improves health and
    safety, fosters social development, supports economic growth, and provides participatory
    governance through information and communication technologies, cooperation, and
    investment in social capital (Wang & Tao, 2023; Lim et al., 2021; Vujković et
    al., 2022; Hu et al., 2023; Luo, Zhuo, & Xu, 2023; Wang et al., 2023). While different
    perspectives exist on smart cities, they agree that information and communication
    technology is the central feature of a city''s future performance. Although some
    researchers argue that information and communication technology is the main characteristic
    of a smart city, this does not mean ignoring social issues since people play a
    crucial role in shaping a smart city through continuous interaction. Each writer
    emphasizes different aspects of a city, making it complicated to measure the intelligence
    of a city due to its unique administrative, economic, social, and geographic conditions
    and priorities. Hence, defining a universal system for all cities based on the
    diverse characteristics of cities across the world is difficult. Moreover, the
    definitions of smart cities put forward by individual cities are not necessarily
    universal, making it advisable to use the fundamental structures of the smart
    city model as the basis for conceptualization. Each city''s intelligence must
    be redefined based on its perspectives, priorities, and content. The definition
    of a smart city places significant emphasis on concepts such as the utilization
    of information and communication technology in urban services and infrastructure,
    integration of different systems in planning and implementation, a collaboration
    of various stakeholders in all stages of urban development, investment in social
    capital, independence in decision-making, participatory governance, connectivity,
    creativity, learning, and management of various local resources (Albino et al.,
    2015; Goodspeed, 2015; Grossi et al., 2020). 2.2. Smart sustainable cities and
    environmental benefits A sustainable smart city leverages advanced technologies
    such as the Internet of Things, cloud computing, big data analytics, and geographic
    information systems to enable urban planning, construction, management, and the
    provision of intelligent urban services. This concept has been embraced as a means
    of promoting industrial, informational, and sustainable development advantages
    for cities. In contemporary times, sustainable smart cities have emerged as a
    hybrid model for addressing urban challenges and transforming cities into livable
    environments (Abusaada & Elshater, 2021; X. Fang et al., 2023; Heidari et al.,
    2022; Li et al., 2022). The development of sustainable smart cities involves various
    groups, including those who focus on developing technology infrastructure and
    sustainable development policies, those who advocate for the implementation of
    e-government services in sustainable smart cities, and those who do not find existing
    urban development models suitable. The sustainable smart city is an innovative
    urban center that harnesses information and communication technologies and other
    related tools to improve the standard of living, efficiency of activities and
    urban services, and competitiveness, while simultaneously catering to the requirements
    of both present and upcoming generations. The sustainable smart city comprises
    complex social and technical systems and has a novel framework for urban development
    (Balova et al., 2021; Catalano et al., 2021; Jedliński, 2014). Copenhagen, Denmark
    provides an exemplary instance of a smart sustainable city, where a variety of
    technologies have been implemented to promote sustainability and efficiency. The
    city has introduced several smart sustainable city projects, including a smart
    traffic system, sustainable waste management systems, and sustainable energy production.
    The smart traffic system utilizes data from traffic systems to enhance driving,
    reduce traffic congestion, and improve road safety. Sustainable waste management
    systems incorporate advanced technologies such as smart sensors and IoT systems
    to collect and recycle waste, air, and water pollution. Additionally, Copenhagen
    has invested in sustainable energy production projects, such as wind and solar
    energy, and improved energy efficiency in buildings and homes, making the city
    a leader in smart sustainable cities through the use of innovative technologies
    (Bibri, 2018; Hara et al., 2016; Kramers et al., 2014). Smart sustainable cities
    possess the potential to yield several environmental advantages. They can help
    mitigate carbon emissions by advocating for eco-friendly transportation modes
    like public transportation, electric vehicles, and bicycles, in addition to utilizing
    smart grids, energy-efficient constructions, and renewable energy sources. Additionally,
    smart sustainable cities can improve waste management practices, enhance urban
    green spaces, and implement water conservation measures to reduce water consumption
    and preserve natural resources. In conclusion, smart sustainable cities can promote
    sustainable development, improve the quality of life for citizens, and minimize
    the negative impact of urbanization on the environment by incorporating innovative
    technologies and sustainable practices (Höjer & Wangel, 2015; Huovila et al.,
    2019; Martin et al., 2018). 2.3. Comparing sustainable smart cities and technology-driven
    cities The growth of information and communication technology-centered cities
    has prompted the emergence of several terms, including \"e-city,\" \"digital city,\"
    \"virtual city,\" \"virtual community,\" \"smart city,\" and \"ubiquitous city.\"
    While each of these cities possesses distinctive characteristics, the most significant
    variation and disagreement exist between sustainable smart cities and smart cities.
    It is erroneous to use the term smart cities to refer to sustainable smart cities
    (Bibri, 2021; Jiang et al., 2023). Höjer et al. points out that smart cities often
    lack sustainability due to two reasons (Höjer & Wangel, 2015). Primarily, sustainability
    is not universally incorporated in all smart city concepts and has been assumed
    rather than explicitly considered in smart cities. Additionally, there is a lack
    of a precise definition of sustainability in smart cities, and none of the smart
    city definitions assign hierarchical importance or prioritize their dimensions.
    Establishing a clear definition of sustainability is an imperative aspect of sustainable
    smart cities. Li et al. identify significant challenges related to privacy, government
    surveillance, digital rights, connecting urban sustainability challenges, social
    cohesion issues, technology discourse, and policymaker approach to smart city
    initiatives as weaknesses of smart cities (Li & Woolrych, 2021). Similarly, Yigitcanlar
    et al. criticize smart cities for adopting a technocratic and neoliberal approach
    to urban development, and it is unclear how a smart city plan will lead to sustainability
    (Yigitcanlar et al., 2019). Monfaredzadeh et al. believe that smart cities do
    not emphasize sustainability concepts (Monfaredzadeh & Krueger, 2015). Datta et
    al. note that most cities introduce themselves as smart cities to escape economic
    crises and produce more wealth (Datta & Odendaal, 2019). This results in the creation
    of new markets through the digitization of urban infrastructures, such as smart
    energy and mobility systems, and the formation of new consumers through smart
    technology consumption. These factors lead to a contradictory formation between
    the goals, expectations, and claims that smart cities have regarding urban sustainability
    (Radtke, 2022; Roblek & Meško, 2020). Therefore, Sustainable smart cities and
    technology-driven cities are two different concepts. Although both concepts focus
    on the use of technology in urban development, they differ in their approach to
    sustainability. Sustainable smart cities prioritize sustainability in their urban
    development plans and use technology as a tool to achieve their sustainability
    goals. They consider social, economic, and environmental factors in their planning
    and aim to create livable and resilient cities for present and future generations.
    Technology-driven cities, on the other hand, focus primarily on the use of technology
    in urban development without necessarily prioritizing sustainability (Al Sharif
    & Pokharel, 2022; ur Rehman et al., 2023; Xia et al., 2022; Xia et al., 2023).
    They may use technology to improve efficiency, connectivity, and convenience,
    but may not consider the broader impact on social, economic, and environmental
    factors. Therefore, the main difference between sustainable smart cities and technology-driven
    cities is their approach to sustainability. Sustainable smart cities prioritize
    sustainability as a core component of their planning, while technology-driven
    cities may prioritize technology without necessarily considering sustainability
    (Dameri, 2014; Verrest & Pfeffer, 2019; Zheng et al., 2020). 2.4. Natural resource
    conservation and the role of smart cities The degradation of natural resources
    in recent decades has necessitated the urgent protection of these resources. Although
    human interventions such as industrial and green revolutions have contributed
    to these changes, the role of human factors in both the destruction and conservation
    of natural resources has been overlooked. Instead, the destruction of resources
    has often been attributed to natural processes and physical, biological, and chemical
    developments, leading to a flawed approach to natural resource management. Traditional
    approaches to resource protection have focused on technical and technological
    knowledge, emphasizing humans'' dominance over nature and the adaptation of ecosystems
    to human desires. However, this approach has resulted in intensified damage and
    destruction of resources. Furthermore, ignoring the needs of local communities
    and stakeholders has led to dissatisfaction and a change in the prevailing ideology
    of resource conservation. This shift emphasizes the preservation of the functional
    integrity of ecosystems and the flexible, proportional use of environmental capacities.
    Additionally, contemporary thinking emphasizes the relationship between the social
    system and the ecosystem, making concepts such as social complexity and ecosystem
    more prominent (Chu et al., 2021; Portney, 2005). Therefore, while current conservation
    programs focus on ecosystem functions, they need improvement and reform. This
    includes giving more importance to the role of local communities and residents
    in natural resource management, providing them with access to new technologies
    and optimized resource management, and involving them in decision-making processes.
    Policy-makers and planners should also value the environmental and economic values
    of natural resources and prioritize the environmental and ecosystem needs in their
    conservation programs. Education and training processes on natural resource conservation
    should be included in school curricula (Bifulco et al., 2016; Khalimon et al.,
    2020; Phadtare & IndajeetJadhav, 2017). The implementation of smart cities is
    a crucial way to protect the environment globally. Smart city transformation involves
    the use of innovative technologies to enhance citizens'' quality of life, optimize
    energy consumption, improve urban management, and protect the environment. Therefore,
    smart city transformation can play a vital role in natural resource conservation.
    Smart technologies can be used to improve the quality of city air, reduce pollution,
    optimize energy consumption, manage water and wastewater, manage waste, conserve
    water resources, prevent food waste, and enhance civic interactions. For instance,
    smart city systems such as smart lighting management systems, smart HVAC systems,
    and smart water and energy management systems can be implemented to reduce energy
    consumption in buildings. Similarly, smart waste collection, separation, and recycling
    systems can improve municipal waste management and preserve natural resources.
    Smart city transformation can improve citizens'' quality of life and conserve
    natural resources, contributing significantly to ecosystem sustainability and
    sustainable development (Guo et al., 2022; Kumar & Dahiya, 2017; Sukhwani et al.,
    2020). This study is centered on the examination of urban green spaces as significant
    natural assets within cities. These green spaces, encompassing parks, gardens,
    trees, and vegetation, play a pivotal role in the urban environment. Given the
    ongoing expansion and increased population density of cities, the effective management
    of these green spaces becomes imperative for achieving sustainability. Hence,
    the primary objective of this study is to explore the integration of smart city
    technologies with urban green spaces to enhance environmental sustainability.
    Through this research, a range of solutions and approaches will be examined, including
    green space planning, data analysis, community involvement, and policy formulation,
    all aimed at fostering livable and environmentally-friendly cities. 3. Research
    methodology The present study employs a descriptive-analytical research methodology
    to explore the concept of smart cities and their features. A comprehensive review
    and analysis of academic literature, practical tools intended to aid cities, and
    official international documents published between 1990 and 2023 were undertaken
    to identify the crucial components, dimensions, beliefs, and perspectives associated
    with the concept of smart cities. The literature search was performed using a
    range of keywords and phrases related to the concept of smart cities, such as
    smart community, digital city, intelligent city, ubiquitous city, virtual city,
    information city, creative city, learning city, knowledge city, urban natural
    resources, the relationship between urban natural resources and smart cities,
    sustainable smart city, energy and water consumption control. The literature was
    obtained via two primary sources, academic literature databases and Google Scholar.
    The search was limited to scholarly articles, scientific journals, and conference
    proceedings in the interdisciplinary fields of urban studies, public management,
    information science, natural resource-related sciences, energy, consumption management,
    and computer science. The initial search yielded a total of 672 documents, which
    were subsequently screened for their relevance to the research topic. The screening
    process involved reviewing titles, abstracts, and full texts of the identified
    documents. Following the screening, 194 documents were deemed suitable for inclusion
    in the final literature review, based on their direct relevance to the integration
    of urban natural resources and smart technologies. The selected documents underwent
    a rigorous evaluation by the research team to assess their quality and credibility.
    Only peer-reviewed scholarly articles, conference papers, and book chapters were
    included in the final literature sample, ensuring a high standard of scholarly
    work. To analyze the collected literature, a descriptive-analytical approach was
    adopted, employing thematic analysis. Key themes, concepts, and findings were
    identified from the literature, and codes were developed to categorize the data
    and identify common patterns. By employing this systematic screening process,
    evaluating the quality of the selected literature, and utilizing thematic analysis,
    this study aims to provide an unbiased synthesis of the current knowledge on the
    integration of urban natural resources and smart technologies for sustainable
    development. However, it is worth noting that this study has certain limitations,
    such as the likelihood of overlooking relevant literature due to the search criteria
    and the likelihood of partiality in the selection and analysis of the articles.
    Therefore, the findings of this study should be interpreted with caution. In conclusion,
    this study employed a rigorous methodology to explore the concept of smart cities
    and the integration of urban natural resources and smart city technologies for
    sustainable development. The study''s findings offer valuable insights for policymakers,
    urban planners, and researchers interested in promoting sustainable development
    in smart cities. 4. Finding and discussion Smart cities are a novel concept in
    urban management that aims to enhance the quality of life for citizens, optimize
    energy consumption, protect the environment, and improve urban management. The
    use of innovative technologies enables smart cities to collect, analyze, and share
    urban data and information from diverse perspectives, contributing to their sustainable
    development objectives. Consequently, there is a direct relationship between the
    concept of smart cities and natural resources, as smart technologies can help
    conserve natural resources by reducing energy consumption, optimizing water and
    energy usage, reducing air and water pollution, promoting the use of public transport
    and pedestrian activities, and improving environmental quality (Adali et al.,
    2022; Oberascher et al., 2022; Qayyum et al., 2021; Weil et al., 2023). Implementing
    smart city systems such as smart lighting management, heating, ventilation, and
    air conditioning, and water and energy management systems can facilitate energy
    reduction in buildings. Furthermore, utilizing smart waste collection, separation,
    and recycling systems can help improve municipal waste management and preserve
    natural resources. Smart cities can also function as a monitoring and control
    system for natural resources, such as water and air pollution. By utilizing smart
    water resource management systems, data on runoff, water quality, and water consumption
    can be collected and utilized for optimal planning. Similarly, monitoring air
    pollution through smart systems can help improve air quality and reduce pollutants,
    contributing to a cleaner environment. The utilization of smart energy management
    systems can aid in minimizing energy consumption and encouraging the usage of
    sustainable energy sources, such as solar and wind energy. Additionally, smart
    transportation systems can optimize traffic, reduce air pollution, and encourage
    the use of public transport and pedestrian activities. The integration of these
    technologies into smart cities can facilitate sustainable development and preserve
    natural resources. To conclude, smart cities are an innovative solution for enhancing
    urban management and promoting environmental protection and sustainable development.
    The integration of smart technologies can help conserve natural resources and
    improve the quality of life for citizens (Alshuwaikhat et al., 2022; Mortaheb
    & Jankowski, 2023; Shang & Lv, 2023; Wang & Zhou, 2023). This study will further
    discuss the relationship between smart cities and natural resources in detail
    in the following sections. 4.1. Green spaces in smart city development Utilizing
    natural resources within urban environments, particularly through the integration
    of green spaces, presents a promising avenue to bolster the sustainability of
    smart city development. This study delves into a range of strategies aimed at
    harnessing the potential of green spaces in smart cities. One such approach involves
    the implementation of smart green spaces, which leverage advanced technologies
    like sensors to effectively manage irrigation and artificial lighting, optimizing
    resource usage in these areas. This can effectively reduce water and energy consumption,
    improve air quality, and mitigate the impacts of climate change. Another solution
    is the conversion of green spaces into energy sources, such as installing solar
    panels on green roofs to generate energy and meet a building''s energy needs.
    Green spaces can also serve as filters for air purification and reducing air pollutants,
    reducing the effects of climate change, and mitigating the heat effects in the
    city. Green spaces can also be designed as venues for social development in smart
    cities, providing recreational and sports activities, a peaceful and friendly
    environment, and social gathering spaces to enhance citizens'' quality of life
    and promote social development. Additionally, green spaces can act as filters
    to reduce noise pollution in smart cities, particularly for sound levels caused
    by traffic or industrial and commercial activities (Anguluri & Narayanan, 2017;
    Artmann et al., 2019; Nitoslawski et al., 2019; Obringer & Nateghi, 2021; Salman
    & Hasar, 2023). This study focuses on a thorough analysis of the role of urban
    green spaces in cities, encompassing parks, gardens, trees, and vegetation. These
    green spaces are valuable natural assets that contribute significantly to the
    urban environment. They offer various ecosystem services, such as the purification
    of air, regulation of microclimates, reduction of noise, and opportunities for
    recreational activities and social interactions. Given the global expansion and
    increased density of cities, it is crucial to effectively manage these urban green
    spaces. Therefore, the primary aim of this study is to explore the integration
    of smart technologies with these green spaces to enhance their sustainability.
    Additionally, this research examines other essential natural resources in urban
    settings, including water, energy, and waste materials. It investigates how smart
    technologies can be utilized to manage these resources efficiently, promote conservation
    efforts, and achieve sustainability. By clearly defining these natural resources,
    this study aims to provide specific insights into harnessing smart city technologies
    to improve natural resource management and enhance urban sustainability. The creation
    of a green space network in cities has been proposed as an effective solution
    for smart city development. This approach involves integrating and connecting
    various green spaces such as parks, gardens, squares, and natural spaces in the
    city to create a network. This green space network can be used as a hub for communication
    between people and the city, promoting sustainable urban development. Also, analyzing
    green space data can facilitate smart city development by using sensors and smart
    systems in green spaces to collect and analyze information on factors such as
    air quality, pollution levels, temperature, and irrigation levels, improving green
    space management, and promoting sustainable urban development. The design of green
    spaces in smart cities can play a crucial role in promoting social development
    (Aly & Dimitrijevic, 2022; Branny et al., 2022; S. Zhang et al., 2022; Japir Bataineh
    et al., 2023). One way to achieve this is by creating recreational and sports
    spaces within green areas to encourage physical activity and social interaction,
    which can enhance the physical and mental health of residents and foster a sense
    of community. Additionally, creating a serene and welcoming environment within
    green spaces can provide a space for residents to relax and unwind, which can
    also encourage social interaction and community building. Another effective approach
    to promoting social development through green spaces is to design these areas
    to include social meeting spaces, such as picnic areas, cafes, and community gardens.
    By providing residents with spaces to gather, socialize, and exchange ideas, green
    spaces can help build a sense of community and promote social development. Moreover,
    involving the community in the design and maintenance of green spaces can promote
    social development by instilling a sense of ownership and pride in their neighborhood,
    which can lead to partnerships and collaborations between residents, local government,
    and other stakeholders. Lastly, designing green spaces to be easily accessible
    and connected to other parts of the city can encourage residents to use these
    spaces and promote social interaction. This can be achieved by creating bike lanes,
    pedestrian walkways, and public transportation routes that connect green spaces
    to other parts of the city. By doing so, green spaces can become a hub for social
    activities and gatherings, promoting social development and enhancing the overall
    quality of life in smart cities (Irvine et al., 2022; Li, 2022; Zain et al., 2022).
    Fig. 1 illustrates the strategies for utilizing green spaces in smart city development.
    The figure is divided into two main categories, including smart green spaces and
    green spaces for social development. The smart green space category includes the
    use of smart systems, such as sensors, to manage irrigation and artificial lighting,
    and the conversion of green spaces into energy sources. The green spaces for social
    development category includes the creation of recreational and sports spaces,
    design for social meeting spaces, and involving the community in the design and
    maintenance of green spaces. This figure highlights the potential of green spaces
    in smart city development to enhance sustainability and promote social development.
    The utilization of smart green space strategies plays a pivotal role in improving
    resource efficiency, leveraging technology to optimize operations, and mitigating
    environmental impacts. Concurrently, social development approaches contribute
    to the promotion of community well-being through inclusive and recreational green
    spaces, as substantiated by prior research. Download : Download high-res image

    spaces in smart city development: enhancing sustainability and promoting social
    development. 4.2. Challenges and benefits of green space data analysis The utilization
    of technological advancements to analyze data pertaining to green spaces offers
    significant potential in mitigating air pollution levels within urban areas. Through
    the integration of sensors, CCTV cameras, 3D mapping, and other intelligent systems,
    valuable information regarding green spaces can be collected and subjected to
    analysis using machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms. This analytical
    approach enables the prediction of optimal irrigation requirements and facilitates
    the regulation of water consumption, thus promoting enhanced water conservation
    practices within green spaces. Moreover, this data-driven methodology enables
    the acquisition of accurate insights into changes in vegetation and air quality
    across cities, thereby facilitating the identification and implementation of effective
    solutions for sustainable urban development (Ding et al., 2022; Jia et al., 2023;
    Ma, 2020; Sharifi et al., 2021). Green space data analysis can be an effective
    solution for reducing air pollution in cities (Douglas et al., 2017; Kabisch et
    al., 2017; Niemelä et al., 2010). One way to achieve this is by using the data
    to increase the area of green spaces in cities, which can help in reducing air
    pollution. By identifying areas that require the creation of green spaces, city
    officials and managers can make informed decisions for sustainable urban development.
    Another way to reduce air pollution is by increasing the number of trees in cities
    with the use of green space data analysis. By analyzing the amount of greenery
    and distribution of trees in different areas of the city, decisions can be made
    about planting trees and vegetation in areas with a shortage of green spaces.
    This can help increase the amount of oxygen produced, leading to improved air
    quality and reduced air pollution. Finally, analyzing green space data can provide
    an accurate picture of changes in the level of greenery and air quality in cities,
    leading to effective solutions for improving air quality. By identifying areas
    that need to increase the number of trees and creating green spaces, cities can
    improve air quality and promote sustainable urban development (Baycan-Levent &
    Nijkamp, 2009; Lee & Maheswaran, 2011; Wolch et al., 2014). Green space data analysis
    holds the potential to provide a host of benefits to urban residents. For instance,
    it can improve air quality by identifying areas that require more greenery and
    trees to reduce air pollution. This, in turn, can positively affect the health
    and well-being of urban residents. Additionally, by analyzing data, cities can
    identify areas that require green spaces and create new ones, which can increase
    access to outdoor recreation, physical activity, and social interaction, thereby
    improving the quality of life of urban residents. Green space data analysis can
    also contribute to improved water conservation by predicting the amount of water
    required for irrigation and controlling water consumption in green spaces. This
    can help ensure that urban residents have access to clean and safe water, which
    is critical for their health and well-being. Moreover, green space data analysis
    can offer valuable insights into how cities can improve their urban planning and
    design. By identifying areas that require more green spaces and trees, cities
    can develop plans that prioritize sustainable urban development, ultimately creating
    more livable communities. Green spaces can also have a positive impact on public
    health by reducing stress levels, promoting physical activity, and improving mental
    well-being. With the help of green space data analysis, cities can create more
    green spaces that are accessible to urban residents, thereby providing them with
    opportunities to improve their health and well-being. Also, green space data analysis
    can involve residents in the planning and maintenance of green spaces, promoting
    community engagement and collaboration. This can help build stronger communities
    and foster a sense of ownership and pride in their neighborhoods (Kabisch et al.,
    2016; Zhang et al., 2017; Ibeanu et al., 2023). The implementation of green space
    data analysis, while beneficial for sustainable urban development, can present
    several challenges for cities. The first challenge is data collection, which can
    be particularly difficult for older cities with limited digital infrastructure.
    Weather conditions, equipment failure, and vandalism are among the factors that
    can affect the quality of data collected on green spaces. The second challenge
    is data management, which can be complex due to the large amounts of data generated
    by green space data analysis. To address this, cities may need to invest in appropriate
    data management systems to ensure that the data collected is well-organized, easily
    accessible, and secure. Another challenge is the need for technical expertise
    in fields such as data analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.
    This requires cities to either hire experts or partner with organizations that
    specialize in these fields to analyze the data collected effectively. Moreover,
    the implementation of green space data analysis can be costly, particularly for
    cities with limited budgets. As such, cities may need to seek funding from external
    sources or prioritize their spending to allocate resources to this area. Privacy
    concerns are also a challenge, particularly if the data collected includes images
    or videos of people. Cities may need to implement appropriate privacy policies
    and regulations to ensure that they comply with relevant laws and protect citizens''
    privacy rights. Finally, engaging stakeholders, including residents, community
    groups, and local businesses, is essential for the success of green space data
    analysis initiatives. Cities may need to invest in public outreach and engagement
    efforts to ensure that stakeholders are well-informed, involved, and supportive
    of these initiatives (Kabisch & Haase, 2011; Kabisch, 2015; Kabisch et al., 2015).
    Green space data analysis has been implemented in various cities worldwide to
    evaluate the distribution and density of green spaces and improve the quality
    of life for citizens. For instance, in Singapore and Shanghai, 3D mapping technology
    and green space data analysis have been utilized to assess the distribution and
    density of green spaces. Similarly, in European cities such as Copenhagen and
    London, green space data analysis has been employed for planning and developing
    green spaces. This includes analyzing the amount of greenery and tree distribution
    in different areas of the city, determining the amount of green space available
    in the city, identifying areas that require green space development, and assessing
    the distribution of green space in public places such as parks and squares. This
    data analysis helps cities prioritize sustainable urban development and create
    more livable communities by providing more opportunities for outdoor recreation,
    physical activity, and social interaction. Green space data analysis can aid city
    officials and urban managers in decision-making related to the creation of green
    spaces. This data analysis can precisely identify areas that require green space
    development and evaluate the amount of green space available in different areas
    of the city. By analyzing green space data, officials can gain insight into the
    amount of greenery and tree distribution in different areas of the city, enabling
    them to make informed decisions regarding planting trees and vegetation in areas
    with a shortage of green spaces. Furthermore, green space data analysis can be
    used to identify areas that require green space development and implement green
    space development plans in these areas. This can help city officials prioritize
    sustainable urban development and create livable communities by providing urban
    residents with more opportunities for outdoor recreation, physical activity, and
    social interaction. By using green space data analysis, city officials can make
    evidence-based decisions and ensure that green spaces are developed in areas where
    they are most needed (Haaland & van Den Bosch, 2015; Madureira et al., 2015; Wood
    et al., 2018). Fig. 2 presents the benefits and challenges of green space data
    analysis in urban development. The figure is divided into two main categories:
    benefits and challenges. The benefits category includes improving air quality,
    water conservation, urban planning and design, public health, and community engagement
    through the creation and maintenance of green spaces. The challenges category
    includes data collection and management, technical expertise, cost, privacy concerns,
    and stakeholder engagement. This figure highlights the potential of green space
    data analysis in sustainable urban development and the challenges that need to
    be addressed for its successful implementation. The existing body of research
    substantiates the favorable environmental, social, economic, and health outcomes
    associated with the benefits mentioned earlier. To ensure the successful implementation
    of green space data analysis, it is imperative to tackle the identified challenges
    through diverse approaches, such as active community involvement, collaborations
    between public and private entities, and enhanced provision of financial resources.

    of technology for green space data analysis, the importance of green space data
    analysis for reducing air pollution and improving the quality of life, challenges
    in implementing green space data analysis, and the importance of stakeholder engagement.
    This comparative analysis helps to identify the common themes and patterns related
    to the integration of urban natural resources and smart city technologies for
    sustainable development. Table 1. Comparison of green space data analysis implementation
    in smart cities of the west and east for sustainable urban development. 4.3. The
    impact of smart cities on urban environmental sustainability Smart cities possess
    the capacity to tackle environmental issues by leveraging cutting-edge technologies
    and intelligent communication systems. This has the potential to yield enhancements
    in air quality, reduction in noise pollution, efficient waste management, and
    optimized resource utilization. To realize these advantages, the implementation
    of smart and automated waste collection systems, adoption of electric vehicles,
    and integration of intelligent irrigation systems are among the key tools that
    can be deployed within smart cities. Moreover, smart cities can effectively curb
    traffic congestion and urban density, resulting in decreased air pollution levels
    and enhanced resource efficiency. By harnessing smart technologies, public transportation
    can be enhanced, car usage can be optimized, and pedestrian and bicycle traffic
    can be promoted (Q. Guo et al., 2023; Song et al., 2023). Various technologies,
    such as Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, Artificial Intelligence (AI), smart
    driving systems, smart energy networks, smart waste management systems, and smart
    home appliances, are utilized in smart cities to enhance the environment. IoT
    sensors can collect data on weather and pollution levels, providing accurate information
    about the environment. AI can optimize environmental processes and improve air
    quality, waste management, and resource efficiency. To achieve a sustainable and
    environmentally friendly smart city, it is essential to implement these technologies
    in a consistent and unified manner (Khawand et al., 2022; Niyi Anifowose et al.,
    2022). By doing so, it is possible to improve the urban environment, reduce the
    negative impact on the environment, and enhance the quality of life for citizens.
    Therefore, the integration of these technologies is crucial to ensure that smart
    cities have a positive impact on the environment while providing the necessary
    services and amenities to citizens (Mauree et al., 2019; Ortega-Fernández et al.,
    2020; Shruti et al., 2020). The impact of implementing smart cities on various
    environmental parameters is discussed in detail in the following sections. 4.3.1.
    The impact of smart city technologies and policies on reducing air pollution Air
    pollution presents a substantial environmental challenge within urban settings,
    and the integration of smart city technologies holds great potential for mitigating
    its impact. Addressing the imperative to enhance air quality is essential, considering
    the detrimental health implications associated with air pollution. One of the
    key approaches by which smart cities can effectively combat air pollution is through
    the optimization of transportation systems. By implementing smart traffic management
    systems, cities can reduce traffic congestion, resulting in vehicles running more
    efficiently and decreasing emissions from cars and trucks. Additionally, smart
    public transportation systems can promote the use of buses, trains, and other
    forms of public transit, which can reduce the number of cars on the road and associated
    emissions. Another approach to addressing air pollution in smart cities is by
    using smart buildings and energy systems. By optimizing energy consumption and
    reducing waste, buildings can become more energy-efficient and generate fewer
    pollutants. Smart grids and renewable energy sources can also help lower emissions
    from power plants and other electricity sources. Smart waste management systems
    can also contribute to reducing air pollution. By minimizing the amount of waste
    sent to landfills and incinerators, smart waste management can lessen the quantity
    of methane and other pollutants released into the air. Furthermore, smart city
    technologies such as air quality sensors can enable cities to monitor air pollution
    levels in real-time and implement measures to reduce emissions when pollution
    levels exceed safe levels. Such measures can include implementing low-emission
    zones or promoting the use of electric vehicles and other low-emission transportation
    options (Shen et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2023; Xu & Yang, 2022; Moshayedi et al.,
    2023). Air quality sensors play a critical role in smart cities, offering several
    advantages such as real-time monitoring, data-driven decision-making, improved
    public health, environmental monitoring, and citizen engagement. Air quality sensors
    allow cities to monitor air quality in real-time, enabling them to quickly identify
    pollution hotspots and respond promptly to prevent health issues and mitigate
    environmental damage. Moreover, air quality sensors generate vast amounts of data
    that can inform evidence-based environmental policies. This data can help in determining
    the placement of green spaces, prioritizing transportation modes, and regulating
    industrial activities. Air quality sensors also significantly contribute to improving
    public health. By identifying areas with high pollution levels, cities can implement
    public health interventions that reduce exposure to harmful pollutants, improving
    the health of residents and reducing the healthcare costs associated with pollution-induced
    illnesses. Additionally, air quality sensors enable environmental monitoring of
    other factors such as humidity, temperature, and noise levels. This data can be
    used to better understand the relationship between environmental factors and air
    quality and improve overall environmental health. Furthermore, air quality sensors
    can increase public awareness of environmental issues and promote citizen engagement
    in environmental initiatives. Citizen involvement in data collection and analysis
    can foster stronger relationships between cities and their communities, promote
    sustainable behavior, and encourage greater participation in environmental monitoring
    efforts (Angelidou et al., 2018; Li et al., 2020; Liu & Zhang, 2021). Although
    the implementation of air quality sensors in cities offers several benefits, it
    also poses several challenges that need to be addressed. These challenges include
    cost, data reliability, data integration, data privacy, equity, and regulatory
    challenges. One of the primary challenges for cities is the cost of purchasing
    and installing air quality sensors, which can be particularly problematic for
    cities with limited budgets. Additionally, there are ongoing expenses associated
    with maintaining, calibrating, and storing data generated by these sensors. Data
    reliability is another challenge that needs to be addressed to ensure that the
    data generated by air quality sensors is accurate and reliable. Measures need
    to be in place to ensure that the data collected is of sufficient quality to support
    effective decision-making processes. Cities also need to have the necessary infrastructure
    and expertise to manage and integrate the large amount of data generated by air
    quality sensors. Furthermore, privacy concerns may arise as air quality sensors
    collect data on individuals'' movements and activities. Therefore, it is vital
    to be transparent about how data is collected and used and to protect individuals''
    privacy. Equity is another challenge, as air quality sensors need to be placed
    in locations that accurately reflect the air quality experienced by different
    communities. This necessitates the placement of sensors in low-income and minority
    communities, which are frequently impacted disproportionately by air pollution.
    Additionally, regulatory challenges may arise as air quality sensors may not meet
    regulatory standards for air quality monitoring. Hence, cities must work with
    regulatory agencies to ensure that the data collected by sensors is usable for
    regulatory purposes (Neirotti et al., 2014; Benevolo et al., 2016; Su et al.,
    2023). To address environmental justice and reduce health disparities, it is crucial
    to ensure that air quality sensors are equitably distributed in low-income and
    minority communities. Cities can adopt various strategies to ensure the fair placement
    of sensors. One strategy is to engage with community organizations and residents
    to identify locations where air quality sensors should be placed. By involving
    the community in the decision-making process, cities can ensure that sensors are
    positioned in areas that accurately reflect the air quality experienced by residents.
    Another approach is to use existing data on air quality, traffic patterns, and
    other relevant factors to identify areas where air quality is likely to be poor.
    This data can help guide the placement of sensors in areas where they are most
    needed. Collaborative partnerships between cities, community organizations, universities,
    and other stakeholders can also facilitate the deployment of air quality sensors.
    These partnerships can ensure that sensors are placed in locations that are relevant
    to the community and that the data collected is used to address community concerns.
    Cities can also adopt policies that require air quality sensors to be placed in
    specific locations, such as near schools or in neighborhoods with high asthma
    rates. Such policies can ensure that sensors are placed in areas where they are
    most needed. Furthermore, prioritizing funding for air quality sensor deployment
    in low-income and minority communities is another strategy that cities can use
    to address environmental health disparities. By doing so, cities can ensure that
    these communities have access to the resources they need to improve their air
    quality (Chatti & Majeed, 2022; Cui & Cao, 2022; Kaginalkar et al., 2021). Apart
    from deploying air quality sensors, cities have implemented various policies to
    reduce air pollution in low-income communities. Green infrastructure projects,
    such as planting trees and building green roofs, can absorb pollutants and improve
    air quality while also reducing the urban heat island effect. Transit-oriented
    development is another policy implemented by cities to reduce air pollution in
    low-income communities. This policy involves building affordable housing near
    public transit and promoting alternative modes of transportation such as walking
    and biking, which reduces the number of cars on the road. Cities have also implemented
    low-emission zones that restrict the most polluting vehicles from entering certain
    areas of the city, often placed in low-income communities. Moreover, clean energy
    incentives such as rebates for solar panels and electric vehicles can help low-income
    residents access clean energy technologies and reduce their reliance on fossil
    fuels. Cities have also implemented regulations on industrial activity to reduce
    emissions and improve air quality in nearby communities, including emissions standards,
    pollution fees, and zoning restrictions. Education and outreach campaigns that
    raise awareness of air quality issues and promote sustainable behavior have also
    been implemented by cities, including campaigns that target low-income communities
    and provide resources and support to help residents reduce their exposure to air
    pollution. The effectiveness of policies implemented by cities to reduce air pollution
    in low-income communities can vary depending on the policy itself, implementation,
    and community engagement (Almalki et al., 2021; Michalec et al., 2019; Yao et
    al., 2020). Smart traffic management systems have the potential to make a significant
    contribution in reducing air pollution in urban environments. By reducing traffic
    congestion and associated emissions from cars and trucks, these systems can optimize
    traffic flow, reduce idling, and improve air quality (Djahel et al., 2014). Studies
    have shown that smart traffic management systems can have a positive impact on
    reducing air pollution in cities. For instance, a study revealed that the implementation
    of an intelligent transport system (ITS) resulted in a 15 % reduction in carbon
    dioxide emissions (El-Hansali et al., 2021). Smart traffic management systems
    can also promote the use of sustainable modes of transportation, such as public
    transit, biking, and walking, which can further reduce emissions and improve air
    quality (De Oliveira et al., 2020). Smart traffic management systems can promote
    sustainable transportation in several ways. Firstly, by providing real-time traffic
    information, these systems enable commuters to plan their routes and avoid congested
    areas, which can encourage the use of alternative modes of transportation such
    as public transit, biking, and walking. Secondly, smart traffic management systems
    can promote multimodal transportation planning by providing information on a range
    of transportation options. For example, some systems offer real-time information
    on public transit schedules and bike-sharing availability, making it easier for
    commuters to incorporate these options into their travel plans. Another approach
    to promoting sustainable transportation is the integration of smart parking systems
    into smart traffic management systems. By offering real-time information on parking
    availability and pricing, these systems can make it easier for people to find
    parking and encourage the use of alternative modes of transportation, such as
    public transit and biking. For example, drivers can be directed to park-and-ride
    facilities located near public transit stations, which can incentivize the use
    of public transit (Li et al., 2017; Sharif et al., 2017; Sumi & Ranga, 2018).
    Smart parking systems possess the potential to play a significant function in
    mitigating traffic congestion and the related air pollution in urban areas. One
    of the key benefits of these systems is that they can reduce the amount of time
    drivers spend looking for parking spots and circling around, which can lead to
    increased traffic congestion and associated emissions from idling vehicles. Smart
    parking systems can achieve this by providing real-time information on parking
    availability, allowing drivers to quickly find a parking spot without circling
    around, reducing the amount of time spent looking for parking and consequently
    reducing traffic congestion. In addition to providing real-time parking information,
    smart parking systems can also use dynamic pricing to incentivize drivers to park
    in less congested areas or at off-peak times. Smart parking systems can aid in
    balancing the supply and demand of parking and minimizing traffic congestion by
    charging higher rates in high-demand regions and lower rates in low-demand regions.
    This approach can encourage drivers to choose less congested parking areas, ultimately
    reducing the overall traffic congestion in the city. Another significant benefit
    of smart parking systems is their ability to reduce double-parking, which can
    block traffic and reduce road capacity. By providing real-time information on
    parking availability and reducing the need for drivers to park illegally, smart
    parking systems can help reduce double-parking and improve traffic flow. Lastly,
    smart parking systems can reduce the amount of time drivers spend cruising for
    parking by providing real-time information on parking availability and incentivizing
    drivers to park in less congested areas. For instance, offering discounts or rewards
    for parking in less congested areas can encourage drivers to choose these areas
    and reduce traffic congestion and associated emissions from idling vehicles. Therefore,
    smart parking systems have the potential to significantly reduce traffic congestion
    and air pollution in cities by reducing the amount of time drivers spend looking
    for parking spots, using dynamic pricing to balance parking supply and demand,
    reducing double-parking, and incentivizing drivers to park in less congested areas.
    These strategies can improve traffic flow, reduce emissions from idling vehicles,
    and ultimately contribute to a healthier and more sustainable urban environment
    (Englund et al., 2021; Liu & Ke, 2023; Zhu et al., 2016). To implement smart parking
    systems in cities, a comprehensive assessment of parking needs is necessary. This
    includes factors such as parking demand, availability, and current technologies.
    After assessing the needs, cities can select from several technology solutions,
    such as sensors, cameras, and mobile applications. The chosen technology solution
    should be suitable for the city''s needs and budget. In the case of a sensor-based
    solution, parking sensors will need to be installed in parking spaces or on the
    street. These sensors can detect whether a space is occupied or vacant and relay
    this information to a central database. Additionally, a parking management system
    should be developed by cities to gather and analyze data from the sensors or other
    technology solutions. This system should provide real-time information on parking
    availability and pricing, as well as enable payment and enforcement. To encourage
    the use of the smart parking system, cities should promote it to the public through
    marketing and outreach campaigns. This can help increase awareness and encourage
    commuters to choose more sustainable transportation options. Furthermore, continuous
    monitoring and evaluation of the smart parking system is crucial to ensure that
    it meets its objectives and identifies areas for improvement. This includes analyzing
    data on parking usage, revenues, and customer satisfaction. By following these
    steps, cities can successfully implement smart parking systems that meet their
    specific needs and contribute to more sustainable transportation choices. Regarding
    smart traffic management systems, their implementation feasibility and effectiveness
    can vary depending on the size, budget, and infrastructure of the city. Implementing
    smart traffic management systems involves significant investment in technology,
    data infrastructure, and personnel, which may not be feasible for smaller cities
    or those with limited budgets. Additionally, cities with older infrastructure
    may need to invest in upgrading their transportation systems to enable the integration
    of smart traffic management technologies. Moreover, the effectiveness of smart
    traffic management systems may depend on the existing transportation infrastructure
    of the city. For instance, cities with well-developed public transportation systems
    may have an easier time integrating smart traffic management systems that promote
    the use of alternative modes of transportation. Conversely, cities with high levels
    of car dependency may face more significant challenges in promoting sustainable
    transportation options through smart traffic management systems (Alsafery et al.,
    2018; Khanna & Anand, 2016; Vakula & Kolli, 2017). Fig. 3 provides an overview
    of the different categories under the core theme of smart city technologies for
    reducing air pollution. The figure illustrates the various strategies and challenges
    associated with the deployment of air quality sensors, optimizing transportation
    and energy systems, improving waste management, and implementing smart traffic
    and parking systems. The categories are organized to highlight the potential benefits
    of these strategies for improving public health, reducing environmental damage,
    and promoting citizen engagement. Additionally, the figure outlines the challenges
    associated with the equitable deployment of air quality sensors and the need for
    regulatory standards to ensure data reliability and privacy protection. A range
    of strategies, including transportation optimization, smart waste management implementation,
    air quality sensor deployment, and the establishment of smart parking and traffic
    systems, have been extensively studied and proven effective in reducing urban
    air pollution. By adopting a comprehensive approach that combines these solutions,
    substantial improvements in air quality and public health can be achieved, as
    supported by previous research. Download : Download high-res image (760KB) Download

    solutions for sustainable urban water management Cities worldwide are facing a
    critical imperative to address water consumption in light of global warming, population
    growth, and escalating per capita consumption. The pressing challenges posed by
    a growing global population and the finite nature of natural resources have elevated
    the urgency of implementing smart city initiatives as an essential endeavor for
    current and future generations (Holdren & Ehrlich, 1974; Jury & Vaux, 2007). Various
    regions around the world are experiencing serious water shortages, particularly
    countries with low rainfall such as Central Asia, India, the Middle East, North
    Africa and North America (Rijsberman, 2006). The quality of water is also a challenge,
    with approximately 1.1 billion people worldwide lacking access to water of desirable
    quality (Elimelech, 2006). One out of every four cities globally is experiencing
    a water shortage crisis, with population growth and urbanization exacerbating
    the situation (Zhang et al., 2020). By 2050, over six billion people are projected
    to live in cities. As a response, since 2012, more than 142 cities in North America,
    Europe, and East Asia have initiated smart city initiatives (Shafiullah et al.,
    2022). Smart building systems, which use artificial intelligence, can react to
    environmental conditions and perform some tasks automatically (Wong & Li, 2008).
    The Japanese company Hitachi, with more than a century of experience in water
    treatment across nearly 42 countries, is working towards creating smart cities
    that efficiently use water resources and establish effective water infrastructure
    (Alusi et al., 2011). In the city of Austin, Texas, approximately 5.8 billion
    barrels of drinking water were lost in 2015 due to leaks in pipes before reaching
    consumers, which accounted for approximately 12 % of the total drinking water
    consumed that year (Blatt, 2011). To address this issue, a water management system
    was introduced, which measures water pressure and pH levels to detect water leaks
    and ensure safe pH levels for human health. These systems use sensors to collect
    data, which is then processed by microcontrollers and communicated through computers
    and wireless networks (Nie et al., 2020; Saad & Gamatié, 2020). Moreover, ultrasonic
    sensors have been used by researchers to evaluate water quantity, quality, and
    leaks, and this data is announced on a website using an Arduino board (Yasin et
    al., 2021). Lopez et al. have developed a method for determining dynamic water
    tariffs and notifying users based on smart meters. Implementing this method in
    the city of Valencia in Spain with 430,000 subscribers resulted in an 11 % reduction
    in water consumption (Lopez-Nicolas et al., 2018). Additionally, Curry et al.
    have proposed five smart pilot projects to reduce water consumption in smart airports,
    smart homes, smart schools, smart buildings, and have reported the amount of water
    saved (Curry et al., 2018). The importance of addressing water consumption reduction
    in cities through smart city implementation and its technologies has been highlighted
    in previous research. By using smart water management systems, such as those that
    detect leaks and monitor water pressure and quality, cities can reduce water losses
    and ensure safe water for human consumption. Furthermore, implementing dynamic
    water tariffs and notifying users based on smart meters can encourage water conservation
    and reduce consumption. The use of smart pilot projects in various settings can
    also help reduce water consumption and promote sustainable water management practices
    (Ntuli & Abu-Mahfouz, 2016; Shahanas & Sivakumar, 2016; Singh & Ahmed, 2021).
    One of the most significant protocols for smart building automation is the KNX
    protocol, which is a global communication standard for home and building control.
    The Konnex Association created the KNX standard in 1999 by combining three older
    European home systems standards, namely EHS, BatiBUS, and EIB or Instabus. The
    KNX standard is widely used in residential and commercial buildings for controlling
    integrated systems, including HVAC, lighting, security, remote control, shading
    and curtain control, monitoring systems, and energy management. The KNX protocol
    has several advantages, such as millions of devices currently in service, all
    devices specifically designed for building automation, a unified software for
    all products regardless of the manufacturer, the ability to use tree, line, star,
    or any combination of topology, the ability to choose between different communication
    interfaces, and the ability to connect to other protocols through different communication
    gateways. The widespread adoption of the KNX protocol has resulted in a vast ecosystem
    of compatible devices, which provides customers with a wide range of options for
    building automation and control. With its versatility and compatibility, the KNX
    protocol is a popular choice for building automation and is widely used in smart
    buildings worldwide. Smart building projects that utilize the KNX protocol require
    the connection of various modules, sensors, and devices that are under the KNX
    protocol or through other communication interfaces to sensors or devices that
    need to be controlled by this system. These devices are connected in a network,
    and sensors receive information and transmit it to the smart modules through the
    network. The received information is then processed in the modules, and appropriate
    actions are taken based on the information (Domingues et al., 2016; Kastner et
    al., 2005; Lohia et al., 2019). The implementation of smart solutions to reduce
    water consumption using the KNX protocol is presented in the following sections,
    divided into three categories: irrigation, residential, and urban solutions. In
    this section, we focus on the irrigation and urban solutions, while the residential
    solutions will be explored in the next section. The irrigation solutions involve
    the use of smart irrigation controllers that monitor the weather and soil moisture
    to optimize irrigation and reduce water consumption. The urban solutions, on the
    other hand, include the use of smart water meters to monitor water consumption
    and detect leaks, as well as the implementation of dynamic water tariffs to encourage
    water conservation. These solutions provide significant opportunities for reducing
    water consumption in smart buildings and promoting sustainable water management
    practices (Christensen et al., 2020; Lazaroiu & Roscia, 2017; Vanus et al., 2016).
    Modern irrigation techniques involve two general forms: pressurized irrigation
    and drip and sprinkler irrigation. However, these methods often face challenges
    such as high implementation costs, technical maintenance of the system, and servicing
    of pumping system peripherals. Sprinkler irrigation may also face limitations
    in mixed planting schemes, as well as water loss due to incorrect system design
    or strong winds (Chaudhary et al., 2011). Rain irrigation systems have an efficiency
    rate of up to 70 %, while drip irrigation systems have an efficiency rate of up
    to 95 % (Payero et al., 2008). In contrast, surface irrigation of farms has an
    efficiency rate of no more than 50 % (Maisiri et al., 2005). In traditional situations,
    where most of the country''s lands are irrigated in this manner, the efficiency
    rate is even lower, at less than 35 % (Oweis & Hachum, 2006). The primary reasons
    for water loss in the agricultural sector are the use of fresh water for irrigation,
    over-irrigation of crops, creation of surface runoff, and irrigation at inappropriate
    times (Legesse & Ayenew, 2006). On the other hand, the development of green spaces
    is a crucial aspect of urban development. Trees are the lifelines of cities, and
    the construction of green spaces is essential for the mental and physical health
    of society. Maintaining these spaces is a fundamental principle of green space
    management, and irrigation is one of the primary needs for maintenance. Currently,
    urban green spaces are irrigated using various methods, such as mobile tanks,
    fixed tanks, human-powered irrigation through embedded taps, pressurized irrigation
    systems, or combined systems. The choice of irrigation method depends on factors
    such as climatic conditions, existing infrastructure, budget, and the type of
    plant tissue used (Choukai et al., 2022). In a smart agricultural field, moisture
    sensors are placed at regular intervals within the soil and next to the planted
    crops. These sensors are connected to a network through specialized wiring. The
    sensors send a message to the central control system as soon as the moisture within
    the soil decreases below the specified level for the plant. This message is displayed
    on a display screen, which is available to the farmer through the central controller
    display screens or control software that can be installed on a mobile phone. Upon
    receiving a message indicating decreased soil moisture from a predetermined number
    of sensors within each row of the planted crops, the system first examines weather
    changes using models provided on reputable weather websites, via a remote control
    module. If rainfall is expected in the coming days based on the weather maps,
    irrigation is delayed until the specified time (the number of days irrigation
    can be delayed is determined by the type of crop). Otherwise, the system sends
    an irrigation command to electric valve gates for the irrigation operation to
    be carried out within the soil. The irrigation continues until the soil moisture
    level is less than the predetermined moisture threshold for the embedded soil
    sensors. Once sufficient moisture is created, irrigation is immediately stopped
    to prevent water loss. Moreover, the system can be adjusted to perform irrigation
    based on temperature changes throughout the day. In hot seasons, irrigation is
    carried out at minimum temperature to prevent water evaporation, while in cold
    seasons, irrigation is carried out at maximum temperature to prevent crop freezing.
    The smart irrigation system reduces water consumption in agriculture and promotes
    sustainable water management practices. The equipment required for implementing
    an intelligent irrigation system for urban green spaces using the KNX protocol
    includes a switch operator, power sources, an internet connection module, a central
    control display for monitoring and entering primary information, electric valve
    gates, soil moisture sensors, environment temperature sensors, a sensor for determining
    light intensity, and a network platform. The number, type of programming, and
    method of communication between devices are determined based on several factors
    such as the location of water supply, accessible water quantity and quality, types
    of crops used in the planting scheme, soil parameters, and regional climate. The
    input level of the switch operator is determined based on the diversity of plant
    coverage in terms of irrigation type. The equipment is designed to ensure efficient
    irrigation and reduce water waste in urban green spaces. The sensors, combined
    with the central control display, provide real-time monitoring and control of
    the irrigation system, allowing for adjustments to be made based on changing conditions
    in the environment (Cruz-S''nchez et al., 2012; Khujamatov & Toshtemirov, 2020).
    Water loss in cities is a significant problem, often resulting from water leakage
    in urban infrastructure (Mutikanga et al., 2009). High-pressure pumps send a considerable
    amount of water into urban water distribution networks daily. The pressure within
    the pipes has the most significant and quickest hydraulic effect on the amount
    of leakage (Trifunovic, 2006). As time passes, some parts of the network become
    worn out and experience water leakage due to high water pressure within the pipes.
    If a broken pipe causes water to leak to the surface, the damage is easily identifiable.
    However, if the pipe is damaged deep underground, the water will never reach the
    surface, making detection and repair much more challenging (Puust et al., 2010).
    In a smart city, installing water leakage detection sensors and pressure-reducing
    pumps, and creating a network between them, can significantly reduce water loss.
    During certain hours of the day, water consumption by users decreases. If the
    water pressure inside the pipes is higher than the needs of the users during these
    hours, water leakage occurs in the worn-out urban infrastructure. Therefore, by
    reducing the water pressure during off-peak hours of water consumption by subscribers,
    water leakage can be prevented to a great extent. Smart water meters measure the
    peak and off-peak hours of water consumption by subscribers, and the information
    obtained from them is sent by the urban smart system network to the central controllers
    and displays. Consequently, if necessary, the water pressure can be reduced or
    increased by the installed pumps. Additionally, smart water meters are present
    in various nodes of the water distribution network structure, measuring the amount
    of water reaching that node. The total amount of water pumped in the nodes should
    match the amount of water output from the main pump. If the difference between
    the numbers exceeds the predetermined limit, a warning message is sent to the
    network supervisor on the central display to inform them of the existence of a
    leakage in the distribution network. Furthermore, a network of water leakage sensors
    is placed around the water distribution network infrastructure. These sensors
    measure the soil moisture around the pipes. If the soil moisture exceeds the standard
    limit determined according to the region''s climate, a warning message is sent
    to the network manager to take prompt action to repair the leak. The implementation
    of these measures in a smart city can significantly reduce water loss and promote
    sustainable water management practices (Fantozzi et al., 2014; Kulkarni & Farnham,
    2016; Laspidou, 2014). The smart water distribution system has several features,
    including the ability to report the amount of water consumed by subscribers in
    each area, detect water leaks, and schedule pre-determined water pressure reductions
    or increases (Bhardwaj et al., 2022; Nguyen et al., 2018). To implement the water
    leakage detection system using the KNX protocol, the following equipment is required:
    a switch operator (with the input level determined based on the diversity of vegetation
    coverage in terms of the type of irrigation), power supply, internet connection
    module, central control display for monitoring and entering initial information,
    electric valve, water leakage detection sensors, and network infrastructure. The
    water leakage detection sensors are crucial components of the system, as they
    detect any leaks and identify their exact location. The central control display
    receives information from the sensors and displays it to the network supervisor,
    who can take prompt action to repair the leak. The smart water distribution system
    reduces water loss and promotes sustainable water management practices in urban
    areas (Ciholas et al., 2019; Rinaldi et al., 2020). In addition to the solutions
    discussed earlier, smart cities can also employ other methods to control urban
    water resources. One such method is smart water pricing, which involves implementing
    pricing schemes that reflect the true cost of water production and distribution.
    This can incentivize water conservation and discourage wasteful usage. For instance,
    tiered pricing systems that charge higher rates for excessive water usage can
    encourage people to be more mindful of their water consumption. Another effective
    approach is public education and awareness campaigns. By educating the public
    about the importance of water conservation and providing practical tips for reducing
    water usage, cities can encourage residents to adopt more sustainable water usage
    habits. Such campaigns can be carried out through various channels, including
    social media, public service announcements, and community outreach programs. Therefore,
    implementing smart city solutions can significantly reduce urban water resource
    waste, which is of great importance in the face of increasing water scarcity in
    many countries around the world. By promoting sustainable water management practices,
    smart cities can ensure the availability of safe, clean water for future generations
    (Chandran et al., 2021; Karwot et al., 2016; Moy de Vitry et al., 2019). Fig.
    4 shows the main categories of smart city solutions for sustainable urban water
    management, including irrigation solutions and urban solutions. Irrigation solutions
    involve the use of smart irrigation controllers that optimize irrigation and reduce
    water consumption through moisture sensors and weather models. Urban solutions
    include the use of smart water meters to monitor water consumption and detect
    leaks, as well as the implementation of dynamic water tariffs. Additional methods
    include smart water pricing schemes and public education campaigns to promote
    sustainable water usage habits. The implementation of these solutions can significantly
    reduce water waste and promote sustainable water management practices in smart
    cities. Therefore, the existing literature provides substantial evidence regarding
    the water-saving and conservation advantages offered by smart irrigation systems
    and technologies that encompass leak detection and pressure management. Augmenting
    these measures with pricing incentives and educational campaigns is crucial for
    cultivating a culture of sustainable water usage in urban areas, as substantiated
    by previous research. Download : Download high-res image (555KB) Download : Download

    strategies and technologies for efficient water use and conservation in urban
    environments. 4.3.3. Technologies and strategies for electricity resource management
    in smart cities Smart city implementation holds immense potential for effective
    electricity resource management. To tackle this challenge, advanced technologies
    and strategic approaches are being employed within smart cities. These include
    smart grid systems, integration of renewable energy sources, energy-efficient
    building practices, demand response programs, infrastructure for electric vehicle
    charging, energy storage systems, microgrid frameworks, and data analytics. Smart
    grid systems use advanced sensors and communication technologies to monitor and
    control electricity distribution in real-time. Smart grids can aid in averting
    blackouts and enhancing the overall efficacy of the electricity system by optimizing
    electricity flows and curbing wasteful usage (Lazaroiu & Roscia, 2012; Xia et
    al., 2021). Additionally, smart cities are progressively adopting sustainable
    energy sources like solar and wind power to minimize dependence on fossil fuels
    and diminish greenhouse gas emissions. The integration of renewable energy sources
    into the grid can also enhance the resilience of the electricity system and reduce
    the probability of power outages. The promotion of energy-efficient building designs
    and technologies, such as LED lighting, smart thermostats, and automated shading
    systems, is advocated by smart cities to lower energy consumption in buildings.
    This can decrease electricity demand and help forestall power shortages. Furthermore,
    demand response programs urge consumers to decrease their electricity utilization
    during peak demand periods, thereby lowering the need for costly new power plants.
    Furthermore, smart cities are investing in electric vehicle charging infrastructure
    to support the transition to sustainable transportation (Silva et al., 2018; Pellicer
    et al., 2013). By providing convenient and accessible charging stations, smart
    cities can encourage more people to switch to EVs and reduce the demand for gasoline-powered
    vehicles that contribute to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Energy
    storage systems are also being explored to help balance electricity supply and
    demand, thereby preventing blackouts and improving the reliability of the electricity
    system. Several smart cities are adopting microgrids, which are small-scale electricity
    systems capable of functioning autonomously from the primary electricity grid.
    Microgrids can help improve the resilience and reliability of the electricity
    system by providing backup power during blackouts or other disruptions. Additionally,
    advanced data analytics tools are being used to better understand electricity
    usage patterns and identify opportunities for energy savings. Smart cities can
    analyze data from smart meters and other sensors to develop targeted programs
    to reduce electricity usage (Caragliu et al., 2011; Khalil et al., 2021). Smart
    grid systems are designed to incorporate advanced digital technologies to modernize
    traditional electricity grids. These systems use sensors and other devices to
    collect real-time data on electricity usage and grid conditions, and then use
    advanced analytics and control systems to optimize the flow of electricity and
    reduce wasteful usage (Phuangpornpitak & Tia, 2013). The implementation of smart
    grid systems can assist utilities in achieving a better balance between electricity
    supply and demand, which can enhance the overall dependability of the electricity
    system. Smart grids can automatically redirect electricity away from regions with
    high demand or store surplus electricity during periods of low demand and distribute
    it during peak demand. Moreover, smart grids can optimize the usage of sustainable
    energy sources like solar and wind power, which can aid in minimizing dependence
    on fossil fuels and diminishing greenhouse gas emissions. This can reduce the
    necessity for new power plants and enhance the utilization of existing generation
    capacity. Two-way communication is a key feature of smart grids, allowing utilities
    to collect data from sensors and other devices in real-time and send signals back
    to these devices to control their operation. This two-way communication enables
    smart grids to be more responsive to changing conditions and optimize the flow
    of electricity in real-time. By using advanced analytics and control systems,
    smart grids can optimize the use of these resources to reduce reliance on centralized
    power plants and increase the resilience of the electricity system. The cybersecurity
    of these systems is critical as smart grids rely on digital technologies and communication
    networks. Smart grid systems need to be designed with strong cybersecurity measures
    to prevent cyberattacks and protect the privacy and security of data. Smart grids
    rely on a variety of devices and systems that need to be interoperable and able
    to communicate with each other. Ensuring that these systems work together seamlessly
    can be challenging, especially when different vendors are involved (Colak et al.,
    2015; Lo & Ansari, 2011). The incorporation of sustainable energy sources like
    solar and wind power into the electricity grid is a crucial approach for smart
    cities to encourage sustainability and decrease dependence on fossil fuels. Solar
    power is increasingly being used by smart cities as solar panels can be installed
    on rooftops, carports, and other structures to generate electricity locally. By
    integrating solar power into the grid, smart cities can reduce reliance on centralized
    power plants that burn fossil fuels and contribute to air pollution and climate
    change. Wind power is another renewable energy source being embraced by smart
    cities. Wind turbines can be installed in windy areas to generate electricity
    that can be fed into the grid, contributing to a cleaner and more sustainable
    energy mix. However, one of the biggest challenges with renewable energy sources
    is their intermittency. The production of solar and wind power can fluctuate,
    making it challenging to balance electricity supply and demand, particularly during
    periods of high demand or low renewable energy production (Anees, 2012; Bhandari
    et al., 2014; Yousif et al., 2019). Smart cities are utilizing energy storage
    systems like batteries to accumulate surplus electricity generated by renewable
    energy sources and dispense it when required, assisting in enhancing the dependability
    of the electricity system and reducing the likelihood of power outages. Additionally,
    smart cities are adopting microgrids as small-scale electricity systems that can
    operate autonomously from the primary electricity grid. Microgrids can be fueled
    by sustainable energy sources like solar and wind power, offering backup power
    during power outages or other disruptions. Integrating renewable energy sources
    into the grid may require upgrading the grid infrastructure to handle the variable
    and distributed nature of these sources, which can be costly (Khan et al., 2018).
    Regulations and policies can also present barriers to integration, such as regulations
    around energy pricing or grid interconnection that may need to be updated to support
    the integration of renewable energy sources or the deployment of energy storage
    systems. Additionally, some members of the public may have concerns about the
    visual and environmental impacts of renewable energy sources, requiring public
    education and addressing concerns to promote acceptance. Despite these challenges,
    many smart cities are making progress in integrating renewable energy sources
    into the grid. By addressing these challenges and working collaboratively with
    stakeholders, cities can build more sustainable and resilient energy systems that
    benefit their citizens and the environment (Hammons, 2008; Liserre et al., 2010;
    Zahedi, 2011). Smart cities need to manage the electricity resources required
    to power electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure effectively. Charging station
    locations must be carefully chosen to ensure that they are easily accessible to
    EV drivers, even if it means installing new electrical infrastructure. Smart cities
    must also consider the types of charging stations installed, ranging from slow
    chargers to fast chargers, which can impact the demand on the electricity grid.
    Load management strategies, such as scheduling charging during off-peak hours
    or incentivizing EV owners to charge their vehicles during times of low demand,
    can help avoid overloading the electricity grid. To ensure that EV charging stations
    are located in areas that are easily accessible to EV drivers, smart cities can
    conduct a needs assessment, engage with stakeholders, use mapping tools, partner
    with private companies, and consider zoning and permitting regulations. A needs
    assessment can analyze data on the number of EVs in the area, the locations of
    existing charging stations, and the availability of electrical infrastructure
    in different areas. Engaging with stakeholders, including EV owners, local businesses,
    and community groups, can help identify convenient locations that meet the needs
    of the local community. Mapping tools can help identify potential locations for
    charging stations based on proximity to major highways, public transportation,
    and popular destinations. Partnering with private companies can provide valuable
    expertise in identifying optimal locations for charging stations. Finally, zoning
    and permitting regulations can encourage the installation of charging stations
    in areas that are easily accessible to EV drivers. By taking a proactive and collaborative
    approach, smart cities can build a more sustainable and resilient transportation
    system by ensuring that EV charging stations are located in areas that are easily
    accessible to EV drivers, promoting the adoption of EVs, and reducing greenhouse
    gas emissions from transportation (Maglaras et al., 2014; Qureshi et al., 2021;
    Vaidya & Mouftah, 2020). Managing electricity resources for energy storage systems
    is crucial for sustainable urban environment. The sizing of energy storage systems
    is a critical component to ensure that they provide the required electricity when
    needed. Historical electricity demand data is analyzed to determine peak demand
    periods and size the energy storage system accordingly. Smart cities may also
    need to implement load management strategies to manage electricity demand, such
    as scheduling charging during off-peak hours or incentivizing electricity users
    to reduce consumption during high demand. Regular maintenance is required to operate
    energy storage systems efficiently and effectively. Smart cities should consider
    maintenance and replacement costs when evaluating the economic feasibility of
    energy storage systems. To maintain energy storage effectively, smart cities can
    establish a regular maintenance schedule, use remote monitoring, perform performance
    analysis, provide maintenance personnel training and education, and enter into
    contractual agreements with energy storage system manufacturers or service providers.
    A comprehensive maintenance strategy can ensure effective and efficient energy
    storage maintenance, contributing to a more sustainable and resilient electricity
    system (Almihat et al., 2022; O''Dwyer et al., 2019; Taveres-Cachat et al., 2019).
    Smart cities are increasingly using data analytics tools to effectively manage
    electricity resources. By analyzing historical data on electricity usage, these
    tools can help forecast future demand patterns, allowing utilities to plan for
    electricity supply and demand, ensuring that there is enough electricity supply
    to meet demand during peak periods. Additionally, data analytics tools can help
    smart cities identify areas where energy is being wasted or used inefficiently,
    allowing utilities to develop targeted programs to reduce electricity usage and
    improve energy efficiency. Load management strategies such as scheduling charging
    during off-peak hours or using demand response programs can also be implemented
    using data analytics to incentivize electricity users to reduce their electricity
    consumption during times of high demand. Furthermore, smart cities can use data
    analytics tools to predict maintenance needs for electricity infrastructure, such
    as transformers and switches, reducing downtime and lowering the costs associated
    with equipment repairs and replacements. By improving energy efficiency, implementing
    time-of-use pricing, managing electricity demand, and predicting maintenance needs,
    data analytics tools can help smart cities reduce electricity costs for residents
    and businesses (Chen et al., 2021; Hashem et al., 2016; Sarker, 2022). Implementing
    smart city technologies for managing electricity resources can be challenging,
    and there are several factors that can impact the success of these initiatives.
    Some of the key challenges that smart cities face include cost, interoperability,
    data privacy and security, public engagement, and regulatory barriers. One of
    the primary challenges is the cost of implementing smart city technologies, which
    can be expensive. Building a smart grid or installing energy-efficient technologies
    in buildings can require significant upfront investments that may take years to
    recoup through energy savings. In addition, smart city technologies rely on a
    variety of sensors, devices, and systems that need to be interoperable and able
    to communicate with each other. Ensuring that these systems work together seamlessly
    can be challenging, especially when different vendors are involved. Data privacy
    and security is another significant challenge. Smart city technologies rely on
    vast amounts of data that need to be collected, stored, and analyzed. Ensuring
    the privacy and security of this data can be a significant challenge, as it may
    be vulnerable to cyberattacks or other threats. Public engagement is also crucial
    for the success of smart city initiatives. Educating the public on the benefits
    of these technologies and engaging them in the planning and implementation process
    can be challenging, especially when there are concerns about data privacy or the
    cost of these initiatives. Furthermore, regulatory barriers such as energy pricing
    or grid interconnection may need to be updated to support the integration of renewable
    energy sources or the deployment of energy storage systems. Despite these challenges,
    many cities are making progress in implementing smart city technologies for managing
    electricity resources. By addressing these challenges and working collaboratively
    with stakeholders, cities can build more sustainable and resilient energy systems
    that benefit their citizens and the environment (Shafiullah et al., 2022; Bawany
    & Shamsi, 2015; Hassan et al., 2021). Fig. 5 illustrates the various strategies
    and technologies that smart cities are implementing for electricity resource management.
    The figure is divided into two main categories: advanced technologies and challenges/considerations.
    The advanced technologies category includes smart grid systems, renewable energy
    integration, energy-efficient buildings, demand response programs, electric vehicle
    charging infrastructure, energy storage systems, microgrids, and data analytics.
    The challenges/considerations category includes cybersecurity, interoperability,
    intermittency of renewable energy sources, upgrading grid infrastructure, regulations
    and policies, and public acceptance. The figure highlights the importance of addressing
    these challenges to achieve more sustainable and resilient energy systems in smart
    cities. The findings depicted in Fig. 5 highlight that the adoption of smart grid
    systems, integration of renewable energy sources, establishment of EV infrastructure,
    and utilization of other relevant technologies can lead to a substantial reduction
    in greenhouse gas emissions, as demonstrated by various assessments. Nevertheless,
    effectively addressing the identified challenges necessitates collaborative efforts
    among multiple stakeholders and innovative policy measures to achieve the desired
    sustainability objectives. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download :

    4.3.4. Environmental effects and challenges of waste management in smart cities
    The primary objective of smart cities is to enhance the well-being of urban inhabitants
    and mitigate environmental pollution through the utilization of advanced technologies
    and efficient resource utilization. In the context of smart city development,
    sustainable management of urban resources, particularly recyclable materials like
    plastics, papers, metals, and glass, assumes great significance. To facilitate
    effective recycling management in smart cities, technologies specific to this
    domain are employed for the collection, segregation, recycling, and optimized
    management of recyclable waste materials. Smart technologies enable the collection
    of data from different recycling containers, which enhances the accuracy of waste
    collection and recycling. This, in turn, leads to efficient and effective recycling
    of waste, resulting in a decrease in the amount of waste produced, enhanced resource
    availability, and reduced environmental pollution. Moreover, recycling various
    materials creates employment opportunities and reduces waste management costs.
    Smart cities utilize various technologies for efficient and effective collection
    and recycling of recyclable waste, such as smart collection systems, separation
    and recycling technologies, artificial intelligence, deep learning, and blockchain.
    Smart collection systems, such as smart recycling containers, smart recycling
    bins, and smart collection networks, employ sensors and smart devices to collect
    and optimize the waste collection process with precision. Separation and recycling
    technologies like automatic sorting systems, advanced recycling systems, and recycling
    machines such as recycling mills are used to recycle recyclable waste. Artificial
    intelligence and deep learning technologies can detect, separate, and recycle
    recyclable waste in a smart and accurate manner (Ullah et al., 2023; Yong et al.,
    2023). By identifying recyclable waste, these technologies can streamline the
    recycling process and increase efficiency. Furthermore, blockchain technology
    can be utilized to ensure that all stages of the collection and recycling process
    are transparent and traceable, minimizing the likelihood of fraud and illegal
    transactions (Aazam et al., 2016; Anagnostopoulos et al., 2017; Esmaeilian et
    al., 2018). Advanced technologies such as sensors, data analytics, and IoT devices
    are used by smart collection systems to improve the collection and management
    of recyclable waste. Sensors are deployed to collect data on the level of recyclable
    waste in recycling containers or bins. These sensors can detect when a container
    or bin is full or nearly full and send an alert to waste collectors to empty it.
    Subsequent to the collection of data by sensors, data analytics tools and algorithms
    are implemented to optimize waste collection routes. By devising more efficient
    routes, waste collectors can diminish the duration and expenses related to redundant
    collections. IoT devices, such as smart recycling containers and bins, communicate
    with one another and with waste management systems, delivering real-time data
    on the whereabouts and status of recyclable waste. This enables waste management
    systems to optimize the collection process and minimize waste. The system also
    utilizes smart routing to optimize waste collection routes. By scrutinizing data
    on the status and location of recycling containers or bins, waste collectors can
    plan the most effectual collection routes, reducing the duration and costs associated
    with unnecessary collections. Additionally, smart collection systems offer remote
    monitoring capabilities for recycling containers or bins, which enable waste management
    systems to keep track of the status of recycling containers or bins in real-time.
    This allows them to respond to issues or emergencies rapidly. In conclusion, smart
    collection systems leverage advanced technologies to enhance the collection and
    management of recyclable waste, resulting in waste reduction and improved efficiency
    for waste management systems (Ali et al., 2020; B. Fang et al., 2023; Shukla &
    Hait, 2022). The introduction of smart collection systems comes with several challenges
    that require attention. One of the prominent concerns is the cost, as the implementation
    of such systems can be expensive, and the associated costs may be passed onto
    residents and businesses. This may act as a barrier to the adoption of these systems,
    especially in areas where the costs of waste management are already high. Moreover,
    the installation of new infrastructure, such as sensors, data analytics systems,
    and communication networks, is essential for the operation of smart collection
    systems, which can be time-consuming and costly. This is particularly true for
    areas with existing waste management infrastructure that may require upgrading
    or replacement. Another challenge associated with smart collection systems pertains
    to data management. These systems generate a vast amount of data that needs to
    be collected, analyzed, and utilized to optimize the waste collection process.
    This requires specialized skills and resources that may not be readily available
    in all areas. Additionally, the success of smart collection systems depends on
    the participation of various stakeholders, including waste collectors, residents,
    and businesses. Engaging these stakeholders and getting them to participate in
    the waste collection process can be challenging, especially in areas where waste
    segregation and recycling are not widely practiced or where there is resistance
    to change. Furthermore, smart collection systems rely on advanced technologies
    that may be susceptible to technical issues or failures. Ensuring that these systems
    are reliable and function correctly at all times can pose a challenge. Despite
    these challenges, the benefits of smart collection systems, such as increased
    efficiency, higher recycling rates, and reduced waste management costs, make them
    an attractive approach to waste management in smart cities. Therefore, it is imperative
    to address the challenges associated with the implementation of smart collection
    systems to fully realize their potential in waste management (Ahmad et al., 2021;
    Ebekozien et al., 2022; Ijemaru et al., 2022). Blockchain technology can be applied
    in numerous ways to enhance waste management practices. One such application is
    the utilization of blockchain for supply chain tracking to track the movement
    of waste from its inception to its final destination, such as a recycling facility
    or landfill. By documenting each step of the waste management process on the blockchain,
    stakeholders can maintain a clear and tamper-proof record of the waste''s journey,
    which can aid in tracking and management of waste streams (Arabian et al., 2022;
    Barenji & Nejad, 2022). Additionally, blockchain can be used to establish digital
    identities for waste management facilities, regulators, and other stakeholders
    involved in the waste management process, ensuring the legitimacy of waste management
    activities and that waste is being handled appropriately and lawfully. Another
    application of blockchain in waste management is the use of smart contracts to
    automate processes such as waste collection and recycling. Smart contracts can
    be programmed to execute specific actions automatically, such as initiating waste
    collection when a recycling bin is full (Samuel et al., 2022; Singh et al., 2022).
    Furthermore, blockchain-based reward systems can be implemented to incentivize
    sustainable waste management practices, such as recycling or reducing waste generation.
    For example, a blockchain-based reward system could provide tokens or other incentives
    to individuals or businesses that engage in sustainable waste management practices
    (X. Zhang et al., 2023; X. Zhang et al., 2023; X. Zhang et al., 2022; Kolahan
    et al., 2021). Also, blockchain technology can be utilized to establish decentralized
    waste management systems where waste management activities are coordinated among
    several stakeholders in a peer-to-peer network. This approach can reduce the need
    for centralized waste management facilities, which can be costly and time-consuming
    to construct and maintain. In summary, blockchain technology can be utilized to
    enhance transparency, efficiency, and sustainability in waste management practices
    (Aithal, 2021; Aroba et al., 2023; Nižetić et al., 2019). Blockchain technology
    holds tremendous potential in augmenting waste management practices by providing
    several benefits, such as transparency, traceability, efficiency, fraud prevention,
    and incentivization. Blockchain technology can establish a transparent and tamper-proof
    record of waste management activities, starting from waste collection to recycling.
    This can increase trust among stakeholders, including waste management companies,
    regulators, and citizens. Also, with blockchain, waste management activities can
    be traced back to their source, allowing for improved tracking and management
    of waste streams. This can lead to better waste management practices, a reduction
    in waste, and an increase in recycling rates. Blockchain technology can facilitate
    the efficient and secure exchange of information and resources between stakeholders.
    This can result in a reduction in the time and cost associated with waste management
    activities. Additionally, blockchain technology can aid in preventing fraud and
    illegal activities in waste management, such as illegal dumping or improper handling
    of hazardous waste. With blockchain, waste management activities can be recorded
    and verified, making it challenging for malicious actors to manipulate the system.
    Moreover, blockchain technology can be utilized to incentivize positive waste
    management behaviors, such as recycling or reducing waste generation. For instance,
    blockchain-based reward systems can offer incentives to individuals or businesses
    that engage in sustainable waste management practices. Blockchain technology has
    the potential to revolutionize waste management practices, but its implementation
    also presents challenges. One of the significant challenges is the technical complexity
    of blockchain-based waste management systems. This involves a considerable investment
    of specialized expertise and resources, making it costly and time-consuming. Additionally,
    integrating blockchain-based waste management systems with existing waste management
    infrastructure can be challenging as it requires significant changes to existing
    processes and systems, which may not be feasible or cost-effective. Another challenge
    is the accuracy and completeness of data recorded on the blockchain. If data is
    inputted manually or by multiple stakeholders with varying levels of expertise,
    it can affect the reliability of waste management data and the effectiveness of
    blockchain-based waste management systems. Besides, the implementation of blockchain-based
    waste management systems may raise regulatory and legal challenges, such as data
    privacy and security concerns, and compliance with waste management regulations.
    Lastly, the success of blockchain-based waste management systems depends on the
    adoption and engagement of stakeholders, including waste management companies,
    regulators, and citizens. Ensuring that all stakeholders are willing and able
    to participate in blockchain-based waste management systems can be a challenge.
    Therefore, while blockchain technology offers numerous benefits to waste management
    practices, it is crucial to address these challenges for its effective implementation
    (Cheng et al., 2022; Fayomi et al., 2021; Ogutu et al., 2021). Artificial intelligence
    and deep learning have the potential to revolutionize waste management practices
    in a multitude of ways. One notable area of improvement is waste sorting. AI and
    deep learning algorithms can be utilized to automatically sort waste into different
    categories, such as recyclable and non-recyclable waste, which reduces the need
    for manual sorting and minimizes the risk of contamination. Predictive analytics
    is another area where AI and deep learning can be applied. The scrutiny of data
    on waste generation and collection patterns permits waste management systems to
    predict future waste generation and devise waste collection routes more competently.
    This can result in more accurate waste forecasting, reduced time and cost associated
    with waste collection, and increased recycling rates. Furthermore, the development
    of smart bins equipped with sensors and cameras that can detect and sort waste
    automatically is made possible by AI and deep learning. These smart bins can accurately
    and efficiently sort waste into different categories, reducing contamination and
    increasing recycling rates. In addition, AI and deep learning algorithms can optimize
    waste management processes such as waste collection, transportation, and recycling
    by analyzing data on waste generation, collection, and recycling. This identification
    of inefficiencies can lead to suggestions for improvements to waste management
    processes. Also, AI and deep learning can be used to detect fraud and illegal
    activities in waste management. By analyzing data on waste management activities,
    AI and deep learning algorithms can identify anomalies or suspicious patterns
    and trigger alerts to waste management authorities. Artificial Intelligence and
    deep learning have the potential to significantly reduce the environmental impact
    of waste management practices. One of the notable ways in which these technologies
    can enhance waste management is through optimizing waste collection routes. By
    analyzing waste generation and collection patterns, AI and deep learning algorithms
    can identify the most efficient waste collection routes, reducing the distance
    traveled by waste collection vehicles and minimizing fuel consumption. This can
    lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. Another way
    in which AI and deep learning can assist waste management is by predicting waste
    generation. By leveraging historical data and considering variables such as weather
    patterns and demographics, AI and deep learning algorithms can forecast future
    waste generation. Accurate predictions can help waste management authorities to
    plan for future waste management needs, reducing the likelihood of overcapacity
    or undercapacity in waste management facilities. Furthermore, AI and deep learning
    algorithms can be utilized to reduce contamination by identifying and sorting
    recyclable materials more accurately. This can help increase the quality of recycled
    materials while decreasing contamination, leading to a reduction in the environmental
    impact of waste management. Properly recycled materials can be reused instead
    of ending up in landfills, which can help mitigate the environmental impact of
    waste disposal. In addition, AI and deep learning can improve landfill management
    by monitoring and analyzing data on landfill conditions such as temperature, moisture,
    and gas emissions. This can enable waste management authorities to better manage
    landfills and reduce the environmental impact of waste disposal. Lastly, AI and
    deep learning technologies can be used to identify hazardous waste, such as chemicals
    and heavy metals, in waste streams. By doing so, these technologies can ensure
    that hazardous waste is appropriately handled and disposed of, reducing the risk
    of environmental contamination and harm to human health (Pirlone & Spadaro, 2014;
    Shah et al., 2018; Thakur et al., 2022). There exist several challenges in the
    implementation of AI in waste management. Data quality is a primary challenge.
    The accuracy and completeness of data used to train AI models can be inconsistent
    and incomplete, making it challenging to develop accurate and reliable AI models.
    Waste management data is collected from various sources, and standardizing it
    can be difficult, leading to inaccuracies and incomplete data sets. Technical
    complexity is another challenge. Implementing AI systems in waste management can
    be technically complex, requiring specialized expertise and resources. Developing
    and maintaining AI algorithms and systems can be costly and time-consuming, and
    the lack of technical expertise in waste management can further complicate the
    process. Integrating AI systems with existing waste management infrastructure
    is another challenge. This can require significant changes to existing processes
    and systems, which may not be feasible or cost-effective. Moreover, waste management
    infrastructure varies widely across different regions, making it challenging to
    develop a standardized approach for implementing AI systems. Regulatory and legal
    challenges also pose a significant hurdle for the implementation of AI systems
    in waste management. These challenges can include data privacy and security concerns,
    compliance with waste management regulations, and liability issues associated
    with the use of AI systems. The success of AI systems in waste management depends
    on the adoption and engagement of stakeholders, including waste management companies,
    regulators, and citizens. Ensuring that all stakeholders are willing and able
    to participate in AI-based waste management systems can be a challenge. Additionally,
    public perception of AI and concerns about job displacement may hinder the adoption
    of AI systems in waste management (Agarwal et al., 2020; Han et al., 2022; Rubab
    et al., 2022). As previously mentioned, smart city technologies can exert both
    favorable and unfavorable effects on urban natural resources and the environment.
    These technologies can mitigate energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions
    by fine-tuning energy usage in buildings, transportation systems, and other infrastructure.
    This can lead to improved air quality. Water conservation can also be improved
    by monitoring water use, detecting leaks, and optimizing water distribution systems,
    which can reduce water pollution and conserve scarce water resources. In addition,
    waste management practices can be enhanced through the implementation of smart
    city technologies. This can include waste collection, sorting, and recycling,
    which can lead to reduced waste generation, increased recycling rates, and a decrease
    in the environmental impact of waste disposal. Additionally, the use of smart
    city technologies to establish green infrastructure, like urban gardens, green
    roofs, and parks, can aid in augmenting urban biodiversity, lessening the urban
    heat island effect, and refining air quality. Smart city technologies also have
    the potential to optimize transportation systems, which can reduce congestion,
    greenhouse gas emissions, and air pollution while promoting physical activity
    through the use of sustainable transportation modes like public transport, cycling,
    and walking. However, the implementation of smart city technologies can also have
    negative impacts on the environment. For example, the production and disposal
    of electronic devices used in smart city technologies can generate electronic
    waste if not managed properly. Moreover, if powered by non-renewable sources,
    smart city technologies can contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution.
    Additionally, the installation of smart city infrastructure, such as sensors,
    can require land and resources, which can have negative environmental impacts
    if not managed appropriately. To maximize the positive impacts of smart city technologies
    on the environment, it is crucial to prioritize sustainable and environmentally
    friendly solutions, such as renewable energy sources, green infrastructure, and
    sustainable transportation modes. The negative impacts of these technologies should
    also be carefully managed, such as the proper disposal of electronic devices and
    the appropriate use of land and resources during their installation. In conclusion,
    the impact of smart city technologies on urban natural resources and the environment
    depends on various factors, and implementing sustainable and environmentally friendly
    solutions is essential to ensure their positive impact on the environment (Chu
    et al., 2021; Guo et al., 2022). Therefore, smart city waste management technologies
    present both opportunities and challenges for promoting urban sustainability,
    as presented in Fig. 6. These technologies include smart collection systems, separation
    and recycling technologies, artificial intelligence, deep learning, and blockchain.
    Smart collection systems and separation recycling technologies can improve waste
    collection and sorting, increasing recycling rates and waste reduction. Artificial
    intelligence and deep learning enable predictive analytics and the optimization
    of waste management processes. Blockchain promotes transparency and security in
    waste management through supply chain tracking and can incentivize sustainable
    behaviors. However, the implementation of these technologies faces challenges
    related to costs, technical complexity, integration with existing infrastructure,
    data quality, regulations, and stakeholder participation. Consequently, the smart
    waste management solutions presented exhibit promising potential for diminishing
    waste volumes, enhancing recycling and circularity practices, reducing carbon
    emissions, and generating various sustainability benefits, as evidenced by previous
    implementations. However, effectively surmounting the identified challenges is
    crucial for the successful widespread adoption of these solutions at the city
    scale. Download : Download high-res image (930KB) Download : Download full-size

    technologies. 4.4. Smart cities and housing resource management The implementation
    of smart cities can yield both favorable and adverse environmental outcomes. On
    one hand, the incorporation of advanced technologies and optimized resource management
    practices can result in a reduction in environmental pollution and promote sustainable
    development in the housing sector. Notably, the utilization of energy-efficient
    appliances, monitoring systems for water consumption, and the integration of renewable
    energy sources within smart homes can contribute significantly to these objectives.
    However, it is important to acknowledge that the construction and maintenance
    of smart city infrastructure may also engender negative environmental consequences,
    such as heightened energy consumption and increased greenhouse gas emissions.
    Furthermore, the production and disposal of electronic devices and technological
    components used in smart cities may give rise to challenges related to electronic
    waste and other environmental concerns. The overall impact of smart city implementation
    on the environment and sustainable development in housing depends on various factors,
    such as the specific technologies and practices utilized, the level of public
    engagement and education, and the regulatory frameworks in place to ensure environmental
    sustainability (Jonek-Kowalska, 2022; Maalsen, 2019). In this section of the article,
    the impact of smart city implementation on enhancing sustainable development and
    managing natural resources in smart city houses is discussed. 4.4.1. Smart city
    technologies for optimizing home electricity consumption Smart city technologies
    provide various ways to manage electricity resources in houses. One of these ways
    is through home energy management systems that optimize energy consumption by
    controlling and automating electricity use. Such systems adjust lighting, heating,
    and cooling based on occupancy, time of day, and other factors. Smart appliances,
    including smart thermostats, lighting systems, and home appliances, can also be
    remotely controlled and adjusted based on energy demand and user preferences.
    Moreover, smart city technologies enable time-of-use pricing, which charges residents
    different rates for electricity use depending on the time of day. This approach
    incentivizes residents to reduce their electricity consumption during peak demand
    periods when electricity prices are high. Additionally, smart city technologies
    support energy-efficient building design through features such as insulation,
    efficient lighting and appliances, and energy-saving building materials. Time-of-use
    pricing provides several benefits to residents. Firstly, it encourages them to
    shift their electricity consumption to off-peak hours when electricity prices
    are lower, leading to reduced electricity bills. Furthermore, this approach reduces
    the overall demand for electricity during peak hours, thereby mitigating the risk
    of power outages and reducing the need for expensive new power plants. Secondly,
    time-of-use pricing promotes energy-efficient practices among residents, such
    as using appliances during off-peak hours or reducing overall energy consumption
    during peak hours. By adopting such practices, residents can reduce their carbon
    footprint and contribute to a more sustainable future. Finally, time-of-use pricing
    can lower overall electricity costs for the local community by decreasing the
    need for expensive peak capacity power plants. This can result in more stable
    and predictable electricity prices for residents in the long term. By utilizing
    time-of-use pricing, communities can benefit from lower electricity bills, reduced
    carbon emissions, and a more stable electricity supply. Smart city technologies
    also facilitate home energy audits, which can be conducted remotely using smart
    sensors. These audits provide personalized recommendations to residents for reducing
    energy consumption. By using these various approaches, smart city technologies
    optimize electricity use in houses, reducing energy consumption and greenhouse
    gas emissions while lowering electricity bills (H. Kim et al., 2021; Curiale,
    2014; Humayun et al., 2022). Smart appliances are increasingly being used in homes
    to manage energy consumption effectively and improve overall efficiency. These
    smart appliances include smart thermostats, smart lighting systems, smart home
    appliances, smart plugs, and smart water heaters. Smart thermostats are programmed
    to adjust heating and cooling settings automatically by taking into account factors
    such as occupancy, time of day, and weather conditions. By learning the residents''
    preferences and adjusting the settings accordingly, they help to reduce energy
    consumption and lower electricity bills. Smart lighting systems are equipped with
    sensors and automation technology that can adjust lighting levels based on occupancy
    and time of day. These systems can be conveniently controlled using a smartphone
    app from anywhere, enabling residents to turn lights on and off remotely and reduce
    energy consumption. Smart home appliances, such as refrigerators, washing machines,
    and dishwashers, can be connected to home automation systems and controlled remotely.
    They can adjust their energy usage based on demand and provide feedback on energy
    consumption, enabling residents to manage their usage effectively. Smart plugs
    can control the power supply to appliances and devices that are not smart-enabled.
    They can be programmed to turn off automatically when not in use, reducing energy
    consumption. Smart water heaters utilize sensors and automation technology to
    adjust the temperature of the water based on demand. They can be controlled remotely
    and provide feedback on energy consumption and usage patterns, enabling residents
    to manage their usage effectively (Alzoubi, 2022; Asare-Bediako et al., 2012;
    Saad al-sumaiti et al., 2014). There are various methods available for integrating
    smart appliances into home automation systems, depending on the appliance and
    the automation system. These methods include Wi-Fi connectivity, Bluetooth connectivity,
    Zigbee or Z-Wave protocols, IFTTT, and home automation hubs (Al-Qaseemi et al.,
    2016). Smart appliances that are equipped with built-in Wi-Fi connectivity can
    be connected to the home Wi-Fi network, enabling them to be controlled using smartphone
    apps or voice assistants (Jabbar et al., 2019). Some smart appliances use Bluetooth
    connectivity to communicate with other devices like smartphones or smart home
    hubs (ur Rehman & Gruhn, 2018). Zigbee or Z-Wave protocols are wireless communication
    protocols that are commonly used in smart home automation systems, and smart appliances
    that are compatible with these protocols can be connected to smart home hubs and
    controlled through the hub (Naidu & Kumar, 2019). IFTTT is a web-based service
    that allows users to create custom automation rules between different devices
    and services. Smart appliances that are compatible with IFTTT can be integrated
    into home automation systems and controlled based on specific triggers and actions
    (Coronado & Iglesias, 2015). Home automation hubs, such as Amazon Echo, Google
    Home, or Apple HomeKit, offer a centralized interface for controlling multiple
    smart appliances. Smart appliances that are compatible with these hubs can be
    connected to the hub and controlled using voice commands or smartphone apps (Kamdar
    et al., 2017). Smart appliances offer great convenience and flexibility as they
    can be controlled remotely using a smartphone app. These apps enable users to
    manage and monitor their appliances from anywhere with an internet connection.
    For instance, a smart thermostat app allows users to adjust their home''s temperature
    remotely, ensuring a comfortable environment while saving energy. Similarly, a
    smart lighting app enables users to turn lights on and off from anywhere, even
    when not at home. Moreover, a smart dishwasher app allows users to start and stop
    their dishwasher remotely, allowing them to run it during off-peak electricity
    hours and save money on their energy bill. To control smart appliances using a
    smartphone app, users typically have to connect their appliances to a Wi-Fi network
    and download the manufacturer''s app. Once the app is installed, users can control
    their appliances using their smartphone, tablet, or any other mobile device. This
    feature provides ease of access and control to users, making their lives more
    convenient. While the ability to control smart appliances remotely using a smartphone
    app is a significant advantage, there are also some limitations to consider. One
    of these limitations is that the app''s functionality and the range of tasks it
    can perform may be restricted compared to the physical controls on the appliance
    itself. For instance, a smart oven may provide more temperature and cooking options
    on its physical control panel than on the app. Another limitation is that controlling
    smart appliances remotely requires a stable and dependable internet connection.
    If the internet connection is weak or lost, users may face difficulty controlling
    their appliances remotely. Moreover, if the app or the manufacturer''s server
    experiences technical issues, users may also encounter difficulties controlling
    their appliances. Furthermore, some users may have concerns about the security
    of their personal data and the privacy of their homes when using a smartphone
    app to control their smart appliances remotely. Hackers could potentially access
    the app and gain control of the appliances, leading to security concerns and privacy
    violations (Makhadmeh et al., 2019; Molla et al., 2019; Molla et al., 2018). 4.4.2.
    Reducing water consumption with smart home appliances and technologies Smart home
    appliances are useful not only for reducing energy consumption but also for reducing
    water consumption. By utilizing these appliances, homeowners can significantly
    reduce their water usage, contributing to a sustainable future. Among these, smart
    irrigation systems can reduce water usage in gardens and green spaces. These systems
    adopt soil moisture sensors to regulate watering schedules contingent on weather
    conditions and plant requirements. Similarly, smart toilets equipped with advanced
    technologies such as automatic washing and drying systems can minimize water usage
    by using only the necessary amount of water for cleaning. Smart washing machines
    are also equipped with water flow sensors that can precisely control the amount
    of water used, reducing water consumption as a result. Smart faucets can also
    help reduce water usage by using motion sensors to allow water flow only when
    needed and shutting off automatically when not in use. Smart showerheads equipped
    with sensors that detect shower occupancy and limit the amount of water used per
    shower also help to reduce water consumption. Additionally, smart leak detectors
    can prevent water waste by detecting leaks in pipes or appliances and alerting
    homeowners before the damage becomes severe. Smart irrigation controllers can
    detect leaks, and prevent water waste. Smart water meters can help homeowners
    track their water consumption and identify areas where water usage can be reduced.
    Smart pool systems also use sensors and automation to optimize pool water chemistry
    and detect leaks, minimizing water waste (Ishak et al., 2017; Nilsson et al.,
    2018; Passenberg et al., 2016; Veselinović et al., 2020; Waleed et al., 2018).
    In KNX protocol-enabled smart buildings, a smart water meter is installed after
    the main water pipe enters the subscriber''s premises. The smart water meter determines
    the required amount of water for each day and night based on water consumption
    patterns, considering the number of residents and other factors. If the building''s
    water consumption exceeds the predetermined amount, the smart water meter sends
    a message to the controllers to cut off the water flow and sends an alert message
    to the residents'' control panels or mobile phones. Following this alert, if the
    water flow is reconnected, the cost of water per liter progressively increases.
    To configure the KNX protocol, several equipment items are necessary, including
    a switch operator, two power supplies, an internet connection module, a central
    control display for monitoring and entering initial information, an electric valve,
    two energy meters, and eight network infrastructures. Improper reuse, dripping,
    or leaks caused by corrosion and wear on washers in water valves lead to significant
    drinking water wastage in residential buildings. These issues are often prevalent
    in areas of the building where people are not always present, such as bathrooms
    and toilets. In smart buildings designed with the KNX protocol, presence detection
    sensors are installed in these areas to turn the water on and off based on the
    person''s presence. To implement a smart system that controls the water temperature
    in residential homes using the KNX protocol, specific equipment is required, including
    a switch operator, two power supplies, an internet connection module, a central
    control display for monitoring and entering initial information, an electric valve,
    two human presence detection sensors, and eight network infrastructures. Around
    60 % of household drinking water is used for washing purposes, resulting in wastage
    of a portion of water to achieve the desired temperature in each wash (such as
    in bathrooms and kitchen sinks). Therefore, in a smart building, sensors can be
    installed at the outlet of water valves to determine the desired water temperature.
    The embedded system then adjusts the water temperature inside the pipes until
    it reaches the desired temperature and makes it available to the user. To implement
    a smart system that controls the water temperature in residential homes using
    the KNX protocol, specific equipment is required, including a switch operator,
    two power supplies, an internet connection module, a central control display for
    monitoring and entering initial information, an electric valve, two water temperature
    sensors, eight human presence detection sensors, and one network infrastructure
    (Bajer, 2018; Benavente-Peces, 2019; Koulamas et al., 2017). Fig. 7 shows the
    various smart home appliances and technologies that can optimize energy and water
    consumption in households. The figure is categorized into three sections: smart
    energy management systems, time-of-use pricing, and smart water management systems.
    The smart energy management systems category includes examples such as smart thermostats,
    lighting systems, and home appliances, which can be remotely controlled and adjusted
    based on energy demand and user preferences. Time-of-use pricing, demonstrated
    in the second category, incentivizes residents to reduce electricity consumption
    during peak demand periods when electricity prices are high, resulting in reduced
    electricity bills, stable electricity supply, and a smaller carbon footprint.
    The third category, smart water management systems, comprises smart toilets, washing
    machines, faucets, showerheads, leak detectors, irrigation controllers, water
    meters, and pool systems, which can significantly reduce water usage. In general,
    the utilization of smart home appliances and technologies empowers homeowners
    to effectively manage their energy and water usage, thereby making a valuable
    contribution towards a more sustainable future. Extensive research reveals that
    the implementation of smart home energy and water systems, as depicted, facilitates
    substantial resource savings and conservation while offering residents flexibility
    and convenience. When combined with sustainable building practices, these technologies
    assume a critical role in promoting sustainable housing and achieving cities''
    efficiency objectives. Download : Download high-res image (832KB) Download : Download

    and water resource management. 5. Conclusion This study employed a descriptive-analytical
    research methodology to investigate the integration of urban natural resources
    and smart city technologies for sustainable development. Through a systematic
    review and analysis of literature, the study aimed to explore the concept of smart
    cities and identify key elements related to the integration of green spaces and
    smart technologies in cities. The findings of this study indicate that green spaces
    play a significant role in promoting sustainability in smart cities. The incorporation
    of green spaces, such as converting them into renewable energy sources, using
    them as natural filters to improve air and water quality, and designing them as
    public spaces, can facilitate environmental, social, and economic development
    in smart cities. However, effectively utilizing green spaces requires the implementation
    of smart technologies, such as sensors, to collect and analyze data on factors
    like air pollution, temperature, and irrigation levels. This data can provide
    insights to improve the planning and management of green spaces in a sustainable
    manner. While the implementation of green space data analysis offers several benefits,
    such as improved air quality, water conservation, urban planning, and public health,
    it also faces challenges related to cost, data reliability, privacy, and expertise.
    Strategies, such as public-private partnerships, community engagement, and allocating
    funding and resources, can help address these challenges. Comparative analysis
    further revealed that cities in the West and East employ green space data analysis,
    but they differ in their approaches and motivations. The focus in the West has
    been primarily on environmental and social benefits, whereas in the East, the
    emphasis has been more on urban planning and development. The study also demonstrates
    that smart cities can use various technologies and policies to address environmental
    challenges, such as air pollution in low-income and disadvantaged communities.
    Deploying air quality sensors, implementing green infrastructure, transit-oriented
    development, low-emission zones, clean energy incentives, and community outreach
    campaigns have been effective in improving air quality and public health in these
    communities. However, the effectiveness of these interventions depends on factors
    such as policy design, community engagement, available resources, and infrastructure.
    Smart cities are utilizing advanced technologies and strategies to effectively
    manage electricity resources and build more sustainable energy systems. Smart
    grid systems allow cities to optimize the flow of electricity in real-time, resulting
    in improved efficiency and reliability. Integrating renewable energy sources such
    as solar and wind power into the grid promotes sustainability by reducing reliance
    on fossil fuels and emissions. Energy-efficient building designs and demand response
    programs help to lower overall electricity demand and costs. Investing in electric
    vehicle charging infrastructure and energy storage systems provides more options
    for balancing supply and demand. Microgrids increase resilience by providing backup
    power. Furthermore, data analytics tools enable targeted programs aimed at reducing
    waste and predicting infrastructure needs. Despite the numerous benefits, challenges
    such as high costs, interoperability, and data privacy must be addressed to ensure
    the feasibility and success of these technologies. A comprehensive, collaborative
    approach that promotes public understanding and policy reform can further progress
    in this area. The future of urban living depends on adaptable, renewable energy
    systems and efficient resource use. With global populations centralized in cities,
    their infrastructure and policies will shape sustainability on a broad scale.
    Technological and social innovation must converge to develop pragmatic solutions
    for managing electricity in cities. Transitioning from outdated systems requires
    long-term vision and investments that yield returns through environmental and
    financial security. Though a complex undertaking, reimagining how we power our
    shared spaces paves the way for greater wellbeing, connectivity, and prosperity.
    With smart designs and stronger communities, cities can lead in fostering a cleaner,
    brighter future for generations to come. Several key conclusions can be drawn
    regarding smart city solutions for sustainable urban water management. Smart irrigation
    systems that utilize soil moisture sensors and weather data can optimize water
    usage for urban green spaces and reduce waste. By linking the sensors to a central
    control system, irrigation can be tailored to the specific needs of the plants
    and delayed during times when rain is forecast. This precision approach can improve
    irrigation efficiency and reduce excess water usage, which can range from 50 to
    70 % to up to 95 %. Smart water distribution systems equipped with meters, sensors,
    and variable pressure pumps can significantly curb water loss from leakage. Installing
    meters at network nodes and linking them to a control center allows for the continuous
    monitoring of water flow, enabling the rapid detection of anomalous losses. Reducing
    pressure during low-demand periods can also mitigate leakage from worn infrastructure.
    Such systems have been shown to achieve water savings of up to 11 % when implemented
    at a city scale. Demand management initiatives, such as tiered pricing and education
    programs, can encourage conservation among water users. Dynamic pricing that increases
    rates for higher levels of consumption has been demonstrated to motivate people
    to use less water. Education programs that provide information about water issues
    and offer tips for reducing usage can also help foster a culture of sustainability.
    Smart cities aim to utilize advanced technologies to enhance sustainability and
    improve the quality of life. However, it is important to consider the potential
    positive and negative impacts of these technologies on the environment. While
    smart technologies can optimize energy usage, enhance water conservation, improve
    waste management, and promote the use of green infrastructure and sustainable
    transportation, their production and disposal can also generate electronic waste
    that requires careful management to avoid environmental harm. Additionally, the
    installation of smart infrastructure requires land and resources, which must be
    used responsibly. Despite these challenges, the benefits of smart cities can far
    outweigh their costs when proper safeguards and policymaking are in place. This
    section highlights several key conclusions regarding the role of smart technologies
    in urban sustainability. Smart energy systems that utilize renewable sources and
    optimize usage can substantially decrease greenhouse gas emissions and pollution.
    Precision technologies for water distribution and irrigation can curb excess water
    usage and loss, mitigating scarcity even as populations grow. Advanced waste collection
    and sorting techniques enabled by sensors and AI can minimize waste generation,
    increase recycling, and reduce the impact of waste disposal on the environment.
    Blockchain technology, in particular, shows promise for transparent and efficient
    waste management. Smart transportation and infrastructure can reduce vehicle usage,
    promote walking and cycling, and foster the development of green spaces, with
    benefits for both the environment and public health. By prioritizing minimal environmental
    impact through sustainable solutions and policies, smart cities can leverage technology
    to conserve natural resources rather than exploit them. The integration of smart
    home technologies offers promising solutions for optimizing resource management
    and reducing environmental impacts in housing. Through the use of smart appliances,
    home automation systems, and sustainable building practices, residents can significantly
    reduce their energy and water consumption. Smart thermostats, lighting systems,
    leak detectors, and time-of-use pricing systems enable convenient and efficient
    monitoring of resource usage, incentivizing more sustainable behaviors. Despite
    limitations related to technology access and electronic waste, communities stand
    to benefit both environmentally and economically by transitioning to smart and
    eco-friendly homes. Smart city systems can leverage data on resource demands to
    develop targeted programs for residential efficiency and infrastructure improvements.
    Given the concentration of global populations in cities, sustainable housing is
    a crucial component of the broader movement toward secure and livable urban spaces.
    However, further research is needed to assess the long-term impacts, ensure equitable
    access, and streamline the complex processes of upgrading conventional homes or
    developing new smart communities. The main findings and contributions of this
    study encompass the positive role of green spaces in promoting sustainability
    through their utilization as renewable energy sources, natural filtration systems,
    and public gathering spaces. Additionally, the study underscores the importance
    of incorporating smart technologies, such as sensors, to effectively gather and
    analyze data for enhanced planning and management of green spaces. While the utilization
    of data analysis in green space management offers numerous advantages, it is crucial
    to address associated challenges through strategies like public-private partnerships
    and community involvement. By conducting a comparative analysis of Western and
    Eastern cities, the research uncovers distinct motivations behind green space
    data analysis, with a focus on environmental and social benefits in Western cities,
    and urban planning benefits in Eastern cities. Furthermore, the study highlights
    the potential of technologies and policies to address environmental justice concerns
    in disadvantaged communities. Notably, the research evaluates various technologies
    and strategies for optimizing electricity resources, conserving water, and managing
    waste with the goal of promoting urban sustainability. Therefore, the integration
    of smart technologies and sustainable practices in homes and cities demonstrates
    the potential for technology and social innovation to converge in pragmatic solutions
    that yield wellbeing through efficiency, cost savings, and reduced environmental
    harm. By embracing green designs and practices, communities can lead the way in
    building a cleaner and brighter future for generations to come. Declaration of

    seederNon-renewable energy 1. Introduction Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is worlds’
    most important cereal crop [1,2] and serves as a staple food for c. a. 35% people
    worldwide [3]. It is the cheapest source of carbohydrates (∼60–80%), proteins
    (∼8–15%), fat (∼1.5–2.0%), minerals (∼1.5–2.0%), vitamins (B-complex and E), and
    crude fiber (∼2.2%) [4]. Wheat is cultivated globally on approximately 217 million
    hectares (Mha) in different agro-climatic regions (Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia)
    [5], with total production of ∼713 million tons [6]. In the Indo-Gangetic Plains
    (IGPs) of South Asia including India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and China, wheat
    is typically cultivated in rotation with rice (Oryza sativa L.), constituting
    an annual rice-wheat cropping system (RWCS). Rice-wheat cropping in South Asia
    and China is practiced for the last ∼1000-years [7]. Rice-wheat cropping in South
    Asia and China covers ∼26 Mha of cultivated land, comprising c. a. 13.5 Mha in
    South Asia alone, representing ∼85% of IGPs total cultivated area [8], and providing
    home to ∼1.6 billion people [9]. The Indian IGPs covers ∼10.5 Mha including ∼4.1
    Mha of north-western states comprising Punjab, Haryana, Uttarakhand and western
    Uttar Pradesh [10]. The sustainability of RWCS in Indian IGPs has been a debatable
    issue over a few decades, primarily due to open-field burning of rice residues
    after its mechanical harvesting [2]. Rice residues burning leads to significant
    environmental pollution caused by substantial release of greenhouse gases [11,12].
    Nonetheless, residue burning deteriorates soil health [13], increased C footprints
    vis-à-vis decreased C sustainability of RWCS [14]. In north-western India, rice
    is harvested mechanically by combine harvesters; leaving significant amounts of
    loose straw and stubble in the field [10,15]. Annually, ∼2.5 million rice producers
    in north-western India burn rice stubble to clear fields for sowing the subsequent
    wheat crop [16]. In Asia, annually ∼600–800 million tons of rice straw is produced,
    whilst the global estimates are approximately 1 billion tons [17,18]. Alone in
    north-western India, ∼500 million tons of crop residues is produced every year
    [19]. According to Andreae and Merlet [11], burning of 1.0 Mg straw (dry mass)
    releases ∼1515 kg CO2, 92 kg CO, 2.7 kg CH4 and 0.07 kg N2O. Nevertheless, burning
    of 1.0 Mg of rice straw leads to loss of ∼5.5 kg N, 2.3 kg P, 25 kg K and 1.2
    kg S from the soil, with significant loss to soil health [13,20]. Therefore, proper
    management of rice residues before wheat establishment is most important for sustainability
    of RWCS [1,2,21]. The conventional tillage (CT) methods for wheat establishment
    after open field burning of rice residues typically involve multiple passes of
    agri-machinery to perform plowing, harrowing, planking, and seeding operations
    [22]. During last decade or two, several rice residue management (RRM) technologies
    have been extensively evaluated in north-western India, including residue removal
    using balers followed by wheat establishment through zero till (ZT) technology,
    retention of residue as surface mulch, and residue incorporation through energy
    intensive tillage using reversible moldboard plows (MBP) and/or rotavator tillage
    (RT) [14]. The ZT drill is used to sow wheat directly into unplowed fields after
    removal of residues from the fields using baler technology [14]. Extensive research
    has been conducted on ZT technology for wheat establishment, and has shown promising
    results due to timely sowing of wheat, compared with the CT in RWCS [[23], [24],
    [25]]. ZT technology after residue removal has great limitation of C loss, besides
    requiring additional operation of baler for residue collection. The recent development
    of specialized equipment such as happy seeder (a modified ZT drill capable of
    wheat seeding directly without any prior seedbed preparation) allowed for in-situ
    RRM [14,26], enables the surface retention of rice residue and simultaneous wheat
    seeding in a single pass of a tractor [21]. Happy seeder technology has made it
    possible to manage residue on-site without the need for additional operations
    [21,27], besides addressing limitations of ZT technology. Happy seeder technology
    has significant potential to establish wheat following in-situ RRM with co-benefits
    of soil C sequestration through reduced tillage besides C input from residues
    into the soil [14,26,28]. However, adoption for RRM has been slow among farmers
    in north-western India, due to farmer''s preference for CT involving intensive
    tillage before wheat sowing in well prepared seedbeds. Wheat establishment following
    CT gives the wheat field a good look about 20–25 days after sowing, which is why
    farmers tend to stick to it. Recently emerged super seeder technology incorporate
    rice residue into soil in a single pass of a tractor and simultaneously facilitate
    fine seed bed preparation along with wheat seeding. As compared to other technologies
    e.g. reversible MBP/RT, super seeder has been less tillage intensive. Due to reduced
    tillage intensity and diesel consumption, super seeder technology has lower energy
    footprints, which make it a more energy efficient and eco-friendly option for
    farmers. Decreased diesel fuel consumption has potential for reduced C equivalent
    emissions [14], because ∼2.6 kg CO2 is released to the atmosphere for each liter
    of diesel fuel consumed [22]. Energy is an essential input to increase crop productivity
    [[29], [30], [31]]]. The amount of energy input in crop production depends upon
    crop production and soil management practices [30,[32], [33], [34], [35]]. Chemical
    fertilizers are the major energy inputs, contributing ∼44–54% towards total input
    energy (EI) in different cropping systems [8,29,36]. Similarly, diesel fuel energy
    comprises ∼12–15% and human labor energy ∼11–14%, and agri-machinery energy required
    for field preparation ∼13–17% of EI [36]. The energy ratio (ER) of 1.8–7.5 for
    wheat [29,34,[37], [38], [39], [40]], 1.5–5.0 for rice [8,[41], [42], [43]], 2.2–7.4
    for maize [37,40,44] and 2.3–4.6 for soybean underpins overwhelming significance
    of contrasting crop production practices which had likely impact on ecosystem''s
    ER [37,45,46]. Therefore, optimization of ER to enhance crop productivity and
    production efficiency [47], economic returns [30,48], and ecosystems'' resilience
    for increased C sustainability [14,35] of a cropping system is pre-requisite for
    preserving natural resources [37] and enhancing net ecosystems'' C budget [26,28,35].
    Data envelopment analysis (DEA) emerged as most robust energy optimization technique
    in crop production, surpassing both parametric and non-parametric approaches [8,29,[49],
    [50], [51], [52], [53]]. As a linear programming (LP) based approach, DEA can
    effectively elucidate the efficient from an inefficient farming units called decision-making
    units (DMUs), while simultaneously estimating the amount of input energy that
    could be saved through the implementation of best management practices (BMPs)
    at current productivity levels [52,53]. Although, DEA based benchmarking of DMUs
    under wheat established following CT as well as for the fields with RRM using
    happy seeder technology is attempted earlier [26,29]; yet, information regarding
    the budgeting and energy optimization in wheat with in-situ rice residue incorporation
    following super seeder technology is largely lacking [31]. We hypothesized that
    energy optimization following DEA based benchmarking would help reduce energy
    footprints in wheat established by using super seeder technology. Therefore, we
    aimed to budget energy input and to develop energy input-output relationships
    for wheat established following in-situ rice residue incorporation with super
    seeder technology. Additionally, we applied DEA approach to segregate energy efficient
    DMUs from inefficient ones to improve energy efficiency and estimate excess energy
    use by inefficient DMUs due to over application of different agri-inputs. The
    present study would help decision and policy makers, and stakeholders to prioritize
    and strengthen the agricultural extension endeavors for dissemination the technology
    and educating the decision makers to make wheat ecosystems energy efficient and
    ecologically sustainable. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Brief information of study
    area The study region in Mansa district (N 29O 32′to 30O 12′; E 75O 10′ to 75O
    46′) of Punjab in north-western India covers ∼2,171 km2. The net sown area of
    ∼1900 km2 represents ∼87.5% of the total geographical area of study region [54].
    The study region is characterized by semi-arid climate with distinct wet and dry
    seasons with average rainfall of ∼378.2 mm year−1, received mainly during monsoon
    season (extending between end-June to end-September). Mean maximum temperature
    reaches 48 °C in May–June, and mean minimum temperature of 3.5 °C in December–January.
    Study region predominantly has light-textured soils with salinity/alkalinity issues
    [55]. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is the major winter season crop cultivated
    in rotation with rice (Oryza sativa L.) and cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), constituting
    rice-wheat and cotton-wheat cropping systems, respectively [56]. 2.2. Brief description
    of technology evaluated and data collection procedure Super seeder is a tractor
    mounted machine capable of direct seeding of wheat in rice fields after combine
    harvesting. It consisted of a straw managing rotor for incorporation of rice straw
    and a seeding unit for wheat sowing in lines (Annexure-1, photo showing wheat
    sowing operation using super seeder). Power to the rotor is provided by tractor
    PTO through a gear box. Machine is operated by a tractor of 55 Horse Power (HP)
    or above. Data were collected during face-to-face interviews (November-2021 to
    April-2022) from randomly selected 45 wheat growers adopted super seeder technology
    for in-situ incorporation of rice residues and establishing wheat (referred as
    DMUs in sub-section 2.4). A semi- interview schedule pre-tested on 10 randomly
    selected respondents was used for data collection. Information on respondent''s
    socio-personal characteristics, farm characteristics as well as quantity of agri-inputs
    (viz. Seed, fuel, labor, fertilizers, biocides, agri-machinery, irrigation water)
    applied and crop yields obtained was recorded from each DMU. Energy inputs and
    outputs were estimated based on specified energy equivalents (Table 1). The seed,
    diesel fuel, human labor, chemical fertilizers and biocides related energy input
    was estimated by multiplying the quantity of applied inputs with their respective
    energy equivalent values (Eqs. (1), (2), (3), (4), (5))) [8,53]. Fig. 1 illustrates
    the diagrammatic representation of the system boundaries for depicting different
    production processes associated with wheat establishment following super seeder
    technology. Briefly, the respondents were asked for number of times each field
    operation was performed starting for tillage to harvesting, time required and
    the diesel fuel consumption in each operation. The information was recorded for
    1.0 acre, and was changed to hectare basis (1 ha = 2.5 acres). (1) Where,  = seed

    processes related to wheat establishment with super seeder technology in north-western
    India. Electricity energy (EE) was estimated based on total HP used to extract
    groundwater for irrigation and motor-run time (h). Irrigation water energy (IWE)
    was calculated based on the irrigations applied to wheat and motor HP. Agri-machinery
    related energy (AME) was estimated depending upon energy costs for their manufacture,
    repair, maintenance and transportation. To estimate AME, weights and useful life
    of agri-machinery and energy coefficients (e.g. 93.61 MJ kg−1 for tractor, 62.7
    MJ kg−1 for other agri-machinery) were considered (Eq. (6)) [53]. (6) Where,  =
    agri-machinery related energy (MJ ha−1), nergy conversion factor (MJ kg−1), W  =
    weight of agri-machinery (kg), L  = economical life of agri-machinery (h), T  =
    working time (h) and A  = size of farm (ha). The total input energy (EI) was calculated
    by adding the energy input from all resources used (Eq. (7)) used in the wheat
    cultivation [8]. (7) 2.3. Estimation of output energy and related indices Wheat
    grain yield was recorded for each farm at harvesting. However, straw yield was
    estimated based on economic: residue yield ratio [62]. Grain and straw yield was
    changed to energy units using specific energy equivalents (Table 1). Total output
    energy (EO) was estimated as sum of energy output as seed + straw using Eq. (8)
    [8,52,53]. (8) Energy efficiency of studied DMUs was evaluated through various
    energy indices, e.g. energy productivity (EP; ratio of grain yield to EI) (Eq.
    (9)), specific energy (ES; ratio of EI to grain yield (Eq. (10)), energy ratio
    (ER; ratio of EO to EI) (Eq. (11)), net energy gain (NEG; difference between EO
    and EI) (Eq. (12)), and human energy profitability (HPE; ratio of EO to HE) (Eq.
    (13)) [8,53]. (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) 2.4. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) for
    energy optimization DEA, a non-parametric approach based on LP was applied to
    define the efficiency scores of DMUs to budget EI which could be saved at current
    productivity scale. DEA realm at investigating a set of peer entities (called
    as DMUs) and runs two sets of valuable evidence viz. A group which relates to
    DMUs’ efficiency score and another that narrates benchmarking information [63].
    The multiple inputs production model was used to measure the relative efficiency
    of a group of homogeneous DMUs [64]. In this model, the efficiency score of a
    DMU was determined based on its distance from the reference units [65]. A lower
    distance from the reference unit corresponds to a higher efficiency score for
    the DMU [63]. Frontier segment of the model represents the efficient target for
    the DMU under consideration [65]. DEA methodology is well-suited for agricultural
    systems as it permits simultaneous consideration of multiple inputs and outputs;
    making it a robust approach for establishing relationships that remains unclear
    with other methods [50,53,63]. Two default models viz. CCR (Charnes-Cooper-Rhodes)
    and BCC (Banker-Charnes-Cooper) were applied. CCR model being an empirical production
    technology frontier, could be estimated by applying LP [66], and optimization
    approach refers to an optimum scale with constant returns to scale (CRS). However,
    to consider variable returns to scale (VRS), the CCR was transformed to the BCC
    model [67]. Basically, DEA models (CCR/BCC) are either input oriented which operate
    to reduce the input level while at un-changed productivity level, or output oriented
    which has capability of increasing output level at same input level [8,29,68].
    Meanwhile, for agricultural production system, a farmer (or DMU) has no control
    on output, but certainly had control on level of agri-input to be applied, therefore,
    an input oriented model has been the most appropriate choice [53]. Therefore,
    we applied input oriented DEA models related to the smallest distance, thereby
    permitting incompetent units to search the easiest way to achieve the efficient
    frontier [29,53]. The DEA approach delivers a vigorous benchmarking tool to comprise
    a technical efficiency (TE), pure technical efficiency (PTE) and scale efficiency
    (SE) score for each DMU [66,67]. The TE score helps compare technically efficient
    DMUs with those of inefficient ones, and delivers insights on how much input reduction
    is required to enhance the performance of the DMUs. The TE is a relative degree
    of how efficiently DEA has utilized the various inputs to realize the only output,
    with the situation to its extreme potential on the production possibility frontier
    [8,69]. It represents the capability of a specific DMU to attain extreme output
    from a specified quantity of input(s) or, alternatively, to achieve the maximum
    accurate diminutions in the quantity of input(s) at current output levels. The
    TE score is calculated as the ratio of the sum of weighted output(s) to the weighted
    input(s) (Eqs. (13), (14)) [8]. (14) (15) Where,  = weight assigned to output
    ,  = amount of output ,  = weight assigned to input ,  = quantity of input ,  =
    number of outputs (  = 1,2, …., ), ‘s'' = number of inputs (  = 1, 2, …, ), and
    represents th DMUs (  = 1, 2, …, ). By applying LP, Eq. (14) could be explained
    as under. Subjected to To account for the possibility of disproportionate changes
    in output resulting from change in input(s), the PTE of DMUs was evaluated using
    BCC the model [67]. The BCC model is particularly useful for distinguishing between
    scale-efficient and scale-inefficient DMUs of the same size and is derived from
    the standard inequality form of dual LP (Eq. (15)). (16) Where,  = weight assigned
    to output ,  = amount of output ,  = weight assigned to input ,  = quantity of
    input ,  = number of outputs (  = 1,2, …., ), ‘s'' = number of inputs (  = 1,
    2, …, ), and represents th DMUs (  = 1, 2, …, ). Where, and are scalar and free
    in sign, and are weight matrixes for output Y and input X , respectively. The
    and  = inputs and output of its DMU, respectively. The BCC model is more stretchy
    and envelops data in much tighter and précised manner than the CCR model, therefore,
    score or PTE ( ) is equal to or greater than the CRS or overall TE score ( ).
    The relationship can be used to measure scale efficiency (SE) of the ‘ith ‘wheat
    DMU (Eq. (16)) [66]. (17) Where, SE measures the efficiency of a DMU in terms
    of its size and is determined by the proportionate increase in inputs/outputs
    [70]. A SE score of 1 indicates scale efficiency (or CRS), while a score <1 designates
    scale in-efficiency. Scale inefficiency may be due to either increasing returns-to-scale
    (IRS) or decreasing returns-to-scale (DRS) [70]. However, SE alone does not reveal
    whether a DMU has IRS or DRS. To address it, a non-increasing return of scale
    (NIRS) module was incorporated into the DEA model [8]. The efficiency scores attained
    from VRS and NIRS models were compared to determine whether the DMU has IRS or
    DRS. If the efficiency scores from both models are equal, it implies DRS, while
    unequal scores indicate IRS. The inefficiency level of studied DMUs was estimated
    by energy saving target ratio (ESTR) by using Eq. (17) [71]. (18) Where, energy
    saving target is the energy input which could be saved at current output level
    and ‘j′ indicates the ‘jth’ DMU. 2.5. Statistical analyses Data collected for
    various agri-inputs/outputs were processed into MS-Excel spread-sheets and analyzed
    to establish energy indices for studied DMUs. Efficiency Measurement System (EMS;
    v. 1.3) was applied to obtain the efficiency indices (TE/PTE) of DMUs using three
    default models (viz. CCR, BCC and NIRS). Efficient DMUs were ranked based on their
    significance for in-efficient DMUs that do not fall on the efficient frontier.
    ETop of Form. Energy input/output for efficient and inefficient DMUs were compared
    using student''s t-test (p < 0.05) using SPSS package for windows (SPSS Inc.,
    Chicago, U.S.A.). Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to establish
    relationships between socio-personal/demographic characteristics of respondents
    that significantly impact energy input based wheat productivity. Data were transformed
    to binary units for age, education level, land holding, family type, farming experience
    and extension contacts (Table 2). Similarly, soil type and water quality (were
    changed to binary units. The binary logistic regression was performed using same
    statistical package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, U.S.A.). The significance of relationships/coefficients
    were marked as ′*′ and ′**′at p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively. Table 2. Socio-personal

    profile The socio-personal and demographic characteristics of respondents viz.
    Age, education status, land-holding, family type, farming experience and extension
    linkage were studied. These results showed that majority (∼64%) of respondents
    were older (>45-years), while ∼36% were younger. Most respondents (∼71.1%) were
    literate and belonged to nuclear families (∼60.0%). About 78% of respondents had
    long farming experience, while weak extension contacts with agri-experts were
    reported by ∼76% of the respondents. About 78% of respondents had small land-holdings.
    Only 1/3rd of the respondents purchased agri-inputs on a cash basis, while a significant
    proportion (∼69%) used credit to buy farm inputs. The socio-personal characters
    influenced input use which eventually influence energy budget of various farm
    fields (i.e. DMUs). All these factors significantly influenced the energy budget
    of wheat production farms. 3.2. Energy budget of wheat established using super
    seeder technology A balance sheet of energy input through various agri-inputs
    applied to wheat established following in-situ rice residue incorporation in north-western
    India showed an EI of 22,589 MJ ha−1 (Table 1). The SE of 2105 ± 43 MJ ha−1 comprised
    ∼9.3% of EI. Due to highly mechanized production system, AME input of 329.0 ±
    23.0 MJ ha−1 (∼1.5% of EI) resulted in a small HE input (∼0.4% of EI). However,
    fertilizer related energy input was the largest (∼45.8% of EI) for wheat sown
    with super seeder technology. Amongst the chemical fertilizers, N has the largest
    share, which accounted for ∼97.5% of CFE. The BE comprised ∼1.0% of EI, with highest
    share of insecticides (∼0.6%), lowest of herbicides (∼0.1%), whilst the fungicides
    in-between (∼0.3%). The IWE of 3930 ± 241 MJ ha−1 incurred an additional EE of
    ∼3400 ± 99 MJ ha−1 required for extracting underground water. The IWE + EE together
    constitute ∼32.5% of EI. A relative contribution of different agri-inputs followed
    the order: chemical fertilizers > irrigation water > electricity > diesel fuel
    > seed > agri-machinery > biocides > human labor used for wheat production using
    super seeder technology (Table 1). 3.3. Crop yields and energy input-output relationships
    These results revealed that grain yield of wheat varied between 4.01 and 6.20
    Mg ha−1 (Table 3). The total above-ground biomass (grain + straw) yield of 8.70
    Mg ha−1 produced EO of 125.3 ± 1.8 GJ ha−1. Energy output as grains comprised
    ∼64.8% of EO, while straw has lowest share (∼35.2%). The EP value of 0.231 kg
    MJ−1 and ES of 4.40 MJ kg−1 resulted in a high ER value of 5.60, which indicates
    ∼5.6-times higher EO per unit of EI in wheat production using super seeder technology.
    A high NEG of 102.7 GJ ha−1 was achieved due to high grain yields and lower energy
    input. Meanwhile, these results revealed wide variation in DE and IDE, as well
    as RE and NRE sources. Whisker box plots showed 1st (25th percentile) and 3rd
    quartile (75th percentile) values of 10.8 and 13.4 GJ ha−1, respectively (Fig.
    2). Average DE expenditure in was higher by ∼1.5 ± 0.2 GJ ha−1 (∼13.8%) than the
    IDE. Similar to DE, IDE also showed large variation, with 25th and 75th percentile
    values of 9.6 and 11.2 GJ ha−1, respectively. The contribution of NRE sources
    was ∼3.0-times higher as compared to the RE sources. The classification of EI
    showed ∼53.2 and 46.8%, contribution of DE and IDE sources, respectively. Conversely,
    RE and NRE sources account for ∼24.8 and 75.2% of EI, respectively in wheat production
    under super seeded technology (Table 3). Table 3. Crop (grain + straw) yield,

    for elucidating energy efficient DMUs With considering large variation in energy
    use amongst the investigated wheat farms (or DMUs), it was important to optimize
    energy use for efficient use of agri-inputs. Therefore, to evaluate and compare
    a system with its key competitors that have the best performance within the same
    group or a similar group performing identical functions, we applied the DEA approach
    to benchmark studied DMUs. The DEA based benchmarking enables a highly robust
    appraisal of their relative performance based on ranking, and thereby help identifying
    the most efficient DMUs from the inefficient ones within a group. The relative
    performance of studied 45 DMUs and their benchmark ranking was based on the CCR
    model has been shown in Table 4. The column of benchmarks highlights that DMU-14
    was the most inefficient DMUs among the benchmark reference set. Therefore, the
    DMU with the highest repetition (e.g. 18 in the reference set for DMU-14) was
    allocated the highest ranking to elucidate the efficient DMUs within a group.
    Accordingly, inefficient DMUs can enhance their energy efficiency by the adoption
    of BMPs of the efficient DMUs. The inefficient DMUs therefore, could become an
    efficient one, if they start following a composite DMU, instead of operating as
    a single DMU. For instance, DMU-13 should follow the BMPs of DMU-14, DMU-32 and
    DMU-41 as a composite DMU to operate as an efficient one. It illustrates that
    DMU-13 is close to the efficient frontier segment formed by these three efficient
    units (DMU-14, 32 and 41). However, DMU-1 should follow the BMPs of DMU-14 to
    become an efficient one (Table 4). Table 4. Results of technical efficiency analysis

    3.5. Technical, pure technical and scale efficiency The elucidation of efficient
    and inefficient DMUs was based on TE, PTE and SE estimated by using CCR and BCC
    models. Based on the CCR model, the TE of 23 DMUs was observed equal to 1.00,
    indicating that ∼51.1% of studied DMUs were energy efficient, whilst the remaining
    22 DMUs (∼48.9%) were inefficient (Table 5). Therefore, to clarify benchmarking,
    if the TE score of a DMU, such as DMU-4, was less than 1.00, it was combined with
    other DMUs to form a composite DMU, representing the BMPs of DMU-14 and DMU-44.
    The intensity vector values indicated that the agri-inputs used and output achieved
    for DMU-13 were similar to those of DMU-14 compared to DMU-32 and DMU-41. However,
    the BCC model elucidated 34 DMUs (∼75.6%) as energy efficient with a PTE score
    of 1.00. Mean values of the three measures of efficiency viz. TE, PTE, and SE
    were 0.89, 0.99 and 0.90, respectively (Table 5). Table 5. Technical and scale

    SE of studied DMUs. These results revealed that for 19 DMUs (∼42.2% of total),
    TE was lower than 0.85, highlighting ∼15% energy saving possibilities. Similarly,
    ∼6.7% of studied DMUs could save ∼10–14% of EI by following BMPs. These results
    revealed relatively narrow range of PTE (0.90–1.00), compared with the range of
    TE (0.71–1.00) (Table 5). A wider range of TE revealed that the farmers were not
    fully aware of adequate amounts of agri-inputs to be applied in wheat production.
    Average TE score of 0.89 highlights that these DMUs could produce the same level
    of wheat productivity with 89% of current EI, and therefore, ∼11% of EI could
    be saved following BMPs (Table 5). However, SE ranged between 0.76 and 1.00 for
    the studied DMUs. A high value of SE (mean = 0.90) implies that the average farm
    size was optimal. Download : Download high-res image (253KB) Download : Download

    Energy use by efficient and inefficient DMUs and estimation of energy saving potential
    The energy saving potential of 2046.7 MJ ha−1 was estimated based on target energy
    use and amount of energy optimized (Table 6). The highest energy saving possibilities
    emerged from those agri-inputs which were the major contributors towards EI. The
    highest energy saving possibility of 860.4 MJ ha−1 occurred from efficient use
    of fertilizer-N application, followed by electricity (506.2 MJ ha−1) and irrigation
    water (321.8 MJ ha−1). Additionally, DEA based optimization has considerable energy
    saving potential (54.8 MJ ha−1 as biocides, 144.1 MJ ha−1 as seed and 115.9 MJ
    ha−1 as diesel fuel energy). Such high energy saving potential implies that currently
    the studied DMUs were over-exploiting agri-inputs in wheat production systems
    (Fig. 4, Fig. 5). Table 6. Estimated target energy use, energy saving possibility

    the energy saving possibilities from different agri-inputs were also estimated
    (Table 7). These results revealed a significant (p < 0.05) differences in energy
    input amongst the efficient and inefficient DMUs. The SE was significantly lower
    for efficient DMUs by ∼9.4%, compared with inefficient DMUs. Similarly, the HE
    was significantly lower by ∼11.7% for efficient DMUs. Conversely, the inefficient
    DMUs had ∼141.5 MJ ha−1 higher FE, compared with the efficient DMUs. But, there
    was a non-significant difference between CFE input among the efficient and inefficient
    DMUs. Amongst the biocides, insecticide related energy input was significantly
    higher by ∼60.8% for efficient DMUs. However, there was non-significant difference
    in fungicide related energy input among the efficient and inefficient DMUs. The
    herbicide related energy input for efficient DMUs was significantly lower by ∼11.4%.

    the efficient DMUs, which accounts for ∼22.5% lower than the inefficient DMUs.
    Although, super seeder technology of wheat establishment has small AME, yet AME
    of ∼38.1 MJ ha−1 was lower for efficient DMUs, comprising ∼10.9% lower energy
    than the inefficient DMUs ( Table 8). Table 7. Comparison of input and output

    4.1. Energy input in wheat established with super seeder Agriculture has been
    a prominent energy consuming sector and has undergone rapid intensification in
    recent decades [72]. Agricultural production requires a large amount of energy
    being applied in the form of agri-inputs, which accounts for ∼5% of the total
    energy consumption of the world [73]. Energy input in crop production primarily
    occurred from different agri-inputs including seed, fuel, fertilizers, biocides,
    electricity + irrigation and machinery associated during different crop production
    phases [33,34,74]. These results revealed that fertilizer-N was the major energy
    input, comprising ∼44.7% of EI, which corroborate earlier research on wheat establishment
    under CT method (∼40.8% of EI) [29] and RRM with happy seeder (∼45.5% of EI) [26].
    In other regions, e.g. in Iran and Bangladesh, fertilizer-N has also been the
    major energy source, contributing ∼38.3–39.9% towards EI [38,39]. Relatively,
    higher fertilizer-N related energy footprints were ascribed to Haber-Bosch process
    of urea manufacturing, which typically requires high temperatures and pressures
    and has high energy consumption. Next to fertilizer-N, IWE of 3930 ± 241 MJ ha−1
    (∼17.4% of EI) incurred an additional EE of 3400 ± 99 MJ ha−1 (∼15.1%). Similarly,
    an IWE of 6171 MJ ha−1 has been reported to incur additional EE of 39,567 MJ ha−1
    (∼49.4% of EI) in wheat cultivation under CT system in Esfahan province, Iran
    [33]. However, wheat established following RRM using happy seeder technology consumes
    IWE of ∼3088.9 MJ ha−1 (∼13.1% of EI) and ∼4202.7 MJ EE ha−1 (∼17.9% of EI), which
    is similar to the results of the present study [26]. The AME input of 329.0 MJ
    ha−1 for wheat established with super seeder technology was almost similar to
    happy seeder sown wheat (363.8 MJ ha−1) [26]. It could be ascribed to the fact
    that both technologies of RRM are based on the principle of less intensified tillage
    as compared to the CT wheat. The CT requires intense tillage with 6–8 operations
    followed by five planking operations [75]. About 50% of wheat producers in north-western
    India perform >5 tillage operations after partial rice residue burning of loose
    straw, and ∼25% of farmers go for complete residue burning before wheat sowing
    [76]. Conversely, wheat sowing under super/happy seeder technologies is performed
    in a single tractor operation without any preparatory tillage for seedbed preparation,
    while simultaneously managing the rice residues [21]. However, wheat established
    under CT requires much higher AME (533.9–1129.4 MJ ha−1) [1,77]. In north-western
    India, Singh et al. [14] reported that wheat established following in-situ rice
    residue incorporation with reversible MBP or RT require 468.5 and 434.9 MJ ha−1
    AME, which was higher by 42.4 and 32.2%, respectively than super seeder technology.
    Tillage and harvesting operation has high energy consumption of ∼45 and 28%, respectively
    in wheat production [78]. Apart from the use of agri-machinery, diesel fuel consumption
    was another major energy input associated with field preparation and other operations
    [79]. The FE of 2168 ± 54 MJ ha−1 in super seeder technology was much lower than
    the CT (9295.6 MJ ha−1; ∼76.7%; Nabavi-Pelesaraei et al. [77], MBP tillage (4030.9
    MJ ha−1; ∼46.2%) [14], and RT (3379.4 MJ ha−1; ∼35.8%; [14]. These results revealed
    that wheat establishment following in-situ RRM using super seeder technology was
    highly energy efficient, compared with other methods evaluated in previous studies
    [14,26,29,33,34,80]. The EI of 22,589 MJ ha−1 for wheat production with super
    seeder technology which was similar to EI (23,488 MJ ha−1) reported earlier for
    happy seeder technology [26]. A much higher EI of 35,737 MJ ha−1 (∼58.2% higher
    than these results) has been reported earlier for wheat farms in Turkey [80].
    Even higher EI of 80173.3 MJ ha−1 (∼3.5-times higher than these results) for wheat
    cultivation in Iran has been reported [33]. Relatively lower EI with super seeder
    technology was ascribed to exclusion of additional tillage operations required
    for in-situ RRM, which consumed a major part of energy as under CT, because intensive
    tillage operations accounted for higher AME + FE [81,82]. Taghavifar et al. [34]
    reported EI of 30626.4 MJ ha−1, which was higher by ∼8037 MJ ha−1 (∼26.4%) than
    these results. According to Singh et al. [14], although, EI for wheat establishment
    with happy seeder technology was energy efficient, yet EI for wheat established
    following in-situ rice residue incorporation using super seeder technology was
    lower by ∼1773 MJ ha−1 (∼7.3%). Singh et al. [14] compared various RRM technologies
    viz. Surface retention with happy seeder, residue removal with baler technology
    and wheat sowing with ZT, residue incorporation using MBP and/or RT, and reported
    that EI varies between 24,362 and 28,246 MJ ha−1. Their [14] study highlights
    significantly lower EI for surface retention of rice residue and wheat establishment
    with happy seeder, while the highest in farms with in-situ rice residue incorporation
    using reversible MBP. Such differences in EI were ascribed to reduced tillage
    intensity in super seeder technology, which help reduce diesel fuel consumption.
    4.2. Classification of total energy input and energy indices The EI in crop production
    is mainly classified as DE, IDE as well as RE and NRE [34,38]. We observed that
    DE and IDE contribute ∼53.2 and 46.8%, respectively towards EI. These results
    corroborate earlier research showing ∼52–54% share of DE towards EI in wheat production
    in West Azarbayjan and India [29,34]. Similar to these results, Singh et al. [14]
    and Soltani et al. [38] reported higher relative contribution of DE towards EI.
    Despite of high energy input, wheat establishment using super seeder technology
    was energy efficient with ER of 5.6 ± 0.1 with NEG of 102.7 ± 1.7 GJ ha−1. The
    NEG was much higher in the present study as compared with earlier research [38,39].
    The NEG of 20.6 and 78.8 GJ ha−1 has been reported earlier for wheat ecosystems
    in Bangladesh and Iran, respectively. Due to decreased NEG, the ER of 2.34 and
    6.50 has been reported, respectively in these countries [38,39]. A large variation
    in ER (1.75–7.50) and NEG (20.6–166.1 GJ ha−1) has been reported for different
    agro-climatic regions of the world [29,34,38,39,44]. These two energy indices
    are thought as important indicators of environmental sustainability of agricultural
    production systems [83]. It has been well established that maximizing NEG is always
    desirable, particularly when the ecosystem has to produce RE [84], or for the
    production system with restricted resources [84,85]. The ER is increased with
    enhancement of crop productivity and/or decrease in EI in crop productivity [36].
    These results corroborate earlier research with relatively higher crop yields
    achieved with lower EI which enhances EP and increases NEG in wheat cultivation
    [26,29,86]. Another energy sustainability index of crop production is the ES.
    The ES of 4.40 MJ kg−1 observed in the present study was relatively lower than
    6.0 MJ kg−1 in Bangladesh [39], 8.42 MJ kg−1 in Azerbaijan (West) [34], 5.0–7.7
    MJ kg−1 in India [29,44] and 5.24 MJ kg−1 in Turkey [40], therefore, indicating
    high energy efficiency of super seeder technology. 4.3. Comparison of efficient
    vis-à-vis inefficient units Further, to elucidate whether a DMU has IRS or DRS,
    the TE values obtained from both BCC and NIRS models were compared. If the TE
    values were approximately the same, then the DMU had DRS. However, if there was
    a significant difference between the values, then the DMU had IRS. Such comparison
    is considered crucial for identifying DMUs with different levels of efficiency,
    and allows for the redistribution of important resources to improve crop productivity.
    It is important to note that achieving significant changes in crop yield may require
    a technological change in agricultural practices. Therefore, recognizing DMUs
    with CRS, IRS and DRS can help in achieving higher crop productivity [26,29,[50],
    [51], [52],86]. These results showed potential energy saving of 2046.7 MJ ha−1
    (∼11.0% of EI) following DEA based benchmarking. In CT wheat, Singh et al. [29]
    reported an energy saving potential of ∼3819 MJ ha−1 (∼12% of EI) based on DEA
    analysis. Similarly, Khoshnevisan et al. [33] reported ∼2076 MJ ha−1 energy saving
    (∼18% of EI) in Esfahan province, Iran. The average TE of 0.89 observed in the
    present study was lower than reported earlier; 0.91 in India [29] and 0.94 in
    Iran [77], indicating higher energy saving potential in the present study. Similar
    to other studies [26,29,33,77], the PTE values was < unity (1), which implies
    that a particular DMUs were misusing EI than that is actually required [66,74].
    The difference in EI between the efficient and inefficient DMUs was higher than
    reported earlier for CT wheat cultivation in north-western India [29], indicating
    considerable potential for saving EI. 4.4. Energy efficiency vis-à-vis socio-personal
    and demographic characteristics The binary logistic model showed a significant
    (p < 0.01) ability to explain the variance in the data-set. Farming experience,
    extension contact, land holding, cash purchase of inputs, leased land, soil fertility
    and irrigation water quality has a significant (p < 0.05) influence on EI. It
    is known that strong extension linkage with agri-experts help enhance the TE score
    of crop production [87]. The length of farming experience help making précised
    appraisal and more accurate decisions in crop production, and helps to enhance
    productivity with efficient use of agri-inputs [88]. Strong extension linkage
    and long farming experience tend to accumulate technical know-how, hands on training,
    skill development which contribute towards enhanced farm efficiency [89]. The
    higher TE of farms is reported for fields with fertile soils [90]. Similarly,
    higher average TE (65–75%) of wheat farms for irrigation water use was related
    to their higher level education and larger farm size [91]. By applying an endogenous
    switching regression model, Paltasingh and Goyari [92] reported that a minimum
    threshold level of education has a significant impact on technology adoption in
    rice due to improved farming skills and productive capabilities of farmers [93].
    The variables of farmer''s age and family type were found to have negative ‘β’
    values, indicating a negative impact on ER in wheat production. These findings
    are consistent with previous research [94,95], who also reported negative ′β′
    values with these variables. Such relationships with negative ‘β’ coefficients
    affirm a common belief that older farmers being more traditional in their practices
    are less open to adopting innovative resource efficient technologies [90]. Similarly,
    ‘β’ coefficient for leased in land was negative but significant, implying decrease
    in ER by ∼2.0% with 1% increase in leased in land. It could be ascribed to the
    fact that farmers having leased land could not afford to take yield loss risk,
    therefore, such farmers had normal tendency of applying agri-inputs particularly
    the chemical fertilizers and biocides slightly on higher side to minimize yield
    loss risk. However, land holding, extension contact, soil fertility and water
    quality have positive ‘β’ values, indicating their positive impact on ER. 5. Conclusion
    Wheat has been the major energy intensive winter cereal crop of north-western
    India, cultivated in rotation with rice. Rice residue management becomes the most
    important sustainability issue, because open field residue burning leaves high
    C footprints due to large emissions of greenhouse gases. Super seeder technology
    has been recently introduced to perform wheat seeding with simultaneous rice residue
    incorporation into the soil. Therefore, we quantified the energy efficiency in
    wheat establishment using super seeder technology and perform DEA based optimization
    for elucidating energy efficient from inefficient DMUs. Super seeder technology
    was energy efficient with NEG of 102.7 GJ ha−1. A high ER indicates ∼5.6-times
    higher production of EO per unit EI. Fertilizer-N was the major hot-spot of energy
    input, comprising ∼44.7% of EI. Besides, IWE + EE together comprised ∼32.5% of
    EI in wheat production. DEA based benchmarking elucidated nearly half (∼51.1%)
    of studies DMUs as energy efficient with TE score of 1.00. Average TE score =
    0.89 underpin the overwhelming significance of DEA based benchmarking for saving
    of ∼11% of EI following agricultural BMPs. The logistic regression revealed that
    farming experience, extension linkage, land holding, cash purchase of inputs,
    leased in land, soil fertility and irrigation water quality had significant (p
    < 0.05) impact on energy efficiency in wheat cultivation. These results revealed
    that DEA based benchmarking would help enhance energy efficiency of DMUs under
    super seeder technology of wheat establishment, while offering possibilities of
    enhancing ecosystems’ sustainability. CRediT authorship contribution statement

    agrivoltaic 1. Introduction The construction sector is undergoing a shift towards
    sustainability, with the integration of solar panels leading the way in this transformation.
    Solar energy has emerged as a pivotal force, reshaping the landscape of buildings
    and charting a path toward a more eco-friendly and energy-efficient future. The
    present review-type paper examines the significant influence of solar panels on
    the construction industry [1], focusing on their advantages, challenges, and potential
    to shape a more sustainable built environment. The integration of solar panels
    into the construction industry has gained significant traction owing to their
    capacity to transform solar energy into clean electricity. As concerns about climate
    change and environmental degradation intensify, architects, developers, and policymakers
    are increasingly turning to solar energy as a reliable and renewable power source
    that significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions [2]. One of the primary benefits
    of solar panels in the construction industry is their ability to generate electricity
    onsite. By capturing sunlight and converting it into usable energy, solar panels
    enable buildings to satisfy a portion or all of their electricity requirements.
    This reduces the reliance of the building on traditional grid electricity, lowers
    utility costs, and increases energy independence. In addition, solar panels allow
    buildings to contribute back to the grid through a process known as “net metering”.
    Solar-panel-generated excess energy can be returned to the grid, allowing buildings
    to earn credit or compensate for the energy surplus they supply [3]. Building-integrated
    photovoltaics (BIPVs) and building-applied photovoltaics (BAPVs) have emerged
    as revolutionary developments in pursuing sustainable energy solutions. These
    ideas surpass the limitations of conventional solar panel applications, integrating
    solar technology seamlessly into architectural designs and structures. BIPVs involve
    the intrinsic integration of solar panels into building elements; whereas, BAPVs
    focus on retrofitting solar panels onto existing structures; they offer distinct
    avenues for harnessing solar energy in the built environment [4]. This increases
    the self-sufficiency of buildings and promotes a more resilient and decentralized
    energy system. In addition to economic welfare, the incorporation of solar panels
    into the construction industry has significant environmental benefits. By utilizing
    solar energy, structures can significantly reduce their carbon footprints, mitigate
    air pollution, and conserve finite fossil fuel resources. This transition to cleaner
    energy sources is consistent with global efforts to combat climate change and
    the transition to a future with reduced carbon emissions [5]. The widespread adoption
    of solar panels in the construction industry depends on overcoming certain obstacles.
    Cost-up-front and installation complexities are two of the most common obstacles
    that prevent building owners from adopting solar energy. However, as technology
    advances and economies of scale improve, the long-term cost-effectiveness of solar
    panel installations has increased, making them an increasingly attractive investment
    [6]. Hosseinnia et al. [7] proposed a two-step method for an optimal solar-assisted
    ground source heat pump (SAGSHP) for integrating buildings. The first is a dynamic
    pinch analysis that targets energy and determines equipment sizes based on the
    dynamic demands of buildings, resulting in multiple energy-efficient daily design
    candidates. Second, a concluding design for the entire year is proposed by computing
    the total annual cost (TAC). The investigation of various daily optimum designs
    (DODs) for a Canadian multifamily test building demonstrates significant energy
    and cost savings, with 55.9% and 79.2% reductions in annual electricity consumption
    for the September and March DODs, respectively, compared with conventional cases.
    Figure 1 depicts the general process for generating solar power from residential
    buildings. Figure 1. General procedure for residential solar power generation.
    Dezhdar et al. [8] examined the energy of solar and wind methods of renewable
    sources for heating, electricity generation, cooling, and heating. It considers
    multiple components, including wind turbines, heat pumps, reverse osmosis, fuel
    cells, photovoltaic/thermal panels, hydrogen tanks, and battery storage. A performance
    analysis of six Iranian cities determined the best location for the system based
    on factors such as fuel cell power, heating capacity, solar panel angle count,
    cooling, and wind turbine count. The suggested system reduced supply and demand
    variations, offering USD 674,278.4 per hour as the cost life cycle and generating
    power for a thermal comfort of 225,694.8 kWh for residential units. Alshibil et
    al. [9] suggested a hybrid solar collector design, combi-photovoltaic/thermal
    (PV/T), which combines water and air as working fluids to address the waste heat
    from classical PV modules. The comparison parameters included the sustainability
    index, exergy efficiency, solar cell surface temperature, and waste heat. The
    results showed that the combi-PV/T module reduced waste heat by 77.5%, lowered
    the surface temperature of the solar cells by 30.6%, and exhibited a higher exergy
    efficiency and sustainability index than the classical PV module. Yang et al.
    [10] analyzed solar energy resources in China. The authors discussed three types
    of utilization methods: photovoltaic (PV), photothermal, and gathering light,
    which are recommended for solar-powered residential buildings (SPRBs). Active
    SPRBs have been highlighted owing to their flexibility and intelligence. This
    paper proposes a building-integrated solar energy (BISE) design to achieve harmony
    between appealing and technology-promoting energy conservation and sustainable
    development in residential buildings. Kim et al. [11] proposed and evaluated a
    two-stage approach to identifying suitable sites for PV panels on the South Korean
    national highway network. The authors aimed to enhance computational efficiency
    while maintaining estimation accuracy by using both low- and high-resolution maps
    with different raster cell sizes. The selected candidate sites from both cases
    resulted in significant solar energy potential, demonstrating the practicality
    of the proposed approach in identifying the optimal locations for PV systems on
    a broader scale. Venugopal et al. [12] explained “Future Sustainable Roads for
    Electric Mobility”, focusing on a multi-disciplinary approach to address energy
    transfer and conversion techniques. The impact is demonstrated through lab-scale
    experiments theoretical examination, and simulations. Models of the loss and thermal
    properties of the self-healing asphalt were developed and contactless charging
    and solar integration were studied. The present review includes a financial feasibility
    case study for a forthcoming Dutch highway with proposed developing modules. Vivar
    et al. [13] investigated a SolWat hybrid system, which was evaluated using real
    wastewater from secondary treatment, incorporating solar water disinfection and
    PV energy generation. Over a year, four seasonal experiments demonstrated that
    after 4 h of treatment, complete bacterial inactivation was not achieved for E.
    coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Clostridium perfringens. However, the attained
    inactivation levels permit water reuse for numerous applications. Bouhadjar et
    al. [14] demonstrated the viability of a low-cost water treatment approach to
    address the high fluoride concentrations in the groundwater in rural Tanzania.
    A small PV-powered nanofiltration (NF) plant equipped with a spiral-wound NF90
    membrane resulted in more than 98% fluoride removal. The treated water consistently
    met the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended standard fluoride concentration
    of less than 1 mg/L, proving its suitability for local communities. The solar
    PV system operates autonomously, producing approximately 240 L/h of permeate,
    with a recovery rate of approximately 12%. Mohammed et al. [15] suggested that
    a power supply design for single-phase induction motors (SPIMs) powered by PV
    cells was successfully simulated using MATLAB SIMULINK. The power supply design
    utilizes a cascade boost (CB) DC/DC converter with a fuzzy logic controller (FLC)
    to achieve maximum power-point tracking (MPPT). A five-level inverter was integrated
    to deliver a stable AC voltage to drive the 1 hp SPIMs. The simulation outcomes
    demonstrate the efficiency of the system and its potential to power SPIMs for
    irrigation purposes, focusing on temperature and humidity. The present paper comprehensively
    reviews the revolutionary impact of solar panels on the construction industry.
    Through an analysis of recently published scientific articles, this study highlights
    the importance of solar energy in combating climate change and highlights technological
    advances that improve efficiency and cost-effectiveness. This review article examines
    how solar panels are being creatively integrated into energy to improve architecture
    and urban planning. It investigates their innovative use in managing water systems,
    such as treatment plants and desalination, even supplying energy to transportation
    infrastructure. In addition, the review describes how solar panels are reshaping
    the aesthetics of buildings and cities by becoming integrated into building materials,
    thereby adding a sustainable touch to contemporary designs. Unlike previous review
    articles, this one examines solar panels’ many uses beyond energy generation.
    Earlier reviews briefly discussed the use of solar panels in building designs;
    but, this work shows how they can become construction materials, improve city
    development, and go green. Unlike previous studies, this review examines how solar
    technology can be used in water system management, road construction, and transportation
    systems. This study investigates the potential for solar panels to enhance various
    aspects of life, shedding light on their capacity to improve sustainability by
    addressing frequently overlooked factors. 2. Types of PV Technologies Exploring
    the landscape of PV innovation, various developed PV technologies should be examined.
    They mostly involve efficiency-focused mono-Si, cost-effective poly-Si, mono-PERC,
    and ingenious half-cut solar cells designed to improve performance. 2.1. Monocrystalline
    Silicon (Mono-Si) Solar Cells Mono-Si is a pioneering technology in PVs, utilizing
    single-crystal ingots to achieve exceptional energy conversion efficiency. Sun
    et al. [16] used statistical distribution law to study monocrystalline silicon
    solar cell conversion efficiency and proposed a forensic algorithm to distinguish
    natural and computer-generated images. Electrochemical etching for porous silicon
    preparation is also introduced. The authors of the study verified statistical
    methods and provided references for related research using processing approaches,
    mathematical methods, statistical methods, and experimental techniques [16]. Boulmrharj
    et al. [17] examined Morocco’s transition to renewable energy sources (RES), particularly
    solar energy, to reduce fossil fuel and electricity imports. Three silicon-based
    grid-connected PV systems in El Jadida, Morocco, were compared in Mediterranean
    climates. The final yield, performance ratio, and capacity factor favored polycrystalline
    silicon and monocrystalline silicon systems over micromorph tandem systems [17].
    2.2. Polycrystalline Silicon (Poly-Si) Solar Cells Poly-Si utilizes multiple silicon
    crystals to provide a viable alternative for solar energy generation, embracing
    cost-effectiveness without sacrificing its potential. Tariq et al. [18] examined
    the mechanical behavior of polycrystalline silicon solar cells (PSSCs) in PV modules.
    Using the finite element (FE) method, they used a Voronoi-tessellation scheme
    and a mean-field homogenized scheme to predict the homogenized response. This
    study compared heterogeneous and homogeneous modeling and investigated the deterioration
    of stiffness caused by existing microcracks. The homogenized FE solution represents
    a progressive failure in solar cells in an accurate and computationally efficient
    manner [18]. According to Kazem et al. [19], dust accumulation in PV modules can
    result in significant yield loss. The researchers collected and analyzed dust
    from five locations in North Al Batinah, Oman. A total of 5 g/m2 of contamination
    on monocrystalline modules decreased the power by 12%, 6%, 6%, 7%, 3%, 4%, and
    4%, respectively. The degradation of the polycrystalline modules was 5%, 4%, 4%,
    1%, 2%, and 2%. The study suggests periodic cleaning intervals ranging from 10
    to 15 days for polycrystalline and monocrystalline modules, respectively [19].
    2.3. Monocrystalline Passivated Emitter and Rear Cell (Mono-PERC) Mono-PERC improves
    light capture through its reflective rear surface, resulting in a new phase of
    increased efficiency through cutting-edge design. Es et al. [20] predicted that
    the passive emitter and rear cell (PERC) concept would dominate the future of
    the PVs industry. Pilot lines, such as the GUNAM PV line, connect laboratory-proven
    concepts with mass-produced goods. The authors focus on standard PERC solar cells
    with a p-type base and Al2O3 rear passivation to demonstrate how loss analysis
    can be applied in an industrially relevant environment [20]. Lunardi et al. [21]
    performed an environmental analysis comparing monocrystalline Al-BSF and PERC
    solar modules. Using life cycle assessment (LCA) methods, they calculated global
    warming, human toxicity, freshwater eutrophication, ecotoxicity, abiotic depletion
    potential, and energy payback time. Compared to Al-BSF, PERC technology slightly
    improves environmental impacts while electronic and upgraded metallurgical grade
    silicon results in lower impacts [21]. 2.4. Half-Cut Solar Cells The efficiency
    dynamics of solar cells are redefined by half-cut solar cells, which revolutionize
    the conventional approach by significantly reducing shading losses. Researchers
    have identified a potential pathway for enhancing output efficiency and minimizing
    energy loss by dividing cells by half and optimizing their connections. Shukir
    et al. [22] investigated the influence of solar radiation, including infrared,
    visible, and ultraviolet rays, on the performance and effectiveness of solar panels.
    Infrared rays overheat panels; whereas, ultraviolet rays destroy the cells. During
    summer, high temperatures can decrease power and voltage. Shade can also threaten
    the durability and safety of solar panels. This article proposes using solar panels
    with half-cut cells to reduce losses caused by high temperatures and the effect
    of shade on panel safety and productivity [22]. Vedat Kiray et al. [23] discussed
    barriers to self-generating energy in residential houses, including location,
    slope, strength, and exposure to shade on roofs. Solar tracking systems improve
    efficiency but are not aesthetically pleasing. The article suggested a dual-axis
    sun tracking system and an aesthetically pleasing gazebo to solve these issues.
    A design study examined the dimensions of a movable platform/roof and calculated
    the annual energy collected by PV panels using a simulation program known as the
    “PV performance tool” [23]. Table 1 displays a comparative analysis of different
    studies categorized according to their settings: Computational Research, Field
    Research, and Experimental Research. These study settings serve to emphasize the
    focus of each study. Table 1. Comparative analysis of PV technologies in different
    study settings. 3. Degradation of PV Modules In the field of solar technology,
    understanding the degradation of PV modules is crucial. Various factors affect
    the efficiency and performance of solar panels over time, necessitating a comprehensive
    examination of degradation processes to ensure prolonged and optimal energy production.
    Khan et al. [24] investigated the stability of PV modules in non-ideal environments.
    Temperature and humidity were found to degrade optoelectric and material properties.
    This study examined the performance of c-Si PV modules installed on a concrete
    slab for 4000 h in a humid-heat stress-testing chamber. Their results indicated
    that the performance retention of the PV modules mounted on a concrete slab was
    93.2%, which was 5% greater than that of the modules without a concrete mount
    [24]. Khan et al. [25] studied 3200 h of the effect of damp-heat stress on PV
    degradation in low-humidity regions. They discovered that PV modules installed
    on concrete had a 1.9% efficiency loss, 5.6% less than that of the PV module used
    as a benchmark. However, the series resistance increased by 60% and 43%, indicating
    that PV modules can perform better in regions with low humidity after concrete
    slab installation [25]. 4. Solar Panels in Building Construction Solar panels
    used in building construction are revolutionizing the use of renewable energy
    in power structures. By integrating solar technology into the design of structures,
    clean electricity can be generated and the carbon footprint can be reduced. This
    transformative strategy represents a major step towards a greener and more environmentally
    responsible future for the construction industry. 4.1. Integration of Solar Panels
    in Building Designs Integrating solar panels into building designs is on the rise,
    fostering sustainability within the construction industry. Vassilades et al. [26]
    studied solar energy in integrated buildings by monitoring building-integrated
    photovoltaics (BIPVs) in terms of single and double solutions of façades. A cavity
    is formed in the double solution that can be used as a duct of air for building-integrated
    photovoltaics/thermal (BIPV/Ts) and building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs),
    which results in improving the capacities in the design and enhancing the architecture
    by the building-integrated solar system (BLISS). Based on climatic conditions,
    the significance of water and air energy and the cost convenience of the BISS
    can be evaluated and adopted during the design stage. Behzadi et al. [27] developed
    and suggested a model of a solar energy generation-pumped system equipped with
    panels made of thermal PVs by rejecting the presence of heat pumps and batteries
    to decrease the amount and make people adopt less expensive energy systems in
    buildings. The developed model was observed under different heating systems, including
    ultra-low, low, and current temperatures, and was analyzed using TRNSYS software.
    The result shows that the productivity during reduced temperature is more efficient,
    in terms of a huge amount of heat (9118.5 kWh) and electricity (3647.4 kWh), than
    the other two and the value ranges from 52.3%, to 62.35%, to 74.51% for the existing,
    low, and ultra-low temperatures. Hosseinnia et al. [28] recommended a dynamic
    approach of targeting the buildings to evaluate the major reuse of heat produced
    indirectly and directly in a building. The authors presented a group of heat exchangers
    based on solar PV panels, ground heat exchange, heat pumps (HPs), and energy storage
    (both electric and thermal energies) and they analyzed them based on the concept
    of pinch, using the cold and hot composite curve (CC) for 12 days. It has been
    recommended that this dynamic method leads to increased storage of electric energy,
    thermal energy storage (TES) volume, and solar PV panels. Allouhi et al. [29]
    determined that the tri-objective optimization process successfully determined
    the best design for a residential building in Fez, Morocco. The chosen configuration
    includes capacity, thermal storage, and thermal collectors of approximately 25
    kW PV, 18 m2, and 1.8 m3. The resulting objective function values were LCOE =
    CAD 17.8 per kWh, LOCH = CAD 3.5 per kWh, and REP = 45%. The self-consumption,
    solar thermal fraction, and self-sufficiency ratios were 69.7%, 90.1%, and 30.6%,
    respectively. The findings indicate the cost-effectiveness and potential of renewable
    solar energy systems applicable to other building types and locations, which promotes
    broader acceptance of solar energy solutions. 4.2. Structural Considerations for
    Solar Panel Installations Integrating solar panel installations into buildings
    safely and effectively requires structural consideration. Engineers carefully
    evaluate load-bearing capacities and architectural compatibility to optimize solar
    panel placement and maximize energy capture. Eltayeb et al. [30] offered a study
    on designing a 3 kW hybrid tree with wind and solar capacities of 1 kW and 2 kW,
    respectively, intended for installation in Vaddeswaram, Andhra Pradesh. The optimal
    energy generation was achieved using a two-axis tracking system. The authors explored
    diverse global energy tree designs and applications, by examining the PV and current-voltage
    characteristics of solar panels and wind turbine power characteristics. Structural
    optimizations ensured that the tree could withstand applied loads, resulting in
    a significant increase in power generation compared to fixed solar panels. Choi
    et al. [31] recommended a safety assessment for floating PV systems considering
    different wave angles and wind, analyzing the stress distribution through experiments
    and numerical simulations (FEA, CFD, and hydraulic dynamics). Wave and wind loads
    were used by hydraulic dynamics and CFD, validated through the experiments. FEA
    analyses the stress distribution at various angles, with junctions between floating
    bodies and solar panels experiencing the highest stress (150–298 MPa). Maintaining
    the stress below the material yield strength ensures safety during the wind and
    wave conditions. Designers should follow this procedure prior to field installation.
    Khan et al. [32] simulated computational fluid variant (CFX) testing for solar
    panels and rooftop structural analysis under various wind velocities (±7.53 to
    ±45 m/s). Factors of safety (FoSs) and displacement for all elements were computed.
    The truss showed vulnerability, with a FoS of 0.41 and a 51.6 mm displacement
    at 7.53 m/s. Failure of the structure’s mounting occurred at 15 m/s, with a FoS
    of 0.72 and a 58.26 mm displacement. Structures of column and channel resisted
    up to ±25 m/s without exceeding limits, exhibiting FoSs of 15 and 14.27 at +25
    m/s, respectively, and deformations of 0.43 mm and 4.59 mm. Meiramov et al. [33]
    conducted full-scale testing and numerical simulations by analyzing the load-carrying
    capacity of the solar panel structure, concentrating on a system of poles mounted
    on a column-to-base connection. This study determined the progress of a non-welding
    connection feature for better durability. The results showed that proper structural
    assessment of the connection is crucial for designing reliable structures of paneled
    solar poles mounted to connect column-base connections. 4.3. Energy Performance
    and Efficiency in Solar-Powered Buildings The solar energy performance and efficiency
    of solar-power buildings exemplify the significant advantages of solar panel integration.
    Deymi et al. [34] explored a case study in St. Petersburg, Russia, on an integrative
    system based on the solar wind in a near-zero-energy building. The system aims
    to satisfy hourly electricity loads, heating, and cooling using an absorption
    chilled turbine of wind, a solar loop of a parabolic trough, and storage of compressed
    air energy. The feasibility assessment indicated that the solar system can cover
    61% of the yearly heating loads; the required electricity load is supported by
    almost 99% of the energy storage system. The system contributes to a reduction
    of 13,859 kg/year in CO2 emissions and achieves extreme efficiency and monthly
    energy consumption in December. Economic analysis shows positive net present values
    after 17, 14, and 12 years, with 5%, 3%, and 1% interest rates, respectively.
    Sulaiman et al. [35] examined the possibility of using low-GWP refrigerants as
    replacements for conventional refrigerants. The model evaluates performance based
    on exegetic and energetic vapor compression cycles with different refrigerants.
    The prototype unit, powered by PV panels and battery storage, supplies cold air
    to a connected canopy. R290 and R600a demonstrated potential as suitable replacements,
    showing improved COP and energy efficiency compared to R134a. Temiz et al. [36]
    developed a comprehensive solar energy system with a ground-sourced heat pump
    for stand-alone residential usage, providing power, heating, cooling, and domestic
    hot water. The system included different building-integrated PV plant orientations,
    an anion-exchange membrane electrolyzer, a vertical-oriented ground-sourced heat
    pump for hydrogen-based energy storage, and proton exchange membrane fuel cells.
    The study assessed the system in five global cities, determining the required
    PV capacity for a 20-floor building in Ottawa, Canada, achieving energy efficiencies
    and overall energies of 10.49% and 18.76%, respectively. Woo et al. [37] determined
    the system of solar power in advanced residential areas based on the usage of
    flexible power (ESS Provision) and aesthetics (panel transparency installation
    type and installation cost). It investigates suitable installation types for multi-unit
    residential buildings and analyzes consumer preferences and economic value through
    a choice experiment with Korean consumers. The results emphasize the economic
    value of transparent solar panel technology and installation type and impact consumer
    acceptance alongside generation efficiency. Baniasadi et al. [38] examined a novel
    solar-geothermal system that provides hot water, electricity, cooling, heat, and
    desalinated water for a zero-energy residential building. It evaluates the exergy,
    energy, and exergy-economic aspects to assess an organization’s feasibility in
    meeting energy and water demands. The system integrates solar and geothermal energies,
    incorporating a PV system, proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer, desalination
    system, and the fuel cell of a PEM with a pressure exchanger, with cooling and
    heating mode efficiencies of 13.27% and 17.25% for energy, and 32.44% and 42.4%
    for exergy, respectively. Acar et al. [39] evaluated the design of an ideal sizing
    for an energy system for hybrid solar hydrogen located in Afyon, Turkey, ensuring
    an uninterrupted and reliable power supply for a zero-energy house. Finding an
    adequate number of PV panels, fuel cell stacks, storage volume, and an appropriate
    electrolyzer model and size was crucial for meeting the house’s energy demands.
    The optimal nominally powered electrolyzer significantly affected the efficiency
    of the system. Abu-Hamdeh et al. [40] associated the energy competence of paraffin
    wax/graphene and paraffin wax/graphene oxide nanofluids in flat-plate solar collectors
    for building heating systems. The results revealed that both graphene-based nanofluids
    exhibited enhanced thermal conductivities compared to paraffin. The solar collector
    efficiency was also improved using graphene-based nanofluids. In addition to the
    structural constraints, the operational constraints of the fluid solar collector
    operation were significant [41]. 5. Innovative Applications of Solar Panels in
    Infrastructure Development Solar panels are essential to infrastructure development,
    which results in a sustainable energy environment. The integration of solar technology
    into PV parking lot canopies and PV noise barriers enhances energy efficiency
    by employing innovative techniques. Photovoltaic Canopies and Noise Barriers Two
    innovative applications of PV technology are examined here. It is, namely, PV
    parking lot canopies and PV noise barriers. These inventive solutions not only
    utilize solar energy but they also serve practical purposes in urban environments.
    Teng Zhong et al. (2021) proposed a computational framework for estimating the
    solar PV potential of urban PV noise barrier (PVNB) systems. The framework employed
    a method of deep learning to identify sites suitable for panel installation. The
    results indicated that PVNB systems in Nanjing have potential installation capacities
    of 14.26 MW and 57.24 MW, generating 4662 MWh and 18,010 MWh annually, respectively
    [42]. Lee et al. [43] conducted research on noise barriers for Singapore’s rapid
    transit railways. They compared the performance of Taipei’s subway track noise
    barriers and vertical noise barriers used by the Singapore Mass Rapid Transit
    (MRT) system using on-site measurements of housing estates. The results demonstrated
    that simulated noise mitigation barriers reduced noise levels reaching residential
    apartments by 5 to 12 decibels, highlighting the need for additional research
    on noise barriers for elevated railway tracks or viaducts [43]. Vallati et al.
    [44] explored the use of PVNBs as a solution to limited space requirements in
    large-scale solar panel implementation. Despite not being a novel concept, the
    study focused on optimizing the acoustic and energy properties of these barriers
    [44]. Soares et al. [45] conducted a multi-criteria evaluation of PV noise barriers
    (PVNBs) in order to assess their energy, economic, and environmental impacts.
    They compared various design configurations and simulated energy outputs at various
    U.S. locations and found that PVNBs with shingles performed the best [45]. Iringová
    et al. [46] designed a PV system for a parking garage in Ilina, optimizing its
    orientation and layout for maximum efficiency. The system was located on a flat
    roof, above the electric vehicle charging stations. The optimal PV technology
    was evaluated for its economic viability, revealing that the system can generate
    enough electricity for six charging stations and cover the building’s energy needs.
    Figure 2 showcases the integration of solar panels within a noise barrier along
    a road. Figure 2. Integration of solar panels in a roadside noise barrier. Deshmukh
    et al. [47] investigated the viability of solar PV canopies for incorporating
    electric vehicle (EV) charging stations into retail parking infrastructure. According
    to the study, Walmart supercenters could potentially deploy 11.1 GW of solar canopies,
    which would provide over 346,000 EV charging stations. This model could be adopted
    by any store, resolving issues with community pricing and increasing store selection
    and revenue. There is a need for more precise quantification in the future. Abdolahzadeh
    et al. [48] studied dust deposition on PV surfaces and discovered that small variations
    in tilt angle do not significantly affect dust deposition behavior. However, dust
    particle size has a substantial effect on deposition. Duo-pitch electric vehicle
    parking lots (EVsPLs) offer better performance against dust deposition while mono-pitch
    EVsPLs are more effective for smaller particles. The study provides a fresh perspective
    on selecting the optimal parking lot structure based on environmental conditions,
    particularly in regions with high dust concentrations. Rudge [49] focused on the
    possibility of solar canopies in Connecticut, a state with a zero-carbon electric
    sector goal. The study employed geospatial methods to evaluate the viability of
    large parking lots in the state, revealing 8416 sites with the capacity to generate
    9042 GWh of electricity. This accounts for 37.0% of Connecticut’s current electricity
    consumption. The study highlights the potential for solar canopies to contribute
    to Connecticut’s energy portfolio and recommends policies to encourage their adoption.
    The methodology can be replicated at multiple geographical scales. 6. Solar Panels
    in Water Management Systems Solar panels are instrumental in revolutionizing water
    management systems that use renewable energy sources. Their integration in water
    treatment plants, water pumping and irrigation systems, and energy-efficient solar
    desalination technologies promotes sustainable water practices and addresses water
    scarcity challenges. As solar-powered solutions evolve, they offer a promising
    path toward efficient and environmentally conscious water resource management.
    6.1. Solar-Powered Water Treatment Plants Solar-powered water treatment plants
    are emerging as a viable means of meeting the growing demand for clean water.
    These plants reduce their reliance on conventional power sources by utilizing
    solar energy, resulting in more eco-friendly water-purification practices. Ruiz-Aguirre
    et al. [50] discussed the combination of pilot-scale H2 production and water decontamination
    or disinfection. The combination of solar-to-hydrogen (STH) and TiO2-CuO for conversion
    was investigated and the highest STH conversion reached 0.9%. Moreover, 25 mg
    L−1 of imidacloprid was completely degraded (>99%). The synergetic consequence
    of the anoxic conditions, TiO2:CuO and solar radiation, caused a significant reduction
    (>5 Log) in the concentration of E. coli in less than 10 min, highlighting the
    potential of this approach for safe wastewater reuse. Hu et al. [51] investigated
    H2 generation with decontamination or disinfection of water using a TiO2–CuO mixture
    for solar-to-hydrogen adaptation. Experiments were conducted in a 25-L solar pilot
    plant to optimize the catalyst dose, semiconductor proportion, and sacrificial
    agent concentration. The best conditions achieved 0.9% STH conversion and 25 mg
    L−1 imidacloprid degradation. The anoxic conditions, TiO2:CuO and solar radiation,
    significantly reduced the E. coli concentration. This study demonstrates the potential
    of safe wastewater reuse for hydrogen production. Further research on Cu toxicity
    and inactivation kinetics is needed. Shumiye et al. [52] discussed integrating
    solar and geothermal energy for power generation and water purification via boiling
    and reverse osmosis. The objective was to enhance energy efficiency and cost-effectiveness.
    The designed hybrid power plant in Ziway, Ethiopia, demonstrates promising potential,
    producing 44 MW of power and treating 100 m3/day of water. The system effectively
    addresses green energy and clean water shortages by combining selective components
    and advanced technologies. Salmerón et al. [53] implemented a pilot-scale hybrid
    eco-engineered water treatment system, utilizing efficient electrocatalysis to
    produce H2O2 at an air-diffusion cathode, generating OH through Fenton’s reaction
    with an added Fe2+ catalyst. The system effectively degraded the model pesticides
    using a boron-doped diamond anode and photocatalysis. The optimization of key
    parameters resulted in a H2O2 mass production rate of 64.9 mg min−1, 89.3% current
    efficiency, and 0.4 kWh m−3 of energy intake; meanwhile, the SPEF process removed
    over 50% of pesticides in just 5 min, showing promising potential for wastewater
    treatment applications. Alrawashdeh et al. [54] suggested a mathematical model
    for producing desalinated water using the multistage flashing-brine recirculation
    (MSF-BR) technique driven by solar energy. A solar power plant with a 30 MW capacity
    generated 6.5 kg/s of superheated steam, where 15 MW is allocated to influence
    the plant of MSF-BR desalination. The remainder was supplied to the grid. The
    MSF-BR desalination plant consisted of 24 evaporation stages, with a top brine
    temperature of 110 °C and a blowdown brine salinity concentration of approximately
    69,439 ppm. Berruti et al. [55] determined the effectiveness of a solar water
    photochemical process by harnessing the combined power of peroxymonosulfate (PMS)
    and natural solar radiation for treating urban wastewater. The PMS/solar process
    performance was evaluated by monitoring the inactivation of naturally occurring
    bacteria and degradation of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs). These findings
    suggest that solar treatment could be a promising, sustainable, and cost-effective
    solution for reclaiming and reusing urban wastewater, particularly in regions
    with ample solar radiation. Figure 3 displays the utilization of solar panels
    to purify water. Figure 3. Solar panel utilization for water purification. Andronic
    et al. [56] investigated wastewater treatment for potential reuse utilizing innovative
    materials with photocatalytic and adsorption properties. TiO2, Cu2S, and fly ash
    were combined to create substrates for removing pollutants from wastewater. Characterization
    techniques, including X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy, offer
    valuable insight into the properties of these substrates. The photocatalytic activity
    was assessed with model pollutants, such as phenol, imidacloprid, and dichloroacetic
    acid, under different solar irradiation conditions, achieving impressive removal
    and mineralization efficiencies of 90%, 56%, and 66%, respectively, after specific
    time intervals. Xiong et al. [57] studied a 3D solar evaporator called PPy-PFBs,
    utilizing industrial polyester fiber bundles (PFBs) coated with polypyrrole (PPy).
    The solar evaporator emulates plant transpiration, drawing water via capillary
    action and keeping it at seven times its mass, making it salt resistant. With
    an exposure height of 6 cm, the matrix-arranged PPy-PFBs achieved an impressive
    3.77 kg m−2 h−1 water evaporation rate, with a remarkable energy conversion efficiency
    of 155.77%. 6.2. Solar Panels for Water Pumping and Irrigation Systems Integrating
    solar panels into water and irrigation pumping systems makes water resource management
    more sustainable and efficient. Vishnupriyan et al. [58] experimented with an
    optimal tilt angle and orientation to maximize solar energy utilization in water-pumping
    applications in remote areas. This study considered four different tilt angles
    (8°, 15°, 30°, and 45°) using a single-axis tracking system. By analyzing the
    performance using the PVsyst simulation software, it was found that a 30° tilt
    angle provided the highest solar radiation and achieved the best performance,
    with a 58% performance ratio. This information is critical for enhancing the efficacy
    of solar PV water pumping systems in such regions. Ramli et al. [59] developed
    a solar-powered portable water pump integrated with an IoT-controlled irrigation
    system. The system uses moisture, temperature, and humidity sensors to transmit
    real-time data to a Blynk IoT cloud. Farmers can easily access and manage water
    pumps by using user-friendly mobile applications. The integration of IoT technology
    has shown significant improvements, achieved higher water usage efficiency, and
    reduced operational costs by 30%. Practical testing and evaluation of the system
    have been successfully conducted, paving the way for future enhancements and automation.
    Wanyama et al. [60] determined that a solar-powered control system, the Smart
    Irri-Kit, utilizes soil moisture sensor feedback for real-time irrigation scheduling.
    Field tests at Makerere University Agricultural Research Station Kabanyolo showed
    that the Smart Irri-Kit achieved efficient irrigation scheduling with no noteworthy
    variance from the gravimetric method for soil moisture detection. Integrating
    solar power into the Smart Irri-Kit enhances its autonomy and reduces its operational
    costs. Future research will explore incorporating weather parameters and advanced
    communication capabilities for remote monitoring and control, making the Smart
    Irri-Kit a promising solution for promoting efficient and sustainable agricultural
    practices. Hilali et al. [61] inspected the potential of solar pumping methods,
    benefiting the Meknes region, with an average of 4.7 kW·m−2·day−1 of solar irradiation,
    respectively. Embracing PV energy satisfies irrigation needs, reduces greenhouse
    gas emissions, and minimizes energy expenses. The use of solar energy technology
    through direct or indirect coupling techniques is effective and eco-friendly and
    fosters sustainable agricultural practices. Further exploration can focus on practical
    implementation and innovative control strategies to enhance the efficiency of
    solar water pumping systems. Ashraf et al. [62] assessed the viability of implementing
    a solar-powered irrigation system (SPIS) in the UIB region of Pakistan. Based
    on the slope index, the results indicate that approximately 92.5% of the HKH range
    is highly suitable for harnessing solar energy. Additionally, approximately 13.3%
    of the area exhibited high suitability based on aspect, with 25.3% showing medium
    suitability. This study underscores the potential of SPISs as a nature-dependent
    remedy for the sustainable waste management of agriculture, emphasizing the importance
    of water conservation technologies and enhancing water-use efficiency. Kumar et
    al. [63] investigated the importance of a solar-powered irrigation system for
    conserving electricity and water in Indian villages. Integrating solar energy
    technology with sprinkler systems can significantly reduce water consumption and
    energy use, leading to cost-effectiveness and environmental benefits. Surplus
    energy can be stored for other electrical needs, thereby promoting sustainable
    socio-economic development in rural Indian communities. Overall, implementing
    solar-powered irrigation in Indian villages has the potential to bring about positive
    changes to agriculture, water management, and energy conservation. Abhilash et
    al. [64] developed a solar tracking system for agricultural irrigation to optimize
    solar energy utilization. The system uses silicon-based solar panels and employs
    solar tracking to align with the sun’s beams, enhancing energy generation and
    battery-charging efficiency. This study emphasizes the importance of storing solar
    energy in batteries to ensure a continuous power supply despite variations in
    solar irradiance throughout the day. The implementation of this automated solar
    tracking approach can significantly improve the sustainability and cost-effectiveness
    of agricultural water management. Yavuz [65] proposed and analyzed a pump for
    agricultural irrigation known as the solar thermoelectric generator-assisted water
    pump (STEGWP). It highlights the design and parameters of solar thermoelectric
    generator cells (STEGCs) and compares their power output and cost with those of
    traditional photovoltaic (PV) panels. The proposed STEGWP system shows promising
    potential as an alternative for reducing energy costs in isolated regions. With
    further improvements in the utilization of quality materials, STEG systems could
    become viable for enhancing irrigation efficiency and sustainability. Kumar et
    al. [66] discussed the evaluation in terms of the techno-economic elements of
    a solar-tree-dependent irrigation pump for sustainable agriculture in rural Indian
    areas. It highlights the data collection on the water requirements for various
    crop stages and estimates the CO2 mitigation values based on electricity harvest
    and lifetime. The cost of the system is projected to be USD 3430 and this research
    suggests the potential for clean energy adoption in agriculture. Overall, this
    study emphasizes the viability and benefits of utilizing solar-powered irrigation
    systems to promote sustainable agricultural water practices management. Huang
    et al. [67] address sewer system planning limitations, like non-quantifiability,
    fuzzy objectives, and decision-making variable uncertainties. Multi-objective,
    nonlinear, mixed-integer, and compromise-fuzzy programming determine decision-making
    variables and provide a framework for optimal planning. The study found that a
    compromise-fuzzy-based MOP method can build a regional sewer system plan that
    meets effluent standards while maximizing the in-plant establishment value and
    minimizing costs [67,68]. 6.3. Energy-Efficient Solar Desalination Technologies
    Energy-efficient solar desalination technologies have revolutionized sustainable
    water desalination techniques. These innovative solutions address freshwater scarcity
    and offer greener alternatives to conventional desalination techniques that utilize
    solar energy. Wilson et al. [69] experimented with a low-cost and efficient 3D
    solar steam generator (ISSG) design for seawater desalination. Utilizing readily
    obtainable materials, such as diesel soot, PVA sponges, chopsticks, and air-laid
    paper, the generator achieved an impressive evaporation rate of 3.81 kg m−2 h−1
    under one sun illumination. The proposed design offers a promising solution to
    address global water scarcity, with the DSp-PVA-3D-6 configuration demonstrating
    a stable and durable performance for continuous desalination operations, producing
    freshwater at a rate of approximately 2 L m−2 h−1 in outdoor experiments. Future
    work will aim to enhance the evaporation rates and water transportation mechanisms.
    Ahmed et al. [70] discussed the importance of desalination in arid regions, the
    energy demands of desalination systems, and the potential for integrating solar
    power into this technology. The study emphasizes the advantages of this integration,
    such as reduced dependence on fossil fuels and a cleaner environment. This review
    highlights the need for further research and development to achieve sustainability
    and address the challenges associated with renewable-energy-based desalination
    systems. Li et al. [71] discussed a unique BiOI-FD-CuO interface evaporator, combining
    a superhydrophobic BiOI floating layer and a CuO polyurethane sponge. It achieved
    efficient solar desalination and sewage purification with a remarkable photothermal
    evaporation rate of 2.37 kg m−2 h−1, thereby addressing the challenges of pollutant
    degradation and salt crystallization. This innovative design offers practical
    solutions for large-scale desalination and wastewater treatment applications and
    provides effective and sustainable solutions to environmental issues. Menon et
    al. [72] reread the potential of renewable-energy-based desalination to shift
    towards a more sustainable approach that highlights solar energy as a capable
    solution for the production of decarbonizing water and evaluating the water cost
    of water for various solar desalination configurations compared to fossil-fuel-driven
    plants. The analysis also indicated a positive outlook for desalination as solar
    generation and storage costs will decrease by 2030. Tunsound et al. [73] examined
    the development of electro spun composite-membrane evaporators for solar desalination
    and steam generation. The composite membranes achieved a remarkable evaporation
    rate of up to ~79% for saline water concentration (21.00 wt% NaCl) and reached
    a maximum rate of 2.42 kg m−2 h−1 at 1.35 sun. Additionally, the membranes demonstrated
    outstanding reusability, with a water mass variation of over 90% after 10 cycles.
    These findings present a promising approach to efficient solar-driven freshwater
    generation and desalination. He et al. [74] investigated solar interfacial-heating
    desalination (SIHD), which showed great potential for addressing freshwater scarcity.
    However, managing high-salinity brine and optimizing water production remains
    a key challenge. This review covers recent developments in the handling of high-salinity
    brine during SIHD and categorizes various strategies. It also discusses the principles,
    comparative analysis, and optimization techniques for enhancing water production,
    while highlighting the tasks and future research prospects in interfacial-heating
    solar desalination. Wijewardane et al. [75] reviewed advancements in solar desalination
    technology, focusing on inventions, innovations, and their potential for commercialization
    to address clean water scarcity. With an estimated two-thirds of the global population
    being impacted by water scarcity by 2025, solar desalination offers a sustainable
    approach to tackle this challenge. Interfacial solar evaporation systems have
    attracted significant research interest owing to their efficiency in utilizing
    solar energy for water production. Ongoing efforts aim to overcome these challenges
    and optimize the scalability and cost-effectiveness of these innovative solar-driven
    solutions. Burhan et al. [76] developed a common platform using long-term ratings
    (LTR) and standard solar energy (SSE) to compare three practical solar harvesters.
    The comparison considers the efficacy of each system despite variations in the
    optical and work cycles. For instance, in the case of solar-powered seawater desalination,
    the SSE required per m3 for stationary PV, concentrated PV (CPV), and concentrated
    solar power (CSP) systems are 6.49, 2.36, and 2.99, respectively. This approach
    compares solar technologies based on their true system potential and efficiency.
    Elhenawy et al. [77] experimented by integrating a system to determine desalination
    using solar energy into hybrid water that combines the technologies of membrane
    distillation (MEE-MD) and thermal desalination. The expertise was established
    using the multi-effect evaporation (MEE) and air-gap membrane distillation (AGMD)
    structures. Outdoor testing revealed that the hybrid MEE/MD configuration outperformed
    the unconnected multi-consequence evaporation unit by 45%. The proposed hybrid
    system can produce 159.84 m3 of fresh potable water annually at USD 5.37/m3 and
    reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 189 tons annually. He et al. [78] reviewed
    the integration of solar photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) technology with desalination
    processes to improve efficiency and productivity. The combined use of PVT panels
    and desalination offers a practical and cost-effective solution, potentially reducing
    expenses by up to 20% compared to current methods. This approach aims to enhance
    solar energy efficiency and enable operational independence for off-grid applications.
    7. Solar Panels in Sustainable Urban Planning Solar panels are being increasingly
    incorporated into sustainable urban planning initiatives worldwide. Smart cities
    and public parks are increasingly adopting solar technology, paving the way for
    urban landscapes that are greener and more energy efficient. Incorporating solar
    panels into urban planning reduces the carbon footprint and encourages the adoption
    of renewable energy sources for a more sustainable and environmentally conscious
    future. 7.1. Solar Energy in Urban Development Strategies Solar energy has driven
    the development of eco-friendly cities. Solar panels can optimize energy use,
    reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and clean cities. Li et al. [79] determined how
    the urban form affects solar radiation in Nanjing using two-hundred samples from
    eight block types. Urban density negatively affected solar radiation; whereas,
    the newly proposed BSR parameter was significantly correlated with building density
    and sky visibility. Certain layouts performed better in different seasons, with
    the U-shaped type having the highest annual average PV utilization potential of
    143 kWh/m2, and both FAR and BSR significantly influenced PV utilization (r2 of
    0.94 and 0.83, respectively). Kaleshwar et al. [80] evaluated the performance
    of solar energy in five different urban build forms (UBFs) based on local climatic
    zones (LCZs) in Nagpur, India. Using indicators related to density, open spaces,
    buildings, streets, and vegetation, digitized 3-D models and solar simulations
    were employed using the Grasshopper and Ladybug plugins. This study shows that
    the UBF significantly affects the probability of solar energy. The procedures
    used can aid in creating urban solar maps, providing valuable insights for decisionmaking
    and planning for retrofitting solar panels in precise urban settings. Guillén-Lambea
    et al. [81] suggested a practice to determine the self-sufficiency of energy in
    urban areas using the energy self-sufficiency urban module (ESSUM) concept in
    Zaragoza, Spain; geographical information systems (GIS), LiDAR point clouds, and
    cadastral data were utilized to determine the self-sufficiency capacity. The results
    indicate that 21% of the available rooftop area can achieve total independence
    of domestic hot water (DHW) while dedicating the balance of the area on the rooftop
    to photovoltaic (PV) can influence self-sufficiency electricity by 20%, resulting
    in significant CO2 emission reduction (12,695.40 t CO2eq/y) and energy hoards
    (372,468.5 GJ/y). It is justified to install solar panels, even in buildings with
    historical value, as they reduce operational charges and pay for the preservation
    of structures through this new energy source [82]. Liu et al. [83] adopted the
    Grasshopper platform to analyze a multi-objective urban form design optimization
    framework in Jianhu, China, considering the minimum building energy consumption,
    maximum solar potential, and sunlight hours. The Ladybug Tools plugin was employed
    for performance simulation, revealing correlations between urban form factors
    and building energy consumption (e.g., BD, OSR, SC, and PAR) and rooftop PV energy
    generation (e.g., FAR, BD, AF, OSR, SC, PAR, and SVF). Future research should
    consider different functional blocks, address simulation time issues, and incorporate
    microclimate and landscape layout factors. Cantoni et al. [84] conducted interviews
    and population surveys in Cape Town, Burkina Faso, Ouagadougou, and South Africa;
    this fieldwork-based study used a hybrid theoretical framework to analyze electricity
    access in peripheral areas. The research highlights the importance of the technological
    design, planned scale, and scope of solar energy projects in determining their
    benefits for local communities, providing valuable guidance for policymakers and
    renewable energy companies to address energy justice issues. Kumar [85] conducted
    a spatial variability analysis of solar energy resources in southern India. Using
    geostatistical models and time series studies with Meteosat satellite-derived
    datasets from the NREL, the region was classified into five suitability classes
    for solar energy resources. The results show an average annual GHI of 690.051
    GWh/m2 and DNI of 617.580 GWh/m2, indicating ample solar potential for future
    urban applications, supporting sustainable energy resources, and contributing
    to infrastructural development in the area. Jo et al. [86] determined the global
    and local effects of climate change caused by buildings in urban areas. This study
    introduced a new methodology using remote sensing data and building energy simulations
    to evaluate the potential benefits of installing reflective roofs. The results
    show that 73% of the buildings in the study area can benefit from cool roof systems,
    leading to an annual electricity reduction of 4.3% (7830 MWh), peak electrical
    demand reduction of 555 kW, and annual reductions of 3823 tons of CO2, 5.29 tons
    of NOx, and 3.52 tons of SO2 emissions. This study underscores the potential economic
    and environmental advantages of implementing cool roof systems for sustainable
    urban development. Xie et al. [87] evaluated the impact of urban morphology on
    building energy consumption and solar energy generation potential for university
    dormitory blocks in Wuhan, China. The authors of the research classified block
    types and analyzed the correlations between urban morphology and energy performance
    indicators (EUI, SEGI, and NEUI) for 55 blocks. The results demonstrated that
    different block types could lead to a 12.25% difference in the EUI and a 35.85%
    significant difference in the NEUI with PV panel deployment, offering valuable
    guidelines for enhancing building energy conservation and clean energy policies
    at the block scale in Wuhan and similar regions. Ranalli et al. (2018) [88] investigated
    the challenges of increasing distributed solar energy capacity in urban areas.
    A spatial decision-support system (SDSS) workflow was proposed to aid stakeholder
    planning and communication. The workflow generates quantified results for economic
    and technical parameters, facilitating informed decisionmaking in the renewable
    energy sector. With the potential to identify suitable deployment sites, encourage
    policy development, and foster data-based decisionmaking, SDSSs offers valuable
    support for sustainable urban energy planning. 7.2. Solar Panel Applications in
    Smart Cities Solar panels are indicators of environmental responsibility within
    the imagined landscapes of smart cities that convert urban areas into renewable
    energy centers. These solar energy options open the door to cleaner, smarter,
    and more resilient urban environments when integrated into smart infrastructure.
    Current practices, regulations, and urban development guidelines in many countries
    do not provide a sufficient foundation for implementing a smart city model [89].
    Integrating solar vehicles within the framework of smart cities is a visionary
    step. By utilizing solar panels as a power source, these vehicles contribute to
    sustainable transportation and conform to the eco-friendly ethos of contemporary
    urban landscapes, fostering a symbiotic relationship between renewable energy
    and urban mobility [90]. Kappagantu et al. [91] analyzed the barriers to implementing
    rooftop solar PV systems in the Puducherry smart grid pilot project involving
    5000 electricity consumers. The results indicated that installing rooftop solar
    power for these consumers would establish a 5 MW capacity, support power generation
    for the Puducherry Electricity Department, reduce losses, fulfill a 5 MW renewable
    power obligation (RPO), and benefit from the net metering feature of smart meters.
    Puducherry’s commitment to solar energy and a favorable environment for energy
    innovation may exemplify India’s transition to renewables. Byrne et al. [92] evaluated
    solar cities using an assessment method to estimate the solar electric potential
    of overlooked rooftop spaces. An illustrative case study conducted in Seoul, South
    Korea, representing a significant portion of the country’s population and economic
    activity, reveals that the widespread deployment of rooftop-based PV systems could
    supply nearly 30% of the city’s annual electricity consumption. Moreover, on a
    typical day, 66% of Seoul’s daylight-hour electricity needs can be met by distributed
    solar power systems, indicating a considerable potential for reducing pressure
    on the city’s electricity grid. Abu-Rayash et al. [93] developed an integrated
    solar energy system in a small city with 5000 homes, achieving overall exergy
    and energy efficiencies of 49.2% and 53.4%, respectively. This method consumes
    intense solar power, PV thermal technology, organic Rankins, and absorption refrigeration
    to offer electricity, cooling, and heating solutions. The CSP farm had the highest
    exergy destruction rate of 46%. Simultaneously, electricity production from PV
    and organic Rankine systems contributed significantly to environmental impacts,
    representing the highest impact potential in categories such as global warming
    and acidification. Hsiao et al. [94] recommended using robotic fiber spinning
    and graphene silk materials to create solar panels of graphene silk thin films.
    Studies have revealed that feeding silkworms with an aqueous solution containing
    graphene doubles the efficiency since the carbon nanotubes increased the durability
    of the spit silk and the carbonized silk’s conductivity by approximately 10 times.
    This biologically autonomous solution addresses the pollution problem of traditional
    solar panels at smart bus stops and offers promising opportunities for sustainable
    infrastructure development. Dispenza et al. [95] designed, validated, and realized
    a solar-powered hydrogen fueling station in Capo d’Orlando, Sicily. This station
    features a 100 kW rooftop PV plant and a 300 kWh battery energy storage system,
    providing energy to an on-site hydrogen production plant. The hydrogen fueling
    station, with subsystems for electrolysis-based hydrogen production, compression,
    high-pressure storage, and automotive dispensing, produces 6.64 Nm3/h of 99.995%
    pure hydrogen. The successful results from the initial test campaign demonstrated
    the promising potential of this smart city application for achieving sustainable
    transportation solutions. Figure 4 illustrates the application of solar panels
    in smart cities. Figure 4. Utilizing Solar Panels in Smart cities. Calvillo et
    al. [96] lead an inclusive evaluation of energy-related planning and operation
    models, categorizing them into four main interventions: transport, generation,
    storage, and facilities. Promising trends have been identified, such as the increasing
    presence of distributed generation (DG) with energy storage and renewable sources,
    the adoption of energy-efficient facilities with advanced control systems, and
    the growing utilization of microgrids and smart grid paradigms. These advancements
    signify the potential of smart cities to integrate sustainable and efficient energy
    systems. Varghese [97] determined the concept of smart cities in India by focusing
    on the proposed city of Dholera in Gujarat. The government’s intention to attract
    foreign direct investment and upgrade infrastructure for development was evident.
    However, the lack of elaboration on rural areas and the potential infringement
    of constitutional freedoms raises concerns. The first smart city’s initial challenges
    highlighted the uncertainties in scaling up 100 smart cities. Considering the
    country’s existing deficiencies, exploring indigenous solutions, such as Dr Abdul
    Kalam’s smart villages, may offer a more inclusive approach to addressing wider-ranging
    problems effectively. Modern solar micro installations cannot store a large amount
    of surplus energy, a solution could be energy storage systems for energy storage
    [98]. Behzadi et al. [99] introduced a smart building energy system incorporating
    PVT panels and a heat storage tank to increase renewable energy utilization, reduce
    energy costs, and enhance reliability. A thorough thermodynamic analysis was performed
    on a real case study house in Esbjerg, Denmark, to assess the feasibility and
    efficiency of the system. The PVT panels generate 3647.4 kWh of annual electricity
    with 14% overall energy efficiency, achieving a yearly energy utilization factor
    of 0.61 and effectively meeting the domestic hot water demand while compensating
    for the building’s energy costs. Mosannenzadeh et al. [100] conducted empirical
    research on 43 European communities implementing smart energy city projects; this
    study provides a systematic classification and analysis of 35 barriers in various
    aspects, such as policy, administrative, financial, and technical. The prioritization
    of these barriers, using a novel multidimensional methodology, reveals key obstacles,
    including fragmented political support, lack of cooperation among partners, insufficient
    external financial support, and a shortage of skilled personnel. The findings
    can aid policymakers in successfully understanding and addressing these barriers
    to implementing smart energy city projects. Ghadami et al. [101] conducted an
    experiment in Mashhad, Iran, utilizing machine learning tools to assess electrical
    energy consumption with a remarkable 99% accuracy in forecasting, employing artificial
    neural network (ANN) and statistical analyses. This study presented innovative
    dynamic strategies based on expert knowledge to promote citizen participation
    in renewable energy generation. Prioritized motivational approaches include optimizing
    costs through energy sharing, implementing an energy coin system, reducing electricity
    costs, and offering valuable insights for smart city development in short- and
    long-term planning. Mukilan et al. [102] explored power generation in a residential
    building using PV sensors and piezoelectric transducers integrated into floor
    tiles. Machine learning models, including the ARIMA time series, support vector
    machine (SVM), and k-nearest neighbor (KNN), were used to analyze and predict
    the sensor performance, with a validation accuracy of 99.5% achieved by the ARIMA
    model. Despite some manufacturing, installation, and maintenance limitations,
    these energy-harvesting tiles offer an innovative and sustainable approach to
    power generation. Guo et al. [103] examined a peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading
    strategy as a key to addressing peak electricity costs in residential areas. Three
    interconnected buildings incorporating solar panels and a hydrogen source engaged
    in P2P transactions to optimize energy consumption and reduce billing. The results
    indicate the usefulness of the planned system, with the risk-averse model generating
    30 kW (18 kW in the risk-neutral model) of solar power, showcasing the potential
    benefits of renewable energy resources. Additionally, minimal variation was observed
    in hydrogen charging, discharging, and fuel cell electricity generation between
    the risk-averse and risk-neutral strategies, emphasizing the significance of the
    trading model of P2P in enhancing energy efficiency and resource utilization.
    Ashwin et al. [104] investigated a smart bin equipped with an HC-SR04 Ultrasonic
    Sensor and TowerPro SG90 Servo Motor, which offers an automated solution for waste
    collection and segregating dry and wet household waste in smart cities. The smart
    bin operates efficiently by using solar panels producing 800 W of energy per day
    and a LiFePO4 battery for storage, reducing 20% of the main electricity consumption.
    This waste management advancement benefits smart city dwellers by ensuring a cleaner
    environment and sustainable disposal. Yao et al. [105] introduced a multi-objective
    robust optimization framework to maximize EVs’ economic and environmental assistance
    and integrate low-carbon electricity in smart cities. This method addresses uncertainties
    and reflects the benefits of numerous stakeholders in smart charging and discharging
    systems. The proposed strategy has positive outcomes, including enhanced clean
    energy utilization, cost savings, and load regulation. This shows its potential
    to foster sustainable and efficient energy management in smart city environments.
    Mosannenzadeh et al. [106] developed a 5 W + 1 H model integrated with a literature
    review and expert knowledge. This study defined smart energy city development
    both theoretically and practically. This study presented a comprehensive conceptual
    framework outlining spatiotemporal scales, stakeholders, principles, objectives,
    and domains. It also offers practical answers and methodology for eight interventions,
    highlighting the significance of integrating smart energy solutions with sustainable
    approaches for successful city development. Yang et al. [107] incorporated distributed
    thermal energy resources into smart thermal grids (STGs) to improve efficiency
    and intelligent management. Integrating renewable resources and thermal energy
    storage (TES) in district heating (DH) technologies, a solar DH system with centralized
    and distributed TES significantly enhances overall efficiency, reducing heat losses,
    energy consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions. Optimization studies are recommended
    to ensure the cost-effective integration of distributed solar energy systems into
    a larger infrastructure. Bandyopadhyay et al. [108] studied the impact of various
    circulated energy methodologies on the peak grid load, energy consumption, and
    residential sector emissions. The optimization framework considered lithium-ion
    batteries, solar panels, smart thermostats, and the storage of ice-cold thermal
    energy. The findings suggest that investing in solar panels and smart thermostats
    can effectively minimize the overall annual expenditure and environmental footprint.
    However, high capital costs and policy disincentives hinder the economic viability
    of storage systems for residential customers. Conversely, LIBs are beneficial
    for mitigating demand charges and controlling peak loads. Abas et al. [109] researched
    SlugCam, a solar-powered wireless smart camera network suitable for outdoor applications,
    such as video surveillance and environmental monitoring. Its energy efficiency
    is achieved through hardware optimization and adaptive software operation, leading
    to extended unattended deployment periods and low network bandwidth requirements.
    The open-source design and versatile functionality of SlugCam make it a promising
    solution for future outdoor video monitoring needs, as demonstrated through extensive
    power characterization and real-world deployments. Sohani et al. [110] examined
    the effect of meteorological parameters on the photocurrent and thermal voltage
    of a 320 W polycrystalline solar panel, showing a 200% increase in solar radiation
    impact within the range of 500–1500 W m−2. Furthermore, ambient temperature influenced
    the thermal voltage of the diode by 9.36% when changing from 27 to 47 °C. The
    photocurrent was the most significant parameter in reducing CO2 emissions, with
    18.0% smaller and 14.6% greater CO2 savings observed for photocurrent values 20%
    inferior and 20% more developed than the base circumstance, respectively, representing
    a 32.6% variation within the range. Qing Li et al. [111] assessed the degradation
    mechanism of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to address their instability. They
    discovered that a halide diffusion equilibrium affects the performance of the
    device. The study found that diffused halides can contaminate the transport layer,
    reducing the efficiency of PV cells. In response, a strategy was developed to
    achieve halide diffusion equilibrium, resulting in an efficiency of 23.13% and
    a stable power output under continuous one-sun illumination [111]. Zhao et al.
    [112] improved organic solar cell power-conversion efficiency (PCE) by increasing
    the charge-carrier diffusion length (LD) in an organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ).
    They added F1, a fullerene liquid crystal, to the active layer to improve charge-carrier
    transport and energetic disorder. The PM6:Y6: F1 ternary OSCs had a 15.23% PCE
    with an active layer thickness near 500 nm [112]. 7.3. Solar-Powered Public Spaces
    and Parks Solar-powered public spaces and parks are illuminated by environmentally
    friendly architecture, embracing nature’s abundant energy while illuminating urban
    parks. Stock et al. [113] demonstrated that climate change mitigation, rural electrification,
    and solar park development in India cause social friction, particularly in Gujarat
    Solar Park, where marginalized populations bear disproportionate burdens. This
    study examines how the socio-material accumulation of water and electrical infrastructure
    unevenly distributes surreptitious burdens across differently positioned peasants,
    posing threats to food security and exacerbating water scarcity. Obaideen et al.
    [114] highlighted the impact of energy supply and demand on the social, economic,
    and environmental aspects. In response, decision makers are adopting sustainable
    development goals (SDGs) to guide policies towards sustainability. The given study
    emphasizes the allocation of solar energy themes within the SDGs. It analyzes
    its contributions, particularly in the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum (MBR) Solar
    Park in the United Arab Emirates, which has mitigated 6.5 million tons of carbon
    dioxide and achieved several SDGs. Sekyere et al. [115] investigated a 20 MW solar
    PV plant located in the southern part of Ghana, near the Gulf of Guinea, which
    was analyzed using both PVsyst simulation and monitored data from 2018. Based
    on the monitored data, the plant delivered 26,480 MWh of energy to the grid; whereas,
    the simulations projected 29,154 MWh annually. The findings provide valuable insights
    into performance statistics, with a 72.8% to 80.2% performance ratio and a 15.1%
    to 16.6% capacity factor. The system efficiency ranged from 11.39% to 12.32% and
    the carbon emission savings reached 12,181 metric tons in 2018. These results
    can guide future large-scale solar projects in coastal tropical regions, including
    Ghana’s southern part. Golroodbari et al. [116] conducted a techno-economic analysis
    that evaluated the viability of combining an offshore floating solar farm with
    a Dutch offshore wind farm in the North Sea. By using cable pooling to optimize
    cable capacity, the anti-correlation between solar and wind resources minimizes
    curtailment issues. The findings demonstrate the potential benefits of integrating
    solar and wind systems in terms of technical efficiency and economic returns,
    with optimally combined capacities that depend on meteorological conditions and
    cost factors. For over a year, Wei et al. [117] deployed a prototype solar-powered
    air monitoring system called the Village Green Project (VGP) on a school rooftop
    in Hong Kong. It recorded approximately 330,000 1-min observations (data completeness
    of ~62%) of ozone, PM2.5, and meteorological parameters, exhibiting good performance
    for a 1-h resolution with R2 values of 0.74 for PM2.5 and 0.76 for ozone when
    compared with the nearby Hong Kong Environment Protection Department (EPD) station.
    The combination of the VGP and nonparametric trajectory analysis (NTA) models
    successfully identified local pollution sources in urban areas, demonstrating
    the potential for effective air quality monitoring and source identification.
    Mohamed et al. [118] evaluated the economic viability of Benban Solar Park, a
    1600 MW AC grid-connected PV project in Benban, considering its annual electricity
    output of 3.8 TWh annually. The analysis showed an economically feasible electricity
    cost of USD 8.1 per kWh with a 10.1-year payback period at a 12% interest rate.
    Moreover, solar parks will mitigate nearly 1.2 million tons of greenhouse gas
    emissions annually. This investigation suggests that agrivoltaic systems are potential
    movement directions for the project’s feasibility. Chen et al. [119] distinguished
    the viability of consuming radiating solar-produced electricity in Qingdao, China
    as a supporting authority for electric buses, considering 547 bus routes and 28,661
    street-view scenarios. The findings indicate that electricity from solar radiation
    contributes to approximately one-eighth and one-fifth of a bus’s overall electricity
    usage per kilometer on sunny and cloudy days, respectively. The proposed framework
    offers insight into the feasibility of integrating solar power into electric bus
    fleets, thereby supporting effective planning decisions for extensive urban areas
    at diverse locations and times. Stock et al. [120] examined Gujarat Solar Park
    and Kurnool Solar Park in India. This study investigated the resistance to land
    acquisition and agrarian system transformations. Various forms of resistance ‘from
    below,’ such as protests, blockades, and lawsuits, challenge the impact of solar
    park development on livelihoods. While corporate social responsibility efforts
    attempt to appease discontent, they fail to address the underlying political claims
    and resistance persists. Carlisle et al. [121] examined public support for large-scale
    solar developments in six Southern Californian counties (Inyo, Kern, Riverside,
    San Bernardino, San Luis Obispo, and Ventura). Findings from a 2013 telephone
    survey (N = 695) revealed that visual impact and proximity to different types
    of land significantly influenced the support. Preferences for buffer sizes and
    proximity contrasts depended on the type of land considered, highlighting the
    complexity of the factors shaping support for solar facilities. 7.4. Solar Panels
    and Urban Agriculture The presence of solar panels creates a specific microclimate,
    thus altering the living conditions of the vegetation [122]. Changes in the species
    spectrum of vegetation induced by the microclimate are particularly evident in
    solar parks established in agricultural landscapes [122]. According to Dupraz
    et al. [123], society must face the choice of increasing energy or food demand.
    Therefore, they posed the question of whether land should be divided into areas
    designated for crop cultivation and those for energy production. Alternatively,
    we should attempt to find a way to combine food production and energy generation
    on the same land. The answer might lie in the agrivoltaic, combining crop cultivation
    and solar panels. Thomas et al. [124] focused on solar parks and mega solar projects
    to accelerate renewable energy integration while mitigating the socio-economic
    and environmental impacts on local livelihoods. By incorporating agrivoltaics,
    the analysis identifies potential income improvements of 8% to 83% through medicinal
    plants, poultry, and beekeeping, providing sustainable solutions for societal
    implications and energy transitions. These findings emphasize the significance
    of considering agrivoltaic as a self-healing mechanism that promotes environmental
    and social benefits in solar projects. Agrivoltaic farms have been established
    in Italy (capacity 800–1500 kWp), the USA (capacity 550 MWp), and China (capacity
    700 MWp) [125]. Solar panels create a persistent shade that most cultivated crops
    can adapt to, primarily due to the lower water losses observed under the panels
    than in traditional agriculture [126]. Agrivoltaic farms produce rosemary, oregano,
    savory, thyme, legumes, chili peppers, tomatoes, potatoes, etc. [127]. The water
    use efficiency of traditional agrosystems is 157% lower than in agrivoltaic systems.
    Carefully selecting crops for agrivoltaic can also enhance economic efficiency
    [128,129]. These results indicate that combining solar panels with crop production
    can increase land utilization efficiency [130]. Nowak et al. [131] called for
    collaboration between botanists and engineers in solar projects to preserve biological
    diversity and promote the trend of ecovoltaics. An additional benefit of vegetation
    within solar installations is carbon sequestration [132]; however, as noted by
    Lambert et al. [133], several ecosystem functions in solar parks are limited,
    including carbon sequestration. The unavailability of food triggers another urban
    trend, urban agriculture, which contributes to food security [134]. Implementing
    urban agriculture holds architectural and urban potential regarding the functional
    use of green spaces, enriching public areas, and increasing green zones within
    dense urban environments [135]. The pressure of regional food availability can
    lead to the application of agrivoltaic technology in urban agriculture. The primary
    benefits of this combination include improved water management, employment opportunities,
    enhanced local food security, and increased energy independence. This will promote
    self-sufficiency in cities and urban neighborhoods. 8. Solar Panels in Construction
    Materials Incorporating solar panels into building materials represents a revolutionary
    step towards sustainable building practices. Façade systems and solar-powered
    building envelope solutions demonstrate the seamless integration of solar technology
    into the fabric of buildings, generating clean electricity while preserving aesthetic
    appeal. 8.1. Solar-Active Façade Systems Solar-active façade systems exemplify
    an innovative and eco-aware approach to building design. By incorporating solar
    panels into the exterior of buildings, these systems efficiently harness solar
    energy while enhancing the aesthetic appeal and green credentials of the architectural
    design. Vassiliades et al. [136] studied the effects of integrating the active
    solar energy method on prevailing façades in Thessaloniki, Greece and in Naples,
    Italy to examine thermal comfort in public spaces. The physiological equivalent
    temperature was used to evaluate street-level thermal conditions before and after
    integration, utilizing the Envi-MET software. The research aims to suggest the
    most feasible combination of urban practices and building integration strategies
    to enhance thermal conditions in public spaces in these coastal cities. Tariq
    et al. [137] presented a novel recommendation system for integrating a solar chimney
    with PCM-based passive energy storage in buildings, exemplified by a digital twin
    generation process. The results indicate that the optimized configurations vary
    based on the climatic zone, with ventilation rates ranging from 2.19 1/h to 4.9
    1/h and energy efficiencies from 37.6% to 40.33%. This study highlights the significance
    of digital data engineering and its impact on global solutions for energy-efficient
    building design. Giovanardi et al. [138] analyzed different building typologies
    as potential applications for the UST collector, optimizing the collector field
    to match the specific heat load profiles. Using TRNSYS software (TRNSYS 16), the
    authors evaluated the innovative thermal façade component’s thermal behavior and
    the energy potential in a combined system. The researchers concluded that its
    low cost, modularity, and easy installation make it a promising technology for
    building transformation, despite the lower energy quality owing to the unglazed
    collector’s low output temperature. Noaman et al. [139] demonstrated the integration
    of passive solar design strategies (PSDSs) with active solar cooling technology
    (ASCT) in a façade. The results showed that passively designed façades can reduce
    cooling claims by 43–65.70% and integrating sloped solar thermal collectors at
    a tilt angle of 30° proved to be the greatest efficient choice for most orientations,
    requiring a façade width ratio of 74–84.30% to meet cooling demands. However,
    vertical STCs cannot satisfy the cooling demands in this context. Vanaga et al.
    [140] discussed dynamic solar façade systems with energy storage to meet building
    cooling and heating demands. The consequences designate that the suggested solar
    façade module reduces the energy demand throughout the cooling season related
    to the reference triple-glazed window. However, further enhancements are required
    to optimize performance throughout the heating season. This underscores the significance
    of integrating passive and active solar design strategies to create sustainable
    and energy-efficient buildings. Tariq et al. [141] determined the sustainability
    of low-budget social houses in Mexico, where over 100,000 houses were built in
    2021, without strict adherence to energy codes. A novel integrated sustainability
    framework that considers energy, economic, environmental, and social aspects was
    proposed. The results demonstrate that intelligent integration of a double-façade
    architecture with advanced air conditioning systems can achieve up to a 48% increase
    in thermal comfort while reducing CO2 emissions by approximately 5668.59 kg/year.
    These findings highlight the need for government regulations to promote sustainable
    building practices in social housing projects. Li et al. [142] suggested an integrated
    active solar thermal façade (ASTF) system by investigating its thermal performance,
    achieving 44.60% and 45.30% heat collection efficiencies on sunny and cloudy summer
    days and 55% and 35.50% efficiencies on sunny and cloudy winter days, respectively.
    The ASTF system demonstrates the compensations of active energy supply and passive
    energy saving, making it a promising solution for hot summer and cold winter regions.
    Yongga et al. [143] presented a solar thermal façade system to minimize building
    energy usage while ensuring indoor comfort in hot summer and cold winter regions.
    Tests conducted under various weather conditions demonstrated significant reductions
    in indoor air temperature of 8.9 °C during cooling and increases of 8.0 °C during
    heating compared to stagnation conditions. These findings highlight the potential
    of this innovative solar façade system to contribute to energy-saving building
    designs and create pleasant indoor environments. Liang et al. [144] investigated
    an innovative active solar building façade system that generates domestic hot
    water and electricity. Utilizing PV/thermal modules as opaque ventilated façades
    significantly reduces the heat transfer into the building envelope by 40% and
    achieves an average PV conversion efficiency of 9%. With a coefficient of performance
    of 3.1, the system demonstrates promising potential for enhancing the thermal
    properties of buildings and providing sustainable energy solutions. Italos et
    al. [145] assessed the energy recital of a residential apartment building in Limassol,
    Cyprus, before and after energy renovation, incorporating a double-skin façade
    and active solar energy systems. Through digital energy simulations, the proposed
    systems’ impact on cooling, heating, and artificial lighting loads was examined,
    resulting in an impressive 83.5% reduction in energy consumption from 94,321 kWh
    to 15,563 kWh, annually. Integrating these innovative systems has proven to be
    a cost-efficient solution for refurbishing buildings in the southeastern Mediterranean
    region. 8.2. Solar-Powered Building Envelope Solutions Solar-powered building
    envelope solutions have redefined energy-efficient building designs by integrating
    solar panels seamlessly into roofs and walls. These innovative solutions optimize
    energy capture, reduce a building’s environmental impact, and embrace sustainable
    design at the innovation frontier. Wang et al. [146] investigated phase change
    materials (PCMs) proving that building energy efficiency has rapidly advanced.
    However, static PCM-built envelopes lack heat storage and flexibility, which results
    in low efficiency. Innovative adaptive dynamic building envelopes integrated with
    PCMs (ADBEIPCM) address this issue by utilizing rotating, moving, flipping, and
    controlling vents to efficiently store solar energy, release heat, reduce building
    loads, and enhance comfort. Future research should focus on developing novel PCMs
    with high strength and stability, AI-based control strategies, and bionic technology-powered
    ADBEIPCMs using renewable energies to improve further building energy efficiency.
    Luo et al. [147] transformed a building envelope into a multifunctional component
    that controls the heat flux and provides additional heating/cooling energy. Integrating
    PV and thermoelectric modules with energy storage explores five different systems
    (S1–S5). These systems exhibit significant energy savings, with an average 30%
    reduction in annual power consumption, offering promising opportunities for sustainable
    building design. Elghamry et al. [148] evaluated the influence of solar cells
    integrated into a building envelope on the power generation, energy consumption,
    comfort conditions, and CO2 emissions within a building. Different positions,
    orientations, and locations were analyzed in New Borg El Arab, Alexandria, and
    Egypt. The findings show that solar cells on the façade and roof can reduce energy
    ingesting by approximately 15% and 40%, respectively, and that a south-facing
    cell on the roof generates the highest annual power. A cell fronting south also
    affords contented interior situations and a north-facing cell on the façade yields
    the lowest CO2 emissions. Zhou et al. [149] determined that a building envelope
    design featuring a dynamic Trombe wall with a PCM was introduced to harness passive
    solar energy for heating buildings efficiently. The pioneering multi-panel solar
    collector storage wall allows the independent rotation of a panel to optimize
    solar irradiation utilization. The experimental results demonstrate that this
    new envelope is 20% more thermally efficient than a companion envelope with a
    static Trombe wall, resulting in potential energy savings from nonrenewable sources
    over the building’s design life. Vakilinezhad et al. [150] conducted an in-depth
    analysis of TC and RM coatings combined with passive strategies on the surfaces
    of residential buildings. The results revealed that the thermal behavior and energy
    performance depend highly on the climatic conditions and insulation thickness.
    In Ahvaz’s hot, arid climate, the retroreflective coating on south-facing surfaces
    reduced cooling loads by approximately 26%, surpassing the winter heating demand.
    In Shiraz, a hot-semi arid climate, the combination of retroreflective and thermochromic
    coatings resulted in an 18% reduction in cooling or heating loads, leading to
    an overall 14% decrease in energy consumption. These findings highlight the significance
    of tailored coating applications for optimizing energy efficiency in different
    climate regions. Qiu et al. [151] emphasized the importance of a passive solar
    design in achieving energy efficiency for office buildings in hot and humid climates.
    By integrating data mining techniques and parametric energy simulations, this
    study identified the glazing system, window-to-wall ratio, and coating on the
    roof as the top three critical enterprise parameters, with significance notches
    of 0.12970, 0.4858, and 0.3197, respectively. These findings offer valuable guidance
    for architects and policymakers to prioritize energy-saving measures and achieve
    sustainable design principles for office buildings in locations such as Guangzhou.
    The advanced simulation-built data mining technique can also be extended to additional
    building categories and weather conditions for energy-efficient designs. Weerasinghe
    et al. [152] studied the growth of solar building envelopes, or building-integrated
    PV (BIPV), which has been important in Asia and Europe; meanwhile, in Australia,
    it has been rather neglected. A machine learning model using real BIPV and building-attached
    PV (BAPV) data, particularly in Australia, could guide stakeholders in making
    informed decisions for investment, policymaking, and research to promote BIPV
    implementation and achieve greenhouse targets. Li et al. [153] introduced a solar
    building integrating photocatalysis and TCES, achieving the double purpose of
    space heating and formaldehyde degradation with a thermal efficiency of 66%. The
    system simultaneously demonstrates significant potential for space heating and
    the purification of air, with an impressive formaldehyde degradation rate of 8.9425
    μg/s. Li et al. [154] established the reaction kinetics for thermochemical sorbents,
    intending to develop models for numerical simulations. A solar building envelope
    united the photocatalysis and energy storage of thermochemicals and achieved an
    impressive total efficiency of approximately 81% under 600 W/m2 solar radiation,
    demonstrating promising integration possibilities. Gholamian et al. [155] suggested
    a hybrid solar-based energy system incorporating phase change materials (PCMs)
    to combat the building division’s substantial energy ingestion and discharge.
    By integrating PCMs, the system achieved a remarkable decrease of 27% in the demands
    of cooling and heating, improving the overall productivity of the plant by cost
    for unit product by 28.54%, exergy efficiency by 13%, usage of fuel by 18.42%,
    and in terms of fuel consumption, respectively. This approach shows promise for
    curbing energy usage and enhancing building sustainability. Winkler et al. [156]
    and Vaverková [129] indicated an important problem related to the location of
    PV farms in open areas and cities, regarding fire hazards in terms of both the
    installations themselves and the vegetation occurring on these facilities. Appropriate
    plant management is necessary in this regard. 9. Environmental Impact Solar energy
    systems generate power without noise or chemicals. However, the associated land
    use can degrade the habitat. Solar cell manufacturing is harmful, and solar thermal
    plants can strain water resources. Battery disposal and energy-intensive solar
    system construction are also important environmental issues. Sustainable and environmentally
    responsible solar energy implementation requires technologies, guidelines, and
    impact assessments to mitigate these impacts [157]. Tsang et al. [158] examined
    the cradle-to-grave impacts of organic PVs versus conventional silicon solar cells.
    According to research, organic PVs have a smaller environmental footprint and
    shorter energy and carbon payback times than silicon. The study also discovered
    that the advantages extend beyond the panel manufacturing process, with the cradle-to-grave
    impacts for long-term and short-term uses being 55% and 70% lower than those of
    silicon devices, respectively. A study by Oteng et al. [159] examined the environmental
    effects of monocrystalline and multicrystalline silicon solar panel waste modules
    in Australia. The research determined that mandatory product stewardship scenarios
    have a global warming potential of −1 × 106 kgCO2eq for mono c-Si solar modules
    and −2 × 106 kgCO2eq for multi c-Si solar modules. However, the collection and
    recycling of most multi-c-Si panels are ineffective. This research provides the
    first framework for life cycle assessment in policy and transportation-related
    analyses. 10. Architectural and Economic Impact Incorporating solar panels into
    buildings provides substantial long-term financial benefits, such as reduced energy
    costs, employment opportunities during installation and maintenance, and increased
    property values [160]. This integration can stimulate local economies and make
    properties more appealing to prospective buyers, increasing resale values [161].
    A study conducted by D’Adamo et al. [162] evaluated Italy’s PV market, focusing
    on subsidies introduced for plants with a capacity above 20 kW. The authors used
    a discounted cash flow methodology to determine critical variables like insolation,
    plant size, self-consumption share, investment cost, and electricity purchase
    price. Break-even point analysis revealed profitability in most cases and half
    of the alternative scenarios, consistent with investments aiming to increase the
    self-consumed energy share [162]. Zeraatpisheh et al. [163] investigated the financial
    viability of PV systems in three buildings. They used EnergyPlus to simulate these
    structures and compare various solar system sizes. The results indicate that demand
    charge tariffs do not justify using PV systems, even considering maintenance costs.
    The profitability index for all three structures falls between 0.2 and 0.8 and
    larger systems are less cost-effective when demand charges are present [163].
    11. Future Trends and Challenges The future of solar panels in the construction
    industry exhibits promising trends and presents numerous challenges. Advancements
    in solar panel technology, seamless integration with building design, and improved
    energy storage solutions are among the trends anticipated to drive widespread
    adoption. To fully utilize the potential of solar energy and create a sustainable
    built environment, it is necessary to address issues related to initial costs,
    grid integration, and aesthetics: (i) Solar panel technology is likely to continue
    to advance for solar panels utilized in the construction industry. Solar panels
    will become more accessible and cost-effective for building owners and developers
    owing to efforts to improve solar efficiency, reduce manufacturing costs, and
    enhance energy-storage capabilities; (ii) The seamless integration of solar panels
    into building designs is an important future trend. As architects and engineers
    integrate solar solutions earlier in the construction planning process, buildings
    can maximize solar energy capture while maintaining aesthetically pleasing designs;
    (iii) For buildings to store excess solar energy, advancements in energy storage
    technologies, such as improved battery systems and grid-scale storage solutions,
    are essential. In addition, integrating smart grid technologies and advanced energy
    management systems will optimize the flow of electricity, thereby improving energy
    efficiency; (iv) Numerous building owners, particularly in the commercial and
    industrial sectors, continue to find the initial cost of solar panel installation
    prohibitive. Innovative financing options and cost-competitive solar technologies
    are required to overcome this challenge; (v) Integrating solar panels into the
    design of a building while preserving architectural aesthetics is challenging.
    Future trends will concentrate on creating solar panel options that are visually
    appealing and adaptable, allowing them to blend into a variety of architectural
    styles; (vi) A method to reduce the competitive pressure between solar energy
    production and food production is explored. One of the trends is considering agrivoltaic
    in urban agriculture or using solar panels in vertical farming systems that produce
    food outside of agricultural land. 12. Conclusions In pursuit of sustainability
    and a greener future, this review article proposes the widespread adoption of
    solar panels in the construction industry. The most significant conclusions drawn
    from the discussion are as follows: (i) Solar energy has emerged as a major contributor
    to the worldwide adoption of renewable energy. Its exponential growth and applications
    in numerous industries, including construction, have demonstrated its critical
    role in combating climate change; (ii) Solar energy systems provide eco-friendly
    power generation without noise or chemical emissions; but, environmental challenges,
    such as land use and manufacturing impacts, must be addressed. Adopting mitigating
    measures, such as technological advancements, guidelines, and impact assessments,
    is essential for sustainability; (iii) According to new research, organic photovoltaics
    have several environmental advantages over silicon cells, including faster energy
    and carbon payback. Product responsibility is essential for the management of
    solar panel waste modules. These findings highlight the need for eco-conscious
    decisions and robust policies for the sustainable integration of solar energy
    in urban environments; (iv) Incorporating solar panels into buildings presents
    a compelling long-term financial proposition, including reduced energy costs,
    employment opportunities during installation and maintenance, and a significant
    increase in property values. These advantages not only have the potential to stimulate
    local economies but could also increase the desirability of properties, thereby
    increasing their resale values; (v) The comprehensive studies conducted underscored
    the importance of assessing the financial viability of solar panel installations.
    While one study demonstrates the profitability of such systems under various circumstances,
    another advises against employing them when demand charge tariffs are in place.
    These insights highlight the significance of well-informed decision-making when
    undertaking solar panel integration projects, balancing both financial incentives
    and constraints for a sustainable and economically sensible future; (vi) Solar
    energy is becoming more accessible to building owners and developers as solar
    panel efficiency and cost-effectiveness continue to improve. This enables buildings
    to generate electricity on-site, promoting energy independence and reducing reliance
    on traditional grids. However, it also paves the way for smarter energy distribution
    and consumption, improving overall energy efficiency. In addition, solar panel
    integration plays a crucial role in reducing buildings’ carbon footprints, mitigating
    air pollution, and conserving finite fossil fuel resources, aligning with global
    environmental preservation efforts; (vii) Although there are many advantages,
    issues still need to be resolved before solar panels can be widely used in the
    building industry. These issues include high upfront costs, difficult grid integration,
    and aesthetic concerns. In conclusion, this review article demonstrates that solar
    panels are no longer a futuristic concept but a practical solution that enables
    the construction industry to reduce its carbon footprint, achieve energy independence,
    and pave the way for a greener and more sustainable world. The adoption of solar
    energy is a shared responsibility for shaping a better future for future generations.

  description: This paper presents photovoltaic-powered electrodialysis reversal (PV-EDR)
    as a promising desalination technology for agricultural applications in the Middle
    East and North Africa (MENA). Water scarcity in MENA has led to reliance on brackish

    research in MENA and interviews conducted with farmers in Jordan led to the conclusion
    that energy cost is the most significant issue facing small-scale desalination
    systems for agriculture in MENA. PV-EDR was chosen as an improved desalination
    architecture to meet the needs of farmers by reducing energy costs compared to
    on-grid reverse osmosis (RO) systems that are currently employed in MENA. A novel
    time-variant (TV) operational approach is presented for continuous PV-EDR wherein
    flow rate and EDR stack voltage are varied based on the available solar irradiance
    such that desalination power matches available solar power throughout a day. This
    results in a variable product salinity throughout the day, but the presence of
    large water reservoirs on MENA farms ensures that irrigation water is adequately
    mixed before being sent to crops. The TV approach enables low-energy, continuous,
    solar-powered desalination without the need for batteries. Given a case study
    in Jordan, a TV-PV-EDR system was conceptually designed and compared to current
    benchmark RO systems in relation to capital cost, energy cost, and total lifetime
    cost via a theoretical techno-economic analysis. TV-PV-EDR was found to have a
    levelized cost of water ($/m3) that is 24 % less than current RO systems despite
    having a larger capital cost. TV-PV-EDR has the potential to provide a mechanism

    1. Introduction The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) face a food and water
    security problem, exacerbated by population growth and climate change. MENA is
    the most water scarce region in the world, with access to only 1.4 % of the world''s
    renewable fresh water despite having 6.3 % of the world''s population [1]. This
    is especially problematic for its agriculture sector, which accounts for 85 %
    of the water use in MENA [2]. Increased water consumption and depleted freshwater
    resources have driven users to rely on brackish groundwater for agriculture [3].
    Using high salinity irrigation water poses several problems for sustainable agriculture.
    Crop selection becomes limited as certain crops cannot be irrigated with salty
    water, including many of the high-value vegetable crops typically grown in MENA
    [4], [5]. Salinity-sensitive crops exhibit decreases in the quality and quantity
    of yield when irrigated with high salinity water. Additionally, irrigating with
    high salinity water degrades soil quality over time, leading to further drops
    in productivity and yield, with the high salinity soil requiring time and money
    to reclaim [4], [6]. These issues are especially problematic for developing economies,
    which rely heavily on domestic agriculture for both food security and economic
    growth [7], [8], [9], [10]. Political conflict, lack of economic resources, and
    poor governance make large-scale structural change in MENA''s agricultural sector
    difficult [7], [11], [12]. Farmers in these countries are left to their own methods
    to address water quality and quantity issues, which often take the form of energy
    and water intensive solutions. New solutions and policies are needed to incentivize
    environmentally friendly, low-energy, water-efficient technologies for water treatment
    and irrigation. Addressing water quality issues puts less stress on water resources,
    increases crop yields and productivity, and preserves soil health while boosting
    local and national economies. There has been success in the past at combatting
    water scarcity and quality issues through the implementation of water desalination
    and widespread water policy changes. Spain, for instance, allocates 22 % of its
    total desalination capacity toward agriculture, more than any other country in
    the world [13]. Spain''s desalination infrastructure in the 20th century was mostly
    comprised of small-scale systems having a production range between 100 and 5000
    m3/day [13]. In the 2000s, Spain transitioned to large-scale seawater desalination
    systems (>100,000 m3/day) because the increased number of small-scale inland desalination
    systems was contributing to groundwater aquifer exhaustion and brine discharge
    issues [13]. Today, most people rely on these large public desalination plants
    for their water needs as they have shown to be more economical and less inconvenient
    than small-scale, privately owned systems which require capital and maintenance
    [13]. Israel is another example of a water scarce country whose water landscape
    has seen rapid change over the course of a few decades through the installation
    of large-scale seawater desalination plants, wastewater treatment, and shifts
    to high value irrigated crops [14]. Moreover, Israel''s widespread adoption of
    drip irrigation has contributed to its 1600 % increase in crop productivity in
    the past 65 years [15]. Both Spain and Israel''s success relied on large-scale
    national desalination systems. However, large-scale change is difficult for many
    areas of MENA where water conflict, politics, and scarce resources hinder cooperative
    efforts to change water policy and invest in water infrastructure at a large scale.
    Much of MENA also has limited access to seawater and the distribution networks
    required to transport water over large distances. Thus, farmers often have no
    choice but to rely on small-scale inland desalination to combat salinity issues.
    Despite the advantages—economic and otherwise—of large-scale desalination systems,
    small-scale desalination systems will be an essential component of water and food
    security for the foreseeable future. Therefore, efforts are needed to improve
    upon existing systems by providing high recovery, energy efficient, renewably
    powered desalination and irrigation systems for small-scale brackish water applications.
    Small-scale brackish water desalination for irrigation is practiced to some extent
    in MENA. However, current desalination solutions pose economic and environmental
    concerns. Desalination is energy intensive and requires large amounts of grid
    electricity or diesel, which are becoming more expensive and volatile in price
    [16]. High consumption of grid electricity is also problematic as it relies heavily
    on fossil fuels. Because of this, renewable energy systems are desirable for desalination,
    but high energy requirements—and, thus, large capital costs associated with installing
    renewable energy systems—prove to be a barrier to widespread adoption. Current
    systems, often reverse osmosis (RO), output large volumes of high salinity waste
    brine, which is toxic to local ecosystems and expensive to dispose of properly
    [17], [18]. Desalination for agriculture could become more sustainable and economically
    feasible by implementing more energy efficient, higher recovery desalination systems.
    Though not as widespread as RO, electrodialysis reversal (EDR) is more energy
    and water efficient than RO for many brackish water applications and could be
    a good candidate for agriculture applications [19]. Additionally, drip irrigation,
    a micro-irrigation technology that delivers water directly to the root zone of
    the crop, has the potential to decrease the amount of water required for irrigation,
    thus further decreasing the size and energy requirements of desalination systems.
    Under correct practices, drip irrigation can reduce the amount of water lost to
    deep percolation and runoff by 20 to 76 % while increasing water productivity
    by 15 % [20]. This paper focuses on codifying the market needs and design theory
    for a photovoltaic-powered electrodialysis reversal (PV-EDR) system for irrigation.
    The current market space around the need for desalination and irrigation in MENA
    is investigated in order to develop design requirements. From these design requirements,
    EDR is chosen to be the most viable solution path to meet the needs of MENA farmers.
    This study goes on to articulate the parametric design theory for an EDR system
    for irrigation applications with the goal of presenting how one might practically
    design and operate a system to meet the given design requirements. The utility
    of this design theory is then demonstrated by conceptually designing and sizing
    a system for a case study farm in Jordan and quantifying its benefit compared
    to existing technology. 2. User needs and design requirements for desalination
    for agriculture in MENA While desalination for agriculture has been adopted in
    various parts of the world including MENA, current systems do not meet the needs
    of farmers. This conclusion was made by the authors through literature review
    about the MENA region, exploration of existing desalination systems in MENA, and
    interviews with farmers in Jordan to elucidate user needs and evaluate how well
    current systems meet those needs. Insights from MENA market research and field
    work in Jordan were then used to develop a list of design requirements for desalination
    for irrigation applications. An initial market review of the agricultural landscape
    in MENA was helpful in evaluating the factors that most affect the economic feasibility
    of desalination for agriculture. The 11 most water-stressed countries in MENA
    were identified, and information was gathered for each regarding income level,
    agriculture contribution to GDP, land resources, renewable surface water and groundwater
    resources, cropping patterns, electricity access, and irrigation practices. This
    information was largely collected from the Food and Agriculture Organization of
    the United Nations (FAO) and World Bank food and agriculture databases [5], [21].
    While this market context contributes to a high-level view of the MENA region,
    it is also important to understand how individual farmers perceive and address
    issues related to water quality and scarcity. To gain this additional perspective,
    the authors traveled to Jordan to conduct interviews with local farmers. While
    each country in MENA faces unique challenges, the findings from field work in
    Jordan are indicative of MENA at large because of the similarities in agricultural
    practices found in most MENA countries regarding crop selection and irrigation
    patterns. Jordan was chosen as a beachhead market for introducing improved desalination
    systems for agriculture because of the extent to which it has already addressed
    water quality and scarcity issues through investment in desalination and drip
    irrigation. Small-scale brackish water desalination is already in practice in
    Jordan, which makes it an ideal location to speak with farmers about the improvements
    that could be made to current systems [22]. Additionally, employing water saving
    technologies such as drip irrigation contributes to the economic feasibility of
    desalination as it leads to smaller and less expensive desalination systems. Drip
    irrigation is being adopted at a rapid pace in MENA, so it is advantageous to
    conduct interviews in Jordan where drip irrigation adoption already accounts for
    81 % of all irrigation [23], [24]. In Jordan, the authors visited 11 farms, ranging
    in size from 3.2 ha to 200 ha. Six of the farms employed desalination—all of which
    were RO systems powered by grid electricity—with an additional farm planning to
    invest in an RO system within the next year. The farmers in Jordan who had desalination
    systems were considered lead users for this market study. These farmers spoke
    about the tradeoffs they considered when purchasing desalination systems as well
    as how investing in desalination had affected their irrigation practices and yield.
    They also provided insight as to their sensitivity to different costs associated
    with their systems in addition to the biggest problems and pain points they face
    with their current systems. Farmers who did not have desalination systems spoke
    about their perception of desalination and what problems might be solved or created
    by the addition of such systems. They also discussed their perceived risks and
    barriers to adopting the technology. Conducting market research and identifying
    user needs led to the identification of five primary factors that affect the feasibility
    of integrating desalination with irrigation: crop selection, energy, irrigation
    water quality, farm size, and cost. 2.1. Market research and design requirements
    The design requirements in Table 1 were elucidated through aforementioned market
    research in MENA and interviews with farmers and lead users in Jordan. The five
    primary factors that influence the selection of these design requirements are
    discussed in the subsequent subsections. Table 1. Design requirements for desalination
    system for agriculture. Design requirement Value Production capacity 20–75 m3/h
    Feed salinity 1500–6000 ppm Product salinity 400–700 ppm Recovery ratio 70 % Energy
    source Solar and grid current RO systems current RO systems minimized but  current
    RO systems is acceptable OPEX/energy cost LCOW CAPEX 2.1.1. Crop selection Desalination''s
    feasibility for agriculture is affected by crop selection because different crops
    respond differently to irrigation water quality. It has been found that desalination
    is most economically feasible for salt-sensitive crops with high value added from
    low salinity irrigation water [22], [25], [26]. For small-scale brackish water
    desalination in Jordan, the value of desalinated water outweighs the cost of desalination
    for high-value vegetable crops [22]. High-value vegetable and tree crops require
    less water and provide higher profit margins than cereal crops, which tend to
    be more tolerant to salinity. Table 2 shows the most popular crops for the 11
    most water scarce countries in MENA [5]. Of the crops listed, 63 % are considered
    “Sensitive” or “Moderately Sensitive” to salinity according to a compilation of
    crop salinity sensitivities from Hanson et al. [4] and could benefit from desalination.
    The most sensitive of these crops require an irrigation water salinity of 400–700
    ppm in order to achieve maximum yield [27]. The salinity requirements of these
    crops thus drive product salinity requirements of desalination systems. Table

    discussed how crop selection affected their decision to invest in desalination.
    Crops that generally have stable market demand and prices are most lucrative to
    farmers; these crops generally are sensitive to salinity. An example of this is
    banana cultivation in Jordan. Its high demand and price throughout the year justify
    the cost of investing in desalination for many farmers [28]. 2.1.2. Energy Energy
    often constitutes the majority of the lifetime cost of a desalination system.
    Lowering energy requirements, and subsequently energy cost, is a key factor in
    increasing the economic feasibility of desalination for agriculture. Desalinating
    brackish water requires less energy than desalinating seawater because of its
    lower salinity. Brackish water in MENA is often found in groundwater aquifers,
    which farmers in MENA rely on heavily (Table 3) [24], [29], [30], [31], [32],
    [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41]. Table 3. Percentage of irrigation
    performed with groundwater in the 11 most water-stressed countries in MENA [24],
    [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39]. Country Use
    of groundwater for irrigation, as percent of total Algeria 65 % Bahrain 90 % Jordan
    53 % Kuwait 76 % Libya 99 % Morocco 47 % Oman 100 % Qatar 93 % Tunisia 60 % UAE
    100 % Yemen 67 % Lead users in Jordan stated that their RO systems comprise the
    majority of the total energy cost of their farms [29], [42], [43], [44], [45],
    [46]. Almost every lead user pinpointed energy cost as the most significant pain
    point of their current desalination system. The farmers least worried about energy
    costs were ones who employed solar systems to offset some of their energy costs.
    MENA''s high solar irradiance makes it an ideal location to implement solar energy
    systems [47]. Despite its potential for solar energy, each of the 11 countries
    listed in Table 2 attribute the majority of their electricity generation to oil,
    gas, and coal sources, with 9 of the 11 attributing over 95 % of their electricity
    generation to these sources [21]. Given the abundance of solar irradiance in MENA,
    solar energy will be one of the most important energy assets to MENA as electricity
    prices rise and become more volatile. Farmers in Jordan listed cost as the primary
    barrier to solar energy adoption [28], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [48], [49],
    [50], [51], [52]. However, many of the farmers who had purchased solar arrays
    paid them off within three years because of the energy cost savings. One farmer
    stated that their solar system was “the best investment [they] have ever made.”
    Energy is important to consider when designing a desalination system because of
    its large contribution to total lifetime cost. Employing solar energy provides
    an avenue by which the energy costs of desalination can be decreased. It is important,
    then, that solar-powered desalination systems perform comparably or better than
    current on-grid systems in order to incentivize their use. 2.1.3. Irrigation water
    quality Understanding what constitutes ideal water composition for crops is essential
    to the design of an improved desalination system for agriculture. While desalination
    is able to decrease the salinity of water, it is not able to remove all harmful
    substances in water. For example, boron, which is toxic to many crops, is difficult
    to remove via desalination [4]. Pre-treatment and post-treatment are often required
    to remove harmful constituents such as boron, suspended solids, or bacteria. Additionally,
    while monovalent ions such as and inhibit healthy plant growth, the presence of
    divalent ions such as , , and are essential to healthy plant growth [53]. Conventional
    RO systems remove monovalent and divalent ions alike, so farmers are often required
    to blend desalinated water with some volume of feed water or install fertigation
    systems to introduce these nutrients back into the irrigation water [28], [46],
    [54]. In Jordan, blending or fertigation was often used to bring water salinity
    back up to around 500 ppm. Irrigation water chemistry affects desalination design
    because of the added expense of implementing fertigation systems to introduce
    ions and nutrients back into the water. Finding less expensive methods to ensure
    ideal water chemistry can help make desalination more affordable. 2.1.4. Farm
    size Farm size affects desalination system design by setting constraints on both
    the production capacity and cost of a system. Smallholder farmers with less than
    1 ha of land often do not have access to the capital required to purchase desalination
    systems. This is compounded by the economies of scale of desalination, wherein
    the levelized cost of desalinated water becomes less for larger production rates
    [22]. While the majority of farm holdings in MENA are less than 1 ha, larger farm
    holdings constitute the majority of cultivated land area in MENA [55]. During
    farm visits in Jordan, the size range of the farms that incorporated desalination
    was 3.2 ha to 200 ha [44], [46]. The production rate of individual desalination
    systems found in Jordan ranged from 25 m3/h to 75 m3/h [28], [42], [43], [44],
    [45], [46]. Farms that required more desalinated water incorporated multiple systems
    in parallel to meet their total water requirement. Farmers with less land said
    that the cost of desalination was the biggest barrier to adoption. Similar trends
    were found regarding solar systems. Farm size is an important indicator of economic
    feasibility for desalination because it determines both production rate and sensitivity
    to capital cost in both desalination systems and solar systems. While desalination
    can be profitable over its lifetime for a large range of farm sizes, smaller farms
    are more sensitive to the short-term impacts of purchasing a system. 2.1.5. Cost
    Though employing desalination for agriculture can in many cases be profitable
    when considering the total lifetime cost of a system, the immediate effects of
    capital and operating costs significantly inform farmers'' perceptions of the
    risks and tradeoffs of investing in desalination. An important insight gained
    from field work in Jordan was that farmers are more sensitive to energy and operating
    costs of desalination systems than capital cost. Every lead user interviewed stated
    that energy and maintenance costs were the biggest pain points of their current
    systems [28], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46]. Some farmers went as far as to say
    that capital cost was not a concern at all; they were able to acquire the capital
    necessary to make large purchases by selling equipment or portions of land or
    by taking out loans. Instead, monthly electricity cost and the frequency at which
    they were required to replace RO membranes were much larger concerns. Farmers
    with the most land were the least concerned with capital costs as they had access
    to the most capital, but farmers of smaller plots of land also understood the
    financial benefits of investing in solar power or desalination. Cost, of course,
    directly influences economic feasibility. The need to reduce energy costs instead
    of minimizing capital costs is an important insight that greatly influences what
    type of system architecture and operational mode is economically feasible for
    farmers. It is important for an improved system to have reduced energy costs compared
    to current systems while maintaining a comparable or better lifetime cost. 3.
    Desalination system selection and design theory The following section presents
    the design theory for an improved desalination system architecture and operational
    mode given the design requirements derived in the previous section. It is found
    that continuous EDR best fits these design requirements and that operating this
    system in a time-variant scheme allows for cost-effective use of solar power.
    Governing theory that informs the design of a continuous PV-EDR system for irrigation
    is then presented. 3.1. Design choices for a desalination system for irrigation
    3.1.1. Selection of desalination process: RO vs. EDR RO and EDR are the two most
    common brackish water desalination processes. While RO accounts for 80 % of brackish
    water desalination, EDR only accounts for 8 % despite studies showing that EDR
    is more energy efficient for certain brackish water conditions [19]. In the RO
    process, feed water is pressurized to overcome its osmotic pressure and pass through
    a semi-permeable membrane. In EDR, a voltage is applied to a stack of ion-exchange
    membranes to separate dissolved ions in water and pass them through these membranes
    into a waste stream. RO and EDR are similar in that they are both capable of operating
    at a range of size scales, feed salinities, and product salinities. Both can also
    be powered by multiple energy sources including grid electricity and renewables.
    EDR has several advantages, however, that make it the ideal candidate for brackish
    water agriculture applications. For low feed salinities (<5000 ppm), EDR is more
    energy efficient than RO [18], [19]. EDR has further energetic benefits compared
    to RO when higher product salinities are desired [19]. This is especially relevant
    to the irrigation case where the product salinity is significantly higher than
    the salinity targeted for drinking water applications. EDR also requires less
    maintenance than RO as its membranes are stronger and less prone to clogging and
    fouling [18]. EDR does tend to have a higher capital cost than RO. However, its
    energetic benefits, decreased maintenance needs, and propensity for selective
    ion removal could make it the ideal technology to be paired with irrigation given
    the design requirements of lower energy costs and lower LCOW. For these reasons,
    EDR is considered for the remainder of this paper. 3.1.2. EDR operational mode
    EDR traditionally operates in either a continuous mode or a batch mode. In continuous
    EDR operation, feed water reaches its target salinity at the end of a single pass
    through an EDR stack or network of stacks. In batch EDR operation, a fixed volume
    of water—a batch—is stored in a tank and is circulated through an EDR stack multiple
    times until the target salinity is reached. Batch EDR is less energy efficient
    than continuous EDR because of the continuous mixing of newly recirculated lower
    salinity water with pre-recirculated higher salinity water in the batch recirculation
    tank. Batch EDR also requires higher flow rates—and thus more pumping energy—than
    continuous EDR for a set production rate because of the need to recirculate water
    multiple times. A benefit of batch EDR is that it requires much less membrane
    area—and thus less capital cost—than continuous EDR as water is recirculated through
    the stack multiple times. For very small production rates (<1 m3/h), the capital
    cost benefits of batch EDR outweigh the energy drawbacks, making it a more cost-effective
    solution compared to continuous EDR [56]. However, these benefits are less pronounced
    for large flow rates, making continuous EDR much more common. Flow rates of 20
    m3/h to 75 m3/h are desired for irrigation purposes, much larger than the 1 m3/h
    production rate where batch operation is considered the most cost-effective [56].
    Continuous EDR is thus chosen in this study to be the ideal system for agriculture
    applications because of its energetic benefits and common use for larger flow
    rate systems. 3.1.3. Considerations for PV-EDR operation One of the seemingly
    difficult attributes of utilizing a solar system is that its power level fluctuates
    through a day or week depending on cloud cover and time of year, which makes it
    difficult for the operation of a desalination system at a constant power level.
    To operate a photovoltaic-powered electrodialysis reversal (PV-EDR) system designed
    for a specific flow rate at a specific power level requires either an oversized
    solar system to account for low irradiance periods of the day or an oversized
    EDR system so that enough water can be desalinated during the few hours where
    solar energy is at its highest. In both cases, solar energy is inevitably wasted
    during the middle of the day when solar irradiance is at its highest, making the
    PV-EDR system more expensive. Battery storage could be utilized to capture this
    energy, but the high cost and maintenance requirements of large batteries often
    become a barrier to entry for end users. He et al. [57] previously developed a
    time-variant operational scheme for EDR wherein system flow rate and EDR stack
    voltage are adaptively controlled depending on the available solar energy, allowing
    for the desalination power profile to better match the solar profile and facilitating
    a smaller and less expensive EDR stack and power system compared to static EDR
    operation. This work, however, only pertained to batch systems operating at small
    flow rates (<1 m3/h). A new time-variant scheme can be developed for continuous
    EDR systems with larger flow rates, which has not been done previously to the
    authors'' knowledge. However, adjusting flow rate of a continuous EDR system inevitably
    changes its product salinity because of physical limits placed on the stack current
    given a certain flow rate. Thus, product salinity will be higher than nominal
    when flow rate is higher than nominal and vice versa. This would normally be unacceptable
    for drinking water applications, but it can work well for agriculture applications
    as the system would be operated in such a way that this variable salinity water
    is blended over the course of a day in a water storage pond to reach its target
    salinity. In this way, a continuous EDR system operating in a time-variant mode
    can sync water production to the solar irradiance profile, leading to a reduction
    in size and cost of solar panels. 3.2. Parametric design theory for time-variant,
    continuous PV-EDR operation In an EDR stack (Fig. 1) high salinity water flows
    through the inlet of a stack composed of alternating anion exchange membranes
    (AEMs) and cation exchange membranes (CEMs), which allow the passing of anions
    and cations, respectively. When an electric field is applied, anions are drawn
    toward the anode, and cations are drawn toward the cathode. Anions and cations
    then pass through the AEMs and CEMs, respectively, leaving behind alternating
    channels of diluate and high salinity concentrate streams that exit the stack.
    Diluate water is stored in a product tank or reservoir, and concentrate is disposed.
    EDR stacks are often comprised of dozens or even hundreds of these alternating
    AEM-CEM cell pairs. Download : Download high-res image (133KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. Electrodialysis reversal (EDR) process. Saline feed water
    enters a stack of alternating anion exchange membranes (AEMs) and cation exchange
    membranes (CEMs). An electric field is applied across the stack at the anode and
    cathode. Cations are attracted to the cathode and pass through the CEM, and anions
    are attracted to the anode and pass through the AEM. Alternating concentrate and
    diluate channels are formed over the length of the stack. The “reversal” denotation
    of EDR comes from the ability to reverse its voltage polarity, causing the concentrate
    and diluate streams to switch. Figure reproduced from Wright and Winter [58].
    Wright et al. [58] previously modeled the operation of EDR using an electrical
    circuit model. He et al. [59] used this modeling theory to develop time-variant
    flow- and voltage- control batch EDR. To model an EDR system, a single cell pair
    is considered (Fig. 2). The molar concentration is given as . Superscripts denote
    the bulk concentration, AEM surface concentration, and CEM surface concentration

    bulk concentration in a given stack segment, is the current leakage factor, is
    the current in a given stack segment, is the ion charge number, is Faraday''s

    the solute in the AEMs and CEMs, respectively, and are the thicknesses of the
    AEMs and CEMs, respectively, and , , , and are the concentrations of the diluate
    and concentrate streams at the interface with adjacent AEMs and CEMs in a segment.

    as and , respectively. A second subscript denotes the channel segment along the
    flow path. represents the current through each segment while represents the length
    of flow path. denotes the channel gap between two membranes. From Eq. (1), it
    is seen that a negative corresponds to a decreasing diluate stream salinity. The
    higher in magnitude this number is, the higher the degree of desalination. For
    a given stack arrangement, both product flow rate and the applied current can
    be adjusted to affect desalination rate. With all else constant, increasing leads
    to an decrease in , which corresponds to less desalination. Increasing leads to
    an increase in , which corresponds to an increased rate of desalination. This
    makes intuitive sense as well; increasing flow rate means that the water has less
    residence time in the stack and, thus, less time to desalinate. Increasing the
    current increases the electric potential applied across the stack, which promotes
    further ion separation. Given Eq. (1), one could posit that during high irradiance
    hours, an increase in could be accompanied by the required increase in needed
    to maintain a constant . However, given a certain flow rate there is a physical
    limit to how much current can be applied to the stack. This limiting current density
    is calculated as (2) where is the transport number of the counterion in the AEM
    or CEM membrane (usually assumed to be 1), is the transport number of the cations
    or anions in the bulk solution, respectively, and is the boundary-layer mass transfer
    coefficient given by (3) where is the Sherwood number, is the diffusion coefficient
    of the aqueous solution, and is the hydraulic diameter. The Sherwood number is
    given by (4) where is the Reynolds number and is the Schmidt number. The Reynolds
    number is given by (5) where is the density of the aqueous solution, is the channel
    velocity of the fluid, and is the dynamic viscosity. The channel velocity is directly
    proportional to the flow rate given some flow channel area. From Eqs. (2), (3),
    (4), (5), it can be concluded that the limiting current density scales with the
    flow rate as (6) As such, for an increase in system flow rate, the amount by which
    applied current can be increased is limited because of the nonlinear scaling shown
    in Eq. (6). An important insight from this relationship is that a change in system
    flow rate will cause a change in product salinity because of the nonlinear current
    scaling. This means that both the flow rate and product salinity of a time-variant
    continuous EDR system will change over the course of a day depending on the available
    solar power. To illustrate this design theory in practice, a system was conceptually
    designed for a case study in Jordan based on the design requirements outlined
    in Section 2: • Nominal Production Rate: 40 m3/h • Feed Salinity: 2000 ppm • Product
    Salinity: 550 ppm • Recovery Ratio: 70 % • Lifetime: 20 years In order to design
    an EDR system for this case study, Eq. (1), along with additional EDR modeling
    theory from Wright et al. [58], was used to build a system sizing tool for continuous
    EDR. Inputs into this system sizing tool include feed salinity, desired product
    salinity, production rate, recovery ratio, and the fraction of limiting current
    density at which the system will operate. Given these inputs and a set of flow
    spacer properties, this tool calculates desalination rate, power consumption,
    and pressure drop for a given arrangement of EDR stacks of a certain number of
    cell pairs. By changing the number of stacks in series and number of cell pairs
    in each stack, one can design a system that meets the target salt cut. For high
    flow rates, multiple lines of stacks can be put in parallel. Because of the large
    range of flow rates considered for this design, a single pump is not adequate
    for efficient time-variant operation as most pumps are sized for efficient operation
    only within a small range of flow rates. In applications where a large range of
    flow rates is considered, multiple pumps of varying size are typically selected
    so that efficient operation can be ensured for the entire flow rate range. For
    this application, three pumps (small, medium, and large) are independently sized
    for different operating points within the flow rate range considered. Only a single
    pump will be operating at a time depending on the flow rate corresponding to the
    given power availability. To meet the target production rate of 40 m3/h and product
    salinity of 550 ppm, a network of stacks was sized that contained two parallel
    lines of five stacks each, with each stack containing 530 cell pairs. This system
    had a total pressure drop of 0.97 bar and a total power consumption of 11.5 kW,
    yielding an SEC of 0.57 kWh/m3. Given this baseline EDR system, the water production
    and energy consumption of a time-variant PV-EDR system was found by taking hourly
    solar irradiance data for a typical day in Jordan [60]. This solar irradiance
    data, along with a solar panel area, yields an hourly power allowance for the
    desalination system. The degree to which this available solar energy affects product
    flow rate and product salinity of the aforementioned system is shown in Fig. 3.
    This is found by considering a range of flow rate inputs for the system architecture
    previously designed. The system sizing tool calculates the required power and
    the product salinity. As available power increases, flow rate increases via an
    increase in pumping power. For this given flow rate increase, applied stack current
    may only increase by the square root of the flow rate increase as shown in Eq.
    (6); thus, the product salinity must increase. Conversely, when less power is
    available, the system operates at a lower product flow rate with a product salinity
    lower than the initial setpoint. Download : Download high-res image (157KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Behavior of a continuous EDR system at variable
    power. As the available power increases, flow rate through the EDR stack increases
    via an increase in pumping power. Applied stack current may only increase by the
    square root of the flow rate increase (Eq. (6)). This change in flow rate and
    current result in a certain product salinity. For a set stack design and configuration,
    an increase in available power yields a higher product salinity. The data in Fig.
    3 was used as a look up table to calculate the hourly product flow rate and salinity
    given the hourly power allowance for the desalination system derived from the
    aforementioned solar irradiance data for Jordan. Thus, the total volume of product
    water was calculated by integrating the flow rate over the course of a day. The
    final salinity of the blended product water was calculated as a weighted average
    of the product salinity over the course of the day. The hourly power allowance
    was integrated over the course of a day to determine the total amount of energy
    required for a day of desalination. The total water production and resultant salinity
    for the day were 480 m3 and 545 ppm, respectively. The total energy required for
    a day''s worth of desalination was 290 kWh. Fig. 4 visually depicts how a system
    of this size operates over the course of a day under constant operation or variable
    flow rate and product water salinity. In the constant power operational scheme,
    flow rate and salinity are constant throughout the day, and much potential solar
    energy is lost during the middle of the day. A total of 360 m3 of water is produced
    and stored. In time-variant operation, the desalination system is allowed to operate
    at higher power levels, leading to higher flow rates and higher salinities. Conversely,
    during low irradiance hours, production rate and salinity are lower. A total of
    480 m3 of water is produced throughout the day as more of the available solar
    energy is captured. For applications such as drinking water desalination, this
    changing salinity would pose issues as consumers would receive water of different
    salinity depending on what time of day they receive water. Desalination for irrigation,
    however, provides an opportunity to take advantage of this time-variant scheme
    without facing the negative consequences associated with changing product water
    salinity. Download : Download high-res image (577KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 4. Time-variant operation throughout a day of desalination. In the
    constant power operational scheme, flow rate and salinity are constant throughout
    the day, and much potential solar energy is lost during the middle of the day.
    In time-variant operation, the desalination system is allowed to operate at higher
    power levels, leading to higher flow rates and higher salinities. More water is
    produced throughout the day as more of the available solar energy is captured.
    Many crops are resilient when faced with small changes in irrigation water quality
    and quantity, especially considering that the system can be designed such that
    the average salinity seen by the crops over the course of a day will be the nominal
    target salinity [61]. From a practical perspective, a system can be designed such
    that the product salinity associated with the maximum flow rate is still within
    an acceptable range for crops. Furthermore, farmers in MENA typically incorporate
    intermediate reservoirs to store water in before delivering it to the crops. These
    reservoirs allow for variable salinity water to be mixed over the course of a
    day to reach a constant salinity before being delivered to crops. This is especially
    true for reservoirs that are much larger than a day''s worth of irrigation water.
    From a design theory perspective, this time-variant operational mode allows for
    a continuous PV-EDR system to be operated at a variable flow rate depending on
    the available solar energy. Using this theory to better tailor desalination production
    with solar irradiance decreases the size requirement of solar panels and energy
    storage. Thus, this operational scheme for agriculture presents a unique opportunity
    to overcome limitations that might otherwise prevent adoption or feasibility of
    time-variant continuous EDR. 4. PV-EDR system comparison 4.1. System design and
    simulation This section presents a cost and performance comparison of the time-variant
    PV-EDR system discussed in the previous section and current benchmark RO systems
    in Jordan. However, it is also useful to compare the time-variant strategy to
    other EDR cases, namely PV-EDR with battery storage and grid-powered EDR in order
    to see what advantages time-variant PV-EDR presents over other possible EDR variants:
    1. Time-Variant, Photovoltaic-Powered Electrodialysis Reversal (TV-PV-EDR): This
    scheme consists of the baseline EDR system operated with a solar power system
    without batteries (Fig. 4). The production rate is varied throughout the day based
    on the time-variant theory discussed in Section 3. Three pumps of varying size
    are used in parallel for each line because of the wide range of flow rates considered
    for this scheme. This allows for each pump to efficiently operate in a narrow
    range of flow rates instead of one pump operating very inefficiently across the
    entire range of flow rates. 2. Photovoltaic-powered Electrodialysis Reversal with
    Batteries (Battery-PV-EDR): As mentioned previously, solar systems containing
    batteries can be undesirable because of added cost and maintenance requirements;
    however, this system is included here for comparative purposes. This scheme consists
    of the baseline EDR system operated with a solar power system with batteries.
    The system is operated at a constant power such that the flow rate and product
    salinity are constant. Any available solar power above this constant power threshold
    is stored in batteries so that desalination can continue at times of low irradiance.
    3. On-Grid Electrodialysis Reversal (Grid-EDR): This scheme consists of the baseline
    EDR system operated with grid electricity. The system is operated at a constant
    power level such that the flow rate and product salinity are constant. 4. On-Grid
    Reverse Osmosis (Grid-RO): This scheme consists of an RO system operated with
    grid electricity. Product water at 80 ppm is blended with some portion of feed
    water to bring the final salinity to 550 ppm. Both a high pressure pump and a
    low pressure feed pump are considered for this system in order to facilitate feed
    blending. This benchmark system is based on RO system parameters from systems
    seen in Jordan in addition to information found on commercially available RO systems.
    Using the same solar irradiance profile as was used for the TV-PV-EDR system discussed
    in Section 3, the water production and energy consumption of Battery-PV-EDR was
    found on an hourly basis. The system was allowed to operate at the constant power
    level of the baseline EDR system throughout the day, with any available solar
    energy above this power level being stored in a battery. This stored energy was
    used to produce additional water at the constant power level during low irradiance
    hours. The daily water production and product salinity were 481 m3 and 499 ppm,
    respectively. The required battery capacity was found to be 99 kWh while the total
    energy required for a day''s worth of desalination was 297 kWh. The water production
    and energy consumption of Grid-EDR was found by considering desalination production
    with the baseline EDR system for 12 h–the same amount of time the two PV-EDR systems
    were able to operate given the solar irradiance profile. The daily water production
    and product salinity were 481 m3 and 499 ppm, respectively. The total energy required
    for a day''s worth of desalination was 296 kWh. The water production and energy
    consumption of Grid-RO was found by considering commercially available RO systems
    as well as current RO systems in Jordan [28], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [48],
    [49], [50], [51], [52], [62]. This system consisted of six parallel lines each
    containing four RO membrane cartridges. A pumping power of 34 kW was used to calculate
    the energy consumption of RO for 12 h of desalination. This desalinated water
    was mixed with additional feed water such that the target flow rate and product
    salinity were met. The daily water production and product salinity were 480 m3
    and 550 ppm, respectively. The total energy required for a day''s worth of desalination
    was 403 kWh. 4.2. Cost and performance comparison This system comparison uses
    CAPEX, OPEX, LCOW, and SEC as the primary performance metrics. CAPEX, given by
    , is calculated by (7) where is the cost of ion-exchange membranes, is the cost
    of flow spacers, is the cost of the pumps, and is the cost of the solar system.
    OPEX, given by , is calculated per cubic meter by (8) where is the specific cost
    of electricity [$/m3], is the specific cost of chemicals [$/m3], and is the specific
    cost of maintenance [$/m3]. LCOW is calculated by (9) where is the replacement
    cost of components of the system''s lifetime and is the total volume of water
    produced over the system''s lifetime. SEC is calculated by (10) where is the total
    energy required to desalinate. From the design requirements, OPEX, which includes
    energy cost, is the parameter of primary importance to farmers. However, while
    farmers are more sensitive to OPEX than CAPEX, it is important that the LCOW of
    a TV-PV-EDR system is comparable or less than that of benchmark RO systems as
    it considers the total lifetime cost of a system. For this study, CAPEX consists
    of the following items shown in Table 4. EDR membranes, electrodes, and spacers
    are priced based on wholesale suppliers [64], [65]. RO membranes are priced based
    on suppliers and the cost Jordanian farmers pay for replacement membrane cartridges
    [28], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [48], [49], [50], [51], [52]. The power system
    components—solar system and battery—are also priced based on common supplier pricing
    and cost data collected in Jordan [42], [43], [46], [66], [67]. Table 4. Items
    included in CAPEX. Items marked with “X” for each system are included in that
    system''s CAPEX. Item TV-PV-EDR Battery-PV-EDR Grid-EDR Grid-RO Membranes X X

    cost was calculated using supplier sizing tools and pricing from Grundfos [70].
    For TV-PV-EDR, three pumps were selected. The flow rate range was separated into
    three distinct sub-ranges, and a pump was selected for each one by inputting flow
    rate and pressure requirements into Grundfos'' pump sizing tool. The flow rate,
    pressure, efficiency, and power were found for various operating points of these
    three pumps. For each of the other three cases, a single pump was selected. The
    efficiency and power was found for a single operating flow rate and pressure.
    All of these pumps were sized using Grundfos'' sizing tool, and power data and
    pricing were obtained from the Grundfos catalog. This study assumes that the items
    listed in Table 4 are the most important in comparing the CAPEX of an EDR and
    RO system. In reality, other components such as filtration, electronics, and hydraulics
    will also contribute to the capital cost of a system, but it is assumed that the
    cost of these additional components will be similar across similarly sized EDR
    and RO systems, so they are excluded from this comparison. For this study, OPEX
    consists energy, chemicals, and maintenance costs. Electricity costs were taken
    from the most recent energy census in Jordan [68]. The chemical and maintenance
    costs listed are common values for EDR and RO [69]. The replacement costs of components
    are not included in the reported OPEX of the system but are included in the total
    lifecycle cost of the system. This was done because component replacements happen
    at varying time scales, often on the order of years. While replacement costs were
    important to farmers in Jordan, monthly recurring expenditures were of more importance.
    CAPEX and OPEX cost metrics are shown in Table 5, Table 6, respectively. Table

    results from this system cost comparison are shown in Table 7. As expected, all
    EDR scenarios perform better than RO in terms of OPEX, namely energy costs. This
    energy savings leads to a smaller LCOW compared to Grid-RO despite the stark difference
    in capital investment. LCOW is the lowest for TV-PV-EDR. The initial investment
    of a solar system leads to lower lifetime cost compared to paying for grid electricity
    each month. Battery-PV-EDR, though having a smaller LCOW than Grid-EDR, has a
    greater LCOW than TV-PV-EDR because of the cost associated with purchasing a large
    energy buffer. However, as mentioned before this cost could go down by incorporating
    time-variant operation in a system with batteries to decrease the overall size
    of the batteries. The SEC of each EDR case is less than that of Grid-RO with TV-PV-EDR
    having the lowest SEC out of the three EDR cases. This is because of the nonlinear
    relationship between available power and flow rate shown in Fig. 3. While operating
    the system at higher flow rates does increase the SEC, operation at lower flow
    rates greatly decreases SEC. Table 7. Cost comparison results for TV-PV-EDR, Battery-PV-EDR,
    Grid-EDR, and Grid-RO systems. TV-PV-EDR is found to have the lowest LCOW while
    Grid-RO has the lowest capital cost. TV-PV-EDR also has a lower SEC than all other
    cases. Empty Cell TV-PV-EDR Battery-PV-EDR Grid-EDR Grid-RO CAPEX [$] $215,361

    and OPEX compared to each of the other scenarios. Each of the EDR cases does have
    a high capital cost associated with it compared to Grid-RO, but the energy savings
    associated with EDR make it less expensive over its lifetime than Grid-RO. 5.
    Discussion The need for energy- and water-efficient desalination was found through
    market research in MENA and interviews in Jordan. These interviews led to insights
    into the factors that influence economic feasibility of small-scale brackish water
    desalination for agriculture applications. Design requirements for an improved
    desalination system were derived based on this market research. An important insight
    elucidated from field work in Jordan is that farmers are much more sensitive to
    operating costs than capital costs. This insight motivates EDR as the opportune
    desalination process for agriculture applications because of its energy savings
    compared to RO for low feed salinities. EDR was presented as the ideal desalination
    process to satisfy the derived design requirements. For PV-EDR systems, a novel
    time-variant operational scheme was presented that allows EDR to operate at variable
    flow rate and salinity depending on available power in order to better capture
    the available solar energy throughout a day. TV-PV-EDR facilitates cost and energy
    savings in both the EDR system and power system compared to solar-powered systems
    operating at constant power. For irrigation, TV-PV-EDR can be implemented with
    large water reservoirs acting as energy buffers. This allows for water produced
    at variable salinities throughout a day to be adequately mixed during storage
    before being sent to the crops. Current irrigation practices in MENA already include
    the use of large water reservoirs, so this architecture would pose minimal change
    to current practices. The integration of desalination and drip irrigation also
    presents an additional area of energy and water savings. Crop water demand is
    dependent on crop evapotranspiration, a parameter calculated by solar irradiance
    amongst other things. Since the production rate of TV-PV-EDR is also closely related
    to solar irradiance, it can be closely tailored to crop water demand. To account
    for daily differences in water production and crop water demand, an energy buffer
    is needed, which can be in the form of the water reservoirs discussed earlier.
    It was found through a theoretical techno-economic analysis that the lifetime
    cost of TV-PV-EDR is less than alternatives including benchmark RO systems found
    in Jordan. Energy and operating costs of a TV-PV-EDR system are smaller compared
    to RO because of its increased energy efficiency in addition to cost savings from
    investing in solar energy. The capital cost of EDR was found to be more than that
    of benchmark RO systems; however, farmers emphasized a much stronger sensitivity
    to operating costs than capital cost. These results show that farmers can gain
    significant cost savings by switching to EDR even if they continue to operate
    it with grid electricity. Further cost savings are seen when implementing solar
    power. It is possible that even more cost savings might be achieved by implementing
    time-variant theory in a solar-powered system with batteries. Operating in a time-variant
    mode with batteries would allow the system to gain benefits from both time-variance
    and batteries. Implementing batteries would allow the system to operate at more
    efficient operating points as it could operate at lower power throughout a longer
    period of the day. Implementing time-variant theory would then decrease the necessary
    size of those batteries. Future work will include determining whether or not the
    benefits of such a configuration outweigh the added complexity and maintenance
    requirements. Additionally, many farms employing solar systems often have grid
    electricity access as well. This could present an opportune operational strategy
    wherein a TV-PV-EDR scheme operates during daylight hours while a Grid-EDR scheme
    operates at night in order to maximize water production. This could then be compared
    to a Grid-RO system that operates for 24 h each day. This work adds value to the
    academic community by elucidating the conditions under which desalination for
    irrigation can be economically feasible in addition to developing time-variant
    theory that can allow for continuous EDR to operate with solar energy more effectively.
    Practically, this study presents the baseline engineering design principles to
    enable engineers to choose appropriate subsystems and conduct further design optimizations
    for more specific case studies and system architectures. It also sets the foundation
    for future pilot systems to be designed and tested. This novel TV-PV-EDR operational
    scheme addresses the energy and water challenges faced by farmers in MENA. Utilizing
    desalinated water for irrigation increases crop yields and promotes soil health
    and longevity. Operating PV-EDR in a time-variant manner allows for effective
    use of solar energy for desalination. This decreases the energy cost and environmental
    impact of using grid energy for desalination. Time-variant PV-EDR makes small-scale,
    high recovery desalination more accessible to farmers, which can boost local economies
    and strengthen the agriculture sector over time. Future work could include piloting
    a time-variant PV-EDR system in Jordan. To this end, the time-variant theory discussed
    here would be formulated into a controller that can be tested experimentally with
    lab-scale systems. Design optimizations would be run with this control theory
    to evaluate system cost and performance to a higher fidelity. Further benefit
    can be added by employing ion-selective membranes with EDR. Monovalent ions such
    as and , which are harmful to plant growth, can be removed while divalent ions
    that are essential to healthy plant growth such , , and can remain. These membranes
    tend to be more expensive, so a tradeoff exists. Limitations of this theoretical
    study include the use of a specific case study in Jordan. Though many of these
    results can be generalized to MENA and other areas of the world, similar steps
    should be taken when designing systems for specific contexts. This study also
    assumes that the main drivers of desalination system cost are membranes, pumps,
    solar systems, batteries, and energy costs. Future studies could focus on performing
    a more in-depth cost analysis of EDR for this context. Additionally, this techno-economic
    analysis was performed assuming a single water chemistry. In reality, different
    sources of water have different contaminants and may require more or less pre-
    and post-treatment depending on the contaminants. Water testing will always be
    important to determine the suitability of EDR or other treatment options. For
    example, dealing with different ions or elevated salinity levels may require more
    acid dosing in a system to prevent scaling and fouling of membranes, which may
    negatively impact water recovery or performance. This study assumes that complications
    from additional contaminants would be similar for both EDR and conventional systems
    such as RO; therefore, the authors decided that considering a single water chemistry
    was sufficient for this comparative analysis. However, additional analyses should
    be performed for case studies where water salinity is higher. An EDR system would
    require more energy input and more membranes to handle added salinity. There may
    be a point where the benefits of EDR do not outweigh the added cost for treating
    high salinity feed streams. Another important aspect of a real-world system is
    the handling of waste streams. The EDR system would need a dedicated brine management
    system designed to process this waste stream. 6. Conclusions This paper defines
    design requirements for a desalination system for agriculture applications. From
    market research in MENA and field work in Jordan, it was determined that EDR best
    meets the needs of farmers because of its energy savings, high water recovery,
    ability to tune water chemistry to meet crop needs, and ability to effectively
    operate using solar energy. PV-EDR systems can take advantage of time-variant
    operational theory wherein variable flow rate is commanded based on the available
    solar irradiance such that desalination production can better match the solar
    irradiance profile throughout a day, leading to power system cost savings. Each
    of these considerations leads to cost and energy savings when implementing TV-PV-EDR
    over current systems. This work provides value to the academic community by elucidating
    the design requirements for desalination for agriculture as well as developing
    time-variant operational theory for low-cost, low-energy desalination. Practically,
    this work provides insight for engineers to be able to design desalination systems
    for agriculture. This work also addresses the needs of farmers in MENA by providing
    low-energy solutions for producing desalinated water for irrigation, promoting
    crop yield and soil health. CRediT authorship contribution statement Jacob N.

  description: Identification of efficient rice growing regions in terms of carbon
    and energy consumption per unit area of cultivation is need of the hour to develop
    an appropriate strategy for achieving higher productivity. In the present study,
    we assessed the different inputs utilization pattern to know their contribution
    towards carbon and energy input for rice cultivation in different districts of
    Karnataka, an Indian state. Details on the input's consumption pattern, viz.,
    fertilizers, chemicals, seeds, irrigation, labour, machinery, fuel etc., were
    collected prior to the study and quantified respective input and output data for
    all districts. Further with input and output data, different carbon and energy
    indices were worked out individually for each district. Overall, Karnataka has
    shown a carbon sustainability index (CSI) and carbon efficiency ratio (CER) of
    1.94 and 2.94, respectively, with methane (48%) and fertilizers (23%) being significant
    contributors to the carbon input. Out of 30 districts, 17 districts have shown
    higher (1.94–3.40 and 2.94 to 4.40) and 13 districts have shown lower (−0.21 to
    1.92 and 0.79 to 2.92) CSI and CER, respectively than the state average with highest
    in Bangalore urban followed by Chamarajanagara. With respect to energy budgeting,
    the average energy use efficiency, energy profitability, nutrient energy ratio
    and human energy profitability in Karnataka ranged from 0.54 to 3.36, −0.46 to
    2.36, 1.8 to 12.9 and 14.4 to 114.2, respectively. Indirect (69%) and non-renewable
    energy (61%) sources were identified as major energy inputs to the total input
    energy in rice cultivation. However, Bidar, Dharwad and Haveri were found most
    carbon and energy inefficient districts in the state. Among the regions, coastal
    Karnataka followed by south interior Karnataka were identified as more efficient
    regions both in terms of carbon and energy. Thus, our research aids policymakers
    in developing region/district specific carbon and energy efficient management
    practices for increasing rice productivity while maximising the use of limited
    resources.

    Highlights • Methane (48%) and fertilizers (23%) were identified as major carbon
    input contributors. • Average direct and indirect energy consumption was 31% and
    69%, respectively. • Irrigation water > fertilizers > electricity was accounted
    major input energy share in rice cultivation. • Non-renewable energy consumption
    (61%) was found higher than renewable energy (39%). Abstract Identification of

    during the recent past because of its disastrous nature posing havoc to various
    forms of life across the globe. Greenhouse gases (GHG) are vital contributors
    to climate change, and agricultural production activities account for 10–14% of
    GHG emissions [1,2]. In India, agriculture is one of the significant contributors
    to the national economy with, cultivable land of 56% in rainfed agriculture and
    75% in arid and semi-arid regions [3,4]. Due to diverse agricultural activities,
    methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), and nitrous oxide (N2O) have evolved as major
    GHGs, contributing 19% of the total GHG emission in India [5]. In agriculture,
    after enteric fermentation (40%), livestock manure management (23%), and fertilizer
    use (13%), rice cultivation is the fourth major contributor of GHG emissions in
    India and emits 97 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent every year
    [6]. Rice is an essential staple food crop in India and the rest of the world,
    as it feeds more than half of the world''s population, with China and India being
    the two major rice producers. Next to China, India is the world''s largest rice-growing
    country, accounting for roughly 22% of total worldwide rice production (approximately
    504.74 million metric tons of milled rice in 2020 as per FAOSTAT), with 44% of
    rice area planted using the puddled transplanting method [7]. To feed the world''s
    growing population, rice production must increase to at least 555 million tonnes
    (milled rice) by 2035 [8,9]. Puddled transplanted rice (PTR) is one of the crop
    establishment techniques of rice in Asia in which rice seedlings grown in the
    nursery are pulled and transplanted into puddled and levelled main fields 15–40
    days after seeding either manually or by machine [10]. Puddling consumes about
    30% of water in PTR system, adding a significant amount of irrigation water energy
    to the total input energy and rendering the system inefficient [11]. Groundwater
    depletion due to climate change and rising labour wages as a result of labour
    scarcity are posing a severe menace to PTR system''s long-term productivity. Rice
    fields subjected to continuous submergence were the potential source of methane
    emission as constant flooding and organic manures are the prime methane emission
    sources [12]. Thus, PTR is considered energy intensive and more GHG emissive crop
    than other cultivating crops. The PTR system mainly relies on indirect and non-renewable
    energy sources for attaining higher productivity (viz., fertilizers, machinery,
    chemicals, irrigation, seed, fuel and electricity) [13]. Indirect energy and non-renewable
    energy sources consumption was 87% and 92.4%, respectively in the PTR system in
    Karnataka, India, in 2019 [14]. AghaAlikhani et al. [15] and Ashraf et al. [16]
    also reported major consumption of indirect (54.9%) and non-renewable (93%) energy
    sources at Mazandaran province of Iran and Punjab region of Pakistan, respectively
    in rice cultivation. Excessive use of irrigation water, chemical fertilisers,
    and pesticides, on the other hand, has a negative influence on the environment
    due to the emission of harmful greenhouse gases besides other environmental impacts
    viz., ecosystem and human toxicity, water depletion, contamination etc [17,18].
    Indiscriminate use of these inputs particularly nitrogen fertilizers for rice
    cultivation was earlier reported in many districts of Karnataka [[19], [20], [21],
    [22]]. Decreased rice yield by 38% along with nutrient imbalance and soil salinity
    was also reported due to erratic use of chemical fertilizers [8,23,24]. Higher
    input consumption particularly, chemical fertilizers and irrigation water, was
    reported in rice cultivation in Australia [25], Pakistan [16], India [26], China
    [27] and Sub-Saharan Africa [28]. Due to improper utilization of these components,
    rice has become more carbon emissive and energy inefficient. Many studies have
    witnessed higher carbon emission [[29], [30], [31], [32]] and energy consumption
    [[33], [34], [35]] in rice than other field crops in India and abroad. In this
    background, Carbon emissions and energy utilization assessment for different inputs
    in rice cultivation will help to identify the inputs which are economical and
    effective in terms of carbon and energy. Water saving technologies alone have
    reduced the overall carbon dioxide equivalent emissions by 18.6% from the rice
    fields [36]. Thus, evaluating different areas using carbon and energy indicators
    will help to conserve the non-renewable energy resources that are scarce in nature
    [37]. Also, microlevel carbon emission and energy flow assessment in rice agroecosystem
    will help the policymakers and planners to develop area specific carbon and energy
    efficient strategies for productive rice cultivation under changing climate. However,
    district level carbon dioxide equivalent emission and energy consumption pattern
    per unit area of rice cultivation in India was not assessed so far. At this juncture,
    the current study examines the sustainability and efficiency of rice cultivation
    in terms of carbon and energy at a district level in India by taking Karnataka
    as an example. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Study details In the present study
    (Fig. 1), carbon footprint and energy assessment were carried out for the different
    districts of Karnataka, an Indian state for the transplanted kharif (rainy season,
    June–October) rice crop for the year 2018–19. The data on area, production, and
    productivity of rice for the year 2018–19 was obtained from the Crop Production
    Statistics Information System, Special Data Dissemination Standard Division, Directorate
    of Economics and Statistics, Ministry of Farmers Welfare, Government of India,
    New Delhi. The total biomass production was worked out with the published data
    on harvest index and root to shoot ratio of rice crop [38]. The agronomic yield
    was divided by the harvest index (0.4) to obtain the biological yield (grain +
    straw) and then biological yield was multiplied by the root to shoot ratio (0.2)
    to derive the total biomass of the crop. Later the total biomass from each district
    of Karnataka state was used to calculate the carbon as well as energy outputs
    of the crop. The emission factors and energy equivalents for the various inputs
    used in rice cultivation were derived from various authors'' pertinent literature
    and presented in Table 1, Table 2. The data on the unit quantity of different
    inputs considered in the carbon footprint and energy assessment of rice for the
    various districts of Karnataka were obtained from the cost of cultivation scheme,
    University of Agricultural and Horticultural Sciences, Shivamogga. Through face-to-face
    survey data was collected from 30 farmers comprising small, marginal and large
    farmers in each district over the course of the season by conducting numerous
    field visits [39]. Download : Download high-res image (886KB) Download : Download

    of transplanted rice for kharif season was assessed by calculating the greenhouse
    gas emission from each input component viz., fertilizers, farm yard manure (FYM),
    methane, diesel, pesticides, irrigation for the different districts according
    to the procedure outlined by Ref. [54]. In the present study, the carbon footprint
    is the total amount of GHGs emitted from the crop cultivation process in addition
    to farm operations and agronomic inputs involved in the rice cultivation, expressed
    in carbon equivalent (CE) units (kg-CE ha−1) [7]. As per the definition, methane
    is included as an additional greenhouse gas factors [12,29,32] as rice fields
    are accountable for about 30% of agricultural methane emissions in the world [55].
    The total CE emissions from the individual input component are determined by multiplying
    its unit quantity with emission factor and computed on a hectare basis (Table
    1). Different input and output components considered in the study are presented

    The influx energy of rice cultivation for different districts of Karnataka was
    estimated using different farm operations and crop yield components (Fig. 2).
    The unit quantity of inputs and outputs were converted into their equivalent energies
    with suitable co-efficient factors (Table 2). The following energy indices were
    computed using input and output energy data to compare the efficiency of rice
    in converting input energy into output energy in different districts [56]. (7)

    3.1. Productivity, carbon input and carbon output The estimated carbon input and
    output along with the productivity of rice in different districts of Karnataka
    is depicted in Table 3. The wide variation in the productivity of the rice across
    the different districts of the state has been noticed with the lowest yield of
    720 kg ha−1 in Bidar district to the highest yield of 4043 kg ha−1 in Ballari
    district. The variation in the adoption of different crop management practices
    and amount of inputs utilization was the reason for the wide variation in productivity
    across the state. On the other hand, around 44% of the total rice growing area
    is under irrigated condition while the remaining area falls under the monsoon
    regime [57]. Among the different regions, south interior Karnataka (SIK) have
    shown 2.9% and 13.3% higher productivity over coastal Karnataka (CK) and north
    interior Karnataka (NIK), respectively. The lower average productivity of NIK
    is mainly attributed to the substantially lower productivity of the Bidar, Dharwad
    and Haveri districts. Table 3. Carbon input, carbon output and carbon indices

    Carbon sustainability index; CER- Carbon efficiency ratio; CI- Carbon intensity;
    CEF- Carbon efficiency. With respect to carbon input, a higher amount of carbon
    equivalents per unit area of rice cultivation was recorded in Raichur district
    (1532 kg-CE ha−1), which was closely followed by Ballari and Koppal districts
    with each of 1368 kg-CE ha−1. Carbon equivalent inputs utilization was 42% and
    27% higher in these districts as compared to state average carbon input (1081
    kg-CE ha−1). Excess consumption of fertilizers, pesticides, and fuel by 129%,
    32% and 140%, respectively over state average resulted in higher carbon input
    in Raichur district over others. Increasing the nitrogen dose from 225 to 300
    kg ha−1 resulted in increased greenhouse gas emissions and subsequent carbon input
    in summer corn in the north China plain [58]. About 100% excessive use of fertilizers
    and more than 50% excess application of insecticides and fungicides than the recommended
    dose for rice cultivation was noticed in the Tungabhadra project area which includes
    the districts viz., Raichur, Koppal and Bellary [19]. Overuse of chemical fertilizers
    by the farmers in the Tungabhadra project command area of Karnataka was also reported
    by Refs. [20,21]. Contrastingly, Dakshina Kannada, Udupi and Uttara Kannada districts
    have shown lower carbon input with a magnitude of 17%, 17% and 21% lower, respectively
    over the state average. Almost 52% reduced fertilizer usage each in Dakshina Kannada,
    Udupi and 70% in Uttara Kannada along with 37% lower fuel consumption together
    contributed lower carbon input in these districts. Lower fertilizer application
    by the farmers over recommended dose in Uttara Kannada district was also revealed
    by Ref. [59]. Similarly, the maximum amount of inputs used in NIK resulted in
    higher carbon input (1181 kg-CE ha−1) followed by SIK (1040 kg-CE ha−1) while
    the lowest amount is observed in CK (885 kg-CE ha−1). Carbon input of 1078.6 kg
    ha−1 under transplanted rice and 156.6 kg ha−1 under direct seeded rice was earlier
    reported at Siruguppa Taluka in the Ballari district and Gonikoppal Taluka in
    the Kodagu district of Karnataka [14]. CO2 equivalent carbon input of 5879.7 kg-CO2
    ha−1 was noticed under conventional aerobic flood irrigation in wetlands of Tamil
    Nadu [60]. However, an average carbon input of 1081 kg-CE ha−1 was recorded in
    Karnataka. Because of methane emission, rice grown under flooded situation registered
    a higher carbon footprint (4.09 t-CE ha−1), which was followed by rainfed rice
    than other crops in Karnataka [61]. The quantity of carbon output through biological
    and grain yield of crop ranged from 864 to 4852 kg-CE ha−1 in Bidar to Ballari
    districts with the state average of 3139 kg-CE ha−1. Overall, 17 districts produced
    more carbon than the state average, while 13 districts produced less than the
    state average. However, among the three regions, SIK (3303 kg-CE ha−1) has shown
    higher carbon output followed by CK (3211 kg-CE ha−1) with least in NIK (2916
    kg-CE ha−1). Irrespective of the regions and districts, higher carbon output was
    mainly attributed to the higher productivity of rice as carbon output was determined
    by the total biomass yield of the crop in that area [14]. quantified the carbon
    output of 4592.7 kg ha−1 in transplanted rice at Ballari and Kodagu districts
    of Karnataka. Amount of carbon input (2619 and 2613 kg ha−1) and carbon output
    (4153 and 4417 kg ha−1) under manually transplanted and mechanically transplanted
    rice, respectively was reported by Ref. [7]. 3.2. Contribution (%) of components
    to carbon input Overall, methane (45%) is the most significant source of carbon
    input in Karnataka, followed by fertilizers (23%) used in rice cultivation. On
    the other hand, pesticides, diesel, and FYM are the least significant contributors,
    accounting for 4%, 6%, and 6%, respectively (Fig. 3). In the same way, irrigation
    contributed 12% to rice cultivation''s carbon input. Continuous submergence, excess
    fertilizers usage and extensive mechanization are principal factors for higher
    greenhouse gas emissions in transplanted rice [62]. In Punjab, methane contributions
    of 16.48% due to submergence and 22.12% due to fertilizers towards carbon footprint
    were reported in rice, whereas fertilizer contributions alone were 66.84% in wheat
    [63]. Download : Download high-res image (276KB) Download : Download full-size

    of rice. Variation in the contribution of different input components towards total
    carbon input was noticed across the different districts of the state. Contribution
    of methane, fertilizers, irrigation, fuel, pesticides and FYM was ranged from
    34 to 58%, 9–39%, 9–16%, 4–11%, 1–9% and 5–8%, respectively (Fig. 4). On-farm
    methane emissions accounted for 86% of the total emissions, followed by nitrogen
    (6%), diesel (3.9%), and machinery (1.3%) under PTR in Ballari and Kodagu districts
    [14]. The highest methane-based carbon dioxide equivalent emissions of about 57%
    followed by farm operations-based carbon dioxide emissions (39%) also reported
    under PTR at Modipuram, Meerut, India [7]. Except in Raichur (34%), Ballari (38%)
    and Koppal (38%), in all the districts contribution of methane towards carbon
    input was more than 40%. The higher contribution of fertilizers by 39%, 38% and
    38%, respectively has reduced the methane contribution in those districts when
    compared to other districts. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download

    to carbon input under different districts of Karnataka. The contribution of fertilizers
    was ranged from 20 to 40% in 19 districts and 10–20% in 10 districts. However,
    in Uttara Kannada district it was just 9%. Less application of fertilizers in
    Uttara Kannada district has resulted in a lower contribution towards carbon input.
    Among the regions, CK had the highest percentage of carbon equivalent emission
    from methane (56%) and irrigation (15%), whereas, contribution from fertilizers
    was highest in NIK (28%) followed by SIK (21%). Continuous flooding of rice fields
    promotes methanogenesis and further leads to higher methane emissions. This might
    be the reason for the higher contribution from methane to total carbon input in
    CK. 3.3. Carbon indices The carbon sustainability index depicts the efficient
    utilization of unit quantity of carbon input through a higher amount of carbon
    output. Karnataka was found as a carbon efficient state towards rice cultivation
    with an average CSI of 1.94 and CER of 2.94 (Fig. 5). Among the different districts,
    Bengaluru urban (3.40 and 4.40) followed by Chamarajanagara (3.27 and 4.27) and
    Dakshina Kannada (2.99 and 3.99) districts were found more carbon efficient districts
    with higher CSI and CER values than others because of their higher carbon output
    per unit quantity of carbon input in rice cultivation. On the other hand, lower
    CSI (−0.21 and 0.01) and lower CER (0.79 and 1.01) of Bidar and Dharwad districts
    have indicated that they are more carbon inefficient districts in rice cultivation
    (Table 3). The lower productivity was the prime reason for the lower CSI of rice
    in the Bidar and Dharwad districts. With respect to the regions, CK and SIK found
    1.8 and 1.5 times more carbon efficient regions than NIK. CSI and CER of 3.3 and
    4.3, respectively under transplanted rice were earlier noticed by Ref. [14] at
    Ballari and Kodagu districts of Karnataka. Download : Download high-res image
    (382KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Box and Whisker plot of overall
    carbon indices of rice cultivation in Karnataka. On average in Karnataka, 0.48
    kg-CE have been utilized to produce a one kg grain yield of the crop. Similarly,
    Karnataka has shown a CEF (carbon efficiency) of 2.45 kg kg-CE−1 which indicates
    that per one kg of carbon equivalent 2.45 kg of rice grain yield was produced
    (Fig. 5). Out of 30 districts, 28 districts have shown lower CI (carbon intensity)
    values and it was ranged from 0.27 to 0.85 kg-CE kg−1. However, Bidar and Dharwad
    districts have been observed as the carbon intensive districts with CI values
    of 1.52 and 1.19 kg-CE kg−1, respectively (Table 3). Similarly, with the same
    two districts lower CEF values (<1 kg kg-CE−1) were also noticed and that was
    lower than the state average value of CEF (2.45 kg kg-CE−1). In the remaining
    27 districts, 16 districts viz., Hassan, Tumkur, Vijayapura, Bagalkote, Mysore,
    Kodagu, Bengaluru rural, Kalaburagi, Davanagere, Mandya, Chickballapur, Udupi,
    Ballari, Dakshina Kannada, Chamarajanagara and Bengaluru urban have shown higher
    CEF (>2.50 kg kg-CE−1) and lower CI (<0.40 kg-CE kg−1), which indicates that in
    these districts the added inputs are effectively utilized and assimilated by the
    crop than other districts. Improper use of added inputs will result in lower CE
    due to increased greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere [64]. CSI, CER and
    CI (kg-CE kg−1 grain) of 0.59, 1.58 and 1.82, respectively in manually transplanted
    rice crop was also reported at Modipuram in Uttar Pradesh [7]. About, 1.2–1.5
    carbon emissions per unit yield (kg-CE kg−1) was noticed and reported in rice
    across India [65]. Rice was identified as the most carbon intensive crop than
    other crops with crop intensity values of 0.118 t-CE t−1 in India [29]. Among
    the regions, NIK was 1.8 and 1.6 times more carbon intensive than CK and SIK,
    respectively. CK and SIK, on the other hand, were found to be 1.5 and 1.3 times
    more efficient in carbon utilization in terms of CEF than NIK. It was primarily
    attributed to greater carbon equivalent inputs (25% and 14%, respectively) and
    lower carbon output (10% and 13%, respectively) per unit area of rice cultivation
    in NIK than the other two regions. 3.4. Energy input and output The quantity of
    energy input and output for PTR in each district was calculated and shown in Table
    4. In Karnataka, 1 ha of rice cultivation consumes on an average of 43,026 MJ
    of energy, with irrigation (29%) accounting major share of the input energy, followed
    by fertilizers (26%), electricity (15%), and diesel (12%). On the other hand,
    chemicals (2%), machinery (3%), human labour (4%), and FYM (7%) made a smaller
    contribution to the total input energy (Fig. 6). Overuse of water for puddling,
    nursery management and maintaining the submergence conditions throughout the crop
    duration might have resulted in higher energy in terms of irrigation in transplanted
    rice. The excess use of major chemical fertilizers (NPK) than recommended dose
    resulted in higher energy in terms of fertilizers. Saturation with irrigation
    water and conventional method of nitrogen application in rice cultivation resulted
    in lower energy use efficiency (EUE), energy productivity (EP) and net energy
    (NE) because of higher input energy than irrigation at 3 days after the disappearance
    of ponded water and leaf colour chart-based nitrogen application [66]. Irrigation
    alone accounted for 39% of energy input followed by chemical fertilizers (36%),
    however, machinery (2%), seeds (3%), FYM (4%), Labour (4%), pesticides (4%) and
    diesel (8%) were identified as the least contributors in PTR in Bellary and Kodagu
    Districts of Karnataka, India [14]. Studies conducted in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab
    also reported irrigation and fertilizer as major energy sinks in transplanted
    rice systems [7,67,68]. Contrastingly, a study conducted at Tripura in India revealed
    that, fertilizers (44–54%) as a major contributor irrespective of the rice-fallow
    cropping system. Also mentioned that they have accounted for zero energy from
    irrigation, as crop received a sufficient amount of rainfall during the crop growing
    seasons [69]. Earlier studies in the Philippines, Guilan province of Iran and
    western Pakistan reported 44%, 36% and 43%, share of chemical fertilizers to the
    total energy input in rice production, respectively [[70], [71], [72]]. Table

    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Overall energy share (%) of different
    inputs of rice cultivation in Karnataka. Rice cultivation in Uttara Kannada and
    Raichur consumed the least (31,636 MJ ha−1) and most (60,518 MJ ha−1) total input
    energy, respectively, across the districts. Higher use of fertilizers, chemicals,
    machinery, fuel, and labour in Raichur district than state average consumption
    led in a 126%, 148%, 34%, 28%, and 11%, increase in energy input from these components
    respectively, resulting in higher input energy per unit area of rice cultivation.
    Similarly, in the Uttara Kannada district, lower energy per unit area was mostly
    due to reduced use of the above-mentioned components, which resulted in reduced
    energy contributions by 69%, 8%, 38%, 39% and 42% respectively, to the total energy.
    Among the regions, higher fertilizer use in NIK has led to nearly 43% and 12%
    increase in input energy over CK and SIK, respectively. Significant fluctuation
    in energy output was observed between the districts due to variations in total
    biomass yield. The energy output was ranged from 24,791 MJ ha−1 in the Bidar district
    of NIK to 139,288 MJ ha−1 in the Ballari district of NIK. The lower grain yield
    in Bidar by 462% over Ballari has resulted in lower output energy. Out of 30 districts,
    18 have higher and 12 have lower energy output than the state average (90,827
    MJ ha−1). NIK has resulted in lower output energy by 11% over SIK and 8% over
    CK due to lower grain yield of the region by 11% and 8%, respectively. Variation
    in energy input and equivalent rice yield will result huge difference in energy
    balance in wetland rice cultivation [33]. Higher estimated energy input and output
    were recorded for PTR (35,605 and 1,55,776 MJ ha−1) than direct seeded rice (7,823
    and 53,227 MJ ha−1), respectively [14]. The total energy input of 61,204.13 MJ
    ha−1 and output of 24,2012.95 MJ ha−1 was earlier revealed in rice cultivation
    at Moga district of central Punjab [68]. Further, higher total input and output
    energy by 46% and 49% than wheat were earlier reported in the rice-wheat cropping
    system at Indo-Gangetic Plains of India [34]. 3.5. Energy indices To identify
    the most efficient energy use district in rice production, several energy indices
    were calculated for each district and presented in Table 4. Higher values of energy
    indices such as EUE, EP, NE, energy profitability, nutrient energy ratio (NER)
    and human energy profitability (HEP) in CK followed by SIK indicated efficient
    input utilization and a lesser amount of energy requirement for the unit quantity
    of output production than NIK. Overall, in Karnataka, the range of EUE, EP, NE,
    energy profitability, NER and HEP was 0.54–3.36, 0.016–0.098 kg MJ−1, -21082 to
    89,820 MJ ha−1, -0.46 to 2.36, 1.8 to 12.9 and 14.6 to 114.1, respectively (Fig.
    7). Download : Download high-res image (485KB) Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 7. Box and Whisker plot of overall energy indices for rice cultivation in
    Karnataka. The majority of districts in the state have greater EUE and EP for
    rice cultivation. However, lower EUE in Bidar (0.54), Dharwad (0.77) and Haveri
    (0.97) districts has resulted in lower EP (0.016, 0.022 and 0.028 kg MJ−1, respectively)
    over other districts. The lower productivity in terms of grain yield has resulted
    in decreased energy output and thus, lower EUE and EP in those districts. However,
    all the other districts have shown EUE values of more than 1. Lower EUE and EP
    indicate that there is a scope for the betterment of energy productivity in PTR
    under different districts of Karnataka. On the other hand, Chamarajanagara, Udupi,
    Dakshina Kannada and Bengaluru Urban were identified as more efficient rice growing
    districts with EUE of >3 and EP of >0.085 kg MJ−1. This was primarily due to reduced
    input energy contributing components and majorly due to higher energy output under
    those districts. Similarly, there was a substantial difference in net energy throughout
    the districts. All the districts have shown positive net energy except Bidar (−21082
    MJ ha−1), Dharwad (−9357 MJ ha−1) and Haveri (−1592 MJ ha−1) in which negative
    net energy was observed. Generally, an increase or decrease in the net energy
    is mainly determined by variation in the total output energy. Positive net energy
    districts indicate that energy can be saved in these areas. In contrast to EUE,
    EP and NE, higher SP was noticed in Bidar district (63.7 MJ kg−1) followed by
    Dharwad (44.7 MJ kg−1) and Haveri (35.6 MJ kg−1) than other districts, which clearly
    indicates that a higher amount of energy being used to produce a unit quantity
    of rice in these districts. Because of efficient utilization of inputs and considerably
    higher grain yield, Bengaluru Urban followed by Dakshina Kannada districts have
    resulted in lower specific productivity (10.2 and 11.2 MJ kg−1, respectively).
    Relatively higher EUE, EP, NE by 83%, 91%, 279%, respectively and lower SE by
    136% than our present results obtained for Karnataka was earlier reported in Punjab
    for rice production [68]. Similarly, higher energy efficiency (7.3) and EP (0.3
    kg MJ−1) were estimated in direct seeded rice than PTR (4.4 and 0.2 kg MJ−1) in
    the Ballari and Kodagu districts of Karnataka [14]. Reduced energy inputs in direct
    seeded rice cultivation were the primary reason for higher energy productivity.
    At the Indian institute of rice research Hyderabad, higher net energy by 6.02%,
    EUE by 9.45% and EP by 9.66% in the conventional system of rice intensification
    (SRI) method resulted from higher grain and straw yields than the mechanized system
    of rice intensification (MSRI) [66]. Lower economic yield, rice equivalent yield
    and subsequent higher energy input led to lower EP in rice-maize (0.27 kg MJ−1)
    and rice-green gram/blackgram (0.28 kg MJ−1) systems than rice-vegetable pea system
    (0.58 kg MJ−1) at Tripura, India [69]. Almost closure values of EUE (2.37) and
    SP (12.84 MJ kg−1) to our present state average results was earlier reported under
    transplanted rice production system in Chhattisgarh, India [73]. The profitability
    of rice cultivation was also assessed in terms of energy, nutrients, and human
    labour as shown in Table 5. Among the regions, CK outperformed NIK in terms of
    energy profitability, NER, and HEP by 117%, 148%, and 84%, respectively, whereas
    SIK outperformed NIK by 55%, 52%, and 11.2%, respectively. The key causes for
    better energy profitability, NER, and HEP in CK are lower input energy, higher
    productivity per unit quantity of fertilizers, and fewer human laborers per unit
    area of rice production. Table 5. Profitability and energy sources of rice cultivation

    13,320 29,706 16,802 26,224 63.0 Within the districts, higher energy profitability
    was noticed in Bengaluru Urban (2.36) followed by Dakshina Kannada (2.09), Udupi
    (2.03) and Chamarajanagara (2.03). This was mainly due to higher net energy per
    unit area of rice cultivation in these districts. Also, owing to a variable rate
    of input utilization viz., labour, fertilizers, machinery, pesticides led to reduced
    input energy and thereby higher energy profitability. In our present study, we
    have also observed higher NER (12.9 and 12.7, respectively) in Dakshina Kannada
    and Udupi districts than other districts, attributing to a 79% lower energy contribution
    from fertilizers to the total nutrient energy output than the state average fertilizer
    contribution. Similarly, higher HEP was also observed in the Dakshina Kannada
    (114.2) and Udupi (112.2) districts, owing to a 73% reduced human labour consumption
    in these areas. The variable cost of the machine transplanter under MSRI and labour
    wages under the SRI method are reflected in their contribution to total input
    energy and thereby variation in energy productivity [66]. However, in Bidar, Dharwad,
    and Haveri districts, reduced energy output due to lower grain productivity resulted
    in negative energy profitability, lower NER, and lower HEP. Higher HEP (125.4)
    for transplanted rice than our current results were earlier reported at Uttara
    Pradesh in India [34]. However, in our study, it was ranged from 14.4 to 114.2
    across the districts. However, similar to our finding''s HEP values of 111 and
    98.7 were reported for PTR and direct seeded rice in Ballari and Kodagu districts
    of Karnataka [14]. 3.6. Energy sources Different input sources, such as direct,
    indirect, renewable, and non-renewable energies, were calculated to determine
    potential contributors to the total input energy of rice cultivation (Table 5).
    Direct energy sources contributed 31% of total input energy on average, while
    indirect energy sources contributed 69%. Electricity is identified as the major
    contributor of direct energy sources, accounting for 48%, followed by fuel (40%),
    and human labour (12%) (Fig. 8). Similarly, irrigation water (41%) and fertilizers
    (38%) were observed as major contributors to indirect energy (Fig. 9) [74]. They
    also reported irrigation and electricity as major contributors to the indirect
    and direct energy in rice cultivation. Similar to our results, in Bangladesh,
    lower and higher contribution from direct and indirect energy sources to the total
    energy in unpuddled transplanted wet season rice was also reported [33]. The declining
    trend of draft animal and human labour power usage in crop cultivation activities
    paved a way for mechanization in Indian agriculture. Thus, under these situations,
    the adoption of fossil fuel-driven agricultural implements leads to higher energy
    contribution from fuel to direct energy [75]. In contrast to our results, higher
    energy contribution from direct energy (65.8%) than indirect energy (34.2%) was
    reported in conventional rice crops at Bhopal, India [76]. Download : Download

    different components of indirect energy in rice cultivation. Among the different
    districts of the state, Shivamogga, Hassan, and Haveri (16,149 MJ ha−1) have the
    highest direct energy contribution to total input energy, which can be attributed
    to increased fuel consumption in these districts for various rice cultivation
    operations. However, 73% and 64% lower consumption of human labour and fuel than
    state average consumption, in Uttara Kannada, Dakshina Kannada, Udupi and Kodagu
    districts, the contribution of direct energy was lower to the total input energy.
    With respect to region, SIK had the highest contribution, followed by NIK and
    CK. Raichur district''s excessive usage of fertilizers and pesticides has resulted
    in a 59% greater indirect energy contribution for rice production than the state
    average, followed by Ballari (41%) and Koppal districts (41%). Uttara Kannada
    district, on the other hand, had a 41% lower indirect energy contribution than
    the state average due to decreased fertilizer consumption. Lower fertilizer usage
    by 47% in SIK and 235% in CK has resulted in lower indirect energy in both regions
    compared to NIK. Renewable and non-renewable energy sources contributed 39% and
    61%, respectively, to the total input energy of rice cultivation (Table 5). Irrigation
    and FYM were recognized as major renewable energy components, accounting for 73%
    and 18% of total renewable energy, respectively (Fig. 10). Fertilizers (43%) were
    identified as the most important non-renewable energy source, followed by electricity
    (25%), and fuel (20%). On the other hand, chemicals (3%), seeds (4%), and machinery
    (5%) were found to be modest contributors of non-renewable energy (Fig. 11). Download

    Substantially higher renewable energy consumption was seen in Chitradurga, Chikkamagaluru,
    Tumkur, and Davanagere districts (17,397 MJ ha−1 each), which was ascribed to
    a 38% higher human labour consumption in these districts than the state average.
    However, lesser renewable energy (16,144 MJ ha−1) was seen in Uttara Kannada,
    Dakshina Kannada, Udupi, and Kodagu districts due to 73% reduced human labour
    consumption due to lower inputs use for rice production. Renewable energy contribution
    from all the regions towards total input energy was almost similar however, in
    SIK contribution was higher by 0.6% and 5% over NIK and CK, respectively. In terms
    of non-renewable energy consumption, Uttara Kannada district consumed less (69%)
    while Raichur district consumed more (66%) than other districts. Heavy fertilizer
    use, increased fuel consumption due to mechanization, and excessive pesticide
    use together contributed to higher non-renewable energy consumption in the Raichur
    district. Similarly, due to higher inputs usage in the region for rice cultivation,
    NIK consumed 20% and 80% more non-renewable energy than SIK and CK, respectively.
    Thus, across the regions and districts, rice production in Karnataka heavily relies
    on indirect and non-renewable energy inputs. Similar to our study, a higher contribution
    of non-renewable energy to total input energy in rice was earlier reported at
    Karnal and Jajjhar districts of Haryana (92.1%) [74] and at Punjab (91%) by Ref.
    [77]. Mechanization in rice cultivation leads to increased contribution from the
    non-renewable energy sources (83%) than renewable energy (17%) in transplanting
    rice in India [75]. The present results are in accordance with the earlier findings
    reported at different parts of the country viz., Uttar Pradesh, Goa, Indo-Gangetic
    plains of Patna and Allahabad, respectively [34,35,56]. Abroad, at Guilan province
    of Iran, similar kind of results was also revealed [71]. 3.7. Energy efficient
    practices for rice cultivation Rice cultivation in Karnataka majorly relies on
    indirect and non-renewable energy sources at the present situation. Mechanization
    in place of human and animal power makes a huge difference in total energy requirement
    and carbon emissive inputs consumption. Labour scarcity and increasing wages demand
    the adoption of farm machinery as it saves 15–20% time in field operation and
    production costs by reducing the inputs requirement [75]. However, mechanization
    led to heavy consumption of non-renewable energy sources like diesel fuel. Excessive
    use of fertilizers and pesticides than the recommended dose on the other hand
    made rice cultivation a more energy intensive crop. At this juncture, there is
    a need for energy efficient management practices for rice cultivation. Adoption
    of different energy efficient varieties, establishment methods, irrigation practices
    and farmers’ friendly renewable energy-based machinery will definitely lead rice
    to become an energy efficient crop. In place of transplanting rice, the adoption
    of dry direct seeded rice or wet direct seeded rice will reduce the input energy
    requirement through reduced tillage operations. A magnitude of 8–12% increase
    in energy productivity and 22–24% increase in energy output: input ratio was reported
    under unpuddled transplanted rice [33]. SRI method of establishment, irrigation
    at three days after the disappearance of ponded water and LCC based nitrogen application
    showed higher energy use efficiency and energy productivity [66]. [76] revealed
    higher EUE, EP and NE under SRI method of planting along with drip irrigation
    than the conventional method and SRI method alone. Higher energy profitability
    can also be realized by cultivating short and medium duration varieties instead
    of long duration varieties. Medium duration (145 days) rice cultivar Swarna showed
    higher energy profitability and net energy gain than short and long duration cultivars
    of Naveen and Gayatri at Cuttack in India [75]. Thus, the adoption of suitable
    management practices and agricultural tools is a way for achieving higher energy
    efficiency in rice cultivation. 4. Conclusions and policy implications Higher
    productivity of rice in Ballari district of NIK region resulted in substantially
    higher carbon output than other districts with a magnitude of 55% increase over
    the state average. However, 17–21% lower carbon input per unit area of rice cultivation
    was noticed in coastal Karnataka due to reduced inputs consumption. Methane (48%)
    followed by fertilizers (23%) were identified as the significant contributors
    of carbon input. On average Karnataka had CSI and CER of 1.94 and 2.94, respectively.
    In terms of CSI and CER, Bengaluru urban (3.40 and 4.40) followed by Chamarajanagara
    (3.27 and 4.27) and Dakshina Kannada (2.99 and 3.99) districts were identified
    as more carbon efficient districts. Conversely, Bidar, Dharwad and Haveri were
    found as carbon intensive districts in the state. Lesser inputs utilization in
    CK resulted in reduced input energy per unit area of rice cultivation with the
    lowest in Uttara Kannada district (31,636 MJ ha−1). However, higher productivity
    in Ballari led to higher energy output. Among the districts, Chamarajanagara,
    Udupi, Dakshina Kannada and Bengaluru Urban were identified as more efficient
    rice growing districts with EUE of >3, energy profitability of >2 and EP of >0.085
    kg MJ−1. All the districts have shown positive net energy and energy profitability
    except Bidar, Dharwad and Haveri in which negative net energy was observed indicating
    the need for efficient energy management practices in these districts. A 79% lower
    energy contribution from fertilizers and 73% reduced human labour consumption
    resulted in higher NER and HEP in Udupi and Dakshina Kannada districts in the
    state. Direct and indirect energy consumption was 31% and 69%, with electricity
    and irrigation water as major contributors, respectively. Similarly, the consumption
    of renewable and non-renewable energy sources was 39% and 61%, with irrigation
    water and fertilizers as a major source of energy, respectively. Even with the
    current values of carbon and energy indices, there is a wide scope for the improvement
    of rice cultivation in Karnataka. By adopting of carbon and energy efficient crop
    management practices along with the maximum inclusion of direct and renewable
    energy sources, rice cultivation can be made more carbon and energy efficient.
    Increasing the input use efficiency through suitable policy interventions, the
    input quantity can be curtailed for rice cultivation. As fertilizers identified
    as one of the major input components, creating awareness to the farmers on the
    nutrient use efficiency through improved agricultural practices like site-specific
    nutrient management, use of nutrient decision tools like a nutrient expert, leaf
    colour chart, chlorophyll meter, promotion of biofertilizers, nano-fertilizers,
    slow releasing fertilizers and legumes in the off-season will help to reduce the
    nutrient contribution to carbon and energy input. Micro-irrigation and fertigation
    should be made available to all farming communities through proper subsidy policies
    to further enhance the water and nutrient use efficiency as rice is a water intensive
    crop. To reduce the utilization of fossil fuels in agriculture, the development
    of renewable energy (solar energy, wind energy or biofuels) driven machinery is
    needed in rice cultivation. Suitable governmental policies/promoting schemes and
    subsidies on those machineries subsequently promote their development and practical
    utilization in agriculture. Authors credit statement Shankarappa Sridhara: Conceptualization,

    1 Introduction Energy consumption is on the rise with technological advancement
    across the globe. In India, most of its population lives in rural areas where
    there is no electrical connectivity that demotes their standard of living. The
    major reason for this lack of connectivity is, villages are located too far from
    the thermal power plants and their revenues do not make the project viable to
    supply electricity in distant rural places. Hence, the only way to provide them
    with better living conditions is through the installation of efficient and low-cost
    photovoltaic (PV) cells that are capable of powering light sources by converting
    solar energy to electrical energy. Solar power as an industry in India is developing
    fast. India’s solar installed capacity as of November 2020 was 36.9 GW [1]. With
    a target of 100 GW of solar capacity by 2022, India has already set up more than
    40 solar parks and provides adequate land area to solar plant upholders [2, 3].
    To reduce the land requirement for installation of solar panels, earlier researchers
    have proposed a solar tree [4] structure that addresses the issue of space constraints
    by installing PV modules on a pole with branches. It is required to acquire 10
    acres of land for harvesting 2 MW of energy from the sun. Installation of solar
    tree structure can produce the same amount of energy by acquiring only 1% of the
    entire area. In the solar tree, the PV modules are arranged in a spiralling phyllotaxy,
    which is inspired from the Fibonacci series observed in nature, thereby capturing
    solar radiation to generate maximum power. Various studies have taken inspiration
    from the nature to maximize the power output of a PV panel. A sunflower-based
    heliotropism [5] has been designed to track the position of the sun in the sky
    for absorbing more energy. Another study has developed nature-inspired evolutionary
    algorithm [6] by utilizing maximum power point tracker (MPPT) technique. Although
    the efficiency of the panel can be increased using MPPT technique, overall cost
    of the system increases which is difficult to afford in rural Indian context.
    To maximize the absorption capacity of solar cell, biomorphic design has been
    used by the earlier researchers [7,8,9,10,11]. The term biomorphism means life-form
    (biolife, morph-form) [12]. It is a method of creating objects by incorporating
    natural elements into the design that are reminiscent of natural and living organisms.
    Innovations inspired from the surface structure of certain natural organisms have
    helped in creating surface coatings that maximize light absorption and reduce
    reflection. Although these studies potentially contribute to the nature-inspired
    design to increase the efficiency of PV panel, it is important to note that nature-inspired
    design not only signifies taking inspiration from the nature, but it also includes
    certain features [11], such as Biomimicry, which is, emulating nature’s systems,
    models, or elements for more functional purposes like solving complex human problems
    [13]. Cradle to Cradle Design, which is a form of biomimicry, where product design
    is modelled on the processes of nature, where all resources are used efficiently
    in a cyclic way. Basically, treating garbage as an eternal resource, i.e. waste
    equals to food [14]. Circular Economy, which is a systemic approach to economic
    development aiming to eliminate waste by continual use of resources and following
    a restorative and regenerative form of design which helps in achieving growth
    without the consumption of non-renewable resources [15]. To incorporate the various
    features of biomorphism, this study aims to reduce ecological or economical costs
    while adding value to the existing solar installation. It is expected that the
    natured-inspired design will also lead the energy sector towards sustainable future.
    A vast majority of PV solar installations deployed in India are the conventional
    flat PV modules which have a poor capability of collecting solar energy, since
    they miss a solar tracking system. The conventional solar installations are fixed
    axis and have an energy conversion efficiency of around 15–19% [16]. However,
    a double-axis solar system like the one proposed in this study can increase the
    efficiency to around 33% [17] for the same capacity. The current technology of
    solar PV modules has many advantages, but some major disadvantages are that they
    require a large land footprint which increases with increase in capacity and inability
    in effectively capturing the public image since they lack art and aesthetics.
    Nature-inspired solar modules can effectively address these challenges. Analytical
    evidence suggests that biomorphic forms for solar installations require 1% of
    the land footprint and increase efficiency by 10–15% since they can be uniquely
    designed and have variable height for the PV modules [18]. Making solar installations
    aesthetically pleasing would eventually increase the awareness of renewable energy
    among the public and improve the understanding of solar technology. 2 Design Methodology
    Biomorhism has been used as a tool to fulfil the aim of this study, i.e. to design
    a solar installation that will add value to the existing solar installations by
    improving the aesthetics. The arrangement of solar panels has been designed by
    taking inspiration from the petals of the flower that add natural aesthetics to
    the design. It has also been designed to have heliotropic functionality like flowers
    so that the panels would track the position of the sun throughout the day from
    east to west and tilt angles that change the angle of the modules depending upon
    the seasons. The biomorphic design in detail as discussed below. 2.1 The Inspiration
    To design a biomorphic solar installation, the first step was to identify a suitable
    source of inspiration for the same. Keeping both the form and functionality aspects
    of the design in mind, three different variations of the installation were conceptualized,
    inspired from the plumeria (Champa) flower, the hibiscus, and the sunflower (Fig.
    1) of which one was chosen to make the final concept. The general aesthetics of
    the three flowers were found suitable to be the primary form for a solar installation
    since either of the three could provide the necessary surface area in order to
    function optimally without compromising the resemblance with the respective inspiration.
    Apart from the form and functionality considerations, these three flowers were
    used to create the concepts since they are very well-known and recognizable flowers
    throughout the country. A questionnaire was prepared to gather feedback on the
    three concepts based on various factors to get a clearer idea about people’s preferences
    and expectations from the installation. The responses from the questionnaire helped
    in narrowing down the inspiration source to one of the three flowers. Fig. 1 Flower

    design concepts (Fig. 2) were created in 3D, inspired from the plumeria, hibiscus,
    and sunflower, and a questionnaire was prepared to get the feedback on the three
    designs based of five factors; namely resemblance to the inspiration, visual appeal,
    approachability, emotional engagement, and preference over a conventional solar
    installation. Fig. 2 Designs inspired from the plumeria, hibiscus, and sunflower
    Full size image A 5-point Likert chart was used to get the insights based on these
    five factors on a scale of 1–5. The concept with the highest average rating was
    then chosen to be the final concept for the solar installation. 2.3 Insights A
    total of 51 responses were collected for the questionnaire. The distribution of
    choices is showed graphically in the form of pie charts in Table 1. The preferences
    between the plumeria and the hibiscus were fairly evenly distributed, while on
    the other hand, the sunflower had the lowest average rating which could be because
    of the general aesthetics of the panels which was not as appealing as the other
    two options. As pointed out in a few responses, the multiple pointed shapes in
    the sunflower-inspired panels could be a hazard if installed in a public space
    and also did not seem as approachable as the other two options which were more
    rounded in shape. The plumeria was chosen as the final concept for the installation,
    not only because it had the highest average rating but also because it had a significantly
    higher percentage of five ratings in the resemblance category (44%) which was
    the most vital characteristic of the design. Though the hibiscus had slightly
    better ratings in a few categories, it was not chosen over the plumeria because
    it was pointed out in a few responses that the shape of the hibiscus-inspired
    panels resembled table fan blades more than the flower itself. The plumeria (Champa)
    is found in India in a few varieties and is a highly popular garden flower, due
    to its varied colours and fragrances [19]. The bark and petals are also used for
    various medicinal and crafting purposes too [20]. It can be found easily throughout
    the country and is a very recognizable flower. Also, in terms of the functionality,
    solar panels that resemble the petals of a plumeria flower would also have a large
    enough surface area for accommodating enough PV cells, so that the efficiency
    of the system would not be compromised. 3 Construction and Design For the construction
    of the installation, the most important part, that is the solar panels, was shaped
    like the petals of the flower and positioned similarly in number of 5. To determine
    the basic specifications of the panels like the number of cells, power output,
    and the overall dimensions of the installation, the solar photovoltaic pump of
    1.8Wp was considered, since it is the most common commercial pump used in India.
    The government provides financial aids to the farmers to purchase either a 0.9
    or a 1.8Wp pump, as per requirement and affordability, but the 0.9Wp pump was
    found not to be adequate for a majority of the crops; thus, the larger 2HP DC
    motor was used [21]. To operate a 2HP DC surface pump, solar panels rated at 1800W
    would be adequate [22]. So, 5 numbers of 72 cell, 350W panels would be required
    [23]. The shape of a single panel is as shown in (Fig. 3). For higher power requirements,
    panels with larger number of cells can be used. Fig. 3 Shape of biomorphic solar
    panel Full size image Since the installation would be heliotropic, the part where
    the panels would be attached was designed to be able to track the position of
    the sun throughout the day any time of the year. This was achieved by proving
    both a swivelling and pivoting motion to the whole upper structure. The overall
    design is represented in Fig. 4. Fig. 4 Digital representation of biomorphic solar
    installation design Full size image Since the position of the sun would vary vastly
    throughout the year from location to location, the pivoting motion of the panels
    is necessary to always keep tracking the sun and keep the efficiency to the maximum.
    Figure 5 shows all the different angles the panels would position themselves on
    different months of a given year if the installation is in central part of India
    [24]. Fig. 5 Pivoting motion of the panels to track the sun’s position from sunrise
    to sunset Full size image The base of the installation was designed in a way that
    it cannot only house the necessary electric components but also act as a platform
    for people to sit on (Fig. 6). The solar panels would provide shade in an open
    field where shades are not available usually for resting purpose. Fig. 6 Platform
    of the proposed solar installation that can be used as a bench Full size image
    Maximum power potential is observed in croplands, grasslands, and wetlands, where
    there is increased insolation, light wind, moderate temperature, and reduced humidity.
    Agrivoltaic system leverages the combined benefits of both food and energy. Therefore,
    this solar installation was designed with the intention of being deployed near
    cultivation fields in rural areas for operating the irrigation pumps. 4 Design
    Evaluation 3D renders and mock-up of the final design were shown to three farmers
    and specific questions regarding their experience with SWPs and the proposed design
    were asked to gain their feedback and insights. This helped in cementing the idea
    of the proposed design being a superior overall system compared to the conventional
    setup, mainly due to its appearance and functionality. The farmers agreed with
    the proposed design being much more aesthetically pleasing, due to its recognizable
    appearance and functionally superior due to the presence of the solar tracking
    system. On a scale of 1–5, all three farmers gave the appearance of the design
    a score of 5 (highly preferred). The farmers also agreed with the base of the
    installation to be a useful addition for use as a bench. Since India receives
    ample amount of solar energy throughout the year [1], the farmers can take advantage
    of the heliotropic nature of the design and operate the system at no less effectiveness
    than a conventional irrigation system that uses grid-connected electric pumps
    or diesel pumps. 5 Conclusion The agricultural sector in India provides a livelihood
    to more than half the population and contributes 18% to the nation’s GDP. Since
    farmers depend on water pumps for irrigation, which are either electric or diesel
    powered, solar water pumps are a viable alternative option as solar energy is
    a major source of renewable energy and has a wide range of uses. Having already
    been widely adopted in commercial, industrial, and residential sectors, it has
    a potential to reap huge benefits for the agriculture sector as well. In fact,
    there are many schemes that are already in place by the government to promote
    installation of solar water pumps and solar power plants, so installing nature-inspired
    solar modules in this sector would go hand in hand with the effective implementation
    of the scheme and provide a great value addition to solar energy as a renewable
    source of energy [25]. The approach of the proposed biomorphic design is very
    simple in nature which can be easily manufactured and installed. The structure
    of the installation can be manufactured through low-cost locally available material
    such as bamboo that will help to reduce the overall cost of the installation without
    compromising the efficiency of the system. Thus, the novelty of the proposed design
    lies in addressing all the features of nature-inspired design, i.e. biomimicry,
    cradle to cradle design, and circular economy that, inter alia, contributes to
    develop a sustainable future. The novelty factor of the proposed design being
    the improved aesthetics and efficiency. The proposed aesthetics of the design
    was received positively by the questionnaire responders and more importantly by
    the farmers that were interviewed. Due to the addition of the solar tracking system,
    the efficiency of the proposed design was improved to around 33% [17], compared
    to an efficiency of around 15–19% [16] for a conventional fixed-axis solar irrigation
    system. Engaging people with technologies that are going to shape the world of
    tomorrow in an engaging way is the best way to make sure that people realize the
    importance of that technology in their life and find it relatable. In a year,
    India receives more than 300 days of clear and sunny sky. The total solar energy
    received on the land area in this period is about 5000 trillion KWh. This is significantly
    higher than the energy output of all the fossil fuel energy reserves in the country
    [1]. So, with such promising possibilities and circumstances for the use of solar
    energy as a renewable source in India, it is important that the large population
    of the country can connect with this idea in a much deeper emotional level rather
    than simply considering it as another technological progress. It would make the
    way people interact with the technology more humane, accessible, tangible, emotional,
    and more exciting. This paper discusses the deployment of biomorphic solar installations
    in a rural Indian context for irrigation purpose in agricultural fields, but the
    same can be done even in urban setups with varied use cases. Similar installations
    can be installed in areas of recreation and public gathering like parks and cafes
    in cities and can even be used for less power consuming applications like lighting
    and charging of electronic devices carried by the user. Hence, the scope of use
    of such installations is virtually limitless. Based on the same concept, various
    kinds of designs and artworks can be deployed in a wide range of scenarios, both
    in rural and urban setups. This would serve as a great platform to create an environment
    where people and technology interact with each other in a way that goes beyond
    the functional capabilities of energy generation. Table 1 Graphical representation

    Increased agricultural production is critical to ensuring food security for the
    world’s growing population. This requires more agricultural farm inputs, including
    water and energy, and carries associated soil, water, and atmosphere pollution
    risks due to increasingly poor-quality return flows and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
    Over time, the return flows and emissions may also accelerate global changes in
    the biosphere, negatively impacting the environment and depletion of non-renewable
    fossil energy resources. Consequently, agricultural development, aimed at obtaining
    short-term benefits, increases the risk of failures in the future for the environment
    and human life [1]. The unsustainability of agricultural development has become
    a much-researched subject [1,2,3]. One challenge for the intensification of food
    production in arid regions is the vulnerability and over-allocation of river flow,
    which causes farmers to shift to pumped irrigation, using available water sources,
    including groundwater [4,5,6,7,8,9]. The pumped irrigation ensures the reliability
    of water supply according to crop water requirements; however, pumping water makes
    irrigation energy- and carbon-intensive, increases greenhouse gas emissions, and
    accelerates climate change [10,11,12]. Pumped irrigation includes lift irrigation
    schemes and pumping groundwater for irrigation. Lift irrigation schemes implement
    an inter-basin water transfer in three stages: pump water from a source to the
    highest level; then transport water by gravity up to the irrigation zone; and
    finally, distribute water between farmers. In Uzbekistan, where over 50% of the
    irrigated land is under lift irrigation, water delivery for crop production is
    the third major consumer of the national electricity generated. Similarly, in
    Tajikistan, lift irrigation schemes occupy 40% of the irrigated land. In these
    schemes, water losses from irrigation canals and farm fields recharge relevant
    aquifers and raise the groundwater table. Groundwater is an essential source of
    irrigation in many countries. In the USA and India, 60% of irrigation already
    relies on groundwater [4,13,14]. Although pumping groundwater accounts for only
    3%, 3.6%, and 6% of total emissions from agriculture in China, Iran, and India,
    respectively [4,5,15], there are regions where groundwater abstraction has become
    the major consumer of generated electricity and source of carbon emissions [8].
    In addition, groundwater irrigation often leads to storage depletion. Global estimates
    of groundwater depletion vary from 145 (±40) km3/yr [16] to 283 (±40) km3/yr [17].
    In regions with intensive agriculture, groundwater depletion follows a significant
    increase in energy use [4,6,18]. The northern states of India and the North China
    Plain are examples of such regions where groundwater depletion has caused an increase
    in energy consumption and carbon emissions [8,19,20]. Due to the depletion of
    groundwater sources, according to Qiu et al. [20], energy consumption and carbon
    dioxide emissions in the North China Plain grew by 22% and 42%, respectively,
    from 1996 to 2013. In such regions, the sustainability of food production is associated
    with the restoration and stabilization of the groundwater table. There are several
    opportunities to stabilize groundwater levels and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
    Fishman et al. [21] found that appropriate crop selection and improved irrigation
    water use in areas with depleted groundwater would reduce groundwater abstraction
    by two-thirds and stabilize groundwater levels. Another opportunity is efficiency-oriented
    programs that can reduce water and energy losses and carbon emissions and benefit
    the environment. Handa et al. [22] found that improving pumping efficiencies reduced
    energy consumption (by 19% and 34%) and carbon dioxide emissions (by 20% and 52%)
    in two study regions in Oklahoma, USA, between 2001–2017. El-Gafy and El-Bably
    [23] obtained similar results for on-farm irrigation pumps in El-Behera, Egypt.
    Several studies focusing on the operation of irrigation systems have linked the
    on-farm adoption of water-saving technologies to carbon dioxide emissions [24,25,26,27,28].
    Thus, Guo et al. [26] found that drip irrigation increases the mean carbon dioxide
    effluxes and the cumulative CO2 emissions compared with flood irrigation during
    the maize-growing season. In contrast, Gao et al. [27] demonstrated that subsurface
    drip irrigation increases water and nutrient use efficiencies and reduces weed
    pressure; moreover, in combination with fertigation, it can lead to significant
    emission reduction. Edwards et al. [29] reached a different conclusion, indicating
    that intensive crop surface and subsurface drip irrigation have negligible impacts
    on GHG emissions in loamy sand soils. In other words, on-farm level evidence is
    mixed, and the carbon input severity of water-saving technologies depends on the
    biophysical factors and other farming practices. Another opportunity is shifting
    to alternative energy sources for pumping groundwater [30]. Mishra et al. [30]
    found that environmental benefits, such as reduced carbon dioxide emissions, can
    be obtained by switching from electric or diesel pumps to solar or wind power.
    This off-farm level consideration had no link with efficiency-oriented programs
    at the farm level. System-level assessments, from electricity generation for pumping
    irrigation water to field levels of food production, are lacking in the literature
    on carbon emissions. This study examines the sustainability of pumped irrigation
    using a system-level approach through linking water and energy use at the on-farm
    level to the appropriate off-farm level mobilization of natural resources and
    carbon emissions to supply water and energy for on-farm crop production. The impact
    of water cooperation at the basin/system level on the sustainability of crop production
    is assessed at the on-farm level in groundwater irrigation areas. Thus, it facilitates
    the analysis of tradeoffs between water, energy, and carbon in groundwater irrigation
    areas. The research question is: how to reduce energy use and carbon emissions
    in crop production using pumped irrigation. The hypothesis is that combined analyses
    of water, energy, and carbon tradeoffs from field to system-level can result in
    sustainable crop production in groundwater irrigation areas. The objectives of
    this study are (1) to compare on-farm level energy use and related carbon emissions
    in gravity and groundwater irrigation systems; and (2) to examine alternatives
    of electricity generation and use, irrigation, and food production at a system-level
    based on these farm-level findings. The novelty of this study lies in the system-level
    approach to addressing water, energy, and carbon tradeoffs for pumped irrigation,
    including lift and groundwater irrigation. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Challenges
    in Food Production Due to Water-Energy-Carbon Nexus The Aral Sea Basin, spread
    across the southern part of Central Asia, has a fast-growing population. The population
    is expected to rise from 57 million in 2020 to 83 million in 2050, making food
    crop production a priority for farming in irrigated lands where over 90% of the
    region’s agricultural products are produced. Population growth will increase the
    demand for more water withdrawal. At the same time, the flow of the main rivers
    in the region is projected to decrease due to climate change and melting glaciers
    upstream. Thus, by 2050, the annual unmet demand in the Amudarya and Syrdarya
    River Basins is projected to increase to 50% and 35% of the total water demand,
    respectively [31]. Considering that over 40% of the irrigated land downstream
    of the rivers is under lift irrigation, food production in the region is projected
    to become highly dependent on the availability of water, the energy to lift water,
    and a sustainable environment, which also requires water for its functioning.
    Under these conditions, the interlinkages between water, energy, and carbon have
    become critical considerations for sustainable food production and an environmentally
    friendly strategy. Food production in the basin depends on river flow, which is
    transboundary. Much of the flow of the Syrdarya (over 73%) and Amudarya (over
    88%) rivers originate in upstream countries—Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Afghanistan,
    while productive farmlands requiring irrigation are located primarily in downstream
    countries—Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Southern Kazakhstan. Reaping the benefits
    of such an environment requires close cooperation between riparian states in the
    upstream hydropower development and food crop production downstream of the rivers
    [32]. There is high demand for such collaboration, as 95% of the hydropower potential
    is undeveloped in the upstream of the Amudarya in Tajikistan and 87% in the upstream
    of the Syrdarya in Kyrgyzstan [33]. Increasing hydropower generation upstream
    in the future could boost the electricity market in the region; however, it might
    reduce the quantity of water available for agriculture in the summer months. While
    downstream crop producers are concerned about upstream hydropower development,
    hydropower is very important for the upstream economy and potential for the region’s
    future [34]. At the beginning of the 1990s, the previously united regional power
    supply system collapsed. The downstream states preferred access to water than
    hydropower from upstream and, facing energy shortages, focused on internal thermal
    power development using fossil energy resources. The electricity supply from upstream
    hydropower stations was replaced with local thermal power stations. This strategy
    causes rapid depletion of fossil resources, including natural gas, in Uzbekistan,
    where reserves are available for only 20–30 years. In addition, the shift from
    hydropower to thermal power increases carbon dioxide emissions, contributing to
    climate warming and melting glaciers upstream. Thus, focusing on thermal power
    in the downstream states causes depletion of fossil energy resources and increases
    CO2 emissions, contributing to glacier melting and subsequent depletion of river
    flow upstream. This dilemma of water and energy tradeoffs and its impact on the
    agriculture and environment of the region is still not well studied [35,36]. The
    government of Uzbekistan, foreseeing an increase in water scarcity in agriculture,
    has prioritized the widespread adoption of drip irrigation. The area under drip
    irrigation is planned to increase from 44,000 ha to 600,000 ha by 2030, with reduced
    irrigation demand by 1500 million m3 of water [37], which could be reallocated
    to another water-short irrigated area or allowed to flow to the Aral Sea. This
    may cause a gradual lowering of the groundwater table in many systems where irrigation
    water losses are the primary source of groundwater recharge. This may produce
    several gains, such as reducing unproductive evaporation from the groundwater
    table and creating free capacities in the aquifers, which can be used to store
    floodwater. The river has excessive flows in high water years. The shortcoming
    is that lowering the water table would make developing groundwater less attractive
    for farmers due to the increased energy demand for pumping. Current water savings
    may be achieved at the cost of future groundwater development. In such cases,
    groundwater depletion can be arrested by managed aquifer recharge activities in
    the winter seasons, for example, by using hydropower releases from the upstream
    reservoirs [38]. Irrigation in CA is already energy-intensive. Currently, irrigated
    agriculture is solely based on river flow, which is delivered to farm gates by
    a multi-level system of canals, often receiving water through inter-basin water
    transfers. This strategy of reallocating water resources from one basin to another,
    developed in the past (during the Soviet time with no borders between the riparian
    countries), is widely applied in the region and has resulted in low water-use
    efficiency of 0.3–0.4; water losses from the canals and the agricultural fields
    fill aquifers and raise groundwater levels. Inter-basin water transfers have often
    been achieved by lifting water from one basin to another, requiring energy to
    pump water. Consequently, the electricity to pump irrigation water amounts to
    12% of the total power generated in Uzbekistan. Thus, low water-use efficiency
    and high energy consumption make agricultural water management a critical starting
    point for sustaining national food production. Developing farmer-driven groundwater
    irrigation under such conditions can improve water and energy efficiencies. Despite
    the government’s water policy prioritizing water-saving by introducing drip irrigation
    or advancing furrow irrigation, groundwater development for agricultural purposes
    remains essential, especially for irrigated land in piedmont areas and river valleys,
    often under lift irrigation. One of the advantages of groundwater development
    over lift or small pump irrigation is that farmers using groundwater decide when
    to irrigate and how much water to apply. Farmers cultivate grapes outside of canal
    command areas where groundwater is 20–40 m deep. They acquire water from lift
    irrigation schemes, if available, or pump groundwater. Lift irrigation schemes
    pump water from a river to a height of 50–200 m and more to the highest point.
    Water is transported by lift canals, usually long-distance by gravity, and then
    distributed between farmers for irrigation. That is why groundwater irrigation
    is less energy-intensive than lift irrigation, with an average value of 0.2–0.4
    kWh/m3 versus 0.3–0.6 kWh/m3, respectively, indicating the regions where groundwater
    irrigation may produce water and energy savings. When the lift irrigation infrastructure
    is aged, the difference in the energy intensity between lift irrigation and the
    groundwater becomes higher. There are also risks of increasing salinization and
    depletion of groundwater, especially in drought years. Thus, the issues are complex
    and require system-level analyses of power generation, irrigation, food production,
    and the environment. 2.2. Study Area This study was carried out in the Fergana
    Valley, where the Syrdarya River begins, by the confluence of two tributaries,
    the Naryn and Karadarya. These two main tributaries and small rivers, flowing
    into the valley from the south and north, are the primary water sources for irrigation.
    At the same time, losses from the riverbeds, irrigation canals, and agricultural
    fields recharge groundwater. Borisov [39] estimated that the total storage of
    groundwater, including renewable and non-renewable, in the Fergana Valley exceeds
    100 km3; despite this significant potential, groundwater is being developed and
    applied for irrigation to cover a shortage of canal water only. Two representative
    farms growing grapes using gravity and groundwater irrigation were selected for
    comparative analysis (Figure 1). Figure 1. The Aral Sea basin and the location
    of the study farms. The two farms selected for this study have different practices
    for growing grapes. Farm 1, situated in the western part of the valley in Soghd
    Province of Tajikistan, has GPS coordinates of 40°08′40″ N and 69°38′47″ E. The
    farm has a total land area of 630 ha, of which 86 ha is allocated to grape cultivation.
    The farmer’s vineyards are grown in rows using trellis on sandy loam soils, underlain
    by gravel deposits, with gravity furrow irrigation applied from the Khodjabakirgan
    River. Farm 2 is located in the Fergana Province of Uzbekistan with GPS coordinates
    of 40°28′40″ N and 71°35′36″ E. In the early 1990s, the farmer received land from
    the government through a long-term lease. The 10-ha area is under groundwater/well
    irrigation, with 6 ha under grapes, while the remaining are young orchards. The
    farm’s soil is sandy loam underlain by gravel 50 cm below the ground surface.
    There is approximately 500 ha of land under the same production technology of
    grape cultivation in the same area. These two sites represent two different farming
    systems. Farm 1 has an extensive land area, is relatively well-supplied with machinery,
    and applies gravity irrigation. Farm 2 is a family farm in a smaller area, relies
    extensively on manual labor, uses a mini tractor for soil tillage, and practices
    groundwater irrigation. While Farm 1 applies row planting of vineyards and gravity
    irrigation by furrows made along the rows, Farm 2 uses intensive crop cultivation
    practices—grape vines at the height of 2 m cover the entire area. Such a canopy
    dramatically increases solar energy harvest, while plant roots occupy the whole
    inter-row space, up to a depth of 50 cm. This canopy shape and root distribution
    allow plants to effectively use solar energy, water, and nutrients. The farmer
    applies a low rate, high-frequency irrigation, using groundwater along the short
    furrows with a width of 60 cm, thereby moistening the entire inter-row space shaded
    by leaves. Due to the indicated differences, including the farming practices used
    in grape production, the form of ownership, management, and irrigation techniques,
    the yield levels achieved by Farm 2 are significantly higher than those of Farm
    1. 2.3. Data and Methods This study used a two-step approach to analyze water-energy-carbon
    tradeoffs. First, we carried out field studies at the farm level to estimate the
    linkages between the shift from gravity to groundwater irrigation and the changes
    in energy consumption and GHG emissions. Since farmers gradually move from cotton
    and wheat to high-value crops, orchards, and vegetables, we selected farms growing
    grapes, an essential source of revenue for farmers from the Fergana Valley and
    the region. We then evaluated system-level alternatives to make farming practices
    more sustainable, including intensifying crop production, introducing water- and
    energy-saving technologies, and shifting to renewable energy sources. 2.3.1. Farm
    Inputs To assess the gains and shortcomings of introducing groundwater irrigation,
    farming practices and inputs, including irrigation water, were monitored during
    2013–2014. All farming practices and inputs were recorded daily. Daily climate
    data for this period were obtained from the Fergana weather station. Field-level
    water monitoring included: (1) measuring irrigation applications by using Cipolletti
    and Thomson weirs, at field level and furrow level, accordingly; (2) Cipolletti
    weirs were also applied for measuring tail-end water discharges that occurred
    during irrigations; and (3) measuring soil moisture content for depths of 0–0.15,
    0.15–0.30, 0.30–0.50 and 0.50–0.75 cm using soil sampling and air-drying methods.
    Phenology observations included measuring soil crop cover and plant height in
    major plant development phases. The evapotranspiration from the grape fields was
    estimated using the water balance method using formula as follows: 𝐸𝑇=𝐼+𝑃−𝐹𝑙+∆𝑆𝑀  (1)
    where ET—evapotranspiration from a grape field; I—total irrigation applied; P—effective
    precipitation, Fl—field losses of irrigation water, ∆𝑆𝑀 —change of soil moisture
    content in the plant root zone. Soil moisture content was determined before and
    at the end of the crop-growing season as well as before and after irrigation applications.
    Deep percolation losses were estimated as the difference between the volume of
    water applied for irrigation and the amount of irrigation water accumulated in
    the plant root zone. Table 1 shows the inputs applied with the emission potential
    for 2013–2014 for both farms. Table 1. Farming inputs with emission potential
    used for grape production per hectare. Adapted from Abdurakhmanov et al. (2019)
    [40]. Table 1 indicates the differences in farming inputs at Farm 1 and Farm 2.
    Intensive farming practices in grape cultivation, applied at Farm 2, require 3.7
    times more labor than in Farm 1; soil tillage practices are applied using a mini
    tractor of 15 horsepower in Farm 2 and a tractor of 80 horsepower in Farm 1. These
    practices, monitored at the farms, are as follows: (a) soil tillage of interrow
    spacing and making furrows in spring; (b) soil cultivation after each irrigation
    at Farm 1 and four times per season and reshaping furrows at Farm 2; (c) applying
    herbicides and insecticides three times per year in the grape-growing season.
    Accordingly, the total diesel fuel consumption amounted to 56 l/ha and 60 l/ha
    at Farm 1 and Farm 2. These figures are within the range given for grape cultivation
    by Karimi and Moghaddam [41] and Osman and Engindeniz [42]. Furthermore, the irrigation
    application technique, another critical input in productivity, differed in the
    farms under consideration. Farmers applied eight irrigations per cropping season
    at Farm 1 and 15 irrigations at Farm 2. Although the recommended irrigation schedules
    were similar because of the same soil and climate conditions, the actual irrigation
    schedules differed (Figure 2). Figure 2. Integral irrigation applications in Farm
    1 and Farm 2 as well as based on recommendation. Modified from Abdurakhmanov et
    al. (2019) [40]. Data of the recommended irrigation schedule (green line) is adapted
    from Domullodjonov (1988) [43]. Figure 2 shows that the total irrigation application
    was higher at Farm 1, and the amount of water applied to Farm 2 was less than
    the recommended volume. The recommended irrigation applications were calculated
    based on climate conditions, soil properties, groundwater table depths, and the
    relevant irrigation efficiency factors [43]. In both farms, farmers themselves,
    based on the status of plants, soil moisture depletion, and availability of irrigation
    water, decided when to irrigate and how much water to apply. The prolonged intervals
    between irrigation applications were in practice, especially from the second half
    of June until the end of July when grape bushes did not receive irrigation water
    for 47 days. Such interruptions in water supply occurred due to the unregulated
    flow of the Khodjabakirgan River. In contrast, groundwater use for irrigation
    allowed timely irrigation at Farm 2. 2.3.2. Energy Use and Greenhouse Gas Emissions
    The study made the following assumptions: Water, energy, and carbon tradeoffs
    and conclusions based on grape production apply to other crops. The ages of the
    vineyards were 25 years and 8 years for Farms 1 and 2, respectively. The study
    assumed that vineyards in this age range do not have different productivity potential
    if properly maintained farming inputs [44]. Thus, comparative evaluations can
    be undertaken. The analysis applied the straight-line method of depreciation of
    agricultural machinery. According to Siyal et al. [45], energy inputs for surface
    water delivery by canal systems in the lower Indus basin in southern Pakistan
    average between 3 and 4 KJ/m3, and carbon emissions are 0.22–0.30 g/m3. These
    values are insignificant compared to on-farm energy consumption and carbon emissions
    in the gravity and groundwater irrigation systems. Considering the low energy
    inputs found in similar systems, energy inputs for water delivery by canal systems
    in the study areas were excluded from further analyses. Water and energy use and
    GHG (CO2-equivalent) emissions were the basis for assessing tradeoffs between
    water, energy use, and carbon emissions. Farm inputs and operations used in grape
    production contribute to CO2 emissions. The amount of carbon dioxide equivalent
    (i.e., CO2-e) depends on the type of GHG emitted from the farming inputs and respective
    conversion factors given in Table 2. Table 2. Conversion factors of farming inputs
    into energy and CO2-e. Energy and CO2 emissions were from electricity and diesel,
    agrochemicals, and agricultural machinery production. 2.3.3. Energy Requirement
    and CO2 Emissions for Groundwater Pumping Electricity consumption for pumping
    water is monitored using the meter. In scenario analyses, the energy required
    for groundwater pumping was calculated using Equations (2) and (3) borrowed from
    Robertson [59] and Shah [4], respectively: 𝐸𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦 (kWh)= 𝑉𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑚𝑒 ( m 3 )×𝐻 (m)
    367×𝜂×(1−𝑇&𝐷𝑙𝑜𝑠) (2) 𝐻=𝑔𝑤𝑑+𝑑𝑟𝑎𝑤𝑑𝑜𝑤𝑛+𝑓𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 (3) where Energy is the energy demand
    (kWh), Volume is the volume of groundwater lifted per annum; H is the total dynamic
    head (Equation (3)); gwd is the initial groundwater depth; drawdown is 3 m, and
    friction losses are 20%; T&Dlos is transmission and distribution losses; and η
    is the efficiency of the pump set (%), including the pump, the driver, and the
    motor. In Uzbekistan, 89% of the electricity generated is from thermal power plants
    (TPPs), and 11% is from hydropower power plants (HPP). Meanwhile, 91% of the electricity
    produced at the TPPs is from natural gas, 2% from black oil, and 7% from coal.
    According to UzbekEnergo, the transmission and distribution losses of electricity
    in Uzbekistan are 11%, while pump set efficiency is 30%. Natural-gas-based electricity
    TPPs have an average efficiency of 28%, and coal-based TPPs have 25%. The estimation
    of CO2 emissions is based on the amount of electricity generated at the TPPs to
    support irrigation water pumping. The rate of natural gas consumption in the overall
    production of electricity for Uzbekistan is 0.276 m3/kWh for conventional power
    plants and 0.188 m3/kWh for new plants. The carbon dioxide emissions per unit
    of electricity from power plants ranged between 0.542 kg of CO2-e for traditional
    once-through systems and 0.368 kg of CO2-e for circulation systems. The Fergana
    Valley, where more than 10 million people live, covers a deficit in electricity
    supply from Kyrgyzstan, where electricity generation is assumed to be produced
    entirely by HPP. The estimations of CO2 emissions from electricity generation
    by HPP are based on Scherer and Pfister [60], where CO2 emissions are correlated
    to the relevant reservoir/electricity generation ratio area. Emissions of CO2
    are determined using this correlation separately for upstream, midstream, and
    downstream hydropower. 2.3.4. Energy and CO2 Emissions from Agrochemicals The
    agrochemicals considered in this study include fertilizers and chemicals used
    for controlling pests and weeds. The study derived the history of agrochemical
    use from monitoring activities and farm records. Farm 2 deployed ammonium nitrate
    (NH4NO3) with 35% N content, whereas Farm 1 applied urea with 46% N content. For
    the production, packaging, delivery, and application of chemical fertilizers,
    emissions were assessed following the emission factor given in Table 2. 2.3.5.
    Energy Use and CO2 Emissions from Agricultural Machinery Production According
    to Pimentel [56], approximately 83.8 mega joules (MJ) of energy is used to produce
    a kilogram of agricultural machinery. Consequently, on average, it takes 9.6 kg
    of CO2-e to produce a kilogram of agricultural machinery [56,57]. It is worth
    noting that there could be differences in farm machinery and manufacturing technologies
    between countries. However, due to data constraints, this study uses the values
    from Pimentel [56] and Maraseni et al. [57]. Water-energy-carbon tradeoffs were
    analyzed using indicators as follows: (a) Total energy inputs per hectare of irrigated
    land; (b) Non-renewable fuel resources depleted; (c) Total CO2 emissions per hectare
    of irrigated land; (d) Crops produced per kg of CO2 emissions, that is, the ratio
    of the yield of grapes to total CO2 emissions [61]; (e) Carbon dioxide emissions
    per MJ of input, that is, the ratio of total CO2 emissions to the energy input;
    (f) Water productivity [61], calculated as follows: 𝑊𝑃= 𝑌 𝐸𝑇 (4) where WP = water
    productivity (kg/m3), Y = yield of grapes (kg/ha), and ET = crop evapotranspiration
    (m3/ha); (g) Energy efficiency (Ee), estimated using the formula: 𝐸𝐸= 𝐸 𝑜𝑢𝑡 𝐸
    𝑖𝑛 (5) where Eout = energy output (MJ/ha), and Ein = energy input (MJ/ha), (h)
    Energy productivity, calculated as follows: 𝐸𝑃= 𝑌 𝑃 (6) where EP = energy productivity
    (kg/kWh), and P is the total energy input for producing grapes (kWh/ha). 3. Results
    3.1. Farm-Level Analysis of Water, Energy, and Carbon Tradeoffs Irrigation water-associated
    energy inputs and carbon emissions: Farm 1 and Farm 2 use different irrigation
    strategies. Farmers practicing gravity irrigation applied eight irrigations varying
    from 1201 m3/ha early spring to 985–1123 m3/ha, each during the summer season
    at Farm 1. Intervals between irrigation were prolonged, especially in the summer
    season, causing a mismatch between water supply and crop water requirements. The
    farmer, employing groundwater irrigation, provided fifteen low-rate high-frequency
    irrigations varying from 389 to 685 m3/ha, each at Farm 2. Intervals between irrigations
    varied from one month in spring to one week in July and the first half of August;
    such frequent irrigation allowed for maintaining soil moisture content at the
    optimal level. Water supplied for irrigation is spent almost entirely for crop
    transpiration thanks to covering the entire area by grape vines at the height
    of 2 m and low-rate high-frequency irrigation by short furrows. Table 3 summarizes
    water-associated energy inputs reflecting the differences in irrigation strategies.
    Water-related energy inputs are low under gravity irrigation and significantly
    increase for groundwater irrigation, causing high carbon emissions. Since water
    is free at Farm 1, the farmers have insufficient incentives to adopt water-saving
    technologies. In opposite, at Farm 2, the farmer is induced to reduce irrigation
    applications and use water more efficiently due to the high cost of electricity
    to pump water. The electricity consumption to operate the pump causes high carbon
    emissions. Table 3. Farm-level water-associated energy inputs and carbon emissions.
    Water balance studies found crop evapotranspiration at 5740 m3/ha at Farm 1 and
    7496 m3/ha at Farm 2. Despite the minor difference between the irrigation applications
    at Farm 1 and Farm 2, there was a high difference in water productivity. This
    was because (1) according to coarse estimates using the crop cover change, over
    83% of the water applied at Farm 2 and only 47% of the water applied at Farm 1
    are depleted productively for crop transpiration; (2) timely irrigation according
    to crop water requirements at Farm 2, which were difficult to follow at Farm 1
    acquiring water from the unregulated river, and; (3) intensive farming practices
    at Farm 2, including better management of soil nutrients, better use of labor
    and fertilizers, resulted in optimal crop canopy and high efficiency in harvesting
    solar energy. The data presented in Table 3 shows that irrigation water supply
    becomes very energy and carbon emission intensive under groundwater irrigation,
    which puts farmers under pressure to apply comprehensive farming practices to
    produce high yields of grapes to recover made investments in water. The intensive
    farming technology at Farm 2 resulted in the fast growth of grapes bushes, which
    required manual labor to cut a large number of leaves and branches; moreover,
    the grape harvest was labor-intensive. There were hidden electricity savings to
    pump water thanks to the highly efficient irrigation technology allowing the farmer
    to save energy against high water losses under gravity irrigation. GHG emissions
    due to groundwater pumping amounted to 0.51 kg CO2-e/m3. Agricultural inputs energy
    and carbon emissions: Table 4 summarizes agricultural inputs, energy, and carbon
    emissions. Table 4. Farm-level agricultural energy inputs and carbon emissions.
    Data presented in Table 4 showed that Farm 2 employing groundwater irrigation
    practices more labor inputs and agrochemicals, which required short-term investment.
    Farmers were ready to install deep wells, securing water for irrigation. However,
    small-scale farming and lack of capital did not allow them to invest in access
    to groundwater and agricultural machinery. Timely irrigation, intensive labor
    use, and agrochemicals permitted farmers to make farming practices comprehensive.
    However, it increased energy inputs and associated carbon emissions. High grapes
    yield vs. high energy inputs and carbon emissions: Table 5 presents estimated
    farm-level environmental indicators of grape production under gravity and groundwater
    irrigation. Table 5. Estimated farm-level environmental indicators of grape production
    under gravity and groundwater irrigation. Table 5 also shows tradeoffs between
    higher yields and higher environmental impacts. The shift from gravity to groundwater
    irrigation and improved farming practices increased water-use efficiency. Despite
    similar application rates, groundwater irrigation allowed timely and efficient
    water application. Farmers receiving desired water applied intensive farming practices
    and invested more inputs, such as fertilizers, resulting in a three-time-higher
    grape yield at Farm 2, 18,600 kg/ha, compared to 6740 kg/ha on Farm 1. Introducing
    intensive farming and timely groundwater irrigation at low rates and high frequencies
    tripled the yield and water productivity. It also increased energy efficiency
    and energy productivity by 8% each. This was because the grapevines cover the
    entire area at the height of 2 m increased solar energy harvest. At the same time,
    plant roots occupying the inter-row space up to a depth of 50 cm allowed plants
    to use water and nutrients effectively. The major disadvantage of the intervention
    was the significant increase in the energy inputs and CO2 emissions per hectare
    of cropland and per m3 of groundwater applied. The current 2.75 times increase
    in crop production is traded for future issues associated with 2.6 times more
    accumulation of GHGs in the atmosphere. On-farm level estimates showed that farm-level
    interventions dealing with the water-energy-carbon nexus were insufficient to
    produce mutual gains and disclose potential tradeoffs. Increasing food crop production
    and improving water productivity was balanced by growing energy inputs and CO2
    emissions, indicating a need for a wider, system-level consideration of the water-energy-carbon
    tradeoffs. 3.2. System-Level Analyses of Water-Energy-Carbon Nexus There are different,
    case-specific, potential cases to improve the sustainability of agricultural production
    [62,63]. This study considers several alternative cases of grape production. These
    alternative scenarios are as follows. Case 1: Gravity irrigation and conventional
    farming practices. Case 2: Pump irrigation using groundwater and conventional
    farming practices: a TPP is a source of electricity to pump groundwater. Case
    3: Pump irrigation using groundwater, intensive farming practices, and water-saving
    irrigation: a TPP is a source of electricity to pump groundwater. Case 4: Using
    energy-efficient pumps to lift groundwater, intensive farming practices, and water-saving
    irrigation: a TPP is a source of electricity. Case 5: Case 4 plus supplying energy
    to pump groundwater from the upstream HPP. Case 6: Case 4 plus supplying energy
    to pump water from the midstream HPPs. Case 7: Case 4 plus supplying energy to
    pump water from the HPPs, located downstream of the main river. Case 8: Using
    a solar pump, intensive farming practices, and water-saving irrigation. System-level
    analyses in this study include on-farm crop production and relevant water management
    and power generation and delivery system. System-level options assume that the
    impact of farm-level decisions on the system level and the opposite, system-level
    choices on the field level have to be considered to improve resources, water,
    energy, and productivity as well as reduce carbon dioxide emissions. For example,
    a transition to intensive farming practices, energy-efficient pumps, or water-efficient
    irrigation technologies, which is often farmer-driven, should consider a system-level
    impact, as this is where the decision would be made to switch from fossil fuels
    to renewable energy sources or improve the efficiency of electricity generation
    and distribution. For example, cases 3 and 8 may have similar results at the on-farm
    level. However, there is still a difference at the system level on CO2 emissions.
    Alternatively, some cases may contribute to better resource productivity at the
    on-farm level. However, they may increase fossil non-renewable resources depletion
    at the off-farm level and increase carbon dioxide emissions. It is essential to
    clarify at the system level whether there are high productivities of water and
    energy, fossil resources still remain, and carbon dioxide emissions minimized.
    That is why linking on-farm alternatives with the system-level options is essential
    in one case. Analyzing such cases contributes to formulating future visions for
    developing agriculture, water, and energy sectors. The first case represents Farm
    1 producing grapes using conventional farming and gravity irrigation. The second
    case analyzes the shift from gravity to groundwater irrigation using thermal power-based
    electricity but no changes in farming practices. The third case represents Farm
    2, producing grapes using groundwater, intensive farming practices, and water-saving
    furrow irrigation. The fourth case evaluates the adoption of energy-efficient
    pumps and improves power generation efficiency. The fifth to seventh cases consider
    shifting powering pumps from TPP to HPP. The eighth case considers shifting to
    solar energy. Cases 5, 6, and 7 analyze the gains and shortcomings of obtaining
    electricity from HPPs located upstream, midstream, and downstream of the rivers,
    respectively. They differ based on the relationship between electricity generation
    and evaporation losses from relevant reservoirs; evaporation losses were estimated
    using data available for HPPs located in the Syrdarya and Amudarya River basins,
    while CO2 emissions from appropriate reservoirs were calculated using the relations
    given by IHA [64]. The emission rate for CO2 was 48 gCO2-eq/kWh for solar PV (utility)
    [64]. The assessment of introducing drip irrigation to grape production at Farm
    2 showed that replacing low-rate high-frequency furrow irrigation with drip irrigation
    may produce only minor water savings. This is due to the combination of intensive
    vineyard cultivation technology with furrow irrigation when: (a) plant roots cover
    the entire soil space between the vineyard rows up to 0.5 m below the ground surface,
    causing no significant water deep percolation losses; and (b) the vineyard leaves
    cover the entire surface area at the height of 2 m, resulting in irrigation water
    depletion mainly in the form of transpiration. The irrigation water losses from
    surface runoff, on average 10%–15% of the total water applied, are collected by
    the tailwater recovery system and directed to an adjacent field for irrigation
    use [40]. These estimates show that the farmer used the available water efficiently.
    For this reason, drip irrigation was excluded from further analysis. The comparison
    of the cases included estimating the environmental indicators at the farm and
    system levels, including on-farm and off-farm. For example, in the case of the
    HPP energy supply, the on-farm level estimates include irrigation water and other
    farming inputs. In contrast, at the system level, additional water depletions
    have evaporation losses from a relevant reservoir and water delivery losses if
    losses form depletions. In the case of TPP energy supply, on-farm level estimates
    include energy inputs related to water and other farming inputs. In contrast,
    at the system level, additional energy inputs include the depletion of fossil
    fuel resources. The system-level inputs considered include on-farm- and off-farm-level
    water and energy inputs to pump groundwater; off-farm energy depletions associated
    with other farming inputs were beyond the scope of this study. The comparison
    of the cases was undertaken using resource productivity and GHG emissions; however,
    there may be other case-specific factors and conditions beyond this study’s scope.
    3.3. Energy Inputs as Affected by Alternative Cases Figure 3 shows the difference
    between the energy input estimates for alternative cases at the on-farm and system
    levels. Figure 3. Energy inputs at (a) on-farm level and (b) system level for
    alternative cases of water and energy use. Depleted energy includes fossil fuel
    resources for TPP; renewable energy includes water evaporation losses for HPP
    and water for cooling solar panels. On-farm level estimates include the energy
    of water, farming inputs, and electricity to pump water. System-level estimates
    include energy for pumping water, system-level water consumption and fossil fuel
    resource depletion, and on-farm-level energy of farming inputs. The analysis at
    the farm level showed minor differences between the cases with pumping water (Figure
    3a). While case 1, with gravity irrigation and conventional farming practices,
    indicates the lowest energy consumption per area, the shift to groundwater irrigation
    in case 2 and the introduction of intensive farming practices in case 3 increased
    energy inputs to a maximum. Other cases show similar energy inputs per ha, indicating
    no significant differences, except case 7, which uses hydropower downstream to
    pump groundwater. The picture is different in Figure 3b. The system-level analysis
    considers fossil fuel consumption for electricity generation, its transportation
    and distribution, and the energy loss associated with water evaporation from reservoirs.
    The research shows high variations between cases with different energy sources
    for pumping water. In cases with TPP power supply, even in case 4 with improved
    water and energy efficiency, energy consumption is 1.5–1.9 times higher than those
    with HPP or solar power supply. In the cases with HPP power supply, the energy
    consumption in cases 5 and 6 is almost similar, while the energy consumption increases
    significantly in case 7. This is because of the excessive energy depletion associated
    with water delivery losses, recharging saline brackish water aquifers, and extra
    evaporation losses from the relevant reservoirs. Based on the system-level analysis,
    energy inputs are minimal for cases 5, 6, and 8, characterized by groundwater
    irrigation, improved water, and energy use, and renewable energy from the upstream
    (case 5) or midstream (case 6) HPPs or solar energy. System-level estimates show
    significant differences in energy inputs for crop production using thermal power
    and renewable power supply for groundwater irrigation. Figure 4 compares the total
    energy inputs, considering farm-level inputs against energy inputs at the system
    level. Figure 4 clearly shows that the worst cases characterized by high energy
    inputs occur when electricity is generated at TPPs for water pumping at farms
    using conventional (case 2) or intensified farming practices, including water-saving
    irrigation (case 3). The same crop production can be obtained with much lower
    energy inputs if electricity is produced using renewable energy, hydropower, or
    solar power (cases 5, 6, and 8, respectively). Figure 4. Total energy inputs for
    crop production under different water and energy cases (MJ/ha). Using power supply
    from the upstream HPP (case 5), the midstream HPP (case 6), or solar energy (case
    8) reduces the energy intensity by 65%, and from the downstream HPP (case 7) by
    53%, as compared to using thermal power (case 2). These data indicate no justification
    for replacing gravity irrigation with groundwater irrigation if electricity is
    supplied by thermal power. 3.4. Carbon Dioxide Emissions as Affected by Alternative
    Cases Figure 5 shows carbon dioxide emissions associated with crop production
    under different water and energy inputs cases. Figure 5. Estimated (a) on-farm
    and (b) system-level carbon dioxide emissions, as affected by different water
    and energy input cases. On-farm level estimates show that introducing intensive
    farming practices doubled CO2 emissions; however, there are no differences between
    the cases with groundwater irrigation using different sources of power supply
    (Figure 5a). The on-farm level assessments were insufficient to disclose water,
    energy, and carbon tradeoffs in the studied cases. The system-level estimates
    of CO2 emissions clearly show the differences between the cases (Figure 5b). In
    the cases with TPP power supply for pumping water, conventional farming practices
    (case 2) resulted in 8.2 times higher CO2 emissions than under gravity irrigation.
    Intensifying farming and improving irrigation practices (case 3) increased CO2
    emissions by 11%. Improving pumping efficiency and power generation efficiency
    (case 4) reduces CO2 emissions by 36% compared to case 2. Advancing TPP energy
    generation (case 4) reduced the emission rate; however, the case remains uncompetitive
    against cases with renewable energy supply (cases 5–8). The shift from thermal
    energy to hydropower energy reduced CO2-e. The energy supply of groundwater irrigation
    from the upstream HPPs (case 5) and midstream HPPs (case 6) had the lowest CO2
    emissions at 1173 and 1225 kg of CO2-e/ha, respectively. These rates are comparable
    to emissions when solar power was applied (1200 kg of CO2-e/ha) while using the
    downstream HPP power supply, CO2 emission rates were 1655 kg of CO2-e/ha. The
    system-level assessments disclosed the benefits of applying renewable energy to
    the low-carbon transformation of food production on irrigated land. Table 6 shows
    the main environmental indicators of the studied cases. Table 6. Environmental
    indicators of different cases of water and energy inputs. The data presented in
    Table 6 indicate that increasing crop production and obtaining gains in water,
    energy, and carbon, including the highest crop production per carbon dioxide emissions,
    are found for cases 5, 6, and 8. No case with a TPP power supply was suitable
    for groundwater irrigation, even using water- and energy-saving technologies.
    These cases have high water productivity, but increased CO2 emissions characterize
    low energy efficiency and productivity. The water productivity indicator alone
    was not enough to conclude on the sustainability of the crop production because
    the WP value did show no differences between the cases with non-renewable and
    renewable energy sources characterized by significantly different carbon emissions.
    In contrast, the crop yield ratio to the carbon emissions directly reflected the
    impact of the case on the use of energy sources, carbon emissions, and crop yields.
    The energy efficiency and the energy productivity indicators indirectly reflected
    differences in carbon emissions. The energy efficiency indicator did not consider
    the changes in crops yields. The worst-case for crop production development was
    the case of groundwater irrigation using conventional irrigation and farming practices;
    the second-worst case was the shift to groundwater irrigation using intensive
    farming practices with no improvements in irrigation practices. Case 4, using
    TPP-based electricity, had higher water productivity than conventional farming
    with gravity irrigation (case 1). However, the depletion of non-renewable resources
    and relatively high carbon emissions make these cases not applicable for the future.
    Groundwater irrigation using downstream HPP (Case 7) is characterized by lower
    water and energy productivity and crop yields per kg of CO2 emissions than the
    other HPP cases due to increased evaporation losses and CO2 emissions from the
    relevant reservoir off-farm water losses to saline groundwater. Case 8, with groundwater
    irrigation using a solar pump, showed the highest water and energy productivity
    and the crop yield per kg of CO2 emissions. From an environmental viewpoint, the
    current strategy of gravity irrigation (case 1) showed many advantages. There
    are no fossil fuel inputs for power generation to lift water, and the energy inputs
    and CO2 emissions are low. However, practicing gravity irrigation depends on the
    availability of water according to crop water requirements; conventional farming
    practices often applied along with gravity irrigation produce low crop yields
    and are characterized by low water and energy productivity. The case of replacing
    gravity irrigation with a low-head micro-irrigation system, which requires power
    to pump water into the system, was beyond the scope of this study. 4. Discussion
    Water productivity is considered one of the main indicators of basin sustainability
    [65,66]. Brauman et al. [65] highlighted that improved crop water productivity
    increases water sustainability. Cai et al. [66] gave different examples, including
    when increasing a basin’s water productivity was at the expense of agricultural
    sustainability. This study results suggest that in the environment, when carbon
    emissions become the main factor of environmental and agricultural unsustainability,
    WP indicator is not enough alone to decide whether the crop production is sustainable
    because, despite it being an important indicator of crop return on consumed water,
    it does not reflect differences of alternative cases in carbon emissions. From
    this point of view, the crop yield response to kg of carbon emissions indicator
    can be applied along with water productivity to compare alternative cases of agricultural
    production using pumped irrigation. To obtain a complete picture of environmental
    sustainability, it is also essential to consider the third indicator—the depletion
    of non-renewable fuel resources. The scale of analyses of the indicators is vital.
    Analyzing the water-energy-carbon tradeoff only at the farm level [22,23] may
    mask the gains and shortcomings of interventions to improve water and energy use
    and hidden environmental impacts. On-farm level analyses show the effect of farm-level
    inputs and measures to improve their efficiencies on crop yield and the increasing
    energy inputs and corresponding CO2 emissions. The energy source—hydro, solar,
    or thermal—makes no difference from a farm perspective. However, the energy source
    makes a big difference at the system level. A system-level analysis, including
    on-farm crop production and linked off-farm water and energy sources depletions,
    is necessary to find possible solutions that may produce gains in crop production,
    resource reduction, including water and energy, improved water, and energy productivity,
    and reduced CO2 emissions. The system-level analysis indicates that the energy
    consumption for crop production is high when the electricity supply for water
    pumping comes from a TPP. Fossil fuel resources become the main component of energy
    inputs, making thermal power less compatible with renewable energy resources.
    The results of this study suggest that it is not sustainable to expand thermal
    power because of the high depletion rate of fossil fuel resources, while improving
    and advancing existing thermal power plants may reduce CO2 emissions and contribute
    to reducing the depletion of fossil resources. Besides introducing intensive farming
    practices and water and energy-saving technologies, improving pumping and energy
    generation efficiencies may bring about resource reduction and environmental benefits
    [27]. However, pumped irrigation using thermal power cannot deal with water-energy-carbon
    tradeoffs. It reduces energy efficiency and productivity, accelerates fossil fuel
    resource depletion, and increases CO2 emissions. Under conditions of increasing
    long-term temperature, due to climate change and depleting fossil fuel resources,
    the gradual shift to environmentally friendly renewable energy resources is a
    better solution than meeting the growing needs by expanding all available resources,
    including thermal resources. For assessing the sustainability of water management,
    a basin’s level is an appropriate scale [67,68,69]. Analyzing trade-offs for water,
    energy, and carbon may require linking basin water management to corresponding
    power generation alternatives located outside the basin. For example, inter-basin
    water transfers from the Amudarya River basin are critical for sustainable water
    supply in the lower reaches of the Zerafshan River and the Kashkadarya River.
    However, the reliable operation of pumping stations that pump water depends on
    power plants located outside of their basins. In such cases, trade-off analysis
    requires linking the basin water management analysis with energy supply alternatives.
    The estimates show that hydropower-based pumped irrigation has advantages over
    thermal-power-based irrigation: fewer energy inputs in crop production and less
    carbon intensity at the system level. These gains can be achieved by accessing
    upstream and midstream hydropower resources. Many studies consider the practice
    of obtaining hydropower electricity in summer and trading for fossil natural gas
    in winter as a benefit-sharing approach for transboundary river basins with upstream
    hydropower and downstream agriculture [32]. This study indicates that the joint
    development and use of upstream hydropower may reduce the depletion of fossil
    fuel resources and lead to more sustainable agriculture based on pumped irrigation.
    The upstream hydropower development should consider water for food, energy, and
    the environment. This case can be pioneered in the case of the Zerafshan River
    upstream of Tajikistan and downstream to Uzbekistan—there is an agreement for
    two HPPs to be installed by the downstream country in the river’s upstream. Similar
    advantages are inherent in the development of midstream hydropower. This approach
    means developing small midstream hydropower in the Fergana Valley, Tashkent, Surkhandarya,
    and Kashkadarya regions in Uzbekistan or the northern part of Tajikistan. This
    proposal coincides with the ongoing construction of new small HPPs on small rivers
    and canals in many regions of Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. Small HPP installation
    does not require extra water depletion because the downstream reservoirs can capture
    hydropower releases; there are minor power transportation and distribution losses
    and CO2 emissions. HPPs on small rivers and widespread canals can produce energy
    from upstream hydropower releases and supply power for developing groundwater
    and wide adoption of micro-irrigation. The study showed the shortcomings of installing
    hydropower downstream, which may cause high water losses due to evaporation in
    the hotter desert zone. There are also environmental and social considerations
    in prioritizing hydropower while infringing the needs of other uses, such as the
    environment and agriculture [70,71,72,73]. Therefore, hydropower development must
    ensure environmental flows, with high importance for river ecosystem services.
    In the case of hydropower releases from reservoirs in winter, agriculture may
    have irrigation water shortages in summer. This is where further tradeoff analysis
    is required to minimize system-level losses. Mitigation measures may include the
    development of sufficient capacities for re-regulating upstream hydropower releases
    in the midstream, focusing on preserving river ecosystem services downstream,
    shifting from canal irrigation to groundwater, and using a managed aquifer recharge
    technique. Hydropower development must contribute to diversifying benefits from
    water rather than prioritizing a single water use. This requires close cooperation
    of riparian states in energy production and water management to enhance food production.
    Solar power was confirmed as the best option for water-energy-carbon tradeoffs.
    Groundwater development using solar power requires minimum resources, water, energy,
    inputs, high resource efficiency, and productivity. It produces minimum CO2 emissions—the
    emissions were 51% less than water pumping using electricity from TPPs. This is
    higher than the emission reduction value found by De Vlugt [74] for groundwater
    pumping for irrigation in India. Developing solar power could be an essential
    contribution to sustaining the growing demand for energy supply and ensuring win-win
    outcomes. While there are plans to install six 100 MW solar power plants by 2030
    in Uzbekistan and similar developments in neighboring countries, they can be further
    expanded to cover the growing energy demand. 5. Conclusions Amid the growing demand
    for food and increasing pressure on limited, vulnerable river flow, the shift
    to pumped irrigation using groundwater has addressed water scarcity in agriculture.
    This adaptation strategy creates a base for increasing crop production by introducing
    intensive farming practices, water-saving irrigation, and energy-saving technologies.
    However, in this case, improved yields of crops and water productivity may be
    traded for high carbon inputs and CO2 emissions. This study results suggest that
    in the environment, when carbon emissions become the main factor of environmental
    and agricultural unsustainability, WP indicator is not enough alone to decide
    on the sustainability of crop production because, despite it being an important
    indicator of crop return on consumed water, it does not reflect differences of
    alternative cases in carbon emissions. Under climate change induced by anthropogenic
    carbon emissions, a combination of three indicators, including crop yields per
    kg of carbon emissions, water productivity, and depletion of non-renewable fuel
    resources, can be used to clarify whether crop production using groundwater irrigation
    is environmentally sustainable. The study revealed that only a farm-level analysis
    of water-energy-carbon tradeoffs might mask the gains and shortcomings of interventions
    to improve water and energy use and hidden environmental impacts. Instead, a system-level
    that includes a combination of farm-level and off-farm-level analysis of the tradeoffs
    is necessary to find crop production cases, which are environmentally sustainable.
    The study found that, in Fergana Valley, the shift to groundwater irrigation using
    thermal power supply makes crop production unsustainable—groundwater supply is
    based on rapidly depleting fossil energy resources, with crop yields per kg of
    CO2 emissions two times less than when electricity for groundwater pumping comes
    from the upstream or the midstream hydropower. The worst cases, characterized
    by high carbon emissions, occur when electricity is generated at thermal plants
    that pump water to farms using conventional or intensified farming practices.
    The study shows that hydropower-based pumped irrigation has advantages over thermal-power-based
    irrigation. Hydropower can ensure timely irrigation and increase resource efficiency
    and productivity simultaneously by improving power availability, producing much
    lower CO2 emissions. With the same water productivity, grape yields (kg/ha) per
    kg of CO2-e/ha were 15.2–15.9 using electricity from hydropower against 7.7 kilograms
    of grapes/kg of CO2-e using thermal plants. Many previous studies have considered
    the practice of obtaining hydropower electricity in summer traded for fossil natural
    gas in winter as a benefit-sharing approach for transboundary river basins with
    upstream hydropower and downstream agriculture. However, the present study suggests
    that this approach does not sustain power generation in the basin while continuously
    utilizing fossil carbon reserves. Instead, joining the development and use of
    upstream hydropower by riparian states reduces the depletion of fossil fuel resources,
    making agriculture more sustainable based on pumped irrigation. Hydropower development
    must ensure environmental flows and consider food, energy, social, and environmental
    tradeoffs to bring basin-scale benefits. This requires close cooperation between
    riparian states on water management and energy generation to enhance food production.
    Midstream hydropower can serve to re-regulate upstream hydropower releases. The
    installation of small HPPs does not require extra water depletion because the
    downstream reservoirs can capture hydropower releases; there are minor power transportation
    and distribution losses and CO2 emissions. Installing power stations on small
    rivers and widespread canals can form a basis for developing groundwater and wide
    adoption of micro-irrigation. Thus, hydropower development must contribute to
    diversifying benefits from water rather than prioritizing a single water use.
    The study indicates that downstream hydropower is less attractive because it causes
    extra water depletion and CO2 emissions from the related reservoirs. The results
    of the study highlight that solar power is the best case to deal with water-energy-carbon
    tradeoffs. Pumped irrigation using solar power showed similar to hydropower grape
    yields per kg of carbon emissions, water, and energy productivities; In contrast,
    hydropower may reallocate water from food production and increase water shortages
    for agriculture solar power requiring minimum water resources, which has no environmental
    impacts. The three pillars for addressing water, energy, and carbon tradeoffs
    for sustainable food production are system-level interventions for water and energy
    saving, use of renewable energy to pump water for irrigation, and river basin
    scale cooperation. These pillars can lead to low carbon transformation of pumped
    irrigation-based food production in Central Asia and elsewhere. Further studies
    are required to analyze other cases, link cropping systems, water saving irrigation
    strategies, and alternative energy sources, and make future projections to achieve
    environmental sustainability in agricultural production. A special focus in future
    studies is to be given to a scale of water management sustainability analyses
    under the water, energy, and carbon tradeoffs at different levels—field, system,
    and basin. Author Contributions Conceptualization, A.K.K., A.A.K. and I.A.; methodology,

  description: Food insecurity in East Africa (EA) is exacerbated by the effects of
    climate change. Water scarcity and high energy costs make it difficult for farmers
    to increase their yields to levels needed to feed growing populations. One way
    for countries to sustainably increase food production is to increase the adoption
    of water- and energy-efficient irrigation technology. Solar-powered drip irrigation
    systems are such a technology. These systems provide many benefits to farmers
    who have been able to install them on their fields, but their high costs is one
    barrier that currently limits its adoption among the majority of EA farmers. In
    this work, a concept for a novel irrigation controller is introduced and assessed
    for its viability in the EA market. The proposed controller determines complex
    irrigation schedules based on local weather predictions and specifics of a given
    farm. It does this while optimizing for the lifetime performance of the irrigation
    system, something that existing controllers do not do and something that could
    lower the lifetime costs of solar-powered drip irrigation systems. The proposed
    controller communicates this complex schedule to farmers in a way that allows
    them to continue to use low-cost, manually-operated valves on their fields. This
    concept is evaluated through storyboard-based interviews with EA farmers and key
    market stakeholders. The results provide initial positive feedback from these
    lead users, suggesting that this controller could be a viable product in EA. If
    adopted at scale, this technology could help lower the barrier to adopting water-
    and energy-efficient irrigation, ultimately having a positive, sustainable impact
    on food security in EA.

    I. Introduction Water is the basis and the main engine of life on earth. Humans
    use water for industrial purposes, sanitation, and irrigation. In the last decades,
    the annual water withdrawal ranged between 11 billion and 15 billion cubic meters
    per year, out of which 69 % is used in agriculture [1]. Unfortunately, most of
    this water is wasted because of inadequate irrigation control systems. As in most
    arid and sub-Saharan countries, agriculture in Morocco is the largest consumer
    of fresh water, especially after launching the Green Plan program in April 2008
    [2]. This program aims to promote agriculture as an efficient sector capable of
    advancing the economy, fighting poverty, and preserving many people in rural areas
    efficiently and sustainably. Within the framework of this program, the government
    provided many facilities and assistance to farmers and investors in irrigated
    agriculture to provide enough basic food for local consumption and export promotion
    programs. However, the level of Smart Agriculture penetration in Morocco remains
    very low. In addition, investors in the irrigated agricultural projects started
    sounding alarms of severe depletion of groundwater on the horizon [3] and the
    lack of a cost-effective real-time data collection in irrigation systems in farming
    fields that will enable them to benefit from the advanced modern technologies.
    There is a need to develop a cost-effective and sustainable data acquisition system
    for smart agriculture applications in sub-Saharan fields for sustainable, efficient,
    and smart agriculture. The system should use renewable energy and the latest Information
    and Communication Technologies (ICT) that can sustain the aridity of an agricultural
    environment. When combined with reasonable control and management and data analytics,
    the data acquisition system can play an essential role in increasing agricultural
    productivity and improving the quality of crops. Most importantly, unlike the
    traditional methods of irrigated agriculture that widely use underground water
    reservoirs and resort to fossil fuels, especially gas, as a source of energy.
    Smart agriculture (SA) exploits modern management systems to rationalize water
    consumption and adopt renewable energies as a source of energy, thus rendering
    the agricultural sector eco-friendly. In this paper, we are presenting an integral
    and cost-effective SA solution. When approached from a Cyber-Physical System (CPS)
    perspective [4], our solution relies on four main ICTs: 1. A Wireless Sensors
    Network (WSNs) monitor, in real-time, the plant environmental conditions, e.g.,
    weather and soil conditions, 2. A Wireless Actuators Network (WAN) acts upon electric
    appliances such as water pumps and light bulbs, 3. A Cloud-based IoT platform
    for real-time data storage, processing, and visualization; and 4. A Fuzzy Logic
    Control module decides on monitoring irrigation durations based on the real-time
    acquired differences between desired and ambient soil moisture. We deployed our
    open-source software solution for data acquisition, actuation, and control. We
    built our cost-effective sensors and actuators using off-the-shelf cheap nano-Arduinos.
    Finally, we leveraged an existing free Cloud-based IoT platform, e.g., NodeRED
    [5]. In this paper, and by considering optimal water-ground usage, renewable energy
    integration, and open-source ICT-based smart irrigation, we aim to contribute
    towards the smooth penetration of Smart Agriculture into underprivileged sub-Saharan
    countries. We are further envisioning, through this work, to set a solid cornerstone
    for establishing a dedicated Cloud-based and HPC (High-Performance Computing)
    platform [6] to collect real-time data about water-table usage. This data, which
    falls under the big data category, as it bears the big data 3Vs (Volume, Velocity,
    and Variety) [7], and along with appropriate Big Data Analytics tools, will tremendously
    assist in promoting eco-friendly smart agriculture. The paper contributions are
    as follows: We present a real-world, cost-effective, and easy-to-deploy general
    architecture for a Smart Farm testbed that the research community can easily adopt
    and adapt for further testing and improvement. We detail how to use open-source
    software and leverage Cloud Computing for wireless sensor data storage and processing.
    We demonstrate the integration of our developed cost-effective wireless sensors
    and actuators using off-the-shelf hardware in a real-world case study. We show
    how integrating renewable energy into smart farms paves the path towards adopting
    our solution in off-grid sites, e.g., arid and sub-Saharan areas. We prove that
    by adopting fuzzy logic into smart drip irrigation, our system reduces water consumption
    by up to 71.8%, thus contributing to sustainable water-table usage. The rest of
    the paper is organized as follows. The background is presented in Section 2, and
    the related work is overviewed in Section 3. The general system architecture and
    design are described in Section 4. In Section 5, we discuss the results and evaluate
    the findings. Finally, in Section 6, we conclude and present our future work.
    SECTION II. Background A. Smart Agriculture as a Cyber-Physical System The rapid
    technological developments of the Internet of Things (IoT), WSN, and Embedded
    Systems in recent years have enabled the development of modern systems and applications
    that have completely changed our lives. CPSs are among the most powerful of these
    modern systems, and Smart Agriculture is a CPS. CPS refers to systems that ideally
    integrate software and hardware components to perform precise tasks. A formal
    definition states: “Cyber-Physical System is defined as transformative technologies
    for managing interconnected systems between its physical assets and computational
    capabilities” [8]. As shown in Fig. 1, the general CPS architecture combines embedded
    computing, wireless sensors, and actuators networks to monitor and control the
    physical environment and give it the ability to adapt itself to new conditions
    in real-time through feedback loops. Its ability to combine different technologies
    and make them integrated has made CPS a crucial technological revolution that
    brings innovation to multiple industries by replacing traditional processes in
    many application areas with new and modern ones. FIGURE 1. Cyber-physical systems
    (CPS) general architecture. Show All Smart agriculture is one of the most promising
    CPS applications that will positively affect human life. SA can preserve a significant
    amount of water and energy through its ability to monitor multiple resources such
    as irrigation and solar energy systems. As a CPS, it replaces the traditional
    agricultural system with a smart and modern one that provides accurate agricultural
    management by collecting and processing data related to the plant, the weather,
    and the soil, in real-time mode and using precise control methods. The interaction
    of the main components of SA as a closed-loop control CPS is depicted in Fig.
    2. This figure includes the field, the control center, the Wireless Sensors and
    Actuators Network (WSAN), and the drip irrigation system. FIGURE 2. Smart farm
    as a closed CPS (Cyber physical system). Show All B. Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSN) The rapid developments in wireless communication technologies, micro-electromechanical
    systems, and digital electronics have given rise to WSN [9]–[11]. The latter consists
    of sensor nodes that monitor the agricultural environment needed data, such as
    temperature, humidity, soil moisture, motion, and pressure, and send through a
    gateway towards the data processing server(s). This data can be hosted locally
    or remotely in the Cloud [12]. Once processed and analyzed, it becomes information
    that can be visualized (e.g., using plots and charts) and sent to the control
    unit to react upon and take actions, e.g., switching On/Off water pumps and drip
    irrigation motors. One of the main advantages of WSN is that it reduces the cost
    of wiring and makes it practical and easy. According to some studies, WSN will
    have the ability to eliminate from 20% to 80% of the installation costs [13].
    The general structure of a wireless sensor node is depicted in Fig. 3 and consists
    of four units [14]: The Sensing Unit consists of sensor modules that sample the
    environmental conditions of the deployment field. The Processing Unit consists
    of a microcontroller with a CPU and memory to run code and process the data. The
    Transmission Unit: This unit modulates digital data and sends it wirelessly. Several
    wireless technologies are adopted for this unit. In our deployment, we are using
    ZigBee [15]. The power Supply Unit is the Lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery that powers
    the wireless sensor node. FIGURE 3. General architecture of a wireless sensor
    node. Show All C. Internet of Things (IoT) With the rapid advancement in ICT,
    today’s era has left the concept of the internet far behind, and a new concept
    has emerged: the IoT. There are many definitions of IoT set by many organizations
    working globally. ITU-T (International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication
    Standardization Sector) has defined IoT as “Global infrastructure for Information
    Society, enabling advanced services by interconnecting (physical and virtual)
    things based on existing and evolving, interoperable information and communication
    technologies” [13]. [16] defines IoT as a technology that combines the internet
    and existing resources to control devices. This control is ensured by using various
    IoT communication technologies such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, Long-Range (Lora), Zensys
    Wave (Z-Wave), SigFox, Wi-Fi, GPRS, 4G, and 5G [17]. Even though IoT is mainly
    about connecting and automating things (objects) over the internet, human intervention
    gives this concept the possibility of existence. The interrelationship between
    the three sections that make up the IoT is illustrated in Fig. 4. FIGURE 4. Tri-sectional
    relationship between the three components of IoT. Show All IoT is witnessing continuous
    progress and has a promising future. Statistics indicate that the number of IoT-connected
    devices is expected to rise to 43 billion devices by 2023 [18]. Furthermore, the
    total IoT market worldwide was worth around \\\\(389 billion in 2020, and it is
    expected to rise to more than one trillion US dollars in 2030 [19]. This optimistic
    future vision reinforces the necessity to develop newer communication technologies
    that enable the synchronization of the largest possible number of new devices
    with sensors over the internet. Fig. 5 shows the persistent increase in connected
    devices/things over the internet for ten years (2015-2025) [20]. FIGURE 5. IoT
    connected devices in 2015-2025. Show All Given that IoT is a fertile research
    area that both the academic and industry sectors are interested in, all indications
    show an urge to deploy novel technologies to cope with the rapid increase in IoT
    deployment and adoption. In this regard, 5G and its Massive Machine Type Communication
    (mMTC) component is excellent news for the IoT market, and it will have a significant
    impact on it [19]. Through mMTC, 5G networks will inevitably improve the reliability
    and performance of many vital ICT-related domains of substantial interest to society,
    such as smart mobility, smart grid, smart buildings, and smart agriculture. The
    following section presents some critical IoT applications in SA. D. IoT Applications
    in Smart Agriculture IoT and connected objects have invaded our daily lives in
    all fields, from smart TVs to connected cars: all our activities are facilitated
    by these new tools, which significantly increase our comfort. All studies confirm
    that the potential of connected things is enormous. For example, a study done
    by Fortune Business Insight indicates that the global IoT market size is projected
    to reach $ 1,854.76 billion by 2028. It is set to exhibit a Compound Annual Growth
    Rate (CAGR) of 25.4% during the forecast period between 2021 and 2028 [21]. The
    applications of IoT are numerous and cover many areas. The most appealing IoT
    applications in Agriculture are presented next. 1) Smart Greenhouses Greenhouse
    farming enhances the quality and quantity of crops production through manual control
    of environmental conditions [22]. A smart greenhouse can be created using IoT
    by deploying sensors and motors that intelligently monitor and control the climate
    conditions based on the needs of the plants [23]. Several operations will be automatic
    by adopting this innovative agricultural system, such as opening and closing windows,
    adjusting the cooling and heating system, and turning on/off light bulbs. Thus,
    manual intervention is no longer required. 2) Smart Irrigation Management The
    currently adopted irrigation methods are somewhat advanced and depend on watering
    at specific times, which does not require much human intervention. Still, at the
    same time, it involves a high degree of guesswork and can be very wasteful in
    terms of water and energy consumption. Some field parts are under or over irrigated
    even with modern irrigation systems. Besides, although farmers would stop irrigation
    systems when expected to rain, sometimes they do not check the weather to adjust
    their schedules accordingly. The smart irrigation management system can consider
    all of this by using precision farming methodologies and IoT-enabled sensors that
    monitor soil moisture levels, humidity, and temperature everywhere in the field.
    The control based on this data automatically adjusts irrigation schedules. It
    also provides the exact amount of water where and when needed to create optimal
    conditions for the plant for a better yield without wasting water and energy.
    3) Integration Into Smart Grid Renewable energy integration into Smart Agriculture
    would serve as a bias to link Smart Farms to Smart Grids (SG) [17]. Smart farms
    are both energy producers and consumers. An SG is an electricity distribution
    network that promotes the flow of information between suppliers and consumers
    to adjust the flow of electricity in real-time and allows more efficient management
    of the electricity network [24], [25]. Smart grid benefits from the significant
    development that IoT and embedded systems are witnessing to optimize energy production,
    distribution, consumption, and storage. It improves the energy efficiency of the
    assembly by minimizing line losses and optimizing the yield of the means of production
    used, taking into consideration the real-time consumption. E. Cloud-Based Big
    Data Analytics Platforms This study uses Node-RED, an open-source flow-based programming
    tool that allows wiring hardware devices, application programming interfaces (APIs),
    and online services. We used the built-JavaScript-based library on Node.js to
    develop the application. We wired pre-programmed nodes represented by appropriate
    icons and created the application’s different needed functional IoT components.
    Node-RED contains several node types, each of which has a specific function. For
    instance, the debug-out nodes are used to monitor the flow. The inject nodes trigger
    a flow manually by clicking on it or automatically at regular intervals. The function
    nodes allow JavaScript code to be run on the messages passed through it. Furthermore,
    dashboard nodes allow us to display data [26]. In this work, we wired up input,
    output, and processing nodes to create needed flows for data preprocessing, processing,
    storage, and controlling the water pumps and the lighting system, as well as sending
    alerts. The deployed Node-Red flow construction of our irrigation control system
    is depicted in Fig. 6. FIGURE 6. NodeRED irrigation control flow construction.
    Show All SECTION III. Related Work Several studies have been carried out in Smart
    Agriculture (SA). Authors in [27] covered state of the art in SA systems from
    a big data perspective. Their work aimed at introducing big data processing into
    SA. Besides, the authors presented a detailed evolution of the different agricultural
    systems was presented. It showed that SA could explore the full potential of information
    communication technology (ICT) by using various data sources. In [28], D. Glaroudis
    et al. provided a detailed survey about the most used messaging protocols in IoT
    applications. Based on the up-to-date references, they introduced, analyzed, and
    compared six protocols: Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), Message Queuing
    Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), Extensible
    Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), WebSocket, and Data Distribution Service
    (DDS). The performance comparison was based on throughput, latency, power consumption,
    bandwidth, reliability, and security. The main challenges that are and will be
    raised by SA applications were also presented in this paper to provide a solid
    basis for realistic implementation options for SA applications. Authors in [29]
    highlighted the importance of IoT and WSN in precision agriculture. The development
    of a low-cost system that monitors, controls, and makes decisions, was presented.
    According to the results, the deployed system showed meaningful improvement in
    the efficiency of resources usage and crops production. Another model of a low-cost,
    effective irrigation system for enhancing cotton production using wireless sensors
    was proposed in [30]. The proposed wireless sensor showed excellent efficiency
    in monitoring the soil water tension, thus implementing an effective irrigation
    scheduling protocol. Authors in [31] deployed small-sized and low-cost WSN nodes
    to improve potato yield by monitoring the field. This study presented a model
    for irrigation management based on mathematical estimations of the agricultural
    parameters. The obtained results ensure better crop yield quality even under stressful
    environmental conditions. Besides, the irrigation system efficiency showed an
    increase that goes up to 10%. In [32], the authors concluded that environmental
    conditions monitoring is crucial to increasing agricultural yield. In this direction,
    a smart system was deployed to monitor soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and
    the movement of animals in the field. The system used Arduino-based sensors. Besides,
    the suggested system deployed an Android mobile application that schedules the
    irrigation, visualizes real-time data, and alerts the farmer in case of any discrepancy.
    The IoT-based SA system farmer-friendly, which is an intelligent system for monitoring
    the concentration of nitrates in groundwater without human intervention, has been
    established in [33]. The proposed approach was based on WSN using Wi-Fi and LoRa
    for data communication. The results demonstrated that the model is ambitious and
    can be adopted by the farmers on large scales. The authors in [34] performed an
    experimental comparison of IoT devices with solar energy harvesting. For the sake
    of the comparison, they used three different communication technologies: Wi-Fi,
    LoRaWan, and ZigBee. The results proved that LoRaWan was the best solution for
    agricultural monitoring when prioritizing network lifetime. The research work
    in [35] defined SA as the application of modern ICT into agriculture. They presented
    the usable IoT hardware and software for smart agriculture and shared interesting
    results. A practical solution for sustainable irrigation in hyper-arid regions
    was proposed in [36]. The suggested solution is based on fuzzy logic combined
    with WSN. According to the results, vast amounts of water and energy were saved
    through effective irrigation scheduling and management processes. For environmental
    sustainability, authors in [37] developed a system that retrieves real-time data
    and uses it to accurately determine the amount of water needed to irrigate the
    garden. The results of this real-world prototype showed savings between 26% and
    34% in water consumption. Still, the results depend on whether the temperature
    sensor is used alone or humidity and soil moisture sensors. Similar to Industry
    4.0 [38], “Agri-Food 4.0” was introduced in [39]. Inspired by the concept of “agriculture
    4.0”, it aims to meet the challenge of enhancing the performance of the agricultural
    supply chain using efficient and effective methods and procedures. The authors
    have conducted a comparative analysis of more than 100 research papers on the
    new technologies and the latest available supply chain approaches. This analysis
    aims to prospect the future of Agri-Food and answer the relevant outstanding questions,
    e.g., how Agri-Food can better support supply chain decision-making? Escamilla-García
    et al. in [40] proposed the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in precision
    agriculture. According to the authors, these models can be developed to adapt
    to new technologies such as IoT, Big Data, and Machine Learning (ML) and eventually
    improve the agriculture field. The feedforward architecture is predominant in
    most of the works analyzed in this paper, while the recurrent and hybrid neural
    networks are less used. The benefits and shortcomings of using ANNs in different
    greenhouses applications such as microclimate prediction, control of carbon dioxide,
    and energy expenses are also featured. In [41], the authors proposed Agrinex,
    a modern irrigation mechanism that helps preserve resources by using WSAN. This
    mechanism can be an alternative to the traditional methods used to control agricultural
    irrigation. Agrinex is based on a mesh network consisting of nodes distributed
    in the field and act simultaneously as sensors detecting soil moisture, temperature,
    and humidity. Some nodes of the mesh network act as actuators that control the
    valves of the drip irrigation system. The results show that Agrinex is a promising
    start for many other WSAN applications in the agricultural sector. A GSM-based
    smart irrigation system was presented in [42]. GSM was used to communicate environmental
    data such as the soil moisture, the temperature in the field, the solar power
    data, and the status of the water pumps. Fuzzy Logic control has been exploited
    in this study to take input from sensors (soil moisture, temperature, and humidity)
    and decide on the water pump status as output. This system has several advantages.
    The most important ones are the availability of a mobile application to remotely
    monitor the irrigation system and its ability to switch Off the water pumps when
    expected to rain. Compared to manual flooding, the results showed that this smart
    system proved its efficiency in conserving water and energy. A system that relies
    on solar energy to cope with water and energy shortages was developed in [43].
    This system uses Wi-Fi technology to provide the control unit with data related
    to the soil and the weather in the field where they are deployed to decide whether
    to send a switch On command to the pumps to irrigate the area or not. Besides,
    the designed controller monitors the water level in the well and operates in three
    different modes: manual mode, mobile control mode, and fuzzy logic control mode.
    The developed prototype solely relied on solar energy. Moreover, it successfully
    proved its efficiency in providing the appropriate conditions for the plants without
    wasting water and energy. In [44], Y. P. Lin et. argue that the next step in the
    evolution in Smart Agriculture will consist of blockchain usage. They proposed
    an ICT e-agriculture system using blockchain infrastructure. SECTION IV. System
    Architecture and Design Our proposed system consists of seven main elements, see
    Fig. 7: Data Acquisition: It is a Wireless Sensor Network that senses the environment
    data and sends it to the gateway [45]. Big Data Analytics Platform (BDAP): The
    unit responsible for data storage, visualization, and processing. In addition
    to that, this platform controls the drip irrigation and lighting system within
    the farm. We deployed this component using a Raspberry Pi along with Node-Red.
    The latter is a local server containing a control unit running algorithms to decide
    whether to pump water from groundwater to basin via water pump #1 or from basin
    to the drip irrigation system via water pump # Wireless Actuator Network (WAN):
    It consists of actuators carrying out decisions issued by the BDAP by switching
    On/Off the water pumps and the lighting bulbs. The actuators are wirelessly connected
    to the BDAP [46]. Renewable Energy: These are solar panels that constitute the
    renewable power source for the farm and battery. Storage Unit: The element responsible
    for storing extra electrical energy produced by the solar panels and reusing it
    when needed to operate the water pumps and lighting. It consists of a Lithium
    battery. Control Unit: It decides whether to forward the produced electricity
    to the Smart Farm or store it in the batteries for future use. Cluster Controller:
    It is responsible for collecting and filtering data related to the smart grid
    and sending it to the Cloud-based IoT platform in real-time mode [47]. FIGURE
    7. IoT based smart agriculture: Testbed general architecture. Show All Our proposed
    system is meant to cope with the rapidly growing need for water-table by controlling
    water pumping, overcoming the shortage in electricity by integrating renewable
    energy, and promoting rational usage of water by regulating drip irrigation. The
    following sections shed further light on the main functionalities of our system.
    A. Data Acquisition The data acquisition is composed of wireless sensors and actuators.
    As depicted in Fig. 8, a sensor node is composed of three elements: Sensor modules:
    soil moisture sensor deployed in the field, temperature, and humidity sensor (DHT11)
    which measures the ambient air temperature and humidity, PIR sensor which detects
    the existence of humans by sensing motion, and for the fields’ security reason,
    the fire sensor is used to detect the presence of a flame or fire, the Ultrasonic
    HC-SR04 sensor which measures the water level in the basin, and the AC sensor
    which measures pumps’ power consumption. Microcontroller: an Arduino Nano board
    that connects all the components is used in this study. Communication module:
    It is responsible for transceiving data between sensors and the BDAP. In this
    study Zigbee module (Xbee series 2 S2C) was used. FIGURE 8. Data flow: from sensors
    to the cloud. Show All In anticipation of any power failure in sunlight deficiency,
    all nodes are powered with an IoT solar system (solar panel 20W, solar battery
    charger, and 25Ah battery). This method makes the WSN data acquisition system
    ideal for agriculture as it can be easily deployed everywhere independently of
    the power installation. This energy harvesting system can guarantee up to 5 days
    of total autonomy for each sensor node. B. Sensor Node Configuration The WSN was
    implemented as a mesh topology using a scalable and reliable firmware named Digimesh.
    Each sensor node can act as a sensor and a router in this configuration using
    the Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol [10]. In the current
    study, five wireless sensor nodes were deployed. These send real-time data to
    the BDAP every 15 minutes through the gateway device (sink node) that connects
    the WSN and the BDAP, see Fig. 9. FIGURE 9. Wireless mesh network architecture.
    Show All The wireless actuator nodes we used to control the water pumps are smart
    relays (Sonoff with integrated ESP8266 Wi-Fi Card [48]). These are WiFi-based
    wireless smart switches that operate with a voltage range of 90-250v AC and a
    wireless frequency of 2.4GHz and are compatible with a wide range of appliances.
    We adopted this smart switch as it is cost-effective, reliable, and provides an
    integrated Wi-Fi module. In addition, ensuring communication with the BDAP as
    the Wi-Fi connection might not be available. We enhanced the data acquisition
    and control unit by replacing Sonoff’s smart relay module with a standard relay
    5V connected to an Arduino Nano microcontroller equipped with a GSM/GPRS module
    or a Zigbee module. Fig. 10. shows the wireless sensors used to collect data from
    the field, Fig. 11. shows the wireless sensors used to monitor the water level
    in the basin and the water pump’s energy consumption, and Fig. 12 shows the wireless
    actuator nodes that act on the water pumps to switch them On/Off. FIGURE 10. In-field

    All C. Big Data Analytics Platform Big Data Analytics Platform (BDAP) is the backbone
    of the proposed system. The developed BDAP is based on Node-RED and tested locally
    on a RaspberryPi 3 board running Raspbian OS. Besides, we installed the message
    broker Eclipse-Mosquitto that implements the IoT publish-subscribe messaging protocol
    (MQTT). Following are the main functionalities of our BDAP. 1) Real-Time Data
    Collection and Storage The BDAP receives real-time data from three sources. DigiMesh
    sensors network is distributed in the field to collect and send data to the gateway.
    This data is then forwarded to the BDAP through the USB serial port. Wireless
    sensor/actuator nodes are deployed in groundwater sources and basins. They are
    connected to Wi-Fi using the ESP8266 module, and they communicate with BDAP using
    the MQTT communication protocol. OpenWeatherMap online forecasting portal: it
    provides up to 5 days forecast of temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure,
    and precipitation. 2) Real-Time Data Visualisation The proposed BDAP contains
    a NodeRED dashboard that displays the acquired data from the different sources
    through a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). The main characteristics
    of the GUI are: Visualizing data over short, medium, and long-term periods (daily,
    monthly, and yearly) in charts form. Allowing the user to remotely act on the
    pumps by switching them On/Off via graphical command buttons. Securing data access
    by prompting the user to authenticate through password-secured sessions. Fig.
    13 depicts the interactive real-time control GUI, which displays the real-time
    soil moisture average, temperature average, water level in the basin, irrigation
    duration, rain precipitation, and the state of water pumps (On/Off). The NodeRED
    dashboard was deployed using flowchart programming. FIGURE 13. Real-time control
    interface. Show All 3) Real-Time Irrigation and Water Level Control The control
    flow of the proposed smart irrigation system is presented in Fig. 14. It has two
    primary sequences: 1. Irrigation control (in green), and 2. water level control
    (in blue). FIGURE 14. Deployed system control-flow diagram. Show All a: Real-Time
    Irrigation Control We are adopting fuzzy logic in deploying this component, and
    we dubbed it the Fuzzy Irrigation Control Unit (FICU). The BDAP starts by retrieving
    predicted precipitation data for the next 24 hours from OpenWeatherMap. Depending
    on provided data, two cases are possible: If it is predicted to rain, the FICU
    decides to switch Off the basin waterpump #2 as the rain will likely irrigate
    the field. else, the FICU proceeds as follows: It retrieves the actual soil moisture
    and ambient temperature (Ta) from the wireless sensor nodes and computes their
    average values. The computed average soil moisture is compared to the desired
    one that varies depending on the plant type. In this study, the desired soil moisture
    is set to 60%. The FICU computes a new variable named Soil Moisture Difference
    (SMD). SMD is the difference between the real-time soil moisture average and the
    desired one. If SMD is ≤ 0, FICU uses SMD and Ta to generate the irrigation duration
    (Id) based on the rules mentioned in Table 1. For instance, “If SMD ≪<0 , and
    Ta is Cold, then Id is set to Short”. Then, waterpump #2 is turned On for Id minutes
    to irrigate the field. If SMD >0, the waterpump #2 is turned Off. TABLE 1 Fuzzy
    Rules of Irrigation Duration The use of Ta alongside SMD by FICU is meant to reduce
    water evapotranspiration at high temperatures. FICU comprises four components,
    see Fig. 15: 1. fuzzification module, 2. The Max-Min Inference Engine, 3. The
    Mamdani-type rule base module, and 4. The Centroid defuzzification module. FIGURE
    15. Fuzzy irrigation controller architecture. Show All The inputs and output membership
    functions of the FICU are depicted in Fig. 16. The fuzzification/defuzzification
    of inputs/output is done using trapezoidal and triangular membership functions.
    FIGURE 16. Fuzzy sets memberships functions. Show All Only three membership functions
    were used for each input to improve the program execution speed and avoid the
    memory backlog [36]. However, five membership functions were used for the output
    to cover all variations of Id. b: Real-Time Water Level Control Drip irrigation
    using basins is the most used irrigation method in agriculture. This method has
    several advantages and drawbacks as well. Advantages: Collecting rainwater: by
    collecting rainwater, water table resources are saved, and energy use is reduced.
    Improving water quality: when water is kept in basins, it becomes more oxygenated,
    thus becoming more beneficial for the plants [49]. Drawbacks: Permanent supervision
    cost: This is the sole drawback. Conventional Water Level (WL) control requires
    permanent human supervision, increasing the cost of the products. Our BDAP monitors
    WL in basins based on real-time data provided by a WL sensor to minimize the additional
    cost due to supervision. The blue part in Fig. 14 shows the WL control flowchart.
    Once the field is watered, the BDAP checks the WL value of the basin. If WL <
    50 %, waterpump #1 is turned On. Then, water is pumped from the groundwater source
    to fill the basin to the maximum. Once at maximum, a switch Off command is sent
    to waterpump #1. The whole water irrigation and water level control process is
    regularly repeated (see Fig. 14). We fixed the cycle duration to one hour. The
    solar system used in this study is shown in Fig. 17. It consists of a DC/AC inverter,
    an AC/DC inverter, electrical protection, and a lithium battery. FIGURE 17. Solar
    system real-world deployment. Show All The real-world deployment of the proposed
    SA system is depicted in Fig. 18. The setup consists of solar panels, WSN, IoT
    solar panels with batteries and water pumps. FIGURE 18. Smart agriculture real-world
    deployment. Show All SECTION V. Results & Discussions In order to evaluate our
    system, real-time data was continuously collected remotely via the settled WSN
    over five days in July 2020. Collected data include soil moisture, temperature,
    irrigation duration, water level, solar panels energy production, and the energy
    consumption of waterpump #2. The relevant data variances are depicted in Figures
    19, 20, 21, 22, and 23. FIGURE 19. Real-time temperature and soil moisture averages.
    Show All FIGURE 20. Real-time soil moisture using the traditional irrigation system.

    All FIGURE 22. Real-time water level and groundwater pump state. Show All FIGURE
    23. Real-time PV power production and waterpump #2 energy consumption. Show All
    In Fig. 19, depicting the temperature and soil moisture variances, we notice that
    the day temperature rose to 40 °C, and the nocturnal temperature ranged between
    15 and 20 °C. Unlike conventional irrigation systems (depicted in Fig. 20), the
    soil moisture is optimal and closer to the desired value (60%), and it stays within
    the range of 57%-65%. In conventional irrigation systems, represented in Fig.
    20, the soil moisture varies from 0%-100%. In Fig. 20, we track the real-time
    soil moisture in traditional irrigation systems within five days. This method
    consists of irrigating the field for two consecutive hours daily. The results,
    in Fig. 20, underpin the following drawbacks: The plant is either over or under
    irrigated since the soil moisture varies between those extreme values, and the
    optimal value (60%) is not maintained for an extended period. The quality and
    quantity of the yield would be negatively affected since the soil moisture reaches
    0% for at least five hours each day. High water and energy consumption: in five
    days, 2400L were consumed, which is equivalent to 480L/day for an area of 25m2.
    The last average is used later to evaluate our system compared to conventional
    irrigation in the same region. Our proposed system reacts to weather changes with
    high precision. It raises the soil moisture to 65% during high temperatures (to
    avoid evapotranspiration losses) and does not exceed 62%-63% in low temperatures.
    To study the impact of the irrigation duration on soil moisture, we tracked the
    relevant variances as depicted in Fig. 21. Accordingly, whenever there is a decrease
    in soil moisture, the FICU computes the desired irrigation period to meet the
    desired moisture value and sends a switch On signal to the wireless actuator attached
    to waterpump #2. Accordingly, the higher the temperature is, the longer the irrigation
    duration becomes. When raising the irrigation periods, the evapotranspiration
    losses are reduced, and as a result, the desired soil moisture is continuously
    maintained. Thus, better conditions are provided to the plant, consequently increasing
    the yield’s quality and quantity. Monitoring and controlling the water level in
    the basin is crucial for controlling the drip irrigation system. In this experiment,
    we continuously track the basin water, which varies according to the irrigation
    periods computed by the FICU. For instance, as shown in Fig. 22, when the water
    level exceeds the set threshold (50% in our case), waterpump #1 is turned Off;
    otherwise, waterpump #1 is switched On until the basin is reached entirely complete.
    Thus, the obtained results are consistent with the water level control previously
    presented in section IV. We used a water pump with a water flow rate of 240 L/hour
    in our experiment. Within five days, the total Id was 169 minutes, and 676 L were
    consumed during this time. This rate is equivalent to 135.2 L/day consumed over
    the same area of 25 m2. Accordingly, our proposed smart agriculture system provides
    the field with an average of 54 m3/hectare per day. This water consumption is
    3.55 times lower than in the traditional irrigation system, and thus the energy
    consumption as well since used pumps are electrical ones. Therefore, we conclude
    that the traditional irrigation system is ineffective in maintaining soil moisture
    at the desired value. In addition, it is wasting water and energy resources. The
    real-time energy consumption of waterpump #2 measured by AC sensor and the real-time
    solar panels’ energy production measured by a smart energy meter within five days
    are presented in Fig. 23. We notice from this figure that the maximum energy consumption
    and maximum solar energy production are reached simultaneously (between 12:00
    pm and 4:00 pm). From this figure, we also conclude that the integration of solar
    energy is suitable for smart agriculture without implementing an extensive storage
    system(batteries). In the design of our SA prototype, the cost has been reduced
    to the minimum possible to make it affordable and widely adopted even by small
    and medium farmers. The unit price for every single component is presented in
    Table 2. TABLE 2 Unit Price of the Different Components The total cost of designing
    our SA Prototype with a RaspberryPi, five wireless sensor nodes, 5 IoT solar panels
    and batteries, two smart relays, and a Zigbee gateway is $ 609, which is much
    cheaper than other existing solutions in the market. The proposed SA system is
    an up-and-coming solution for many reasons: Better quantity and quality production.
    Less energy and water consumption. Cost-effectiveness. Open-source. Eco-friendly.
    Easy monitoring (less effort). Designed to promote scalability. SECTION VI. Conclusion
    This paper developed, presented, and deployed an open-source and easy-to-deploy
    smart agriculture system with the main drivers of cost-effectiveness, water consumption
    optimization, and renewable energy integration. The deployed SA system leverages
    up-to-date ICT. We used IoT devices for data acquisition and control (sensors
    and actuators). We also used Cloud Computing for data processing, visualization,
    and data storage. Besides, we recurred to fuzzy logic to implement a fuzzy irrigation
    control unit that decides on the appropriate Id (Irrigation Duration) based on
    real-time processed data. This approach saves water and energy and provides adequate
    conditions for the plants, thus optimizing crops’ yield. Furthermore, this allows
    better monitoring for the water level in the basin and adheres to the conventional
    eco-friendly trend of sustainable agriculture through its total reliance on solar
    energy. The case study results show that our proposed solution is promising compared
    to the traditional irrigation system due to its cost-effectiveness and ability
    to reduce water/energy consumption by 71.8%. As future work, we are paving the
    way towards scaling up our system by deploying our solution in several farms in
    the region, allowing our BDAP (Big Data Analytics Platform) to collect big real-time
    data about water-table usage in the region. Thus appropriate irrigation strategies
    can be derived and analyzed. Besides, we plan further experimentation to enhance
    solar energy production and storage. We will also integrate LoRa wireless sensors/actuators
    network and develop a machine learning system that predicts soil moisture, energy
    production, and energy consumption within a few days. The machine learning algorithm
    can adapt to different crop requirements in moisture levels and improve crop yield.

    1. Introduction The major rabi (winter season) crop in India is wheat (Triticum
    aestivum L.), followed by barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), mustard (Brassica juncia
    L.) and maize (Zea mays L.) which are grown after the harvest of predominant kharif
    (rainy season) rice (Oryza sativa L.). The harvesting of long duration rice cultivars
    is generally delayed. Hence, sowing of next rabi crops are getting delayed due
    to adoption of conventional tillage (CT) practices in the Indo-Gangetic Plains
    (IGP). In CT, the traditional practice of opening and turning the soil greatly
    pays towards the quick oxidation of soil organic matter (Gathala et al., 2011)
    and it includes high labour and energy input, consequently resulting in poor productivity
    and economic earnings of the farmers (Aryal et al., 2015). The tillage operations
    are energy and input intensive and create difficulty in the timely seeding of
    the next crop (Jat et al., 2009). The conservation agriculture (CA) is valuable
    as it improves soil quality by enhancing C sequestration, increased water and
    nitrogen use efficiency and saving fuel consumption. All these lead to mitigate
    greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agriculture (Kumar et al., 2018). The location
    specific and finest management package is required to be developed for mitigating
    GHG emissions from CA in different crops. The significant environmental benefits
    have been reported under CA (Kassam et al., 2012). The grasping of soil organic
    carbon (SOC) is definitely one of the main benefits under CA systems. Some studies
    show that various types of tillage systems strongly increase short-term CO2 emissions
    (Álvaro-Fuentes et al., 2007; López-Garrido et al., 2009) and no-till systems
    are known for being more cost-effective technology (Gonzalez-Sanchez et al., 2015).
    Research findings suggest that under various tillage and soil management practices,
    CO2 emissions have been influenced by interaction of crop and soil quality (González-Sánchez
    et al., 2012; Aguilera et al., 2013). Adoption of CA practices reduces GHG emissions
    from the soil, which improves productivity under climate change. The mitigation
    and adaptation of climate change was reported under zero tillage (ZT) which was
    the most environmentally friendly technology among different tillage practices
    (Busari et al., 2015). Several researchers indicated that the greatest portion
    of emission from crop production is related to the use of machinery, diesel, electricity,
    fertilizers, seeds, and pesticides (Alimagham et al., 2017; Sarauskis et al.,
    2018). The highest GHG emissions was reported from nitrogen fertilizers (40.9–65.7%),
    followed by diesel (Lu et al., 2018). To mitigate the impact of agriculture on
    the environment, it is urgently required to reduce diesel consumption and increase
    water use efficiency through adoption of CA practices (i.e. no/minimum tillage
    operations) as CT consumes substantial quantities of diesel fuel. It was reported
    that CT typically consumed 29–59% of the diesel fuel (Sarauskis et al., 2014).
    Alternatively, crop establishment practices which led no or minimum number of
    tillage operations, result in lower energy use and reduce GHG emissions (Alam
    et al., 2015; Gathala et al., 2016; Hossen et al., 2018). Conservation agriculture
    encourages the adoption of minimal soil disturbance, maintenance of ground cover,
    and rotation of crops for a smallholder farm (Kassam et al., 2018). The CA management
    was demonstrated to produce higher crop yields and profit with lower global warming
    potential than conventional practice across South Asia (Ladha et al., 2015). Many
    other researchers also reported these findings (Padre et al., 2016; Islam et al.,
    2019). Crop cultivation includes numerous operations like tillage, manuring (application
    of organic manures), fertilizer application (mineral fertilizers), irrigation,
    inter-cultural operations, etc. These practices contribute to GHGs emissions and
    have negative impact on the environment. Apart from cost of cultivation, soil
    tillage operation is also a major contributor to GHG emissions in crop production
    (Tjandra et al., 2016). In rice based cropping systems CA in both crops or in
    rabi crop can lower the total energy requirements by 13.2%, CO2-eq emissions by
    13.9% and increase energy use efficiency (EUE) and energy productivity (EP) by
    17% compared with CT (Jat et al., 2020). The savings in total energy use were
    mainly due to savings of fuel and labor under CA compared to CT (Gathala et al.,
    2020). Nandan et al. (2021) in the rice-based cropping system observed that conservation-tillage
    treatments increased grain and straw/stover yields of crops, eventually increased
    the output energy (6–16%), net energy (14–26%), energy ratio (25–33%), and energy
    productivity (23–34%) compared with farmers’ practice in the eastern IGP. Hence
    identification of a tillage system with higher crop productivity, energy output,
    energy use, lower energy and carbon input is the need of the hour. The emission
    of GHGs, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) has
    caused global warming and associated variation in climate in the present scenario.
    The Indian agriculture contributes to around 14% of the country''s total GHG emission
    (MoEFCC, 2021), mostly due to livestock rearing, low land and irrigated rice cultivation,
    nitrogenous fertilizer use and burning of crop residues. Within agriculture, in
    2016, 54.6% of GHG emissions were due to enteric fermentation, followed by 17.5%
    from rice cultivation, 19.1% from fertilizer applied to agricultural soils, 6.7%
    from manure management, and 2.2% due to field burning of agricultural residues
    (MoEFCC, 2021). Submerged rice cultivation is a principal source of CH4 emission,
    whereas usage of nitrogenous fertilizers leads to N2O emission. CO2 is also emitted
    due to usage of fossil fuel during farm machineries operations in the field and
    due to crop residues burning. Tillage operations emit GHGs notably, N2O and CO2.
    The GHG emission is mainly influenced by the type of inputs used for production,
    such as fertilizers, pesticides, organic manure, fossil fuels, machinery and irrigation
    methods (Soni et al., 2013). The reduction of GHG emissions have been reported
    in minimum tillage by using less fossil fuel in field preparation and by higher
    carbon sequestration in soil. A life cycle GHG emission estimation by farm efficiency
    analysis tool (FEAT) calculated 1987, 1992 and 2028 kg CO2eq ha−1 for ZT, minimum
    tillage (MT) and CT practices, respectively, in wheat cultivation of Bangladesh
    (Rahman et al., 2021). However, crop residues mulching in reduced tillage resulted
    carbon loss to the atmosphere due to decomposition (Petersen et al., 2008). But,
    Pisante et al. (2014) confirmed that CA leads to lower GHG emissions, reduced
    fertilizer use, and higher terrestrial carbon sequestration. A summary of the
    literature review revealed that energy efficient technologies help to identify
    or develop more with low adverse environmental impacts and improvement in natural
    resource conservation (Traista et al., 2009). Several studies have reported energy
    indices and GHG emission under different agricultural crop production systems
    (Camargo et al., 2013; Schmer et al., 2014; Takashima et al., 2016; Basavalingaiah
    et al., 2020). Jat et al. (2020), in the IGP, observed that CA-based cereal (rice/maize)
    systems recorded higher net energy and energy-intensiveness levels of 251% and
    300%, respectively, compared with those of the CT-based rice-wheat system. The
    investigation of energy in agricultural systems is one of the expectable approaches
    to assess the energy efficiency and their effect on environment (Sørensen et al.,
    2015; Jat et al., 2020). Energy efficient technologies help to identify or develop
    more with low adverse environmental impacts and improvement in natural resource
    conservation (Lazaroiulgh et al., 2009; Bojaca and Schrevens, 2010). Limited information
    is available on the potential benefits of long-term CA on energy efficiency, C
    sustainability index and global warming potential (GWP) of different rabi crops
    in the IGP. Hence, a scientific evaluation is required to decrease input energy
    in different farm activities, such as land preparation, fertilizers and agro-chemicals
    application and irrigation to enhance energy-use efficiency and to reduce GWP
    of these operations. Therefore, the present study was carried out with the following
    objectives: (i) to find out the most energy use efficient CA based rabi crop that
    has least GWP in the IGP and (ii) to assess the carbon efficiency in term of GHG
    emissions, carbon input and output as affected by different tillage practices
    under rabi crop production of the IGP. We hypothesized that barley and mustard
    production would have less GWP than wheat, due to less use of mineral fertilizers
    in former crops. We also hypothesized that in different rabi crops (as wheat,
    maize, barely and mustard), long term CA practice (conservation tillage as NT/HT)
    would save input energy increase productivity and would have higher energy use
    efficiency and lower GWP than CT. In this paper we analyze and present energy
    dynamics (mainly energy use efficiency), C sustainability index and GHG emission
    under CA based rabi season crops cultivation. In order to achieve the objective,
    the effect of tillage and residue mulching in different rabi crops on energy balance,
    carbon footprints and carbon use efficiency (of rabi crops) under rice-based cropping
    system was estimated. There were three tillage systems, such as no tillage without
    residues (NT), NT with crop residues retention (HT) and conventional tillage (CT).
    There were four rabi crops: wheat, winter maize, barley and mustard. The present
    study was conducted for 11 rabi seasons in the rice-based cropping system with
    an aim to identify an environmental friendly practice with higher crop productivity
    and lower GHGs emission and energy use and to ascertain the rabi crop with lower
    GHGs emission and energy use, for the small and marginal farm lands of the IGP.
    Energy indices (net energy, energy use efficiency, energy productivity and specific
    energy), global warming potential and carbon footprint (C input, C output, C sustainability
    index and C efficiency ratio) as affected by different rabi crops cultivation
    and tillage and residue management practices were evaluated. The obtained results
    (including the N2O emission) were discussed after evaluating the relationships
    among net return energy, energy dynamics and GHG emission, C input and C output.
    2. Material and method 2.1. Experimental details A field experiment was conducted
    during rabi (November to March) seasons form 2007–19 (11 rabi seasons) on a Typic
    Ustochrept at the research farm of the Indian Institute of Farming Systems Research,
    Modipuram, Meerut (UP), India located at northwest India, Meerut (29° 40′ N, 77°
    40’ E, 237 m above sea level). The climate of the region is semi-arid subtropical,
    with dry hot summers and cool winter. The average monthly minimum and maximum
    temperatures in January (the coolest month) were 7.2 °C and 20.1 °C, respectively.
    The corresponding temperatures in May (the hottest month) were 24.2 °C and 39.8
    °C, respectively. The rainfall and minimum and maximum temperatures during growing
    seasons of crops were recorded at the meteorological observatory located at the
    farm. The average seasonal rainfalls during rainy season (July–October) and rabi
    season (November to April) were about 583 and 80 mm, respectively. Three tillage
    systems, no tillage (NT), no tillage with residues (HT) system, and conventional
    tillage (CT) were employed as main plots in four crops in a split-plot design
    with three replications. Each plot was 16 m × 4 m. In NT, wheat was sown directly
    without any tillage and crop residues were removed. However, in HT system, it
    was sown with NT with retention of previous crop (rice) residues (at 6 t ha−1).
    In CT, 2 harrowing +2 tine cultivating along with rotavator for clods crushing
    were performed before planting by zero-till drill. The harrowing and cultivating
    operations were carried out using a tractor mounted disc harrow and tine-cultivator,
    respectively, which were conventionally used by farmers of the region (Table .1).
    Use of other machineries, such as plant protection device (i.e. sprayer), thresher,
    and water pump were same in all tillage treatments. Table 1. Details of treatments

    H = Harrowing, C = Cultivator, R = Rotavator, HT = Happy turbo seeder, CT = conventional
    tillage. The four crops were sown as sub-plots in each tillage system i.e. wheat
    (Triticum aestivum); winter maize (Zea mays); barley (Hordeum vulgare) and mustard
    (Brassica juncea). The sowing of wheat and barley was performed by a zero-till
    drill and that of winter maize and mustard by using a multi crop zero till drill.
    Wheat (PBW-343), maize (Naveen), barley (K-508) and mustard (Pusa bold) were sown
    as per recommended package and practices with seed rate at 100, 25, 100, 6 kg/ha
    and line spacing of 20, 60, 20 and 45 cm, respectively. The recommended fertilizer
    dose for wheat and maize (120:60:40 kg NPK ha−1), barley (60:30:20 kg NPK ha−1),
    and mustard (80:40:40 kg NPK ha−1) were applied as basal and top dressing. Glyphosate
    (N-(phosphonomethyl)-glycine) at 1.2 kg active ingredient ha−1 was applied before
    seeding in addition to above post emergence non-selective herbicides in NT and
    HT systems in all crops. In wheat, the chemical weed control was applied using
    Sulfosulfuron at 25 g active ingredient ha−1 + Metsulfuran methyl at 4.00 g active
    ingredient ha−1 at 30 days after sowing (DAS) followed by one spot hand weeding
    on 40–45 DAS. The weed control in maize, atrazine at 0.28 kg/ha a.i. as pre-emergence
    on 3–5 DAS was applied using backpack knapsack sprayer fitted with a flat fan
    nozzle using 500 L of water/ha followed by one spot hand weeding on 30–35 DAS.
    In mustard, two spot manual hand weeding were done after 30 and 45 DAS. The insecticides
    and fungicides were applied as needed following crop wise recommendation. The
    depth of irrigation water (5 ± 2 cm) was applied in wheat, maize and barley, whereas
    in mustard, it was applied at (3 ± 2 cm) irrigation depth, and total 3 to 6 irrigations
    were given (as per crop) using an electric operated submersible pump. In the second
    to third week of April, all crops were harvested manually and threshed using a
    tractor operated multi-crop thresher. The yields in term of grain and biomass
    of all treatments were recorded at 12% moisture content. Detail of all agronomic
    practices and tillage systems as per treatment wise is presented in summarized
    form in Table 1. 2.2. Energy dynamic analysis All inputs used in each treatment
    and output data were converted to energy equivalent using standard energy coefficient
    for Indian context (Table 2). In this study, however, most relevant energy coefficient
    values to Indian context were used to estimate energy equivalent. The key inputs
    used in production of all four crops (i.e. wheat, maize, barley and mustard) were
    recorded in unit area basis as human labour (h), machinery operation (h), fossil
    fuel i.e. diesel (l), farmyard manure (FYM, kg), mineral fertilizers (kg), seeds
    and pesticides (kg), irrigation water (m3) and electricity (Kwh). However, grain
    and straw yields were determined as outputs. The energy efficiency of all production
    crops were assessed based on the input–output analysis. Table 2. Energy coefficient

    in the farm machinery operation of tillage, planting and threshing, human labour
    and electricity used) and indirect energy (production of fossil fuel, synthetic
    fertilizers, pesticides, farm machinery, seeds, etc.), were considered. The energy
    inputs of human labour were determined in all operations/activities performed
    by human power sources during crop production. The energy equivalent of water
    for irrigation input means indirect energy of irrigation consisting of the energy
    consumed for manufacturing the materials for pumps, and equipment as well as the
    water energy and direct source of energy used in electricity for pumping operation
    using on-farm irrigation systems (Khan et al., 2007). The indirect input energy
    of farm machineries was determined by considering the energy used in manufacturing,
    repair, life and effective field capacity of the machine by using equation (Canakci,
    2010). Embodied energy in machinery was expressed in terms of MJ ha−1. (1) IEmach
    = (MTR x W)/ (L x FCe) Where, IEmach = machinery input energy, (MJ ha−1). MTR
    = input energy usage for manufacturing, transporting and repairing farm machinery/self-propelled
    machines. W = machinery mass (kg). L = Usage life of machinery (h). FCe = effective
    field capacity of farm machinery (h ha−1). The output energy values of seed and
    straw of all rabi crops were determined by multiplying the total grain and biomass
    yield (kg ha−1) with energy coefficient (Table 2). 2.3. Energy indices The different
    energy indices as energy use efficiency (EUE), energy productivity (EP), net energy
    (NE), and specific energy (SE) were computed using the following equations (Asgharipour
    et al., 2012; Yaolin et al., 2019): (2) (3) (4) (5) 2.4. Global warming potential
    (GWP) and carbon indicators Our focus was on two aspects: (i) total GHG emissions
    per unit area of crop cultivation, presented as kg CO2 e ha−1 and (ii) total carbon
    input, output and footprint of carbon as emissions per kg of grain yield, presented
    as kg CO2 e kg−1 of grain. The CO2 equivalents were estimated by converting CO2,
    CH4 and N2O emissions with GWP potential factors of 1, 34, and 298 for CO2, CH4
    and N2O, respectively (Eggleston et al., 2006). Impact of different tillage systems
    for rabi crop cultivation on environment was evaluated by assessing the total
    yield scaled carbon footprint of the crop production. The carbon footprint was
    assessed from selected agronomic inputs used in crop production viz., synthesis
    of mineral fertilizer as nitrogen (N), phosphate (P2O5), potash (K2O), herbicide,
    insecticide, seed, on-farm fuel consumption, electricity used and soil N2O emissions
    were converted to kg CO2 equivalent. The fossil fuel consumption was determined
    due to operations of farm machineries by tractor in different tillage systems,
    sowing and planting, harvesting and threshing operations, etc. The carbon footprint
    linked with agronomic inputs and various farm machinery operations were assessed
    by multiplying the inputs with carbon emission coefficient (CE) and then converted
    into terms of CO2 equivalent (Table 3) (Lal, 2004; Tabatabaie et al., 2012). As
    CE are not available for particular pesticide and herbicide used, the similar
    group of pesticides were considered equivalent coefficient assuming production,
    transportation, storage, and field applications processes were equal (Tabatabaie
    et al., 2012). Table 3. The greenhouse gas emission (GHG) coefficients (kg carbon

    al. (2013) Moreover, GHG emissions by farm machinery jobs and agronomic input
    uses, the both direct and indirect N2O emissions were also considered in total
    CO2 equivalent estimation from applied mineral fertilizers, crop residues and
    crop roots by emission factors (Table) (Lal, 2004; Bhatia et al., 2004). Direct
    N2O emissions comprised of nitrification and denitrification of N from mineral
    fertilizers and crop residues used as mulching. The quantities of retained residues
    were recorded in each treatment. The shoot: root ratios were considered to assess
    the root biomass of the previous rice crop (Tabatabaie et al., 2012). For consequent
    N2O and CO2 equivalent determination, the N2O molecular mass is fixed to 44/28.
    2.4.1. Direct N2O emission The direct soil N2O emissions (N2ODirect) from the
    mineral N fertilizer applied (NSNF), N contents of crop residues mulching and
    left-over soil surface (NCR) and N content from previous crop root in soil (NROOT)
    were estimated following the given relations: (6) (7) where, NSF = Quantity of
    mineral fertilizer N applied to soil in crop production per unit area to account
    for that volatilizes as NH3 and NOx NSNF = Quantity of mineral N fertilizer applied
    in crop cultivation, kg N ha−1 FracGASF = Fertilizer fraction that volatilizes
    as NH3 and NOx. Amounts of volatilization depend on soil management, plant and
    climatic features and the quantity of N applied, pH and moisture of soil and temperature.
    From different Indian studies, it has been assessed the extent of volatilization
    (Sarkar et al., 1991; Bhatia et al., 2004) to be about 15%. In the present estimation,
    the fraction of volatilization is taken as 15% of N applied in place of the default
    value of IPCC (OCED, 1991) of 10%. NCR, the N content in crop residue used as
    mulching on soil surface is determined using the relationship below: (8) where,
    CRST is the amount of crop residue retained on soil surface and FracNCRST is the
    N content of crop residues. EF is the emission factor (0.53%) for N2O–N emitted
    from the various N additions to the soil. Instead of the variations in emissions
    factors of direct emission of N2O, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
    (IPCC) suggested to practice a common default emission factor as 1.25 kg N2O emitted
    per 100 kg N used into soils. Whereas, a specific emission factor of 0.53% was
    recommended for the IGP (Jain et al., 2016). Hence this factor was used for estimation
    of direct emissions. 2.4.2. Indirect soil N2O emissions The indirect N2O emission
    (fraction of leaching and volatilization) factors are variable, indefinite and
    additionally these are affected by different treatments, addition of mineral fertilizers,
    soil types, etc. (Sharma et al., 2011). Indirect soil N2O emissions (N2Oindirect)
    from nitrate leaching, runoff and volatilization of NH3 and NOx were determined
    (Gan et al., 2011) as follows: (9) where, NSNF is quantity of mineral N fertilizer
    applied in crop cultivation, kg N ha−1 and NCR is crop residue N and NROOT is
    previous crop root N, kg N ha−1 EFVD = Volatilization emission factor of NH3,
    and NOx, volatilization emission factor of N2O emission to atmospheric by NH3
    and NOx (considered as 1% as per IPCC default value). In Indian context, the coefficient
    is taken as 0.5% (Bhatia et al., 2004). FracLEACH = All N lost fraction by leaching/runoff,
    (i.e. 10% of the applied N) and EFLEACH = Leaching emission factor, emission factor
    for lost N by leaching and runoff (kg N2O–N kg−1 N, 0.5%) All emission factors
    were listed in Table 4 (IPCC et al., 2006). Table 4. Parameters and emission factors

    2.4.3. Carbon indices In this study, the GHG emissions from different inputs were
    considered as major sources of global warming in different emissions forms through
    common unit (Hülsbergen et al., 2001; Kariyaiah et al., 2020) by multiplying their
    respective coefficients and presenting the result in terms of CO2-equivalent per
    hectare (CO2 eq./ha). The CO2 emission coefficients used are presented in Table
    3. The carbon indices such as carbon input, carbon output, carbon sustainability
    index, and carbon efficiency ratio were estimated using following equations as
    mentioned by Chaudhary et al. (2017): (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) 2.5. Statistical
    analysis The experimental plots were placed as a split-plot block design with
    three replications and all parameters were analyzed. All data on energy dynamics,
    carbon footprint were analyzed using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) for split plot
    design as described by Gomez and Gomez (1984). . Tukey''s Honestly Significant
    Difference (HSD) test was used as a post hoc mean separation test (p < 0.05) using
    SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, USA). The correlation coefficient
    and regression between different energy input and output parameters with carbon
    footprint data were performed using Microsoft Office Excel (2013). 3. Results
    and discussion 3.1. Energy input use pattern The energy use pattern under three
    tillage systems for four different crops in rabi seasons are depicted in Table
    5. The results revealed that input energy (i.e. average of all tillage system)
    was highest in wheat (20,974 MJ ha−1) followed by maize (19,470 MJ ha−1), barley
    (16,319 MJ ha−1) and mustard (11,429 MJ ha−1). However, among tillage systems,
    the input energy was lowest in HT and maximum in CT, irrespective of crop production
    systems. The CT recorded 20, 21 to 22, 25 to 26, 20–22% higher input energy (IE)
    than HT and NT in wheat, maize, barley and mustard, respectively. Among tillage
    systems, CT consumed higher input energy than HT and NT in all crops. It was due
    to higher energy used in land preparation for more diesel consumption under CT,
    more irrigation water energy was consumed and thereby more electricity was used
    in tilled crops. Whereas, no-tilled without residues (NT) and with residues (HT)
    were having no tillage operations before seeding which consumed low quantity of
    irrigation water, thereby less electricity was used. Similar results were also
    reported by Chaudhary et al. (2009), Mansoori et al. (2012) and Pratibha et al.
    (2015). As inputs were used for crop production in different sources, it was revealed
    that highest energy source input was mineral fertilizer which varied from 25%
    to 49% of total input energy in all rabi crops, irrespective of tillage systems
    (Chaudhary et al., 2004). However, the second highest input energy consuming source
    was irrigation energy which ranged from 14% to 44% of total input energy (Khan
    et al., 2007). The irrigation input energy was influenced by different tillage
    systems as well as crops. Among tillage systems, CT recorded higher irrigation
    input energy (ranged from 27 to 45%) than HT (16–33%) and NT (21–34%). The data
    revealed that CT had 23% and 35% higher irrigation energy than NT and HT, respectively,
    in wheat, maize and barley. However, in mustard it was 35% and 52% higher than
    NT and HT, respectively. The share of pesticides (i.e. insecticides, fungicides,
    herbicides, etc.) consumed was higher in case of NT and HT compared with CT in
    all crops due to more herbicides used in no-tilled fields. CT consumed about 46–50%
    lower pesticides than NT and HT in all rabi crops. It was mainly due to higher
    use of herbicides in case of both no-tilled fields compared with tilled fields.
    The input energy used in farm machinery was also higher in CT than NT and HT due
    to various types of machinery (such as harrow, cultivator, rotavator, etc.) used
    for land preparation in CT field. The other input energy as seed and human labours
    were similar in all tillage treatments under all crops. Table 5. Source wise inputs

    input energy that varied from 86 to 93% of total input energy irrespective of
    all crops and tillage systems. However, indirect sources of energy (IDE) also
    used 51–74% of total input energy (Fig. 1). The lowest direct energy source was
    observed in HT and NT and the values were 26–31% less than CT. This was due to
    lower use of fossil fuel in land preparation, sowing operation and electricity
    for irrigation in HT and NT than CT. The renewable sources of energy was only
    6–15% of total input energy (Fig. 2). This indicated lower use of organic fertilizer
    and very less use of renewable sources of energy, such as solar power or wind
    power for irrigation purpose. Download : Download high-res image (324KB) Download

    The estimated energy indices of different tillage systems of four rabi crops are
    depicted in Table 6. The output energy (OE) and net energy return (NRE) were significantly
    higher in HT than NT and CT in all crop production systems. It was due to higher
    yield in adopted conservation tillage technology (HT and NT). The HT produced
    12 and 4, 11 and 4, 16 and 6, and 18 and 6% higher net energy return than CT and
    NT in wheat, maize, barley and mustard, respectively. These results are in agreement
    with findings of Choudhary et al. (2017), who reported that residue cover in NT
    noticed higher energy output and net energy return than CT. Energy use efficiency
    (EUE) was also higher in HT than NT and CT, irrespective of all crops. The energy
    productivity (EP, kg MJ−1) of HT, NT and CT were 0.34, 0.32 and 0.26 in wheat,
    0.37, 0.35 and 0.29 in maize, 0.43, 0.39 and 0.30 in barley and 0.28, 0.26 and
    0.21 in mustard. The EP was significantly greater in HT than CT and the value
    in HT was similar to NT. The significantly higher specific energy (SE, MJ kg−1)
    was observed in CT (3.86, 3.46, 3.38 and 4.85) followed by NT (3.17, 2.87, 2.55
    and 3.83) and HT (2.94, 2.67, 2.35 and 3.58) in wheat, maize, barley and mustard,
    respectively (Table 6). Earlier, it was revealed that greater input energy was
    consumed in CT plots than no tilled systems (NT and HT), irrespective of crops
    grown. On average, among tillage systems, the energy needs for per kg grain yield
    (specific energy, SE) was highest in mustard (4.19) followed by wheat (3.31),
    maize (2.94) and barley (2.75). Whereas, SE values of maize and barley were similar.
    It was due to higher input energy used per kg grain yield of mustard compared
    with other crop systems. The results of this study were similar to other studies
    by Chaudhary et al. (2006); Khan et al. (2007) and Shahan et al. (2008) who observed
    that NT treatment consumed lowest input energy and specific energy. In another
    study by Sarauskis et al. (2020), it was reported that highest energy output,
    energy productivity and energy efficiency ratio were obtained under NT. Table

    emission The GHG emission assessed for tillage systems under various rabi crops
    revealed (Table 7) that CO2 equivalent GHG emissions from different farm inputs
    were major contributors to total GHG emissions. CO2 emission from farm inputs
    used in different treatments for crop cultivation varied between 72 and 80% of
    total GHG emissions and contribution of N2O-based CO2 emissions was low and varied
    between 20 and 28% of total emissions (Table 7). Irrespective of all tillage systems,
    the total GHG emission (kg CO2 equivalent ha−1) was highest in wheat (2,351) followed
    by maize (2,274), barley (1,859) and mustard (1,652). The value of GHG emission
    in wheat was significantly different (P < 0.05) compared to barley and mustard,
    but was similar to maize. Significantly higher GHG emission (kg CO2 equivalent
    ha−1) was recorded in CT (2,996, 2,939, 2504 and 2044) and this was followed by
    HT (2,069, 1,955, 1578 and 1475) and NT (1,987, 1,930, 1495 and 1438) in wheat,
    maize, barley and mustard, respectively. Data revealed that CT produced 31 to
    34, 33 to 34, 37 to 40 and 28–30% higher GHG emission than HT and NT under wheat,
    maize, barley and mustard, respectively. The GHG emission data under NT and HT
    were similar (P < 0.05), but CT had significantly more emission than both treatments.
    Similar results were also reported by Pathak and Wassmann (2007). The lowest CO2
    emission flux was observed from the NT treatment (Bogužas et al., 2018). Table

    0 21 0 139 0 235 2044 Some disparity in GHG emissions under different tillage
    treatments and crops were due to lower fossil fuel consumption (Sadeghinezhad
    et al., 2014) and fewer indirect emissions linked to energy disbursed in manufacture,
    transport, repair and farm machinery use under NT and HT than CT. The higher GHG
    emissions under CT (1057 to 1410 kg CO2 equivalent ha−1), owing to farm machinery
    use, was due to more number and time of machinery used for tillage operation than
    NT and HT. Thereby, it was also noticed that more GHG emissions were through diesel
    fuel consumption for tillage and other operations which contributed in higher
    GHG emissions (i.e. 144–198 kg CO2 equivalent ha−1 in CT compared with 64 kg CO2
    equivalent ha−1 in NT and 60–67 kg CO2 equivalent ha−1 in HT). Sarauskis et al.
    (2017) also reported that CO2 emissions from tractors increased with tillage intensity
    and working depth which directly related to fuel consumption in tillage operation.
    Besides the fuel consumption, electricity used in irrigation contributed more
    GHG emission (i.e. 349 kg CO2 equivalent ha−1 in CT) than NT (91–269 kg CO2 equivalent
    ha−1) and HT (67–228 kg CO2 equivalent ha−1). Similar results were reported by
    Busaria et al. (2015). Moreover, N2O based CO2 emissions were lower in CT and
    NT (i.e. 181–342 kg CO2 equivalent ha−1) than HT (300–407 kg CO2 equivalent ha−1)
    due to residue retention (about 6 t ha−1) under HT. The overall lower emissions
    in NT and HT were due to no fossil fuel consumption in tillage operation (Carbonell-Bojollo
    et al., 2019). The contribution of N2O-based CO2 emissions varied as per application
    of residues on soil (Bhatia et al., 2010; Mutegi et al., 2010). HT recorded 16,
    16, 26 and 22% higher N2O-based CO2 emissions than both NT and CT under wheat,
    maize, barley and mustard, respectively. This was due to N content in retained
    residues. 3.4. Carbon indices The total GHG emissions and carbon indices were
    estimated and presented in Table 8. C input was significantly (P < 0.05) higher
    in CT (817, 801, 683, 557) than HT (564, 533, 40, 402) and NT (542, 526, 408,
    392) in wheat, maize, barley and mustard, respectively. It followed similar pattern
    to total GHG emissions of different treatments. However, significantly higher
    C output was observed in wheat than barley and mustard. Among tillage treatments,
    NT and HT had significantly higher C output values than CT. The higher was the
    quantity of fossil fuel use, more was the farm machinery used in the tillage operation.
    In addition, higher irrigation quantities were responsible for greater GHG emission
    and C input under CT than NT plots. This trend is in agreement with Mohammadi
    et al. (2014). Thus, an appropriate method like reduction of weeds, adoption of
    minimum tillage can decrease the diesel fuel consumption. Furthermore, retaining
    crop residues on soil surface decreased the electricity consumption due to less
    irrigation needed for crop cultivation. Similar data were reported by Dyer et
    al. (2003). The highest C output was observed in HT followed by NT and CT. It
    was due to greater grain yield in HT for all crops. The application of crop residues
    increased the biological activities in the soil hence improved SOC and microbial
    activities, which tend to enhance the yield compared to CT plots. The carbon sustainability
    index (CSI) and carbon efficiency ratio (CER) were significantly higher in HT
    and were similar in NT and CT in all crops. However, GHG emission (kg CO2 eq.
    kg−1 grain yield) was significantly higher in CT followed by NT and HT in all
    treatments. About 34 to 35, 34, 41 to 43, and 32–33% higher GHG emissions (kg
    CO2 eq. kg−1 grain yield) were observed in CT than HT and NT under wheat, maize,
    barley and mustard, respectively (Table 8). However, mustard had significantly
    higher GHG intensity (kg CO2 eq. kg−1 grain; 0.59) followed by wheat (0.37), maize
    (0.35) and barley (0.32). Due to less seed production, mustard had highest GHG
    intensity. The reason for higher GHG intensity per kg grain production under CT
    compared with no-tilled plots (i.e. NT and HT) was due to greater use of farm
    machinery in tillage operations hence higher fossil fuel used, more electricity
    consumed in irrigation of crops due to more number and depth of irrigation in
    all crops (Chaudhary et al., 2017; Pratibha et al., 2015). The lowest environmental
    pollution (i.e. GHG as CO2 eq ha−1) was observed under NT treatment compared to
    intensive tillage system (Sarauskis et al., 2020). Table 8. Greenhouse gas (GHG)

    ratio. 3.5. Uncertainty In crop cultivation major emission was N2O and that was
    from the use of mineral fertilizer and from soil due to excessive tillage operation.
    Emissions depend on quantity of fertilizer used per corps, and specific characteristics
    of a location viz., temperature, soil types, etc. The emission factor depends
    on soil moisture content, rainfall and temperature (Sharma et al., 2011). As per
    available literature, for the N input based direct emissions from managed agricultural
    soils, the IPCC suggests using the default emission factor as 1.25% (EF in IPCC
    tier 1 methodology) in spite of variation in soil pH, temperatures, climatic condition,
    etc. Other studies recommend Indian-specific emission factor is 44% lesser than
    IPCC default emission factor (Dobbie et al., 2003; Lal, 2004). Jain et al. (2016)
    reported an EF of 0.53 in Indian condition. In India, the EF varied from 0.14
    to 12.8%. This approach eliminates factors that have no technique to examine the
    possible effect of future climate and land use change. Moreover, the uncertainty
    may also be due to N2O emissions from field operations. The emissions from mineral
    fertilizers as N, P and K and pesticides use were assessed using the factors reported
    in literature (Shang et al., 2011) as there are no emission factors available
    as per Indian condition. In our research, an innovative effort was given to evaluate
    GWP (by quantifying emission of CO2, N2O and CH4) of the tillage practices of
    different rabi season crops, emissions of GHGs from soils and all field activities
    followed to grow wheat, maize, barley and mustard under a sub-tropical climate.
    Moreover, energy indices and C sustainability index in different rabi crops under
    different tillage systems were quantified. Based on evidences, it was obvious
    that NT sown rabi crops without and with crop residues (i.e. ZT and HT) produced
    higher yield, less energy input and lower GHG emission per kg gain production
    than CT. 3.6. Relationships among input, output and net return energy and GHG
    emission, C input and C output The input energy (IE) was positively correlated
    with OE (r = 0.673), NRE (r = 0.551), GHG (r = 0.895), C input (r = 0.895) and
    C output (r = 0.660) (Table 9). The OE had significant positive correlation with
    NRE, GHG, C input and C output. The NRE was positively correlated with GHG, C
    input and C output. The GHG was positive correlated (P < 0.05) with C output (r
    = 0.354). Table 9. Pearson correlations between IE, OE, NRE, GHG, C input and

    in the IGP. These parameters were evaluated for three tillage systems (CT, HT
    and NT) under four rabi crops (wheat, maize, barley and mustard). The objective
    was to assess energy dynamics, GHG emissions, and carbon efficiency as affected
    by different tillage practices under the rabi crops production in the IGP. Among
    different tillage practices, NT without and with retention of previous rice crop
    residues (6 t ha1) (i.e. NT and HT) yielded higher grain production than CT with
    less input energy consumed. Net grain input energy and energy use efficiency were
    also higher in HT and NT than CT. Moreover, less equivalent CO2 emission and less
    input energy requirement per kg grain production were observed in ZT and HT than
    CT. The CT plots had lower carbon sustainability index (CSI) and carbon efficiency
    (CE) than other treatments (ZT and HT) in all crops. The no-tilled plots with
    retention of 6 t ha−1 rice crop residues (i.e. HT) was a better option in terms
    of energy saving and less GHG emission (i.e. lower GWP) and greater net energy
    return and energy use efficiency in the IGP. Among rabi crops, cultivation of
    barley was energy efficient and had less GHG intensity. Thus, HT should be promoted
    in the IGP and other similar agro-ecologies across the globe for ensuring climate
    change mitigation. Results of this study provide a new science based evidence
    for the science and policy leaders. These will help to prioritize the appropriate
    combination of management practice and selection of crops to sustainably diversify
    the conventional rice-wheat system of the IGP to address the environmental quality
    and to contribute key sustainable development goals. Credit author statement Ved

  description: Ecologically designed wastewater treatment systems (ex., Eco-Machines™)
    utilize a diverse ecosystem to treat wastewater to the same extent as conventional
    treatment, but require less energy and chemical inputs. The environmental benefits
    of Eco-Machines™ can be theoretically maximized by incorporating hyperaccumulating
    aquatic plants (ex., duckweed) to facilitate nutrient recovery and conversion
    into protein-rich biomass, which can then be harvested for a range of agricultural
    and bioenergy applications. Although it has been established that ecological wastewater
    treatment systems are more cost- and energy-efficient than conventional wastewater
    treatment systems, a systematic life cycle assessment (LCA) of an Eco-Machine™
    coupled with its beneficial by-products has not been conducted. In this study,
    a series of LCAs were performed on different operational scenarios for a 1000
    gallon per day, pilot-scale Eco-Machine™ that, in addition to producing irrigation-quality
    water, also produces duckweed biomass for aquaculture. The analysis revealed that
    Eco-Machines™ located in warm climates, which do not require a greenhouse or supplemental
    heating, use approximately a third of the energy and produce half of the greenhouse
    gas emissions compared to conventional wastewater treatment systems in similar
    locations, while also providing benefits to human health, ecosystem quality, climate
    change, and resources. In addition, increasing the growth area for duckweed using
    vertical farming techniques improves the overall impact of the system. This study
    suggests that with proper management, ecological wastewater treatment systems
    that upcycle nutrients and water into beneficial products can provide a net benefit
    to human health and the environment.

    1. Introduction Biological wastewater treatment is the most common form of sewage
    treatment in the developed world and has gone mostly unchanged since the early
    1900s. In a conventional wastewater treatment system, organic material and nutrients
    are typically removed from the wastewater by bacteria that grow in a large aerated/mixed
    tank (activated sludge tank). Although there are many possible configurations,
    the wastewater typically then proceeds to an anoxic tank, where denitrifying bacteria
    reduce nitrate to nitrogen gas. Although effective, conventional wastewater treatment
    systems require large amounts of energy to operate, and essentially waste a valuable
    source of nitrogen by letting it escape into the atmosphere. In the U.S. alone,
    wastewater treatment was responsible for 1.8% (69.4 billion kWh) of the total
    electricity use in 2011 (Copeland and Carter, 2017), and released approximately
    600,000 tons of aqueous total nitrogen (TN) and 300,000 tons of nitrous oxide
    (N2O, a greenhouse gas that is 300 times more potent than CO2) into the environment
    (Maupin and Ivahnenko, 2011; US EPA, 2012). As a sustainable, decentralized alternative
    to conventional wastewater treatment, ecological wastewater treatment systems
    (ex., Eco-Machine™) utilize a series of tanks containing a variety of microorganisms,
    macroinvertebrates, and plants to treat wastewater and recover nutrients, all
    with no chemical input. These systems have been implemented predominantly for
    treating domestic sewage in small, ecologically conscious communities around the
    world (ex., EcoVillage Findhorn, 2007). More recently, ‘tidal-flow’ Living Machines®
    are being used in major urban office buildings, military bases, housing developments,
    resorts, and institutional campuses (McNair, 2009). Although there has been little
    reporting on the implementation of advanced ecological engineered systems in the
    developing world, the potential benefits of utilizing similar technologies are
    well known. The United Nations has stated that resource recovery from decentralized
    wastewater treatment systems has significant potential for producing energy and
    nutrients for agriculture (UN Water, 2017). Ecological treatment systems have
    the unique capability of producing both irrigation water (particularly if the
    effluent of the system is UV disinfected; Sheehan, 2012) and protein-rich plant
    biomass (ex., duckweed) without requiring the large amounts of energy that are
    needed to operate conventional treatment systems. Thus, the use of ecological
    wastewater treatment systems in the developing world has the potential to address
    multiple societal concerns simultaneously, including wastewater treatment, protein/nutrient
    production, and access to water for agriculture. Duckweed, also known as water
    lentils, are floating aquatic plants from the subfamily Lemnoideae which require
    only a few millimeters of water depth to grow and can tolerate a large variety
    of water quality conditions. When grown in nutrient rich environments like wastewater,
    duckweed grows rapidly and can obtain dry weight protein concentrations of up
    to 45% (Leng, 1999). Duckweed grown on partially treated wastewater in an Eco-Machine™
    was found to produce 5–10 times more protein per area than common land-grown crops,
    such as oats, soybean, and corn, without accumulating harmful pathogens or metals
    above the regulatory limits for animal feed (Roman and Brennan, 2019). Despite
    these benefits, the environmental impacts of producing duckweed on wastewater
    have not been quantified. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a technique to evaluate
    the environmental impacts of a product or process, considering energy and material
    inputs, processing or manufacturing, use, disposal, and the emissions and waste
    that a process or product produces over its lifespan. LCA studies have been conducted
    on wastewater treatment systems (Dixon et al., 2003; Hospido et al., 2004; Li
    et al., 2013; and Tabesh et al., 2019) and the production of sustainable protein
    alternatives, such as insects, seaweed, and algae (Oonincx and de Boer, 2012;
    Halloran et al., 2016; Gnansounou and Raman, 2016; and van Oirschot et al., 2017).
    One study analyzed a Living Machine® (similar to an Eco-Machine™) for treating
    domestic wastewater from an office building, and found that these decentralized
    systems can reduce total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by almost 90% and total
    energy consumption by 10%, when compared to conventional wastewater treatment
    systems (Hendrickson et al., 2015). The U.S. EPA estimates that Eco-Machines™
    are operationally cost competitive with conventional systems up to flow rates
    of 1 million gallons (3785 m3) per day in warm climates, and 600,000 gallons (2270
    m3) per day in cooler climates that require a greenhouse and supplemental heating
    (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2002). To date, no LCA studies
    have been conducted on coupling an ecological wastewater treatment system with
    protein production. The aim of the LCA conducted in this study was to identify
    and quantify the environmental impacts of operating a pilot-scale Eco-Machine™
    treating municipal wastewater while concomitantly producing animal feed (derived
    from duckweed) and irrigation water (derived by UV disinfection of the treated
    effluent). This is the first LCA to evaluate an ecological wastewater treatment
    system that produces duckweed and treated wastewater as beneficial outputs of
    the system. Although this study evaluates one pilot-scale system with a discrete
    set of products, this analysis is a necessary first step toward understanding
    where environmental impacts in these systems originate, so that future systems
    can be designed and operated to maximize environmental sustainability. The results
    from this study can be used as a basis for developing ecological wastewater treatment
    systems that are incorporated into domestic animal production operations to facilitate
    recovering and upcycling of waste nutrients into protein-rich plant biomass. Additional
    studies would need to be conducted to validate these results for full-scale systems.
    2. Methods 2.1. Description of the Penn State Eco-Machine™ and inventory analysis
    The model system utilized for this study is a pilot-scale Eco-Machine™ with a
    capacity of 3785 L day−1 that is located at The Pennsylvania State University
    (University Park, PA, USA) campus. Since this location is within a temperate forest
    biome that experiences freezing temperatures during part of the year, and the
    vegetation within the system is mostly tropical, the Penn State Eco-Machine™ is
    sheltered within a greenhouse which receives supplemental heat via a propane-powered
    furnace when temperatures drop below 18 °C. A solar power array located outside
    of the greenhouse, consisting of ten 175 W panels on a tracker system that follows
    the sun''s position throughout the day (Sharp NT-175UC1 panels; Zomeworks UTRF
    168 solar tracker), provides nearly 80% of the electricity used within the system.
    Routine operation of this facility includes weekly delivery of municipal wastewater
    from the Penn State Wastewater Treatment Plant following rag and grit removal
    (i.e., primary influent). Wastewater is delivered to an outdoor underground holding
    tank, from which wastewater is pumped into the greenhouse, where it is treated
    through a series of six tanks and a subsurface wetland, before passing through
    a UV disinfection unit. The system is configured as a Modified Ludzack-Ettinger
    (MLE) process, where the anoxic tanks are located upstream of the aerobic tanks
    (Fig. 1), and a portion of the nitrate that was converted from ammonia in the
    aerobic tanks is recycled back to the anoxic tanks for denitrification. A subsurface
    wetland inside the greenhouse removes the remaining BOD and nutrients. Although
    natural predation in the Eco-Machine™ has been shown to remove E.coli by 70% (Sheehan,
    2012), a UV disinfection unit was added to remove remaining bacteria from the
    system effluent, to ensure they are below the regulatory limits of 126 CFU/100
    mL for irrigation water (FDA, 2016). Download : Download high-res image (324KB)

    and scope of the LCA analysis. Solid arrows indicate the flow of wastewater through
    the treatment system. Dashed arrows indicate products. The dashed line is the
    system boundary. Duckweed harvested from the Penn State Eco-Machine™ has been
    tested as a source of protein for animal fodder (Roman and Brennan, 2019), a substrate
    for bioethanol and biomethane production (Calicioglu et al., 2019), and as a slow-release
    sustainable soil amendment/fertilizer (Kreider et al., 2019). Of these options,
    using duckweed as a protein supplement has been calculated to have the highest
    monetary value on today''s markets (Calicioglu, 2019). In this study, the environmental
    benefits of using the duckweed grown in the Eco-Machine™ as a source of tilapia
    feed were analyzed, since the need for sustainable aquaculture feed is well established,
    and duckweed has been previously shown to be an effective supplement for tilapia
    in various studies (Gaigher et al., 1984; Moreau et al., 1986; and Fasakin et
    al., 1999). The following water quality parameters were monitored from June 2016
    to May 2020 to verify system performance: chemical oxygen demand (Hach Company,
    Loveland, CO); total nitrogen (Shimadzu TOC-VCSH/CSN analyzer, Columbia, MD);
    and the anions nitrate, phosphate, and sulfate measured via ion chromatography
    (Dionex ICS-1100, Sunnyvale, CA) as described previously (Roman and Brennan, 2019).
    In addition, duckweed within the system was harvested every five days over a period
    of 5 months, dried, weighed, and tested for crude protein (nitrogen content of
    the biomass x 6.25; Jones, 1941) to determine protein production. Finally, pathogen
    counts of E.coli, total coliform, and fecal coliform (MacConkey, m-Endo LES, and
    m FC agar, respectively, Hardy Diagnostics, Springboro, OH) were measured using
    spread plates in both UV disinfected water and dried duckweed (50 °C for 48 h)
    to determine if system by-products were below the regulatory limits for irrigation
    water and agricultural feed. The LCA of the Penn State Eco-Machine™ inventory
    was broken into three phases: construction; operation; and products (Table 1).
    The construction phase consists of six HDPE tanks used for treatment; a concrete
    underground holding tank; a greenhouse, which includes a block foundation, glass
    windows, and steel beams; gravel and HDPE liner for the wetland; piping and valves;
    solar panels; and a UV disinfection unit. The operation phase consists of: electricity
    used for aeration, pumping, air humidification, and UV disinfection; and propane
    used to heat the greenhouse in the winter months. Products include irrigation
    water (UV disinfected treated wastewater); duckweed used for tilapia feed; and
    treated wastewater. The functional unit of the analysis is million liters (ML)
    wastewater treated. Table 1. Inventory used in the life cycle assessment of the

    grown in the Penn State Eco-Machine™ was previously reported to have an average
    growth rate of 7 g m−2 day−1 and a protein content of 38% (Roman and Brennan,
    2019). For the LCA, a growth area of 44.5 m2 (the size of the wetland in the Penn
    State Eco-Machine™) was assumed available to grow duckweed year-round. There is
    no database item for duckweed within EcoInvent, so a common product that duckweed
    can replace was used as a proxy: tilapia feed (24–28% protein; GLO). Duckweed
    has been shown to be an effective replacement for conventional fishmeal in the
    diet of tilapia (Gaigher et al., 1984; Fasakin et al., 1999). In fact, some studies
    have shown that duckweed can be used as the sole component of the diet without
    sacrificing the survival rate of the fish (Hassan and Edward, 1991). As a conservative
    estimate, a 30% replacement of conventional tilapia fishmeal with duckweed was
    used for this study, which has been shown to be the most cost effective diet in
    terms of cost per unit weight gain of fish (Fasakin et al., 1999). Thus, the duckweed
    produced in the Eco-Machine™ was assumed to offset 30% of the detrimental impacts
    associated with producing tilapia feed on a mass basis (which includes impacts
    to agriculture, animal husbandry, fisheries, energy expenditures (electricity
    and industrial heat), and direct emissions to aquatic environments). It was also
    assumed that aquaculture operations would be co-located with the Eco-Machine™;
    therefore, downstream duckweed processing such as packaging and transportation
    were not included in this analysis. The resulting impacts could reasonably be
    expected to differ from the actual impacts associated with duckweed utilization;
    therefore this LCA could be improved in the future with a more refined database
    item for duckweed. 2.3. Life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) SimaPro 9.0 was used
    for the life cycle inventory analysis and impact assessment calculations, coupled
    with the EcoInvent 3.6 database (system model = allocation, cut-off by classification;
    process data = unit) and no amendments were made to the datasets other than the
    proxy of duckweed as tilapia feed. Impact 2002+ was used as the methodology for
    the impact assessment due to its reliability for both agricultural processes and
    environmental treatment LCAs (Jolliet et al., 2003), which are uniquely combined
    in this study. The method quantifies four damage categories: human health; ecosystem
    quality; climate change; and resources. Within these damage categories, 15 midpoint
    categories were quantified: carcinogens; non-carcinogens; respiratory inorganics;
    ionizing radiation; ozone layer depletion; respiratory organics; aquatic ecotoxicity;
    terrestrial ecotoxicity; terrestrial acidification/nutrification; land occupation;
    aquatic acidification; aquatic eutrophication; global warming; non-renewable energy;
    and mineral extraction (Humbert et al., 2012). The human health damage category
    is the sum of the following midpoint categories: carcinogens; non-carcinogens;
    respiratory inorganics; ionizing radiation; ozone layer depletion; and respiratory
    organics. Human health impacts are expressed in “Disability-Adjusted Life Years”
    (DALY), which characterizes disease severity, accounting for both mortality and
    morbidity. Human health is dominated by respiratory effects caused by inorganic
    substances emitted into the air (Humbert et al., 2012). The ecosystem quality
    damage category is the sum of the midpoint categories: aquatic ecotoxicity; terrestrial
    ecotoxicity; terrestrial acidification/nutrification; land occupation; aquatic
    acidification; and aquatic eutrophication. Ecosystem quality impacts are expressed
    in “Potentially Disappeared Fraction of species over a certain amount of m2 during
    a certain amount of year” (PDF-m2-yr). Ecosystem quality is dominated by terrestrial
    ecotoxicity and land occupation (Humbert et al., 2012). The climate change damage
    category includes one midpoint category: global warming. Climate change impacts
    are expressed in kg CO2-eq and are dominated by greenhouse gas emissions (Humbert
    et al., 2012). The resources damage category is the sum of non-renewable energy
    and mineral extraction midpoint categories. Resources impacts are expressed in
    Megajoules (MJ) and is largely dominated by non-renewable energy consumption (Humbert
    et al., 2012). 2.4. Sensitivity analysis A Monte-Carlo analysis was performed
    within SimaPro to determine the uncertainty in the inventory data for the damage
    categories (95% CI). A sensitivity analysis was performed to determine how a greenhouse
    and heating affect the overall impacts of the system. Additionally, using vertical
    farming techniques to increase the duckweed growth area and yield was investigated.

    impacts of the Penn State Eco-Machine™. Net impact value per million liter (ML)
    treated for each category is listed above (positive values represent detrimental
    impacts and negative values represent beneficial impacts). 3.1.1. Detrimental
    impacts As the pilot system in this study is currently operated, including a greenhouse
    and supplemental heating, the major detrimental impacts are from climate control,
    aeration, and construction of the greenhouse/wetland. Some of these impacts, however,
    could be mitigated with changes in design or operation. Climate control is responsible
    for the largest detrimental impact for 10 midpoint categories: respiratory inorganics
    (56.5%); ozone layer depletion (77.8%); respiratory organics (64.7%); aquatic
    ecotoxicity (59.0%); terrestrial ecotoxicity (58.7%); terrestrial acidification/nutrification
    (55.6%); aquatic acidification (64.8%); aquatic eutrophication (68.7%); global
    warming (54.6%); and non-renewable energy (67.5%). Climate control in the Penn
    State Eco-Machine™ is provided by a propane furnace and a humidifier; there is
    no air conditioning. Propane used to heat the greenhouse is responsible for nearly
    all of the detrimental impacts from climate control. The Eco-Machine™ had an average
    propane usage of 1077 gallons per year (based on data collected from 2018 to 2020).
    Operating Eco-Machines™ (and other indoor ecological wastewater treatment systems)
    in climates with moderate temperatures year-round would remove the need for heating,
    and greatly reduce the detrimental impacts. Aeration is responsible for the largest
    detrimental impact for three midpoint categories: non-carcinogens (14.1%); ionizing
    radiation (62.5%); and mineral extraction (25.5%). Aeration is provided to the
    aerobic tanks by two air compressors that each operate for 6 h per day, consuming
    nearly 2500 kWh of electricity per year. This result is consistent with conventional
    wastewater treatment systems, where aeration typically accounts for over 75% of
    the total energy used (Cantwell et al., 2017). Strategies for reducing the energy
    cost for aeration in Eco-Machines™ include: installing fine-bubble diffusers and
    reducing fouling; installing mechanical mixers in the aerobic tanks to increase
    oxygen use efficiency; and adding a trickling system that allows the wastewater
    to pass over shallow steps to naturally aerate between tanks. The construction
    of the greenhouse and wetland is responsible for the largest detrimental impact
    for the final midpoint category: carcinogens (38.5%). This study assumed that
    raw materials were used to build the greenhouse/wetland; however, recycled/reclaimed
    materials could be at least partially used to construct such systems (ex., recycled
    concrete blocks for the foundation, recycled gravel for the wetland, etc.). In
    addition, a greenhouse would not be necessary if the system were located in a
    tropical/equatorial region, which would greatly reduce construction impacts. Although
    not a leading detrimental impact in any category, wastewater delivery is responsible
    for >5% of the total impact in most midpoint categories. Currently, a 2000 gallon
    (7.6 m3) tanker truck is used to transport primary influent wastewater one mile
    (1.6 km) from the wastewater treatment plant to the Eco-Machine™. Ideally, wastewater
    would be piped directly to the Eco-Machine™, but shallow bedrock on the site prohibited
    the construction of underground sewage pipes. In practice, an Eco-Machine™ should
    be connected directly to the sewage pipes to avoid having to transport wastewater
    to the system by truck. The remaining detrimental impacts stem from the treatment
    tanks, piping and valves, pumps, and UV disinfection, which collectively account
    for less than 5% of the total impacts for all but two midpoint categories: aquatic
    ecotoxicity (5.8%); and terrestrial ecotoxicity (8.6%). 3.1.2. Beneficial impacts
    The beneficial impacts from the Eco-Machine™ in this study result from the renewable
    electricity produced by the solar panels, wastewater treatment, irrigation water
    (treated wastewater), and tilapia feed (duckweed) produced within the system.
    The integrated solar array is responsible for the largest beneficial impact for
    seven midpoint categories: ionizing radiation (−56.1%); ozone layer depletion
    (−9.0%); aquatic ecotoxicity (−19.4%); terrestrial acid/nutri (−21.7%); aquatic
    acidification (−14.7%); global warming (−22.1%); and non-renewable energy (−14.6%).
    The solar array provides roughly 80% of the total electricity used by the Eco-Machine™
    annually, however, during the summer months, the solar panels provide more electricity
    than the Eco-Machine™ consumes, and the additional electricity is sent to the
    university grid. Since this relatively small solar panel system provides the majority
    of the electricity needed throughout the year, it suggests that Eco-Machines™
    could be easily designed to operate with only electricity produced by a larger
    solar array, greatly reducing their long-term detrimental impacts. Wastewater
    treatment is responsible for the largest beneficial impact for four midpoint categories:
    carcinogens (−65.8%); non-carcinogens (−76.7%); terrestrial ecotoxicity (−33.3%);
    and mineral extraction (−51.5%). This study assumes that if not treated by the
    Eco-Machine™, the wastewater would otherwise remain untreated to fairly compare
    this system to other wastewater treatment systems. From a global perspective,
    this is realistic, as approximately 80% of the world''s wastewater is discharged
    without treatment into the environment (NRDC, 2018). Ecological wastewater treatment
    systems are ideal for addressing this problem, especially in developing regions,
    since they require little energy and infrastructure to operate. Irrigation water
    produced by the Eco-Machine™ is responsible for the largest beneficial impact
    for three midpoint categories: respiratory inorganics (−32.2%); respiratory organics
    (−15.4%); aquatic eutrophication (−17.9%). Tilapia feed is responsible for the
    largest beneficial impact for one midpoint category: land occupation (−55.1%).
    3.2. Damage categories The damage category impacts (human health, ecosystem quality,
    climate change, and resources) caused by the Penn State Eco-Machine™ were grouped
    into three phases to facilitate the analysis and discussion that follows: construction
    (Fig. 3a), operation (Fig. 3b), and products (Fig. 3c). Download : Download high-res

    three phases of the Penn State Eco-Machine™: a) construction; b) operation; c)
    products; and d) total (see Table 1 for inventory; positive values represent detrimental
    impacts and negative values represent beneficial impacts). 3.2.1. Human health
    The net impact to human health from the Penn State Eco-Machine™ is 1.69 E−4 ±
    3.86 E−4 DALY/million liters (ML) treated wastewater (Table 2). The near zero
    value indicates that the system has little to no detrimental impacts on human
    health. Although minimal, the largest of the detrimental impacts to human health
    are caused by climate control (53.5%), followed by aeration (24.1%), and greenhouse
    construction (8.4%). The largest beneficial impacts to human health are from wastewater
    treatment (−36.2%), irrigation (−31.5%), and the solar panels (−21.4%). Table

    shown for each phase at each damage category (95% CI; positive values represent
    detrimental impacts and negative values represent beneficial impacts). Damage

    ± 1000 86,000 ± 14,000 For the Eco-Machine™, the propane consumed, and thus the
    detrimental impacts from natural gas processing and oil refining, is the largest
    contributor to detrimental human health effects. Electricity consumption, and
    thus the emissions from the power plants producing the electricity, is the other
    largest contributor to the detrimental human health effects. However, since the
    solar array produces about 80% of the total electricity consumed by the system,
    the detrimental human health impacts from producing electricity in a power plant
    are largely offset. Additionally, the energy required to treat wastewater in a
    conventional plant is not needed if wastewater is treated in the Eco-Machine™,
    creating a beneficial impact to human health. Lastly, utilizing the irrigation
    water produced by the Eco-Machine™ on nearby farmland removes the detrimental
    impacts of the infrastructure and energy needed to pump water from a surface/ground
    water source for irrigation. 3.2.2. Ecosystem quality The net impact to ecosystem
    quality from the Penn State Eco-Machine™ is 170 ± 480 PDF-m2-yr/ML (Table 2).
    The largest detrimental impacts to ecosystem quality are from climate control
    (58.7%), aeration (18.4%), and treatment tanks (6.6%). Similar to human health,
    the largest beneficial impacts to ecosystem quality are from wastewater treatment
    (−31.8%), irrigation water (−27.6%), and the solar panels (−16.4%). 3.2.3. Climate
    change The net impact to climate change from the Penn State Eco-Machine™ is 958
    ± 114 kg CO2-eq/ML (Table 2). The largest detrimental impacts to climate change
    are from climate control (54.6%), aeration (24.9%), and greenhouse construction
    (7.0%). The largest beneficial impacts to climate change are from solar panels
    (−22.1%), irrigation (−15.9%), and wastewater treatment (−14.9%). This analysis
    likely underestimates the beneficial impacts to climate change from the Eco-Machine™,
    as photosynthesis by plants in the system was neglected. For example, Taro (Colocasia
    esculenta) grows in the aerobic tanks, and is known to sequester carbon at a rate
    of 10.4 ± 5.2 g C/m2-day (Saunders et al., 2012). Given an estimated surface area
    of 2.33 m2 for Taro in the Eco-Machine™, it could theoretically sequester ~24
    g C/day, or 8.8 kg C/year, which would offset approximately 0.7% of the total
    CO2 emissions from operating the Eco-Machine™ for one year (Belles, 2020). If
    C sequestration from all the plants in the Eco-Machine™ were included, it would
    likely reduce the CO2 emissions from the system by less than 5% (Belles, 2020).
    Frequent harvesting of duckweed in a vertical farming system would likely increase
    C uptake, however, so beneficial impacts to climate change in that scenario would
    require further investigation. Consistent with human health and ecosystem quality,
    over half of the detrimental impacts on climate change are from the oil refining
    and processing required to create the propane which is burned to heat the greenhouse
    in the winter. Replacing propane with natural gas would reduce the detrimental
    impacts in the climate change category by nearly 70%. Although operating the Eco-Machine™
    in a temperate zone with a propane furnace results in net detrimental impacts
    to climate change, it is still only about a third of the climate change impacts
    produced by the operation of a conventional wastewater treatment (3000 kg CO2-eq/ML;
    Hendrickson et al., 2015). It should be noted that environmental impacts from
    the release of GHGs from microbial metabolic processes during wastewater treatment
    (i.e., carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxides) were not considered in this LCA
    of the Eco-Machine™, and therefore it likely underestimates the total GHG emissions
    from the system. 3.2.4. Resources The net impact to resources from the Penn State
    Eco-Machine™ is 85,700 ± 13,900 MJ/ML (23,800 kWh/ML; Table 2). Climate control
    (67.5%) is responsible for over half of the detrimental impact, followed by aeration
    (16.3%), and wastewater delivery (8.6%). The solar array (−14.6%) provides the
    largest beneficial impact to resources, followed by irrigation water (−5.4%),
    and wastewater treatment (−3.5%). As currently operated, the detrimental impact
    to resources from the Penn State Eco-Machine™ (23,800 kWh/ML) is 4–5 times higher
    than the impact to resources from conventional wastewater treatment (~5000 kWh/ML;
    Hendrickson et al., 2015). This is for two reasons: 1) the furnace used to heat
    the greenhouse in the winter currently consumes propane; and 2) biogas produced
    during conventional treatment is typically recovered and used to heat various
    treatment processes throughout the treatment plant (Noyola et al., 2005). In its
    current configuration, the Penn State Eco-Machine™ does not produce a significant
    quantity of biogas as it does not contain an anaerobic digester. Methane is below
    detection in the tanks, so it is likely that any methane production occurring
    deep within the tanks is likely consumed by methanotrophic organisms in the upper
    water layers that are exposed to oxygen through diffusion. For methane capture
    to be possible, either an anaerobic digester would need to be added to the system,
    or the anaerobic tanks would need to be redesigned to avoid aerobic zones in the
    upper layers. When the need for heating the greenhouse with propane is removed,
    the impact to resources from the Eco-Machine™ is reduced to 2750 kWh/ML, or about
    half of the impacts from conventional wastewater treatment. 3.3. Sensitivity analysis
    on heating/greenhouse requirements Based on the results of the damage assessment
    of the Penn State Eco-Machine™, it is obvious that removing the need for housing
    the system within a heated greenhouse would greatly reduce its detrimental impacts.
    A comparison of the impacts from four scenarios are shown in Fig. 4: propane heated
    greenhouse, natural gas heated greenhouse, non-heated greenhouse, and no heat
    and no greenhouse. The largest reduction in detrimental impacts comes from the
    need to heat the greenhouse, which transforms the Eco-Machine™ from producing
    detrimental impacts at all four damage categories to producing a beneficial impact
    (negative value) in the human health, ecosystem quality, and climate change damage
    categories (Fig. 4). Changing from propane to natural gas heating reduces the
    detrimental impacts for ecosystem quality and climate change, but increases the
    detrimental impacts for human health and resources. IMPACT 2002+ offers a ‘weighted’
    single score impact, that accounts for the overall importance of each damage category
    and weights them accordingly, allowing for the four damage categories to be compared
    with the same units. When the Eco-Machine™ heated with propane versus natural
    gas are compared with weighting, propane heating produces 1.4% more total detrimental
    impacts than natural gas, indicating that natural gas heating would slightly improve
    the overall sustainability of the Penn State Eco-Machine™. This result indicates
    that Eco-Machines™ are capable of producing net benefits to all damage categories
    expect resources, when located in areas that do not require heating. Download

    change; and d) resources. Net impact is shown adjacent to the bar in each plot
    (positive values represent detrimental impacts and negative values represent beneficial
    impacts). 3.4. Sensitivity analysis on vertical farming options to increase duckweed
    growth area One of the benefits of duckweed is that it only requires a few millimeters
    of water depth to grow, making it well suited for vertical farming (Leng, 1999).
    Therefore, a sensitivity analysis was performed to examine the potential beneficial
    impacts of utilizing multiple stacks (1–4) of duckweed growth platforms covering
    the area of the wetland (44.5 m2) to increase the duckweed growth area in the
    Penn State Eco-Machine™. A steel frame was used to support the vertical duckweed
    growth trays, which were assumed to be made of plywood sheets lined with an HDPE
    liner, which is a common configuration for hydroponic systems. LED light strips
    installed underneath the trays provide light to the duckweed growing in the tray
    beneath. No LED lights were used above the top tray or in the single stack scenario,
    since sunlight would not be impeded by another tray above. The inventory used
    for the vertical growth sensitivity analysis is presented in Table 3. Table 3.

    Increasing the number of vertical stacks used to grow duckweed provides additional
    beneficial impacts for human health (Fig. 5a), ecosystem quality (Fig. 5b), and
    climate change (Fig. 5c), but increases detrimental impacts for resources (Fig.
    5d). The majority of the detrimental impact in the resource category was due to
    the electricity used to power the LED grow lights. In each damage category aside
    from resources, the plywood used as the base of the growth platform provided the
    largest detrimental impact, suggesting that the use of recycled wood or another
    recycled container system could eliminate a substantial portion of the detrimental
    impacts of the vertical farming system. Nonetheless, the results suggest that
    the additional beneficial impacts from producing more duckweed outweigh the detrimental
    impacts from constructing vertical farming system and the energy required to power
    the LED lights (Fig. 6). Download : Download high-res image (498KB) Download :

    4. Conclusions A life cycle assessment conducted on a pilot-scale Eco-Machine™
    showed that the detrimental impacts from these systems are dominated by the fuel
    source used to heat the greenhouse and aeration. It was determined that if the
    greenhouse were located in a region that does not require heating, the system
    would transform detrimental impacts for human health, ecosystem quality, and climate
    change into beneficial impacts. Fine bubble diffusers, mechanical mixers, or a
    passive trickling system incorporated into the Eco-Machine™ could reduce the detrimental
    impacts from aeration. The integrated solar array provides the largest beneficial
    impact to the system by producing nearly 80% of the electricity that the Eco-Machine™
    consumes. Currently, the solar array only consists of ten solar panels, and could
    be easily expanded to produce all of the energy needs of the Eco-Machine™. As
    currently operated, the Penn State Eco-Machine™ produces about a third of the
    CO2 emissions as conventional wastewater treatment systems. The impact of the
    Penn State Eco-Machine™ to resources is about 4–5 times higher than conventional
    wastewater treatment; however, if the need for heating were removed, it would
    produce about one-half of the impacts to resources as conventional wastewater
    treatment. Finally, providing additional area for duckweed growth in the form
    of a vertical farming system increases the overall sustainability of the system
    by producing more protein-rich plant biomass. The results from this study do not
    consider the potential environmental impacts from microbial metabolic processes
    (i.e., carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxides) occurring within the Eco-Machine™.
    Future research should investigate how these types of systems scale with treatment
    capacity, and validate the safety of duckweed biomass generated from different
    wastewater sources for use as animal feed. In addition, LCAs of ecological treatment
    systems coupled with duckweed growth for use in other products (ex., fertilizer,
    bioenergy) should be conducted to quantify the impact of using these systems for
    meeting various community needs. Credit author statement Roman, B: Methodology;

  description: 'Background: Solar sprinkler irrigation system is energy-efficient
    and can reduce operation costs, but it is susceptible to weather and timing of
    irrigation as insufficient energy supply may occur when demand for power peaks
    during the irrigation. This could result in low energy conversion efficiency and
    destabilize hydraulic performance of the system. Light radiation, as an important
    parameter in designing solar irrigation systems, varies spatiotemporally and could
    affect the amount of solar energy absorbed by the solar panel and result in unstable
    electricity supply and changes in water pressure in the system. Currently, there
    is a lack of protocol for optimizing configuration of the operating parameters
    of the solar sprinkler irrigation systems. Objective: Considering that existing
    solar sprinkler irrigation systems are prone to unstable water pressure, uneven
    energy distribution and low conversion efficiency, this paper aims to elucidate
    how light intensity affects the spray performance of the sprinkler irrigation
    system. Method: The hydraulic performance parameters of a solar sprinkler irrigation
    system under light intensities between 225.7 and 1 145 W/m2 were measured using
    laser raindrop spectrometer technology, from which we calculated the kinetic energy
    distribution of the water droplets, kinetic energy per unit volume of water, and
    the kinetic energy intensity. We also proposed a method to calculate the energy
    conversion efficiency of the system. Result: The light intensity mainly affected
    the kinetic energy of small water droplets with diameter less than 1 mm in the
    proximity of the sprinkler. As the light intensity increased, the kinetic energy
    per unit volume increased first and then declined asymptotically in a trend which
    can be fit by a fourth-degree polynomial function. With the increase in the radial
    distance from the sprinkler, the kinetic energy intensity increased first and
    then gradually reduced to 0 at the far end. With the light intensity varying between
    300.8 and 1 018.8 W/m2, the kinetic energy intensity only showed a small fluctuation
    and the energy conversion efficiency of the system varied between 24.59% to 37.21%.
    When the light intensity was in 225.7~416 W/m2, the conversion efficiency of the
    energy intensity peaked approximately at 36%. Conclusion: When the light intensity
    was within 300.8~416 W/m2, the kinetic energy showed the smallest fluctuation,
    the energy distribution was most uniform, and the energy conversion efficiency
    maximized. Our results provide a baseline guidance for improving spray performance
    and energy conversion rate of solar sprinkler irrigation system, and helping optimize
    configuration of its operating parameters.'

  description: This review summarizes electricity use on dairy farms, with a focus
    on how energy is used, energy use indices (EUI), conservation strategies, and
    generation of renewable energy to reach net zero. EUI of electricity consumption
    varied between the identified studies primarily based on farm management system
    (confined, pasture-based), housing type (tie-stall, free-stall), and region (North
    America, Europe, Asia, Africa, Oceania). The highest electricity usage was associated
    with milking and milk cooling systems, which, on average, accounted for 23% and
    22% of total electricity use, respectively. Energy use scaled per cow (EUIc) was
    lower, on average, for pasture-based dairy systems than for confined systems (475
    vs. 769 kWh cow-1 y-1). Considering milk production, the average EUI scaled to
    milk (EUIm) was lower for pasture-based systems (6.6 kWh 100 kg-1) than for confined
    systems 9.2 kWh 100 kg-1. Considering all non-irrigated farm types, EUIm averaged
    7.7 kWh 100 kg-1 and EUIc averaged 612 kWh cow-1 y-1. There was a large range
    of EUI, with higher values associated with automated milking systems and irrigation.
    Electricity consumption by the global dairy sector (excluding irrigation) was
    estimated using the average EUIm at approximately 64.2 TWh y-1. The main conservation
    technologies include variable speed drives (milk vacuum pumps, milking systems,
    fans), pre-cool heat exchangers, refrigeration heat recovery systems, energy-efficient
    light fixtures (compact fluorescents, light emitting diodes), and efficient ventilation
    (high-volume low-speed fans). Theoretical savings of up to 32% overall could be
    achieved by combining several technologies. Feedback from electricity monitoring
    can inform dairy farmers of their energy use pattern to guide decisions to reduce
    consumption. Tools for predicting energy use and related costs on dairy farms,
    which can indicate potential energy savings from operational changes, were reviewed.
    By combining conservation methods with renewable energy from biogas or solar,
    many dairy farms can produce enough electricity to reach net zero electricity.
    For example, a hypothetical barn-based 250 milking-cow dairy farm consumed 1021
    kWh cow-1 y-1, on average, and could produce approximately 1095 kWh cow-1 y-1
    using a biodigester or 960 kWh cow-1 y-1 using rooftop photovoltaic solar panels.

    energy. Highlights Studies of electricity use were reviewed, representing five
    continents. Considering all farm types, electricity use averaged 7.7 kWh 100 kg-1
    milk and 612 kWh cow-1 y-1. Pasture-based dairy systems used less electricity
    than barn-based systems (475 vs. 769 kWh cow-1 y-1). By combining several conservation
    technologies there is potential to reduce electricity demand by one-third. Dairy
    farms can reach net zero electricity by combining renewable energy production
    with conservation. Abstract. This review summarizes electricity use on dairy farms,

  description: 'There is an urgent need for identification of the eco-friendly/cleaner
    production system that is more productive and profitable; efficient user of energy,
    water, and carbon-based inputs, and also environmentally safer. The four years
    study was conducted from 2016 to 2019, where the dominant rice-wheat cropping
    system is practiced extensively after ‘Green Revolution’. The objectives of the
    experiment were to evaluate: (1) energy budgeting, (2) carbon auditing, (3) production
    and economic efficiency of diverse cropping systems for upland rainfed as well
    as irrigated ecosystems of eastern India. Tillage and cropping system treatments
    were laid out according to a completely randomized block design and replicated
    thrice. Ten cropping sequences were comprised of: T1) a farmers’ practice of transplanted
    rice-wheat-mungbean, T2) conventional till-direct seeded rice (CTDSR)-wheat-mungbean,
    T3) soybean-maize, T4) CTDSR-mustard-urdbean, T5) foxtail millet-lentil-fallow,
    T6) pearl millet-chickpea-fallow, T7) finger millet-toria-fallow, T8) sorghum
    (grain)-chickpea-fallow, T9) maize cob–pigeon pea, and T10) sorghum (fodder)-mustard-urdbean.
    Energy contributions of different inputs were 42–55, 12–21, 8–18, and 4–12% for
    fertilizers, diesel, labour, and electricity, respectively. The amount of indirect
    (fertilizer, chemicals, and machinery) and direct (diesel and electricity) non-renewable
    energy inputs were 40–60 and 18–26%, respectively. Indirect renewable energy input
    (seed and crop residues) was 1–7% as compared to 15–24% of direct-renewable energy
    (human labour and irrigation water). The maximum energy input was recorded for
    T1 (53511 MJ ha−1). The maximum biomass production (40.2 Mg ha−1) was recorded
    with T9, while the maximum benefit: cost ratio (3.64) was noted for T10 and T8.
    The highest specific energy (33.5 MJ kg−1) and energy productivity (0.92 kg MJ−1)
    were recorded in T8 treatment. Irrespective of cropping systems, retention of
    crop residues accounted for 28.6–58.5% of total carbon input. The carbon sustainability
    index was 5–7 times higher for the millet-based production system [T6 (9.32) and
    T8 (10.27)] compared to cereal-based systems [T1 (1.66) and T2 (1.21)]. Diversification
    of the rice-wheat system through climate-resilient millets-based production system
    reduced 84% energy consumption and 87% carbon footprint. The millet-based production
    system also helps in reducing the carbon input by 172% and improves the energy
    use efficiency by 61% compared to the cereal-based cropping system. Therefore,
    the study has an innovative idea to support the crop modelling, policymakers,
    government planners, researchers, and producers to achieve the sustainable development
    goals in Indo-Gangetic Plains and similar agro-climatic conditions of South Asia.'

    The objectives of the experiment were to evaluate: (1) energy budgeting, (2) carbon
    auditing, (3) production and economic efficiency of diverse cropping systems for
    upland rainfed as well as irrigated ecosystems of eastern India. Tillage and cropping

    (fodder)-mustard-urdbean. Energy contributions of different inputs were 42–55,
    12–21, 8–18, and 4–12% for fertilizers, diesel, labour, and electricity, respectively.
    The amount of indirect (fertilizer, chemicals, and machinery) and direct (diesel
    and electricity) non-renewable energy inputs were 40–60 and 18–26%, respectively.
    Indirect renewable energy input (seed and crop residues) was 1–7% as compared
    to 15–24% of direct-renewable energy (human labour and irrigation water). The
    maximum energy input was recorded for T1 (53511 MJ ha−1). The maximum biomass
    production (40.2 Mg ha−1) was recorded with T9, while the maximum benefit: cost
    ratio (3.64) was noted for T10 and T8. The highest specific energy (33.5 MJ kg−1)
    and energy productivity (0.92 kg MJ−1) were recorded in T8 treatment. Irrespective
    of cropping systems, retention of crop residues accounted for 28.6–58.5% of total
    carbon input. The carbon sustainability index was 5–7 times higher for the millet-based
    production system [T6 (9.32) and T8 (10.27)] compared to cereal-based systems
    [T1 (1.66) and T2 (1.21)]. Diversification of the rice-wheat system through climate-resilient

    IndiaEnergy budgetingEconomics 1. Introduction The continent of Asia is vulnerable
    to the anthropogenic climate change because of its more reliance on agriculture
    [1]. Small land-holdings and poor natural resource management are among the major
    issues for lower crop productivity of the agricultural production systems of South
    Asia [2]. Rice (Oryza sativa), a major staple food crop, is cultivated on ∼163
    M ha of 114 countries with a total production of ∼742.4 MT during 2016 [3]. In
    India, ∼12.5 M ha area is under rice-wheat cropping system (RWCS) [4], which is
    less remunerative due to more labour, water, capital, and energy requirements.
    The erratic and unpredictable rainfall patterns prevailing during the rainy season,
    declining ground-water level, and severe soil degradation, further aggravate the
    total factor productivity, and sustainability of the system [5]. Also, the widespread
    practice of in-field burning of crop residues before the planting of wheat is
    exacerbating the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG. The emission from global RWCS
    is estimated at ∼523 MT CO2-e year−1 and contributes ∼10% of the total agricultural
    emission globally [6]. Achieving the food and nutritional security by increasing
    crop productivity and diminishing the inter-annual variations in crop yields in
    South Asia has become a major challenge. There is strong evidence of the negative
    impacts of climatic change on the productivity of wheat and rice by variable magnitude
    under diverse climates of the region [7]. Composite exposure using different indicators
    (i.e., maximum and minimum temperatures, the intensity of low and high rainfall
    during rainy and winter seasons) has revealed that RWCS in eastern India is highly
    vulnerable to climatic change. The yield of wheat and rice is predicted to decline
    from 10 to 40% by 2050 [8]. With each degree centigrade rise in temperature, the
    demand for irrigation water is expected to rise by 10% [9]. In India, freshwater
    withdrawals are ∼761 billion cubic m (2008–12) and ∼90% of this is linked with
    the agricultural production system. In order to meet the demands of food for the
    ever-increasing population, India has to produce 37% extra rice and wheat by 2025
    using 10% less irrigation water [4]. As farmers of South Asia practice different
    crop rotations, it is imperative to assess the energy budgeting and C-auditing
    of annual crop rotations. For developing cleaner and safer production systems,
    energetics steadiness must be assessed for diverse cropping systems of upland
    rainfed as well as irrigated agro-ecosystem of eastern India [10]. Diversification
    of the existing cropping system with non-cereal crops are reported to have a lower
    emission of greenhouse gasses (GHGs) [11]. The leguminous crop has a lower C-and
    water footprint as compared to cereals due to the lesser release of GHG [12].
    Intensive tillage operations, which are an integral component of modern agriculture,
    require higher inorganic fertilizers, fossil fuels, and electricity, leading to
    increased C-footprints and declined energy use efficiency [13]. Designing of the
    productive and environmentally sustainable production systems, with lower emission
    of GHGs and energy use, is the need of the hour for a cleaner/safer environment
    and higher profitability of the farmers [14]. Zero tillage (ZT), a key component
    of conservation agriculture (CA), improves soil health, crop productivity, and
    curtails the fuel requirement leading to a significant decline in CO2 emission
    [15]. Thus, it could be an appropriate technology for reducing energy input and
    C -footprint [16]. Most of the climate-resilient cropping systems include millets,
    oilseeds, and grain legumes due to their low input requirement, better resilience
    to adverse climatic conditions and superiority in productivity under sub-optimal
    resources. Choudhary et al. [13] also highlighted the importance of millets and
    grain legumes for the sustainability of the existing production systems in developing
    countries like India. Direct seeding of rice and other climate-resilient crops
    in cereal-based cropping can further reduce the GHGs emission [17]. Energy is
    an important input in the modern agricultural production system and, therefore,
    the inter-dependence of energetics, and crop production needs to be evaluated
    for designing an energy and C- efficient cropping system [18]. The input-output
    relationship of diverse production systems varies with total biomass productivity,
    soil type, and diverse tillage practices. The extreme dependence on fossil fuels
    (diesel) and other non-renewable energy sources, and increasing awareness of the
    emission of GHGs have shifted the focus on the judicious use of renewable energy
    such as biofuels [19]. Thus, there is a need to assess the energy use efficiency
    (EUE) and C-auditing of the diverse production systems in the Indo-Gangetic Plain
    (IGP) of South Asia. The rice-based cropping system, which is critical to food
    and nutritional security of the IGP of eastern India, warrants additional research
    in the context of moderating C- and energy uses. The available scientific information
    on C-footprint of climate-resilient cropping systems is scanty for designing and
    developing the strategies of sustainable production systems. At the same time,
    GHG emission and yield penalty from the identified cropping systems must be minimized
    for a cleaner environment [12]. We hypothesized that the diversified crop rotations
    result in a reduction in energy consumption and carbon footprints and provide
    more yields and income under the climate changing scenario. Thus, the present
    investigation was aimed to evaluate the energy use patterns, C-footprints, and
    economics of 10-diverse cropping systems in eastern India. The present study aimed
    to quantify the energy-cum-carbon budgeting for an eco-friendly low C-emissive
    and economically-efficient sustainable production systems in Indo-Gangetic Plains
    and similar agro-climatic conditions of South Asia. 2. Materials and methods 2.1.
    Experiment site and climate The present investigation was conducted for four consecutive
    years from 2016 to 17 to 2019-20 in the region where the rice-wheat cropping system
    is widely practiced. The experimental site is located at the ICAR-Research Complex
    for Eastern Region, Patna, India, at 25°30′N, 85°15′E, 52 m above mean sea levels
    (MSL) (Fig. 1). This region has an annual precipitation of 1168 mm, of which 88%
    is received between July and September. The mean annual evaporation is 1573 mm.
    The data on precipitation and temperature for the study site are presented in
    Fig. 2. The soil of the experimental site was loamy in texture (50.4, 35.0 and
    14.6% sand, silt, and clay, respectively) (Typic Haplustept, Fluvisol), with pH
    of 7.5, EC of 0.12 dS m−1, soil organic carbon (SOC) content of 6.0 g kg−1, KMnO4
    oxidizable N of 64.6 mg kg−1, Olsen phosphorus of 23.9 mg kg−1, NH4OAc exchangeable
    potassium of 78.3 mg kg−1, and DTPA-extractable zinc of 0.66 mg kg−1 (0–15 cm
    soil). Download : Download high-res image (2MB) Download : Download full-size

    Treatments were laid out according to the completely randomized block design (CRBD)
    and replicated thrice. Ten cropping sequences included T1: transplanted rice (Oryza
    sativa)-wheat (Triticum aestivum)-mungbean (Vigna radiata) (CT) (Farmers practices,
    FP), T2: conventional till-direct seeded rice (CTDSR)-wheat-mungbean (ZT), T3:
    soybean (Glycine max)-maize (Zea mays) (ZT), T4: CTDSR-mustard (Brassica juncea)-urdbean
    (Vigna mungo) (ZT), T5: foxtail millet (Seataria italica)-lentil (Lens culanaris)
    (ZT)-fallow, T6: pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum)-chickpea (Cicer arietinum)
    (ZT)-fallow T7: finger millet (Eleusine coracana)-toria (Brassica rapa) (ZT)-fallow,
    T8: sorghum (grain) (Sorghum bicolor)-chickpea (ZT)-fallow, T9: maize cob (Zea
    mays)-pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan) (ZT), and T10: sorghum (fodder)-mustard-urdbean
    (ZT). All crops raised during the rainy season were grown under CT, while all
    winter and summer crops were grown under ZT, except in farmers’ practice (T1).
    In T2 treatment, ∼30% residues of rice and wheat were retained, whereas for other
    treatments crops were harvested at the ground level and removed. Two to three
    manual harvestings were done for summer crops (mungbean/urdbean) and then entire
    crop biomass was incorporated into the soil. The size of the individual experimental
    unit was 8.0 × 5.0 m (Fig. 1). 2.3. Crop establishment and management All the
    component crops were grown as per the standard crop calendar (Table 1). Before
    initiating the experiment, the land was chisel ploughed to 30 cm depth and levelled.
    The weed control was achieved by glyphosate (41% EC) at 1.5 l ha−1 a week before
    crop seeding/planting. Selective pre-and post-emergence (PE/POE) herbicides were
    used to manage the weeds. Atrazine (PE) for maize, pretilachlor (PE) for transplanted
    rice [2–3 days after transplanting (DAT)], pendimethalin (PE) followed by bispyribac-sodium
    (POE) for CTDSR [20 days after sowing (DAS)], pendimethalin (PE) for mungbean/urdbean
    and mustard (2–3 DAS), and clodinafop propagyl (POE) for wheat (30 DAS) were used
    for effective weed management. All crops of the rainy season were planted during
    the third week of June and harvested by the second week of October except for
    maize and fodder sorghum in T9 and T10 treatments. The quality protein maize (QPM),
    which was grown for dual-purpose (green cob as well as fodder), was seeded on
    20th June and harvested by the end of September in each year. All winter crops
    (e.g., wheat, oilseed, and pulses) were sown during the third week of October
    and harvested in March and April. Summer crops (mungbean/urdbean) were sown and
    harvested during the first week of April and June, respectively. Table 1. Crops,

    to compare the energy use pattern and energy ratio of diverse cropping systems.
    The primary information of energy inputs for specific crop management practices
    under the different treatments was used for calculation of energetics. All the
    inputs used in a cropping system were recorded. Energy inputs associated with
    different cropping systems and their coefficients collected from published peer-reviewed
    literature are presented in Table 2. Energy inputs include both the operational
    (direct) and non-operational (indirect) energy. The operational inputs energy
    includes human labour, fuels, and machine; and non-operational energy includes
    seed, chemical fertilizers, and pesticides. Energy output (grains, fodder, stover,
    roots) was computed by multiplying the quantity of crop production with their
    respective energy coefficients [23]. In the present study, only the energy inputs
    used in crop production were included, but the renewable/built-in sources of energy
    (solar radiation, wind, inbuilt soil fertility) were not considered, since it
    has no opportunity cost [24]. Moreover, these inputs are independent of management
    practices during the experimentation. The flow chart of the methodology is presented
    in Fig. 3. Table 2. Energy equivalent of inputs and outputs used under present

    for all inputs were totalled for computing cumulative energy input. Energy output:
    Energy outputs for a product (grain) and byproducts (straw/stalk/roots) were computed
    by multiplying the quantity with its corresponding energy equivalents. Net energy
    returns: Difference between energy output and input involved for crop production.
    The following formulae were used for calculating the energy use efficiency indices
    [23]: (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) 2.5. Carbon auditing Cumulative
    photosynthates of crops, representing total C-output, was computed by multiplying
    respective crop yields with an average C- content of biomass (∼44% on a dry weight
    basis) [25]. The C-equivalent (CE) was computed by multiplying the respective
    inputs (diesel, fertilizer, pesticide) with related emission-coefficients (Table
    3) as reported by Lal [25]. Computed CE was used in assessing C-emission based
    on production, transportation, storage, and farm operations. The sum of C-input
    and output were computed by summing up CE of all the inputs and outputs, respectively
    [13]. The C-budgeting of diverse cropping production systems was computed by using
    the following equations [28]: (12) Carbon output (kg CE ha−1) = Total biomass
    (economic yields + by-product of yields) × 0.44 (13) (14) (15) (16) Table 3. Emission

    of the different cropping sequences was converted into the rice equivalent yield
    (REY) by the following formula [18]. (15) where, MSP is the minimum support price
    as fixed by the Government of India (GOI). System rice equivalent yield (SREY)
    or system productivity and system production efficiency (SPE) was computed as
    per the following equations [18]: (16) (17) 2.7. Economic analysis Economics was
    worked out by considering all the incurred variable costs for a diverse cropping
    system. Major variable costs include uses of energy (human/machinery) for land
    preparations, fertilizer, insecticide, irrigation, harvesting and thrashing. The
    labour cost was computed by multiplying the wage rate of GOI with man-day ha−1.
    All the input cost was totalled to get the total variable cost (TVC). The gross
    returns (GR) were computed by multiplying the marketable outputs (grains/cob/fodder
    and straw/stover yield of individual crops) with their market price. Net returns
    (NR) were computed by taking the difference between gross returns (GR) and TVC
    (NR = GR-TVC). 2.8. Statistical analysis The collected data were subjected to
    analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a general linear model [29]. The F–test was
    done to determine the significant effect of treatment [30]. 3. Results 3.1. Biomass
    productivity The total annual biomass production differed among the cropping systems
    (Table 4). Intensive cropping systems [three crops year−1, T1 (farmers’ practice),
    T2, T4, and T10] produced higher total biomass (27.6–32.1 Mg ha-yr−1) on annual
    crop rotations. However, the maximum biomass production was registered in treatment
    T9 (40.2 Mg ha-yr−1), which was higher by 46, 30, 41, 55, 247, 36, 232, 27, and
    25% over T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7, T8, and T10, respectively. Irrespective of
    the cropping system, treatment T9, and T10 had higher root biomass (5.4–5.7 Mg
    ha-yr−1) than other treatments. Among the rainy season crops, sorghum, dual-purpose
    maize, and pearl millet were the most productive followed by wheat and rice. Among
    the pulses, pigeonpea produced the highest stover biomass during the winter cropping.

    The energy requirement for crop production is directly related to the management
    techniques followed and inputs used. Energy analysis is an important tool for
    judging the system production efficiency of the diverse production system and
    achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). A production system is considered
    efficient when it produces higher energy output and consumes comparatively lesser
    energy. The data on energy use patterns revealed that rice-based cropping system
    [T1 (farmers’ practice), T2 and T4] were the most energy-intensive with an energy
    input of 36872–53511 MJ ha−1 followed by T3 (30596 MJ ha−1). Whereas, the energy
    requirement of the millet-based production system was lower and varied between
    16353 (T5) and 20405 MJ ha−1 (T8). Among the intensive cropping systems (T1, T2,
    T4, T3 and T10], the lowest energy requirement was registered for T10 treatment
    (Table 5). Total energy input used followed the trends of T1 (53511)> T2 (47403)>
    T4 (36872)> T3 (30596)> T10 (29293)> T9 (22667)> T8 (20405)> T6 (19808)> T7 (17999)>

    The operation-wise energy use data showed that nutrient and water management consumed
    major shares of the total energy inputs (51–71%). The energy input used for irrigation
    in rice-based cropping systems [ T1, T2, and T4 ] was 8356–13370 MJ ha−1 as compared
    to 1672 MJ ha−1 in the millet-based production systems (T5, T6, T7, T8) (Fig.
    4). The energy inflow through crop nutrition ranged between 43 and 49% being higher
    in T1, T2, T3, T4, and T10 (Fig. 5). Among the different millet-based cropping
    system, the maximum energy input was consumed through inputs of nutrients (Table

    under diverse cropping system (average of four years). Among the various inputs,
    diesel was the most energy-intensive. The maximum consumption of diesel was noted
    in T1 treatment (Fig. 5). Diesel and electricity (direct non-renewable energy)
    accounted for 11.9–20.9 and 4.0–12.3% of energy inputs, respectively (Fig. 4).
    Overall, these items contributed to the maximum energy inputs, followed by direct-renewable
    energy (labours and water). The energy used for land preparation was higher in
    cereal-based production systems and varied from 3324 MJ ha−1 (T10) to 6728 MJ
    ha−1 (T1) compared to millet-based cropping (2630 MJ ha−1) (Table 5). Among the
    various sources of energy inputs for different operations, fertilizers contributed
    a major share of total energy inputs under cereal and millet-based production
    systems. The total energy input (indirect non–renewable energy) by fertilizer
    for T1 to T10 treatments were 23285, 22649, 13210, 16686, 7400, 8732, 9922, 8732,
    11059, and 13753 MJ ha−1, respectively (Table 5). The share of energy used for
    fertilizer was the highest followed by irrigation, land preparations, harvesting,
    and threshing in the cereal-based cropping systems. A similar trend was also noted
    in millet-based production system (Fig. 6). Download : Download high-res image

    ranged from T5 (153699 MJ ha−1)-T9 (512589 MJ ha−1) (Table 6 and Fig. 7). Irrespective
    of the cropping system, the maximum energy output was recorded in T9 (512589 MJ
    ha−1), of which 14, 72.1, and 13.9% of the energy output were credited by green
    cob, fodder, and root biomass, respectively. The energy ratio and energy profitability
    were also higher with T9 (22.6 and 21.6) followed by T8 (20.2 and 19.2). The highest
    and the lowest energy intensiveness was recorded for T1 (0.36 MJ US$−1) and T9
    (0.24 MJ US$−1), respectively (Table 6). It was evident from the data that the
    nutrient energy use and non-renewable energy use efficiency were significantly
    higher under the millet-based production systems compared to cereal-based cropping
    systems. Nutrient and non-renewable energy use efficiencies were 55.8 and 58.3%
    higher, respectively, in the millet-based than cereal-based cropping systems (Table
    6). Table 6. Energy input-output relationship of diverse cropping system under

    Carbon emission Energetics and C-footprints have close nexus to the modern agricultural
    production systems. Irrespective of the cropping systems, retention of crop residues
    consumed ∼28.6 (T10) to 58.5% (T2) of total C-input in residues recycled plots.
    Residues retained or incorporated as a source of C- consumed ∼29–59% of the total
    C-inputs in the cereal-based production system. Next to crop residues, fertilizers
    consumed ∼27.3 (T2) to 69.8% (T7) of total C-inputs (Fig. 8). Diesel used for
    land preparation, planting, threshing operations consumed 205.9–421.2 kg CE ha−1
    C-input in cereal-based cropping and 159.1–196.6 kg CE ha−1 C-input in the millet-based
    production system (Table 7). The maximum and minimum C-inputs were used in T2
    (6271 kg CE ha−1) and T5 (914 kg CE ha−1). The trend followed for C-input was
    T2> T1> T4> T10> T9> T3> T8> T6> T7> T5. The treatment T9 had the highest C-output

    practice. 3.3.2. Carbon sustainability index The sustainability of agricultural
    production systems mainly depends on their C-footprints. The C-footprints of diverse
    cropping production systems are highly dependent on the ability of crops to convert
    the absorbed nutrients into grains. Irrespective of the cropping systems, treatment
    T8 had the highest C-efficiency and CSI (11.3 and 10.3) and T2 (2.2 and 1.2) the
    lowest (Table 7). The maximum C-footprint was recorded for T2 (0.40 kg CEkg−1
    SREY), the maximum CER was for T10 (8.9), and the minimum for the T2 treatment
    (1.9). 3.4. Economics The cost of cultivation and economic returns obtained from
    the diverse cropping systems of the present study are given in Table 8. The mean
    cost of cultivation of all the intensified cropping systems (triple) was significantly
    higher than that for the double cropping system. The cost of cultivation was higher
    in cereal-based cropping systems and varied from US$ 1400 ha−1 (T3) to US$ 2080
    ha−1 (T1). The maximum net returns and benefit: cost ratio (BCR) was noted for
    T9 (US$ 3665 ha−1 and 3.75), while the lowest with T7 (US$ 500 ha−1 and 1.61).

    Results of the PCA bi-plot revealed that the first two principal components (PC1
    and PC2) were T6 and T8 treatments, which were also positively correlated with

    and cropping systems, a widely adopted management practice in the entire globe,
    is widely practiced to resolve the issues of the adverse effect of climatic changes
    in the intensive production system to achieve the environmental sustainability
    [21]. Crop diversification through climate-resilient cropping system is one of
    the main approaches for improving the productivity of the agro-ecosystem and resolving
    the issues of ecological sustainability [22]. It also helps in a reduction of
    C-footprint and energy use [31]. Thus, designing a resilient crop production system
    must be aimed at optimizing the energy input and C-footprints (CFs) of the entire
    production system. The emission of GHG and CFs of the individual crop must be
    assessed thoroughly. While designing an efficient cropping system, it is necessary
    to choose the crops/cultivars that require low input and have lower C-footprints
    [32]. Irrespective of the cropping systems, the maximum biomass production was
    noted for the T9 treatment. The variation in biomass production was attributed
    to differences in the genetic potential of individual crops [21]. Higher total
    biomass production in maize/sorghum/pearl millet-based cropping system was due
    to more production potential of C4-plants. The dual-purpose maize/millets (sorghum/pearl
    millet) and pigeonpea utilize the solar energy efficiently, and thus, had higher
    total biomass production [23]. The present investigation was also validated for
    upland rainfed conditions, where the soil moisture is the primary constraint to
    achieving high crop yields [13]. Further, better crop management practices (residual
    fertility/moistures) are also equally responsible for higher yield benefits [33].
    4.2. Energy uses and input-output relationship Energy-based system productivity,
    energy output, net energy returns, and energy ratio are some of the pertinent
    indicators for efficient appraisal of energy utilization in modern crop production.
    These indicators are helpful in assessing the enterprises, their composition,
    adoption to the specific management practices, and appraising the feasibility
    of energy requirement [11]. The necessity of energy, and its production potential
    mostly depend on inputs used, crops/cultivars, types of cropping system and crop
    establishment practices also [12]. The total energy input requirement was the
    highest in the cereal-based production system for T1 (farmers practice) (53511
    MJ ha−1), which was ∼2.6 higher than that of the millet-based production system
    (Table 6). The key factor responsible for the use of more input energy was intensive
    crop management practices for better crop productivity in cereal-based cropping
    system [18]. Crop production based on the CT was energy-input intensive and have
    lower resources use efficiency [5]. About 30–35% of energy input was used for
    land preparations and crop establishment as also reported by various researchers
    [32]. Of the total inputs for diverse farm operations, fertilizers contributed
    the maximum share of energy input (42.8–55.1%) (Fig. 5). Tuti et al. [23] also
    reported that fertilizer and seeds were the prime contributors to energy use (∼83%).
    Next to the fertilizers, diesel used for crop production was the most energy-intensive
    item (Table 6). Diesel used was the highest in cereal-based production systems
    (∼11.9–20.9%) and the lowest in millet-based cropping (∼4.04–12.3%) (Fig. 5).
    It also differs due to the adoption of high yielding crop/cultivars and different
    farm operations (ploughing, irrigation, machinery) under the diverse production
    system [24]. However, ZT production systems had a lower energy requirement owing
    to the omission of tillage and minimum intercultural operations [34]. The energy
    output of diverse production systems is governed by total biomass production including
    the main product and by-products [12]. Multiple cropping systems produced a higher
    energy output by yielding the more grain/seeds/fodder/cob and total biomass production
    except for T6 and T8 (Table 5). Irrespective of cropping systems, energy input
    contribution was the maximum for fertilizers (42.8–55.1%) due to higher levels
    of nitrogen fertilization in the rice, wheat, maize and mustard. In terms of energy
    productivity, dual-purpose maize, pigeonpea and sorghum grain/fodder were the
    most productive compared to rice/wheat. In general, the cereal-based cropping
    sequence had higher energy outputs than non-cereal systems. System-based energy
    ratio ranged from 6.8 to 22.6 and it depended on the total biomass production
    and energy input used. The energy ratio of the millet-based production system
    was higher due to the production of more biomass with minimum energy input [13].
    The treatment of T9 was identified as the most energy-efficient. The farmers’
    practices (T1) was the least energy-efficient due to the use of more energy input
    in the form of fertilizer and human labours [18]. The treatment T1, involving
    a third crop in rotation had more energy input and relatively lower energy output
    resulting in a lower energy ratio. The higher energy ratio and productivity were
    noted with higher economic yields [23]. The farmers’ practices (T1) and T2 treatment
    had minimum energy productivity. The effectiveness of energy use was better in
    maize cob/fodder, sorghum, pigeonpea as indicated by better energy ratio. The
    most energy-intensive cropping system was T1 due to the use of more energy inputs
    for the production of comparable energy outputs [16]. Thus, the optimal selection
    of crop/cultivars is necessary for designing the resource, energy, and C-efficient
    production systems [35]. The cropping systems involving maize/sorghum/pearl millet
    had the highest energy outputs with the use of lower energy input. Higher energy
    productivity of the millet-based production system was due to higher yields of
    pearl millet/sorghum/maize/sorghum fodder in terms of rice equivalent yield. The
    key factors responsible for higher energy inputs in the cereal-based production
    system was due to more energy input in the form of fertilizers, machinery, diesel
    and weeding [24]. Thus, there is a need to minimize these components in crop management
    to increase the EUE. In the present investigation, millet-based cropping sequences
    had lower energy requirement (16353–20405 MJ ha−1) compared to cereal-based cropping
    systems (30596–53511 MJ ha−1). The diminution in energy input in millet-based
    cropping system was mostly due to lower fertilizer use and intercultural operations,
    while intensive tillage in cereal-based cropping increased energy use [36]. The
    adoption of ZT production system reduced the energy use to some extent, while
    the use of pesticides augmented the same than that of CT [13]. Thus, the higher
    biomass of millet-based cropping sequences resulted in higher energy outputs under
    poor resource availability [37]. 4.3. Carbon budgeting 4.3.1. Carbon emission
    The cereal-based cropping system had the highest C-inputs. This might be due to
    residues added and more fertilizers used [T1 (farmers practice), T2, T4, T10].
    Higher C-inputs in ZT production system were due to applied residues (contaiñ44%
    C-content on a dry weight basis) [25]. Goglio et al. [38] also noted an increased
    C-input due to retention of crop residues. In cereal-based production systems,
    fertilization alone contributes ∼27.3 [T2] to 51.6% [T3] of C-input, whereas it
    ranged from 51.8 [T8)] to 69.8% [T7] in millet-based systems (Fig. 8). These differences
    in C-inputs were due to alteration in existing cropping systems [16]. Generally,
    fertilizer was the major consumer of C-inputs in cereals as well as in millet-based
    cropping systems. Among the agronomic management, the maximum shares of C-inputs
    were noted from residues followed by that from fertilizer and fossil fuel (diesel)
    [28]. The maximum C-outputs were recorded in T9 due to production of more biomass
    [12]. Substitution of rice-based cropping system by a millet-based production
    system significantly reduced carbon input and carbon footprint (CF). Such a trend
    suggested that CF of crop production largely depended on the ability of crop/cultivars
    to convert the mineral nutrition into total biomass [16]. These results are in
    agreement with the view of others who stated that CF of the cereal-based production
    system can be reduced markedly by the better agronomic management practices and
    sustainable cropping intensification through the adoption of climate-resilient
    production systems [14]. In the present study, regardless of crops and cropping
    systems, fertilizers contributed to the maximum GHG emissions followed by the
    use of diesel and machinery. Hence, emphasis should be focused on selecting those
    crop/cultivars for intensification of the existing rice-wheat system, which requires
    less tillage and fertilizers and has a higher conversion efficiency. 4.3.2. Carbon
    use efficiency Improvement in EUE and CUE of all crops in diverse production systems
    have a specific role in environmental sustainability by lowering the C-emission.
    Higher CE/CSI/CER in millet-based production system [T6 and T8)] is explicated
    by lower C-input due to lack of residues and the minimal use of inputs (fertilizers/insecticides/pesticides/irrigation).
    The highest C-footprint noted for treatment T2 (0.40 kg CE kg−1 SREY) might be
    due to the minimum emission of C from fossil fuels [13]. Higher C-input has recorded
    in residue added plots in ZT compared to that for the control plots. These data
    are in close agreement with those of Jat et al. [28]. Higher C-input used in the
    -based production system was due to more application of inorganic fertilizers.
    Higher values of CE/CSI/CER in millet-based production system were due to lower
    C-input through crop residues, fertilizer use and fossil fuel (diesel) and production
    of more C-outputs [16]. Diesel use was the 3rd most significant contributor towards
    C-emission in the cereal-based production system, but these values ranked 2nd
    with the adoption of a millet-based cropping system (Table 7 and Fig. 5). The
    total CE emission was higher in the cereal-based cropping system (262.1–421.2
    kg CE ha−1) than that of millet-based production system (159.1–196.6 kg CE ha−1).
    This gap of GWP among these cropping systems might be due to differences in the
    amount of diesel used [39]. The minimum tillage has lower GHG emissions than that
    of conventional production systems [11]. Residues retention increased the C-emission
    compared to non-residues added plots. This increase in GWP was due to added N-rich
    crop residues [38]. The cereal-based cropping system had higher CFs (0.32–0.40
    CE kg Mg−1 SREY) than that to the millet-based production system. Millet-based
    cropping system required lower C-input (913.7–1236.7 kg CE ha−1) and had C-output
    at par (13935 kg CE ha−1) to those of the cereal-based cropping systems. These
    results from the present experimentation are in close agreement to those reported
    by Choudhary et al. [13]. The marked effects of crop establishment and tillage
    practices on CE/CSI were reported by other researchers [40]. Crop residue retention/mulching
    on soil enhanced C-output and CE/CSI [39]. In the perspective of the climatic
    change scenario and human-induced emission, the viability of the diverse cropping
    system is based on C-efficiency [25]. Thus, conversion from the rice-based production
    system to millet-based cropping diminishes the fossil fuel use and improves environmental
    sustainability. Hence, the adoption and promotion of a millet-based production
    system saves the energy, improves the EUE, reduces the C-footprints, and maintains
    the equilibrium of food, nutritional security, and environmental sustainability
    issues in the IGP of South Asia. The Bi-plot PCA analysis also confirmed that
    a millet-based production system (T6 and T7) is highly correlated with C-auditing
    attributes (CE, CSI, C-footprints) and energetic variables (energy ratio, energy
    profitability, energy productivity) (Fig. 9). Similar results were also reported
    by Kumar et al. [41]. 4.4. Economics Net returns are the main evaluation tool
    to assess the effectiveness of enterprises, management options, and production
    economics [32]. The 4-year mean expenditure incurred on the cereal-based production
    sequences was higher and could be attributed to excessive tillage operation, and
    high use of fertilizers, irrigation, and human labours (Table 8). Comparatively
    lower B: C ratio in the cereal-based production system was due to lower returns
    and higher expenditure involved per unit production [41]. Thus, higher net returns
    in millet-based cropping system in the present investigation suggest that these
    alternative production systems are highly remunerative due to lower investment
    and at par economic yields in terms of rice equivalent yield to the cereal-based
    production system. Therefore, the efficient use of the natural resources (energy,
    water, labour) with the adoption of the millet-based production system in the
    diverse agro-ecosystem are feasible and viable options for improving the productivity,
    profitability and provides a cleaner/safer environment to the resource-poor farmers
    of the region [21]. Although the millet-based production systems have been proved
    to be highly efficient in terms of system productivity, profitability, energy
    ratio, reducing C-footprints and GHG emission; their adoption and substitution
    for rice-wheat cropping system with millets is a difficult task in eastern IGP
    due to the fact that rice and wheat have become a major food staple. However,
    with the increase in temperature and rainfall variability, there is a need to
    identify and target the areas suitable for the millet-based production systems.
    Being rich in nutrients and dietary fibres, millets needs to be promoted as nutri-cereals
    in the diets of rural poor. The Government policies should be changed in favour
    of millet-based production systems for wider adoption. 5. Conclusion The dominant
    rice-wheat cropping system is intensively cultivating in the Indo-Gangetic Plains
    zone of South Asia, it is an energy and C-intensive zone for rice-based cropping
    systems, there is an urgent need to deigns more efficient production systems,
    which are more productive, climate-resilient, C-and energy-efficient, and environmentally
    sustainable. This study has designed as a more productive, energy-cum-C-efficient
    production system that promote the profitability and environmentally safer production
    system for upland rainfed as well as irrigated ecosystems of India and South Asia.
    The major findings of the study are summarized as follows: 1. The adoption of
    a millet-based production system reduced energy consumption, C-input, C-footprint,
    and enhance the energy use efficiency by 84, 172, 58, and 61%, respectively, in
    comparison to cereal-based cropping systems. 2. The inclusion of millets in the
    existing system also improved the energy productivity, system productivity, and
    economic efficiency under the diverse agro-ecological zone of eastern India. 3.
    The fertilizer, a non-renewable energy input, was responsible for the major share
    of the total energy input (42–55%) followed by diesel used for machinery during
    agricultural operations (12–21%) for all the diverse cropping systems. 4. The
    nutrient and non-renewable energy use efficiencies were 55.8 and 58.3% higher,
    respectively, in the millet-based produce than those for the cereal-based cropping
    systems. Hence, the existing rice-wheat cropping system may be diversified with
    the substitution of climate-resilient millet-based production systems, which are
    more productive, resource use-efficient, energy-cum-carbon-efficient, and low
    emitter of GHGs. The information generated from this study would enhance the knowledge
    and strengthen the database of policymakers and researchers for promoting safer,
    cleaner, sustainable as well as productive climate-resilient cropping systems
    in the Indo-Gangetic Plains of South Asia to achieve the ‘Sustainable Development
    Goals’. Authorship contribution statement Rakesh Kumar: Conceptualization, Methodology.

  description: The current strategies of crop production beside the current status
    of energy and water resources are believed to be hardly capable of addressing
    the increasing global food demand. Using low-input, high-output crop production
    systems, therefore, could be a good answer to these problems. To address this
    challenge, a water and energy efficient intensive rotary hydroponic cropping system
    was developed. Plants in the area of an open-ended rotary drum take water from
    a chamber beneath the drum and grow inward toward a set of illuminating LEDs embedded
    at the drum horizontal axis. This system included an embedded irrigation unit
    which used plants' evapotranspiration fuzzy predictions for irrigating plants
    based on their water requirements, and an array of solar photovoltaic panels as
    the main source to supply renewable, clean energy. The system was evaluated in
    a lowirradiance season by growing lettuce in fuzzy-based and ordinary irrigation
    modes. According to the results, the average daily lettuce plants' ET in fuzzy
    mode was about 2.18 L. The solar unit could supply an average of about 52% of
    annual energy requirement and about 50% of energy requirement in low-irradiance
    days of winter. To produce one kilogram of marketable lettuce, fuzzy-based mode
    required 43% less area, 56% less water, and 74% less energy, compared to ordinary
    mode. Compared to open field method of lettuce planting, plants were 12 times
    denser and water usage was approximately 15 times less.

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso SECTION I. Introduction
    Burkina Faso is a country whose economy is essentially based on agriculture. Agriculture
    and fishing are among the important sources of activity and revenue in this country.
    For instance in a report (year 2015) “les politiques agricoles {a travers le monde”,
    it''s said that 82% of population is engaged in farming [1]. Burkina Faso is not
    a country with a tradition of fishing, let alone aquaculture. The fishery resource
    sector has therefore remained marginalized for a long time. Attempts to set up
    fish farms have been hampered by a lack of scientific knowledge and sufficient
    training on the species used. Production by aquaculture is very low, whereas practically
    all Burkinabe territory is classified as very favorable for the potential demand
    for aquaculture products. Aware of the challenges of aquaculture in the fight
    against poverty and because of the potential of the country, the Government of
    Burkina Faso has since 2007 the development of this sector as a priority to meet
    the needs of populations in animal protein. The Aquaculture and Aquatic Biodiversity
    Research Unit (UR-ABAQ) at Nazi BONI University is therefore part of the overall
    objective of meeting the fish protein requirements of the population. It aims
    to create a fully controlled pilot production chain for African catfish based
    on optimizing water management and maximizing the use of local agricultural by-products.
    On February 1st 2016, a 3-years EU project called WAZIUP (www.waziup.eu) was funded
    under the EU H2020 programme within the specific topic of cooperation between
    EU and sub-Saharan countries. WAZIUP is a collaborative research project using
    cutting edge technological research applications on IoT and related big data management
    and advanced analytic issues. It aims to provide ICT solutions, (at the lowest
    price possible, low energy consumption and long-range communication), corresponding
    to real African rural or urban use cases in order to allow them to reproduce them
    in a do-it-yourself philosophy. Amongst all the project''s use cases, some of
    them are to help farmers and fish farmers increase the yield of fishing and agriculture.
    A low-cost water-monitoring system, a weather station and soil moisture sensors
    have therefore been developed and deployed in fish ponds on the experiment site
    of the Aquaculture and Aquatic Biodiversity Research Unit (UR-ABAQ) at Nazi BONI
    University in Nasso village. Nasso is a village located west of the city of Bobo-Dioulasso.
    Bobo-Dioulasso is the capital of the Hauts Bassins region (Burkina Faso). The
    city of Bobo-Dioulasso, the second largest city in Burkina Faso, is located 365
    km from the capital Ouagadougou and 125 km from the Mali border. According to
    the Geographical Institute of Burkina (IGB) (2013), the geographical coordinates
    of this city are the following: W4 °- W3 °/ N13 °- N12 °. With an area of 1,102
    km, Bobo-Dioulasso is an urban commune with 12 rural communes and 205 villages
    attached (Gomgnimbou, 2015). The village of Nasso is located 15 km northwest of
    the town of Bobo-Dioulasso. The study area belongs to the South-Sudanian climate
    characterized by annual rainfall of 800 mm to 1200 mm. The Fig. 1 shows the location
    of Nasso village in Burkina Faso''s map. Fig. 1. Location of Nasso village in
    Burkina Faso''s map Show All This sensor network deployed has to help in the permanently
    measurements of certain parameters which are useful in some experiments conducted
    on fishes and crops (banana + papaya) at the research unit. This paper which relates
    our job is organized as follow.. In section 2 we describe the study environment
    by presenting the site and the conducted experiments on it. In section 3 we give
    an overview of the objectives that are guiding this deployment of sensor network.
    In section 4 we explain the methodology followed and in section 5 we describe
    the technology used. We show the results obtained in section 6 and we present
    our future works in section 7. We end by a conclusion in section 8. SECTION II.
    Study Environment A. The Site Study took place at the Aquaculture and Aquatic
    Biodiversity Research Unit (UR-ABAQ) at Nazi BONI University. UR-ABAQ is composed
    of two experimentation buildings. One for claria and another for tiliapia. Inside
    of each building, there is a hatchery and pre-fattening basin. In addition to
    theses experimentation buildings, there are some fattening basins outside which
    irrigate some experimental fields of banana and papayas solos. Fig. 2 illustrates
    a clarias hatchery and Fig. 3 illustrates a papaya field. Banana field is shown
    in Fig. 4 Fig. 2. clarias hatchery Show All Fig. 3. papaya field Show All Fig.
    4. banana field Show All B. Site Performed Experiments The experiments performed
    on the site concern artificial reproduction and production of performing clarias
    larvae and tilapias'' super male. This is done by using innovative methods which
    respect consumer and environment health. There are also some nutrition experiments.
    This is done by making many mixtures with some local products in order to find
    a better way to feed fishes at low costly. In addition to these experiments performed
    on fishes, there is experimentation on banana and papaya solos production by watering
    two fields with the water produced by the fish of the aquacultural ponds. SECTION
    III. Objectives We chose to use a Minimum Viable Product approach to deploy as
    quickly as possible a simple and operational product and improve the next versions
    by iterations based on users feedbacks and real needs. The objectives of this
    first deployment are follows. Deploy a low-cost sensor network which permits to
    measure values of parameters such ph, dissolved oxygen, water temperature, soil
    moisture and meteorological parmeters (wind speed, air humidity, rainfall, sunshine,
    …). Make a test of the robustness of this sensor network deployed. Collect and
    analyze the data measured. Test alerts sending functionnality when certain parameters
    values exceed their thresholds. SECTION IV. Methodolgy The methodology followed
    to achieve this sensor network deployment is first the assembling and deployment
    of sensing devices. Second the deployment of the gateway. And third, data collecting,
    analyzing and visualization. A. Assembling And Deployment Of Sensors The main
    components used are [2]. Microcontrollers such as Arduino pro mini and Adafruit
    Feather M0 for running sofwtare. LoRa radio modules such as HopeRF RFM 95W and
    Modtronix inAir9 for communicating data measured to the gateway. Physical sensors
    such as fuidino moisture sensor and h-101 ph electorde for measuring data. Batteries(lithium
    or AA battery) and solar panel for powering. The assembling consists of [2]. Preparing
    the boards by soldering some header pins to microcontrollers and to LoRa radio
    modules boards. Adding one or more physical sensors to the boards. Uploading a
    software to the microcontrollers. x Connecting battery to the boards. Packaging
    everything in an box which can be covered by a solar panel. Fig. 5 and the Fig.
    6 illustrate some sensing devices assembled. Fig. 5. inside view of a sensing
    device for measuring soil humidity Show All Fig. 6. box covered by solar panel
    of a sensing device for measuring water temperature, dissolved oxygen and ph Show
    All The deployment consists of placing the sensors in the dedicated places and
    make sure that the antenna and solar panel are outside. Solar must be oriented
    to the south and antenna must be in the same direction to the gateway. Fig. 7–,
    , Fig. 9, and Fig. 10 show few deployments of a soil humidity sensor, dissolved
    and ph sensors. Fig. 7. soil humidity sensing device attached to a papaya plant
    Show All Fig. 8. soil humidity sensing device attached to a banana plant Show
    All Fig. 9. ph and dissolved oxygen sensors placed in the clarias hatchery Show
    All Fig. 10. a view of a box covered by solar panel and LoRa antenena placed outside
    the clarias building Show All B. Gateway Deployment The deployment of gateway
    consists of placing it in a place where its antenna is in a high location possible
    [3]. The distance between the gateway and sensors can achieve 20km or higher range
    in line of sight condition and about 2km in non light of sight. But in our case
    it is around only 100m which separates the sensing devices with the gateway. Before
    the deployment, the gateway which is a Raspberry PI has to be equipped with a
    LoRa radio module and 2G/3G usb modem. Also some configurations must be applied
    such as setting longitude and latitude parameters, 2G/3G APN name and service
    path [3]. With the 2G/3G dongle, the gateway can also directly send SMS to an
    end-user or a cloud platform. Sending SMS can be configured to serve as a backup
    connection. This feature is very useful in WAZIUP as Internet connectivity can
    be impossible in some areas: SMS are sent to the WAZIUP platform when Internet
    is not available. Fig. 11 shows a gateway deployed Fig. 11. gateway equipped with
    3G usb modem deployed Show All C. Data Collecting And Visualization The sensors
    measure data at some time range. It is 10 minutes for meteorological sensors,
    20 minutes for water sense device and 1 hour for soil humidity sensors. Once a
    sensor measures a data, it communicates it a first time to the gateway. And in
    a second time the gateway stores data locally and pushed them online. The online
    storage is made into some clouds platforms http://kibana.waziup.io/ and http://dashboard.waziup.io/.
    In these platforms data can be viewed as simple text or as graphs. Graphs represent
    data measured in a certain period. kibana.waziup.io permits to filter data through
    certain fields such as sensor name, date and time of data measured, attribute
    designing the specific parameters from the environment sensed. On dashboard.waziup.io,
    it''s possible to remove or edit sense devices information. Fig. 12 and Fig. 13
    present respectively possible visualization views of kibana.waziup. and dashboard.waziup.io.
    Fig. 12. data filtering on kibana.waziup.io Show All Fig. 13. actions possible
    on sensors on dashboard.waziup.io Show All SECTION V. Technology Description IoT
    and Big Data are great technologies that can permit to collect real time data
    in certain domains such as fish farming and agriculture for purposes like water
    quality monitoring, crops status monitoring, weather predictions, etc. Nowadays
    developed countries discuss about massive deployment of IoT. However African countries
    are still far from being ready to enjoy the benefit of IoT. The causes of this
    late are: lack of infrastructure, high cost of hardware, complexity in deployment,
    lack of technological eco-system and background technologies. To Deploy IoT in
    Africa context especially in sub-Saharan zone, it''s necessary to take into account
    the cost of deployment. That''s why we use low cost sensing devices and low cost
    gateway in the sensor network. We use mainly low-cost and low-power components
    in the sensor network. 1) Low-Cost And Low Power Sensing Devices Sensor devices
    are built by using “off-the-shelves” components. Indeed we use arduino boards,
    LoRa modules and physical sensors. Arduino boards are well-known in the microcontroller
    user community for their low-cost and simple-to-program features. The main arduino
    board used is Arduino Pro Mini, which comes in a small form factor and is available
    in a 3.3v and 8MHz version for a cost less than 2 € from Chinese manufacturers.
    Arduino boards can be run with a 4 AA regular batteries. Semtech''s long-range
    technology (called LoRa) is a spread spectrum technology which can manage sub-ghz
    frequency of an end-device for maximize battery life [4]. LoRa technology, which
    can be privately deployed in a given area without any service subscription is
    a good alternative to non energy efficient and expensive mobile telecommunication
    infrastructure (e.g., GSM/GPRS, 3G/4G/LTE). There are many LoRa modules to connect
    to arduino in order to communicate data measured to the gateway. Ones we used
    are HopeRF RFM92W/95W and the Modtronix inAir9/9B. Their prices are between 7
    and 15 € [5]. It''s possible with theses off-the-shelves components to get a fully
    operational low cost and low power sensing device at a cost less than 15 € that
    can run over one year without need to change battery. 2) Low Cost Gateway The
    gateway used in the senor network is based on a Raspberry PI (1B/1B+/2B/3B) which
    is low cost (less than 30) and a reliable embedded Linux Platform. The gateway
    equipped with LoRa modules as sensing device ones can receive from any LoRa device
    and is designed to be fully customizable for a targeted application with post-processing
    features based on high-level languages such as python [5]. The gateway deployed
    handles all the sensing devices in the sensor network. It''s in charge to store
    locally or push data received from sensing devices into a cloud platform. The
    locally storage helps to visualize even there is no Internet connection. Raspberry
    PI needs only 5v as supply power. So the consummation of energy is not high 3)
    Waziup Platform Conceived on the Paas paradigm Waziup platform is an IoT and Big
    Data platform. IoT platform in the sense that it handles sensors connectivity
    (via an Iot bridge1) and processes received data (transform its format, apply
    some operator, etc). It manages also information relative to sensors. Indeed in
    the platform it''s possible to add, modify or delete a sensor virtually. Big data
    platform aspect is the fact that waziup platform permits to store data generated
    by sensors. The volume of data is huge and data are sent at any moment. In addition
    to the huge storage capacity, Waziup platform performs data analytics (filtering,
    aggregating, correlating,…) to extract the most valuable information for the sake
    of monitoring and actuation. In waziup platform data are visualized in real time.
    The visualizations can be as simple text or as graphs. In addition to a versatile
    remote cloud support, the gateway has a local MongoDB database to store incoming
    messages. For instance, to handle temporary Internet connectivity issues, the
    gateway can store received messages until Internet is back again. However, the
    main utilization for the MongoDB database is to provide easy interaction with
    an embedded web server to graphically display historical received data on a user''s
    smartphone. Waziup platform has the capacity to provide information as alerts
    or recommendations to users through sms or social notifications (Facebook or Twitter).
    Waziup platform can be replicated locally. This is interesting because when Internet
    connection is not permanent. So even there is no Internet connection, it would
    be possible to use the same possibilities of online waziup platform locally. SECTION
    VI. Resuslts Data collected from the gateway show that the sensor network is functional.
    Indeed data are sent regularly (day and night) into waziup platform. The sending
    rate is respected for the different sensing devices. But we noticed that per moment
    data could not be sent due to internet connection problem in the most of cases.
    But sometimes the problems were other things like battery issue of a sensing device,
    sensor recalibrating. In this section we show few graphs of water temperature
    (Fig. 14), dissolved oxygen (Fig. 15) data collected on a period of 01/17/18 to
    02/14/18. Also we present wind speed (Fig. 16) data collected on 01/12/18 to 02/19/18
    and air temperature (Fig. 17) collected in the same time. Fig. 14. water temperature

    air temperature measured on 01/12/18 to 02/19/18 Show All The different graphs
    demonstrate that the sensor network is in good health. SECTION VII. Future Works
    In our future works we shall have two particular use cases in Nasso and in Moussougou.
    In Nasso we will be interested in the study of the contribution of a fertilizer
    on maize yield and in Moussodougou, the prediction of the fish growth. 1) Evaluation
    Of The Effects Of Organic Substrates On Maize Yield And Soil Fertility In The
    Houet Province The context of agriculture in Burkina Faso is characterized by
    an overall decline in the yields of all speculation and an acceleration of land
    degradation. This degradation affects 20% of arable land today. For the improvement
    and maintenance of soil fertility, various sources of fertilization are tested.
    The use of organic matter has the advantage of maintaining and increasing yields
    and at a lower cost. There are different types of organic inputs that are differentiated
    by their origin (plant or animal), their degree of decomposition (C / N ratio)
    and their richness in humus (iso-humic coefficient). For this study, poultry droppings
    and maggot residues are used to improve agricultural production and soil fertility.
    The objectives of the study are to determine - the effect of maggot substrates
    and poultry droppings on maize yield; and - the effect of maggot substrates and
    poultry droppings on soil chemical parameters. We shall use sensors to determine
    chemical parameters of the soil and soil moisture. The main chemical analyzes
    of the soil will concern pH, total carbon, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, total
    potassium, assimilable phosphorus and available potassium. The horizon 0–20 cm
    is concerned with the chemical analyzes of the soil. Soil moisture is determined
    to see the effect of drought pockets. The horizons 0–20 cm, 20–40 cm and 40–60
    cm are concerned by the measurement of the soil moisture. The sensors will have
    to collect these parameters according to a time step. An interval of 1 month is
    sufficient for chemical parameters. At the beginning of the study additional laboratory
    analyzes will be carried out (2 or 3 times depending on the financial means) to
    confirm the sensor data. 2) Prediction Of Fish Growth In Moussodougou Dam Fishing
    is a very important activity there and carried out mainly by the populations around
    water reservoirs. Among the major reservoirs where the fishery is developing is
    the Moussodougou dam (shown in Fig. 18), which covers an area of 600 hectares
    with a capacity of 35,350,000 m3. Since its setting-up, the dam has been the subject
    of fish farming by indigenous peoples. According to a study carried out by the
    IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature), members of the fishing
    group have seen their income increase and their living conditions improved since
    the dam was built. However, since a while, there has been a decrease in the quantities
    taken by fishermen, whose causes are certainly multiple. These include anthropogenic
    pressure (over-exploitation), pollution and climate change. This situation results
    in a reduction in fish diversity on the one hand and an impoverishment of the
    actors of the fishing sector with regard to the loss of earnings on the other
    hand. Fig. 18. Moussodougou''s dam Show All Given this situation, stock assessment
    of various species is becoming a necessity. The overall objective of the planned
    deployment is to identify the degradation factors of the production and to quantify
    the specific biomasses exploited in the dam of Moussodougou in order to know the
    state of their exploitation. In this deployment, in addition to collecting the
    physicochemical parameters of the water, we will: determine biological variables
    (bio-indicators) from benthic macro-invertebrates and phytoplancton; identify
    and quantify the main species exploited in the dam with machine learning techniques.
    SECTION VIII. Conclusion We demonstrated in this paper that it''s possible to
    use a sensor network to measure automatically and permanently some weather, water,
    etc parameters. we started by describing the study environment. After we presented
    the objectives, we explained how to assemble and deploy sensors and gateway. Further
    we explained the technology used and we finished by presenting some graphs represented
    parameters dissolved oxygen, water temperature, wind speed and air temperature
    values sent on waziup platform. This sensor network has to help fish farmers to
    control better their fish''s production and to optimize the watering of agricultural
    fields. Also it permits to determine the correlations between the weather parameters
    and the production of crops. ACKNOWLEDGMENT We are grateful to WAZIUP project

    Conference Location: Bangalore, India SECTION I. Introduction Water is one of
    the important resources for the life of animals, plants and human beings. We need
    to conserve the existing water resources and manage efficiently for the betterment
    of Plantlife. Effect of exhausting freshwater resources could be worse than depletion
    of oil. It may cause a complete destruction of numerous life forms on earth. It
    is our responsibility to save and use the water properly. Agriculture is one of
    the important sectors which depend on the freshwater resource for food production.
    Efficient water utilization in agriculture requires technology intervention in
    the traditional method of farming where they depend on rainwater. Efficient water
    utilization in agriculture includes many aspects such as Sensor-based field and
    resource mapping, Smart irrigation, Remote equipment monitoring, remote crop monitoring,
    Predictive analytics for crops and livestock, Climate monitoring and forecasting,
    Livestock tracking and geo- fencing, etc. We know that Indian agriculture is mainly
    depending on monsoons rainfall. The gambling of monsoon disturbs the food production
    in the agriculture sector. As the monsoon rainfalls are unpredictable, the irrigation
    is necessary for agriculture throughout all the seasons. In India, 80% of rainfall
    is during June to October. Hence it is necessary to irrigate farmland during the
    rest of the months safely and efficiently [1]. With the invent of IoT and Cloud
    computing, the agriculture sector has opened up a new door for “Precision agriculture”.
    Precision farming can be thought of as anything that makes the farming practice
    more controlled and accurate when it comes to raising livestock and the growing
    of crops. In this approach of farm management, a key component is the use of IT
    and various items like sensors, control systems, robotics, autonomous vehicles,
    automated hardware, variable rate technology, and so on. The adoption of access
    to highspeed internet, Cloud data store, mobile devices, and reliable, low-cost
    satellites (for imagery and positioning) by the manufacturer are few key technologies
    characterizing the precision agriculture trend. This paper focuses on design and
    development of the CloudIoT based irrigation system for conservation of water.
    Smart irrigation is capable of supplying the water to the entire field uniformly,
    schedule and controls the water supply remotely so that each plant has the adequate
    amount of water it needs, neither too much nor too little as shown in Fig 1. Fig.
    1 Irrigation system using cloudiot paradigm Show All Water use efficiency in the
    field can be determined by Field Water Efficiency (%) = (Water Transpired by Crop
    ÷ Water Applied to Field) x 100. The system is designed to develop an automatic
    irrigation system which switches the pump motor ON/OFF on sensing the moisture
    content of the soil. The network of wireless sensors has provided ample opportunities
    for automation. These help to obtain details from resources like water, soil,
    or air in the field and analyze them to take the decision to improve the yield
    and save resources. Lightweight publisher-subscriber protocol MQTT is used for
    communication purpose by which harvests will be evaluated for soil moisture, humidity,
    temperature, water supply to crops. Monitoring these parameters will help in comprehending
    and managing agrarian varieties for prominent yield. The environmental parameters
    are stored in Dynamo DB for further reference. AWS gateway with AWS Lambda is
    used to notify the user/farmer. The advantage of using this method is to reduce
    human intervention and still ensure proper irrigation. Smart Irrigation system
    using CloudIoT is shown in figure 1. Main advantages of MQTT for IoT agent are
    Security, Central Broker, Quality of Service, Last will & Testament and Retained
    messages and Flexible Subscription pattern. MQTT has been replaced HTTP as the
    throughput of MQTT is 93 times faster than HTTP''s and it is more data-centric.
    The MQTT is an M2M publisher-subscriber protocol which follows client-server architecture,
    every sensor is a client and a broker is a server. The lightweight and efficiency
    of MQTT make it possible to significantly increase the amount of data being monitored
    or controlled. SECTION II. Related Work The authors Alessio Botta et al, [1] have
    discussed the CloudIoT paradigm, a combination of cloud computing technology and
    IoT in development of smart applications. The different drivers for integration
    stated are communication, storage, and computation. The challenges in integrating
    these technologies are security, privacy, heterogeneity, performance and big data.
    The open issues in these are standardization, intelligence, pricing, service level
    agreement and energy efficiency. The authors Antonis Tzounis et al [2] describe
    the different application of IoT in the agriculture sector. The integration of
    cloud and IoT for climate monitoring is proposed in the paper. Tracking in the
    food supply chain, livestock applications for monitoring the animals and the agricultural
    fields are discussed in the paper. A. Zanella et al [3] have proposed the architecture
    of IoT application in the smart cities with the example ‘Padova’ city. The protocol
    stack for the constrained and unconstrained devices is mentioned. A. Zanella et
    al [4] point out the different sections where the IoT could be embedded in the
    healthcare sector. The different services in healthcare such as m-health, wearable
    device access, child health and drug reactions are described. The applications
    such as blood pressure, temperature, ECG, glucose level monitoring, wheelchair
    management are discussed. In [5] the amalgamation of cloud and IoT technology
    is applied in the conservation of the architecture to preserve the heritage. The
    structural health of the architecture is captured and monitored through the system.
    The revolution in the disruptive technologies such as cloud computing, IoT, machine
    learning and data analytics has made its mark in different sectors such as transportation,
    agriculture, healthcare, environment monitoring, renewable energy systems, retail
    and industry In [6] authors discuss general aspects of agriculture Agricultural
    people typically follow three prominent methods of irrigation namely channel system,
    sprinkler system, drip system. This system consumes much time and effort. Automation
    of irritation makes agronomist work much easier this motivated us to structure
    a smart irrigation system. Authors in [15] discuss smart irrigation system and
    also speaks about the measures taken and issues identified to automate traditional
    methods in agriculture. In [7] and [8] author discusses a WSN based the irrigation
    control and collection of data from the sensor for vegetable crops is through
    a system with collects weather parameter through Smartphone. In [9] the uses of
    sensors and data analysis are discussed. In [10] the IoT application in smart
    irrigation using low-cost devices is proposed. Authors in papers [11]–[14] summarize
    about the use of a lightweight MQTT as the most suitable and the most efficient
    and prominent one. After its invention in 1999, it is widely implemented across
    many sectors. Different devices used in the IoT systems such as raspberry pi is
    also quoted in the paper. In [17] the authors discuss the applications developed
    using IoT alone. In [18] the authors explore the open source software environment
    for implementing the cloud services such as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS),
    Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service(SaaS). In [19] the authors
    propose a curriculum with IoT as a course suggested in the 3rd year for enabling
    the students to develop interdisciplinary projects. In [20] a FarmBot used for
    precision agriculture is described. The data-driven decision support system is
    included to assist the farmer in making the decisions. In [21] the fertigation
    along with automated irrigation is an IoT application described. In [22] the Cloud-based
    architecture for the farming is presented. In [23] the role of big data in making
    the farming decision is discussed. Fig 2 Blend of cloud and internet of things
    architecture [23]. Show All SECTION III. The Cloud Iot Architure The different
    layers adopted in the CloudIoT architecture are user layer, proximity network,
    public cloud and provider cloud as shown in fig 2. The user devices such as mobile,
    tablet, laptops connect to the cloud services using the internet. The users within
    the coverage area (proximity network) are only able to connect to the services.
    The aggregated data from the sensor devices (things) is gathered at the IoT gateway
    devices. The edge computing devices connect the gateway devices to the data centers,
    the backend infrastructure of the provider cloud. The services provided by the
    cloud provider fall into the public network category. The device registry, management,
    and identity services are provided by the service providers. To connect to the
    cloud infrastructure the developer need to obtain the access control permission
    keys, performed using the API (Application interface) management module of the
    provider cloud. The visualization, data analytics, process management and data
    storage services are available for the applications developed using provider cloud
    infrastructure. At each of the layers in the CloudIoT architecture, the security
    module is embedded. The cloud users have to sign a Service Level Agreement (SLA)
    to use the services of the cloud provider, which are governed by the authorities
    in the region. SECTION IV. Proposed System The CloudIoT architecture layers are
    applied to the case study smart irrigation system in the agriculture sector as
    shown in fig 3. The mobile app is used to on/off the water motor remotely by the
    user to increase the water efficiency. Option is provided to the user to on/off
    the motor manually also. The user can schedule the watering of the plants based
    on the soil moisture content in the field. The efficiency of the water used in
    the field is computed as: A. User Layer Field Water Efficiency (%) = (Water Transpired
    by Crop ÷ Water Applied to Field) x 100 B. Proximity Network The devices within
    the coverage are able to communicate with the gateway device. IoT Device: The
    temperature sensor (DHT11: Digital Humidity and temperature), a soil moisture
    sensor, light sensor are connected to the controller device. The temperature,
    moisture, and light intensity data are sent to the IoT gateway device. IoT gateway
    device: The Raspberry Pi 3 is used as the gateway device which is connected to
    the AWS provider cloud. Is used to execute the AWS client along with the embedded
    service to read sensor values in the digital format, AWS client called AWS MQTT
    SDK is the standard package provided by the AWS to interface the hardware pi device
    with the AWS IoT MQTT server. C. Public Network The application built is hosted
    on a public network, using the provider cloud infrastructure. The cloud application
    developer has to select a server in the region of the application developer; these
    form the edge computing service module. Iot Connectivity The lightweight protocol,
    MQTT is used for the communication between the client nodes and the service provider.
    MQTT protocol uses the ‘publish-subscribe’ type of communication model. The components
    of the protocol are publisher/subscriber, messages, topic and broker. The message
    between the publisher and the subscriber node are exchanged with the help of the
    broker node. The broker agent receives the messages, filters the message and publishes
    the messages to the subscriber nodes. The subscriber subscribes for the messages
    published by the publisher. If the subscriber loses the connectivity with the
    MQTT broker, the broker notifies the subscriber with the ‘Last Will and Testament’
    feature, in this case, the subscriber can publish new message. Criteria for the
    Subscriber To Receive the Data The subscriber subscribed topic should be the same
    as the topic published by the publisher. Both the subscriber and the publisher
    should be connected to the same broker. Topics Topics are case sensitive; wildcards
    are allowed when registering a subscription. The topic matching is performed using
    the hierarchical structure. Security The authentication of the MQTT subscribers''
    nodes is performed by the broker. The protocol guarantees privacy by encrypting
    the payload using SSL/TLS. Application-Level Qos (quality of service) The QoS
    is of three levels zero, one and two value. The value zero indicates ‘fire and
    forget’, the value one indicates ‘delivered at least once’ and the value two indicates
    ‘delivered exactly once’. Mqtt Strengths Space, time and synchronization decoupling
    features, security, QoS, ‘Last will and testament’ are the strengths of the MQTT
    protocol. The CoAP is the other lightweight protocol, with four-byte compact header,
    strong DTLS security, asynchronous subscription and built-in discovery. D. Provider
    Cloud The visualization, analysis, process management, and data storage services
    are taken from the services provider. Device Management AWS IoT is used for executing
    the MQTT server where an instance of a physical device is created along with the
    certificates required for security purposes. To publish the soil moisture sensor
    values on to AWS IoT MQTT server the topic name chosen is ‘pi2aws'' [16]. API
    Management The access control keys are obtained for - reading and writing data
    and also to implement AWS alarms and cloud watch services. Process Management
    The actual lambda functions are written inside this service so whenever a sensor
    data is published on to the MQTT server the corresponding lambda functions associated
    with the events are triggered and the corresponding action written in the function
    is executed. (Alarms like forwarding the soil data to the AWS dynamo database)
    Fig 3. Proposed cloudiot smart irrigation system Show All Device Data Store It
    is used to store the sensor values in the database for further referral and also
    for the analysis of the data sent to the cloud. DynamoDB a NoSQL database is used
    to store the two attributes of the sensor: the sensor values and the timestamp
    at which it was generated. NoSQL is a scheme less database. Each record in the
    database can have a variable size attributes. Notification as a Service This service
    is used to push the notifications on to the client or the farmer whenever low
    moisture values are encountered in order to specify that the soil is dry and corresponding
    actions are taken, the reminder is sent via email, by using SNS mailer of SNS.
    Data Analysis The Weka (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis) tool is used
    to perform the data analysis. It consists of machine learning algorithms for preprocessing,
    classification, clustering, association mining, analysis, prediction and visualization
    of the data set using the graphical user interface. The Sequence of steps executed
    is as follows: The moisture content in the soil is sensed through the soil moisture
    sensor placed at various locations in the field. The sensed data is read by the
    pi through GPIO 21 (General Purpose Input Output pin) sent via ADC (Analog to
    Digital Converter) The sensor value is analyzed for its meaning if sensor data==1
    then the soil is dry. if sensor data==0 then the soil is wet. The analyzed data
    is then published to the MQTT server on AWS IoT platform based on the value sensed
    in the topic name of ‘pi2aws''. The alarms get activated on AWS in cloud watch
    and the corresponding triggers are executed: the sensor data is pushed to AWS
    dynamo database if the sensed value says that the soil is dry then the SNS is
    triggered and the SNS mailer is used to notify the farmer via mail. The farmer
    then can take decisions accordingly. Mobile Application The 3rd party mobile application,
    “MQTT Dashboard”, is customized for the use in remote switching (on/off) of the
    water pump in the field. SECTION V. Result Analysis Performance of Mqtt The performance
    of the system is increased using MQTT with an average time 4.38 msec for responses.
    As the packet header of the MQTT is 2 bytes smaller than CoAP (Constrained Application
    Protocol) packet header the performance of MQTT is 30% better than CoAP. Sensor
    Data Analysis The analysis of sensor data obtained through different attributes
    as shown in table I. is performed. Table I. Attributes and description of the
    sensor data set Table II shows the analysis of the temperature and the light intensity
    needed for the plant growth in the data collected location. Analysis of the temperature,
    light intensity and humidity help to determine the supply of water to the plants.
    Fig 4 shows the analysis of the humidity at the location of the data collection
    is performed using WEKA tool. Fig 5 shows the data analysis performed using the
    Cloudwatch service provided by the service provider. The number of successful
    connections for one-week duration is monitored as shown in fig 5. Visualization
    of the MQTT and HTTP protocol messages exchanged between IoT devices and the provider
    cloud is shown in fig 6. The connection establishment ping, publish and subscribe
    are the different types of messages exchanged between the IoT device and the service
    provider cloud. The direction of the inbound and the outbound messages are monitored
    and represented in the dashboard. Fig 4 Analysis of the humidity at the location
    of data collected using WEKA tool. Show All Fig 5. Data analysis of successful
    connections using cloudwatch services. Show All Table II. Analysis of the average
    temperature and light intensity in the dataset SECTION VI. Conclusion The integration
    of Cloud Computing and Internet of Things (CloudIoT) has given the next big leap
    ahead in the solution domain in the form of smart applications. Wireless Sensor
    Networks which is considered as one of the important components in IoT encouraged
    a new path of research in agricultural and farming domain. In recent times, WSNs
    are widely applied in various agricultural applications to improve the productivity
    by making use of existing resources in an optimal way to cut down the costs incurred
    in farming. The key contribution of the proposed work makes use of lightweight
    protocol MQTT to provide efficient and secure communication between the users
    and the device/sensors thereby increasing the performance of smart irrigation
    system. Fig 6 Visualization of messages used in MQTT protocol. Show All The sensor
    data is analyzed using WEKA tool to control the water supply to plants and helps
    in scheduling the proper flow of water only when it is needed for plants. The
    blend of CloudIoT technology has reduced the human interventions in the monitoring
    of plants. This helps in achieving scalability if extended to the entire rural
    region. SECTION VII. Future Work The proposed system can be improved by recommendation
    engine and prediction module for the complete automation of the irrigation system.
    Recommendation engine uses historical data of a user, soil moisture, temperature,
    humidity, light intensity and elevation to recommend the type of crop that can
    be sown to improve the yield in that location. Prediction module can be used to
    analyze current conditions of the environment to control the sprinkler or water
    supply to plants without the human interventions. Authors Figures References Citations

    In the last five years, the Chilean Ministries of Agriculture and Energy developed
    a national strategy to incorporate renewable energies into various economic sectors.
    Since 2013, more than 1500 off-grid solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, with power
    ranging from 1 kW to 3 kW, were installed to drive existing irrigation systems
    in small and medium-sized farms for the exportation of fresh fruit. A net billing
    regulation was also implemented in 2014. This study shows a cost-effective methodology
    for the sizing of solar PV systems for existing irrigation facilities in Chile,
    in an effort to improve the competitiveness of the fresh-fruit industry. The same
    methodology may also be implemented in other Latin American countries. The article
    presents the analysis of four projects (two in the Atacama Region, and two in
    the Maule Region). The baseline situation of the four units was studied, as well
    as the energy-efficient actions that may be applied, in addition to the recommended
    characteristics of the selected PV system to drive the irrigation systems of small
    fresh-fruit farms. Off-grid and on-grid solar PV systems were analyzed, including
    some particularities of the Chilean regulations. The required water demand of
    the irrigation systems and their corresponding pressure heads were also determined.
    The electricity demand of the system was calculated, and the PV system was designed

    PV systems 1. Introduction Currently, some developing countries have progressed
    agriculture beyond just being a local food self-sufficient activity. Agriculture
    now plays a key role in the social and economic development of communities. Agriculture,
    like other activities, is currently attempting to incorporate sustainability actions,
    including the reduction in energy consumption, the diminishment of environmental
    impact, and the preservation of natural resources, such as water and soil [1].
    The use of renewable energies is one way of making agriculture more sustainable.
    In this context, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)
    and the European Union promoted the use of renewable energies in agricultural
    activities [2]. Irrigation is a prime candidate for improvement as it represents
    one of the most energy-intensive activities in farming. Irrigation systems may
    be classified as on-grid or off-grid depending on electrical grid access. In general,
    off-grid systems use fossil fuels, such as diesel, in stationary generator sets
    [2,3,4,5]. Although rural electrification is expanding, it may still not be technically
    or economically feasible in some regions of Asia and Latin America due to the
    cost of extending the electrical grid, and the complicated access to some remote
    areas [6,7,8]. The use of renewable energy contributes to reducing the dependency
    on fossil fuels and greenhouse emissions [7]; consequently, solar energy has been
    used to power irrigation in agricultural activities for two decades [9]. Solar
    photovoltaic (PV) irrigation systems may be classified as either off-grid, when
    the system is isolated from the electrical grid (Figure 1b), or on-grid, when
    the system is connected to the electrical grid (Figure 1a). In Reference [3],
    off-grid installations are described as the most typically implemented solar PV
    irrigation systems. The off-grid approach presents itself as a viable, cost-sensitive
    solution for irrigation systems due to difficulties in electrical grid connections
    in remote areas [10]. Many authors [2,3,7,9,11,12] discussed the use of off-grid
    solar PV irrigation systems for remote areas in the last decade. Some reports
    focused on off-grid solar PV systems connected directly to the pump [11], while
    others also described storage alternatives such as batteries and water storage
    [2]. The present study considers direct solar PV irrigation systems. Figure 1.
    (a) Schematic of an on-grid photovoltaic (PV) irrigation system. (b) Schematic
    of an off-grid PV irrigation system. Irrigation is a seasonal activity as crops
    only require water during some months of the year. This situation may prove inhibitory
    to the incorporation of off-grid solar PV irrigation systems [12]. In some cases,
    the use of on-grid solar PV irrigation systems may be more beneficial, as they
    have the ability to disperse excess electricity into the electrical grid when
    its generation is greater than the demand of the irrigation system in periods
    where water is unnecessary, or when the electricity demand is lower than the electricity
    generated by the PV system. This option is only possible when access to the electrical
    grid exists [1]. Additionally, on-grid systems allow the extension of irrigation
    time during periods of reduced solar radiation, by altering the size of the pumping
    system [13]. Chile is the main exporter of fresh fruit in the Southern Hemisphere,
    and the top exporter of table grapes, strawberries, and blueberries in the world
    [14]. The fruit farmland was estimated to be 322,197 hectares in 2016. Sixty percent
    of the producers are small or medium-sized, with their fruit farmland encompassing
    around 0.5 hectares to 3 hectares [14]. In the fresh-fruit industry in Chile,
    the electrical cost is relatively high in comparison with other members of the
    Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) [15]; therefore,
    some solutions should ideally be implemented so as to reduce the electrical cost,
    such as the incorporation of solar PV systems into existing irrigation systems.
    In addition, the installation of solar PV systems is a reasonable approach thanks
    to the high solar radiation across most of Chile [16]. Since 2012, the Chilean
    Ministries of Agriculture and Energy developed a national strategy to incorporate
    renewable energies into the agriculture sector. Between 2013 and 2014, 1480 off-grid
    solar PV systems, with power ranging from 1 kW to 3 kW, were installed to drive
    existing irrigation systems in small and medium-sized farms for the exportation
    of fresh fruit [17]. Some doubts exist with regards to the focus of the program
    as there is no evidence of an adequate analysis of the existing irrigation systems’
    baseline prior to the installation of the solar PV system. In Reference [18],
    it is indicated that most farmers in Latin American countries have old and inefficient
    irrigation systems, resulting in an overconsumption of energy, which accounts
    for approximately 50% of the annual operational cost. Similar situations are observed
    around the world: Reference [19] reported pump efficiencies ranging between 20%
    and 30% in existing irrigation systems in Tunisia; Reference [20] reported a motor-pump
    performance of 30%. An inefficient irrigation system requires an unnecessarily
    oversized solar PV system. Also, irrigation is only necessary in some months and
    in some hours; consequently, there is a gap between electricity produced by an
    off-grid solar PV system and electricity required by the irrigation system. In
    2014, a net metering billing policy, Regulation Number 20.571, was approved, allowing
    the injection of excess electricity from PV systems into the electrical grid for
    systems with an installed capacity lower than 100 kW. Consequently, on-grid solar
    PV system may be considered as a configuration when there is a nearby electrical
    grid. Furthermore, Chile has an electrical grid that covers 99% of the population
    [21]; consequently, most farms have access to electricity for housing and harvest
    purposes. Therefore, the analysis of on-grid solar PV systems is warranted. There
    are some opportunities to reduce the electrical cost associated with irrigation
    systems via energy-efficient approaches. However, most of the fresh-fruit industry
    in Chile does not have access to the adequate technical information required to
    correctly design irrigation systems, or to apply energy-efficient actions so as
    to improve actual systems. In general, the baseline situation is not well known;
    consequently, the potential for energy efficiency is also unknown. Other factors
    contributing to the lack of information include limited available data regarding
    the successful implementation of energy efficiency in the use of PV irrigation
    systems. The general objective of this research is to demonstrate a cost-effective
    methodology for the sizing of solar PV systems for existing irrigation facilities
    in Chile. An adequate design of a solar PV system to drive existing irrigation
    systems may improve the competitiveness of the fresh-fruit industry in Chile and
    other Latin American countries. The article presents four projects of energy-efficient
    actions for solar PV systems incorporated into existing irrigation systems in
    a small fresh-fruit industry. Off-grid and on-grid solar PV systems were analyzed
    in two Chilean regions, as well as some particularities of the Chilean regulations.
    For each irrigation system, the baseline situation was determined, as well as
    the potential energy-efficient actions, in addition to the recommended installation
    of the PV system. 2. Proposed Methodology for the Implementation of a Solar PV
    System into Existing Irrigation Systems A simple methodology for the design of
    adequate solar PV irrigation systems for both off-grid and on-grid configurations
    is presented below. As shown in Figure 2, the methodology consists of three steps:
    the determination of the water required by the crops, the electricity required
    by the irrigation system, and the PV design to supply all (off-grid) or part (on-grid)
    of the electricity required by the irrigation system. Initially, the baseline
    situation of the existing irrigation system was analyzed (Year 0), which was generally
    characterized by an oversized irrigation system with a high operational cost and
    no maintenance procedures. Subsequently, the water demand of the crops and the
    electricity demand of the proposed irrigation system were calculated. Some energy-efficient
    actions were also implemented in the existing irrigation system (Year 1). Once
    the existing irrigation system was adequately improved, the solar PV system was
    then sized and installed (Year 2). The performance of the irrigation system was
    appropriately monitored on a yearly basis following the implementation of each
    stage. Figure 2. Proposed methodology for the implementation of a solar PV irrigation
    system. 2.1. Water Demand The irrigation system’s water demand arises from an
    estimation of the water needed to obtain optimal crop production. The water demand
    is calculated from the estimated crop evapotranspiration (ETc); however, an estimation
    of the ETc requires knowing the reference evapotranspiration (ET0). Doorenbos
    and Pruitt [22] defined ET0 as the sum of the water evaporated from the soil and
    the water transpired by a large area of ground completely covered with grass under
    ideal conditions (active growth and without water restriction). ET0 was estimated
    using the most accepted method, based on the Penman–Monteith equation [23], as
    shown below. 𝐸 𝑇 0 = 0.408Δ( 𝑅 𝑛 −𝐺)+ 900𝛾 𝑢 2 ( 𝑒 𝑠 − 𝑒 𝑎 ) 𝑇 Δ+𝛾(1+0.34 𝑢 2
    ) (1) where ET0 is calculated in mm per day, Rn is the net solar radiation incident
    on the crop surface, G is the heat rate of the soil (MJ/(m2·day)), γ is the psychrometric
    constant (kPa/°C), u2 is the wind velocity measured at an altitude of two meters,
    es is the saturated steam pressure, and ea is the actual steam pressure, both
    of which are measured in kPa. Δ is the slope of the steam pressure, given in kPa/°C.
    Agrometeorological stations measured all climate variables for the determination
    of ET0, which depends on wind speed, solar radiation, air temperature, and relative
    humidity. ETc was estimated from ET0 and the crop coefficient (Kc). Kc takes into
    account the type of crop, the climatic conditions, the characteristic parameters
    of the soil, and the vegetative phase. This factor was previously calculated for
    each species and growth phase, and values are tabulated in the CNR (Chilean Irrigation
    Commission) bulletins [24,25], and in the document titled “Reference Evapotranspiration,
    for the Determination of Water Demands for Agriculture in Chile” [26]. The crop
    evapotranspiration, ETc, was calculated using Equation (2), where ET0 was adjusted
    based on the crop coefficient: 𝐸 𝑇 𝑐 = 𝐾 𝑐 𝐸 𝑇 0 (2) where ET0 is expressed in
    mm per month (mm/month), and Kc is the crop coefficient. The net water demand
    (ND) per month was calculated using Equation (3). ND is given by the difference
    between ETc and the effective rainfall (Pe) received by the crop. ND is effectively
    the water required by the crop’s roots from the irrigation system. 𝑁𝐷=𝐸 𝑇 𝑐 −
    𝑃 𝑒 (3) Pe was estimated from actual rainfall using the methodology proposed by
    the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), United States Department of
    Agriculture (USDA) [22]. In this study, it was calculated from the monthly average
    of actual rainfall measures obtained from the national agroclimatic network (Agromet)
    [27]. The irrigation system is required to supply more water than the net water
    demand (ND), as it is necessary to overcome any losses of water which occur in
    the irrigation system. Additionally, some security factors were included so as
    to guarantee that the crop will receive at least the ND. The application effectiveness
    (Ea) includes the effects of deep percolation and surface runoff. Ea for the drip
    irrigation system was estimated to be 90%. Other parameters affecting the water
    demand are the washing requirement (RL) and the coverage coefficient (Kr). RL
    is the minimum percolation water required to keep the soil salinity constant and
    to avoid an increase in salinity that may diminish the development of the crop.
    Kr reflects the non-necessity of adding water to the complete projected surface
    of the crop. Kr takes a value lower than or equal to unity. Equation (4) shows
    the water demand (D): 𝐷= 𝑁𝐷(1+ 𝑅 𝐿 ) 𝐾 𝑟 𝐸 𝑎 (4) The determination of the irrigation
    schedule establishes how frequent and how long it is necessary to supply water
    to the crops. The irrigation frequency interval and the volume of water supplied
    depend on the volume of water maintained in the root zone of the crops and how
    quickly it is used. The irrigation frequency is a function of the soil texture,
    the soil structure (water percolation), the depth of the effective root zone,
    the type of crop, and the stage of crop development [28]. For high-frequency irrigation
    requirements, a short interval is defined (one, two, or more days). The objective
    is to maintain soil humidity [29]. The annual irrigation schedule was provided
    by an irrigation expert, and it indicated the frequency of irrigation for each
    month. Once the irrigation calendar was defined, the daily irrigation requirement
    (RID) in liters was determined using Equation (5): 𝑅𝐼𝐷= 𝐷 𝐴 𝑐 𝐷 𝑖 (5) where Di
    represents the days of irrigation during the month, and Ac is the surface area
    covered by the crops in hectares. Ac was determined from Equation (6), considering
    the surface of each plant frame (PF) and the number of plants (Nplants): 𝐴 𝑐 =𝑃𝐹
    𝑁 𝑝𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑡𝑠 (6) The length of time (ti), in hours for which an irrigation system
    may run so as to supply enough water to cover the requirements of the crops was
    determined using Equation (7): 𝑡 𝑖 = 𝑅𝐼𝐷 𝑞 𝑒 𝑁 𝑒 (7) where qe is the volume flow
    rate supplied by the emitters in liters per hour, and Ne is the number of emitters.
    2.2. Electricity Demand of an Irrigation System One of the most commonly used
    irrigation systems is drip irrigation, which is a water-saving irrigation system
    that distributes water to the crops through a pressurized network including valves,
    pipes, and emitters. The pump selection for the irrigation system depends on both
    the irrigation system head (required pumping pressure) and the water demanded
    by crops (Section 2.1). The irrigation system head takes into account the elevation
    head, the pressure drop due to friction in the pipes and singularities (i.e.,
    valves), and the required working pressure by the emitters. In this study, pumps
    supply a constant volume flow rate; consequently, the electricity demand by the
    pump is constant. Other studies [11,30,31] proposed the use of variable speed
    pump that allows the water supply to adjust as a function of variations of solar
    radiation allowing to optimize the irrigation regime. A control system which is
    able to match water supply with solar radiation may help to energy optimization
    [32], especially in off-grid configurations; however, this alternative is not
    covered in this study. An optimal design is obtained through a minimization of
    the global cost, which takes into account the operational cost (electricity cost)
    due to pumping, which is reduced when the pressure drop is reduced, and the capital
    cost of the irrigation system. The pressure drop is estimated from the friction
    in the pipes, and singularity losses in the valves and fittings. The pressure
    drop decreases as the pipe diameter increases, reducing the operational cost;
    however, the capital cost increases correspondingly. An adequate selection of
    emitters and filters also helps minimize the pressure drop. The pumping system
    was designed to withstand the worst-case scenario coinciding with the month featuring
    the highest water demand. The operational characteristics of the pump were given
    by the pump characteristic curve, which was obtained in an experimental standard
    test. The pump characteristic curve provided information about the system head
    (H), the pump efficiency (η), and the electrical power required by the pump (Wp)
    as a function of the pumped volume flow rate of water (Q) [15]. Wp was given by
    Equation (8): 𝑊 𝑝 = 𝑄𝜌𝑔𝐻 𝜂 𝑝 𝜂 𝑚 (8) where ηp is the mechanical pump efficiency,
    and ηm is the electric motor efficiency. In general, ηp ranged from 90–95%, and
    ηm fell between 45% and 65% [33]. Some high-efficiency pumps may achieve a combined
    pump efficiency (ηp ηm) of up to 85% [34]. Once Wp was calculated (from Equation
    (8)), the daily electricity required (Ed) was obtained using Equation (9): 𝐸 𝑑
    = 𝑊 𝑝 𝑡 𝑖 (9) 2.3. Solar PV System Design In most cases, the water demand for
    irrigation is seasonal; however, the PV system generates electricity all year.
    The solar PV system should be able to supply the electricity required by the irrigation
    system in order to guarantee a uniform distribution of the volume flow rate of
    water required by all the crops. An adequate design of a PV system requires accurate
    data of solar resources. In this paper, the Solar Explorer (Explorador Solar),
    an online tool developed by the Chile Ministry of Energy [35], was used. The solar
    PV model available in the Solar Explorer is used in this study. It is based in
    the model developed by Sandia National Lab and described in Reference [36]. Also,
    the solar radiation data used in the solar PV model were obtained for each specific
    location from the Solar Explorer. The radiation database and its accuracy are
    explained in detail in Reference [37]. 2.3.1. Off-Grid PV System The off-grid
    systems may present some difficulties as they are designed to supply the majority
    of the electrical power required by the irrigation system. The electrical power
    peaks during the month with the highest water requirement. Therefore, this situation
    happens only one month per year. Consequently, this results in the off-grid PV
    system being oversized for the remainder of the year, and it is often not used
    at all due to a lack of irrigation. The power of the off-grid PV system (WPV)
    was sized according to Equation (10): 𝑊 𝑃𝑉 =1.2 𝐸 𝑑 𝑡 𝑖 / 𝑊 1kW,𝑃𝑉 (10) where
    Ed is the daily electricity demanded by the irrigation system in the month with
    the highest water demand, and W1kW,PV is the average electrical power produced
    by a PV system with a nominal electrical power of 1 kW in the selected location,
    for the month with the highest water demand, in one hour between 10:00 a.m. and
    11:00 a.m. ti is the length of time of irrigation per day, considered equal to
    5 h for the off-grid system. The off-grid system was designed to operate between
    10:00 a.m. and 03:00 p.m., the period of higher solar radiation. However, as an
    additional safety factor, the irrigation system was available the remainder of
    the day if there existed the required solar radiation to drive it. 2.3.2. On-Grid
    PV System The on-grid PV system was sized so as to supply the required energy
    on an annual basis, using the electrical grid either as a source to complement
    the PV system, or as a drain for the excess electrical energy generated by the
    PV system. The main objective was to reduce the annual electricity bill to zero.
    The power of the on-grid PV system (WPV) was sized according to Equation (11):
    𝑊 𝑃𝑉 =1.2 𝐸 𝐴 𝐸 1kW,𝑃𝑉 (11) where EA is the annual electricity demanded for irrigation,
    and E1kW,PV was the annual electricity produced by a PV system with a nominal
    electrical power of 1 kW, evaluated in the selected location. A safety factor
    of 1.2, oversizing the PV system by 20%, was considered for off-grid and on-grid
    PV systems. E1kW,PV and W1kW,PV were obtained using information from the Solar
    Explorer [35]. In addition, the slope of the PV modules was selected as 10° subtracted
    from the actual latitude and facing north. A loss factor of 14% for the PV modules
    and an inverter efficiency of 90% were also considered. 3. Case Studies in Chile
    Four experimental units (EUs) were selected for the implementation of a PV system
    to drive the existing irrigation systems. Two Chilean regions were evaluated,
    with one off-grid and one on-grid solar PV system used to drive the existing irrigation
    systems in each region. Firstly, a baseline was defined, and the annual energetic
    behavior was reported as Year 0. Secondly, a performance analysis of the existing
    irrigation system was conducted, and some energy-efficient actions were implemented.
    The impact of energy-efficient actions was monitored for a year, and reported
    as Year 1. Either the solar PV off-grid or the on-grid system was installed. The
    system was monitored for a year, and the results were reported as Year 2. Each
    unit had a real-time acquisition system that monitored the electricity used by
    the pump, the water volume flow rate, and the head pressure of the irrigation
    system. The electricity generated by the solar PV system was monitored during
    Year 2, as was the electricity supplied to, or demanded by, the electrical grid
    for the on-grid systems. 3.1. Baseline—Year 0 Table 1 shows some characteristics
    of the selected EUs. Two of them (EU 1 and EU 2), which produced table grapes,
    were located in the Atacama Region in northern Chile, while the other two EUs
    (EU 3 and EU 4), which were dedicated to the production of strawberries, were
    located in the Maule Region in southern Chile. In the Atacama Region, there is
    an annual average daily solar radiation of 3400 kWh/m2. EU 1 and EU 2 had irrigation
    systems that covered a surface area of 0.80 ha and 0.87 ha, respectively. Both
    EU 1 and EU 2 were considered similar on the basis of their water demand for irrigation.
    In the Maule Region (southern Chile), the annual average daily solar radiation
    is 1900 kWh/m2. The irrigation systems of EU 3 and EU 4 covered 0.3 ha and 0.5
    ha, respectively, which were considered similar surface areas. EUs 1, 2, and 3
    had access to the local electrical grid, while EU 4 was an off-grid system, with
    its electricity requirement was supplied by a stationary 2 kW diesel generator
    set. Table 1. Location of the experimental units (EUs). Assuming similar characteristics
    between EU 1 and EU 2, initial analyses indicated that the electricity use of
    EU 2 was considerably greater than that of EU 1; consequently, there was an opportunity
    to implement some energy-efficient activities. The electricity prices of EU 1
    and EU 2 were comparable. The surface area of EU 3 was smaller than that of EU
    4; however, EU 3 used more than four times the electricity required by EU 4. Therefore,
    EU 3 also had an issue of energy efficiency which could be addressed. The electricity
    costs of EU 3 and EU 4 were similar, despite EU 4 using considerably less energy
    than EU 3 due to it being an off-grid facility which produced its electricity
    using a stationary diesel generator set. Firstly, the performance of the irrigation
    system was evaluated, and actions were undertaken to improve its operation, before
    proceeding to the design of the PV system which was to be implemented in the irrigation
    system. 3.2. Performance Analysis of Irrigation Systems—Year 1 It seems reasonable
    to assess the energetic performance of an irrigation system prior to the installation
    of a PV system. Aspects regarding energy efficiency may be found upon studying
    water demand, as the irrigation system may be supplying more water than necessary.
    Additionally, components of the irrigation system, such as the pump, filters,
    and emitters, may be inadequately implemented, resulting in greater electricity
    requirements than necessary. Furthermore, the operation and maintenance protocols
    for the irrigation system may not be appropriate. Consequently, it may not be
    cost-effective to design a PV system for an irrigation system without first assessing
    the functionality of the irrigation system. 3.2.1. Water Demand The methodology
    presented in Section 2.1 was used to determine the monthly water demand for each
    EU. Agrometeorological stations from the national agroclimatic network (Agromet)
    [27] located close to each EU were used to determine the necessary climate variables
    (i.e., wind speed, solar radiation, air temperature, relative humidity, and rainfall)
    for the determination of ET0 (Equation (1)) and ND (Equation (3)). Kc was required
    in Equation (2), and it was obtained from the Chilean Irrigation Commission bulletins
    [24,25], and the “Reference Evapotranspiration, for the Determination of Water
    Demands for Agriculture in Chile” [26]. After studying the initial conditions,
    it was determined that EU 3 used more water than necessary. The farmer had decided
    that EU 3 increased the irrigation surface area from 0.3 ha (Year 1) to 2.5 ha
    (Year 2). The monthly water demand for each EU is presented in Table 2. The irrigation
    season began in August, and finished in March for the Atacama Region (table grapes),
    and the greatest water demand was observed in December. In the Maule Region, strawberries
    required water between September and April, and the peak water demand was observed
    in December. EUs 1 and 2 presented similar water demands. The new surface area
    of EU 3 was more than five times greater than that of EU 4, as was the water demand.
    Table 2. Water demand (D) for each EU in m3. 3.2.2. Electricity Demand of an Irrigation
    System As mentioned before, the pump selection of the irrigation system depends
    on the required system’s pressure and the water demand. The system pressure for
    a drip irrigation system depends on the difference in elevation between the suction
    pump and emitters, as well as the system’s pressure drop, and the working pressure
    required by the emitters. A drip irrigation system was used in all selected EUs.
    New-generation emitters (NGE) were selected and implemented in each EU, which
    operated in a working pressure ranging between a 5 m and 30 m water column (m
    H2O), and with a water volume flow rate of 4 L per hour [38]. The design conditions
    considered a working pressure of 10 m H2O for the NGE emitters. An NGE emitter
    consists of a pressure-compensating diaphragm allowing uniform irrigation. The
    uniformity of irrigation is relevant as it supplies the correct volume of water
    required by all the crops distributed across the farm. Additionally, this results
    in optimal production on the farm, and a minimization of the loss of soil nutrients,
    avoiding deep percolation [39]. The proposed configurations, able to account for
    the water demand, had a system pressure head (m H2O) as presented in Table 3.
    Additionally, the pressure head due to the emitters, the topographic slope, and
    the pressure drop of the irrigation system are also shown. EUs 1, 2 and 4 had
    similar conditions with a system pressure head of 14 m, with contributions from
    the emitter requirements (10 m), the elevation head (1 m), and the pressure drop
    (3 m). However, EU 3 presented a much greater system pressure head (47 m) due
    to high elevation (32 m) between the pump suction and the emitter discharge. Furthermore,
    the higher elevation and longer distribution lines caused an increase in pressure
    drop to 5 m. Table 3. System pressure head required by the irrigation system in
    each EU, and their contributions from the new-generation emitters (NGEs), the
    elevation head, and the pressure drop. As discussed in Section 2.2, the pumping
    system should be designed for the worst-case scenario, coinciding with the month
    featuring the greatest water demand. This occurred in December for table grapes
    and strawberries. Table 4 shows the monthly electrical energy demand of the irrigation
    systems in each EU. The monthly electricity demand (Ed), in kWh/month, was calculated
    using Equations (8) and (9), and the data are presented in Table 2 and Table 3.
    The selected pump (Lorents C-SJ8-7) had a combined efficiency (η) of 45% (ηp =
    50% and ηm = 90%). Additionally, the annual energy demand (kWh/year) and the annual
    electricity cost ($/year) are also listed. Table 4. Monthly electrical energy
    demand (kWh/month) for irrigation in each EU. 3.2.3. Results of Energy-Efficient
    Actions The most common approaches to saving water and energy in irrigation systems
    include an irrigation calendar with the correct water demand at baseline for the
    estimation of appropriate evapotranspiration factors, a measurement of the daily
    irrigated volume flow rate, an installation of automatic irrigation systems with
    timers, and minimization of the system pressure requirement by means of adequate
    selection of filters, fittings, valves, and emitters. In addition, the development
    of an operation and maintenance plan for the irrigation and PV systems is beneficial,
    as well as the selection of an adequate pumping system. Table 5 shows the economical
    assessment of each EU following the application of previously mentioned energy-efficient
    actions. The electricity usage and cost are shown at baseline (Year 0) and after
    the energy-efficient actions were applied (Year 1). In addition, the savings,
    the investment, and the payback are shown. Table 5. Economical assessment of each
    EU. The operational cost of EUs 1, 2 and 3 correspond to the amount paid yearly
    to the electricity company. In the case of EU 4, the operational cost represents
    annual diesel consumption. In Year 1, the application of energy-efficient actions
    to the irrigation systems resulted in savings of greater than 70% in EUs 1, 2
    and 4 when compared with baseline conditions (Year 0), and a similar observation
    was reported for other Latin American countries [18]. Upon studying the initial
    operational conditions of EU 3, it was detected that EU 3 used more water than
    necessary. The payback periods reported for EUs 1, 2 and 4 were approximately
    four years long. The irrigation system of EU 3 was modified following the increase
    in irrigated surface area from 0.3 ha (Year 0) to 2.5 ha (Year 1); however, EU
    3 still used more energy (2941 kWh/year compared with 2134 kWh/year) than at baseline
    (Year 0). The payback period for EU 3 was less than six years. 3.3. Solar PV System
    Design—Year 2 3.3.1. Off-Grid PV System EU 2 (table grapes) and EU 4 (strawberries)
    were selected for the implementation of an off-grid system to drive their irrigation
    systems. The design of an off-grid PV system required the identification of the
    month with the greatest energy demand, which was observed with a correspondingly
    peak water demand in December for EUs 2 and 4 (1769 m3/month and 322 m3/month,
    respectively). The daily electrical energy demand of EU 2 was 4.8 kWh/day. The
    off-grid system operated between 10:00 a.m. and 03:00 p.m. so as to maximize solar
    radiation, while a safety factor was incorporated allowing operation outside of
    these hours provided there was adequate solar radiation. The average electrical
    power (W1kW,PV) produced by a PV system in 1 h (December, between 10:00 a.m. and
    11:00 a.m.) with a nominal electrical power of 1 kW was 0.62 kWh. The required
    power capacity of the PV system was 1.86 kWp; however, considering the capacity
    of the individual PV modules as 0.23 Wp, the power of the off-grid PV system (WPV)
    was sized to 2.07 kWp (nine PV modules, see Table 6). Figure 3 presents the daily
    energy performance of the off-grid PV system installed in EU 2. The lines show
    the electricity generated by the PV system during an average day across a time
    period of September to February. The dashed bars represent the electricity demand
    of the irrigation system on a day when the crops were irrigated. The PV system
    was able to supply in excess of the electricity demanded by the irrigation system.
    The excess electricity generation was dissipated, and lost without generating
    any useful work. Moreover, when considering that irrigation did not occur daily,
    and was also a seasonal activity (seven months), the excess dissipated electricity
    was greater than that observed in Figure 3. Figure 3. Daily energy performance
    of Experimental Unit (EU 2) on days with irrigation (off-grid PV system). Table
    6. Electrical power required by the photovoltaic (PV) system used in each EU.
    3.3.2. On-Grid PV System Chile has an electrical grid covering 99% of the population;
    consequently, most farms have access to electricity for housing and harvest purposes.
    Therefore, on-grid systems were included in the analysis. For the on-grid system,
    a Chilean regulation (Ley 20.571) incorporated a net billing model which allows
    the reception of a payment if some excess electricity is generated in a PV system,
    and is injected back into the electrical grid. Chilean law permits the injection
    of any excess electricity produced by connections below 100 kW. The price charged
    by the electric company for electricity purchased from the electrical grid ranges
    between $221 and $276 per kilowatt-hour, and the price paid for electricity injected
    back into the electrical grid is $118 per kilowatt-hour. The Chilean electrical
    grid has high penetration, allowing wide access. The on-grid PV system was sized
    so as to supply the required energy on an annual basis, using the electrical grid
    either as a source to complement the PV system or as a drain for the excess electrical
    energy generated by the PV system. EU 1 (table grapes) and EU 3 (strawberries)
    were selected for the implementation of an on-grid system to drive their irrigation
    systems. The annual electricity demand (EA) was 560 kWh/year for EU 1, and 2134
    kWh/year for EU 3. The daily energetic performance of EU 1 is displayed in Figure
    4 for the irrigation season (September–February). The annual electricity demand
    was 560 kWh/year, and the irrigation system operated between 9:00 a.m. and 05:00
    p.m. The annual electricity (E1kW,PV) produced by a PV system with a nominal electrical
    power of 1 kW was 1875 kWh/year; consequently, the required WPV was 0.36 kWp,
    and was supplied with two PV modules, resulting in an installed PV system with
    a power of 0.46 kWp (see Table 6). When the irrigation system was in operation,
    the electricity demand was greater than the electricity generated by the PV system.
    The electricity demand is shown in Figure 4 as dashed bars, and the lines show
    the electricity generated by the PV system on an average day across a time period
    of September to February. The days without irrigation helped compensate for the
    electricity production, resulting in a net annual energy cost equal to zero. Figure
    4. Daily energetic performance of EU 1 on a day with irrigation (on-grid PV system).
    3.3.3. Effects of Installation of PV System on Irrigation Systems Table 6 shows
    the characteristics of the four studied EUs. EUs 1 and 3 were selected for the
    implementation of an on-grid PV system to drive their irrigation systems. The
    annual electricity demands were 560 kWh/year and 2134 kWh/year for EUs 1 and 3,
    respectively. The PV system sizes for each EU were 0.46 kWp (EU 1, two PV modules),
    and 1.84 kWp (EU 3, eight PV modules). The off-grid PV systems were tested for
    EUs 2 and 4. The PV systems were sized using the daily electricity demands, which
    were 4.8 kWh/day and 2.0 kWh/day for EUs 2 and 4, respectively. The EU 2 PV system
    was sized with nine PV modules, for a total power of 2.07 kWp, and the EU 4 PV
    system was formed by four PV modules delivering 0.92 kWp. Table 7 shows the economical
    assessment of each EU following the incorporation of energy-efficient actions
    (Year 1), and after installing the PV systems (Year 2). The electricity usage
    and cost are shown for Years 1 and 2. The PV system design allowed a reduction
    in energy cost to zero in Year 2 for both off-grid and on-grid PV systems. Additionally,
    the savings, required investment, and the paybacks related to the installation
    of the PV systems are shown. Table 7. Economical assessment of each EU. For the
    table-grape farmers in northern Chile, if 100% of the electrical demand was covered
    by the PV system, the installed power of the PV system would be 4.5 times greater
    in the off-grid system than in the on-grid system. The smaller system (on-grid)
    costs six times less than the off-grid system. The payback was achieved in 12
    years for the on-grid system, and in 57 years for the off-grid system. Similar
    results were obtained in southern Chile for the strawberry farmers. The on-grid
    PV system was installed in a farm with a surface area 8.3 times greater than that
    where the off-grid PV system was installed; however, the PV system was twice as
    large. As shown in Table 7, the on-grid system is the ideal choice if the electrical
    grid is nearby. This PV system was designed to cover 100% of the annual electrical
    cost. This design criterion avoided oversizing the PV system, and reduced unnecessary
    investment (the capital cost) unlike the off-grid systems; consequently, payback
    periods for on-grid systems were considerably lower than those for off-grid systems.
    Optimal operation was achievable in hours of increased solar radiation, resulting
    in an increase in electricity generated by the PV system, and a minimization of
    excess electricity generation. This was applicable to both off-grid and on-grid
    PV systems. Electricity self-consumption is recommendable, considering the difference
    in purchasing and selling electricity; therefore, the payback period tended to
    be shortened upon increased electricity self-consumption. The net billing regulation
    in Chile encourages the self-consumption of electricity; consequently, the payback
    period of the project may be shortened. A PV system capable of lasting more than
    25 years requires substantial investment; however, the business model demonstrated
    high profit when the irrigation PV system had a long-term life cycle. The project
    lifetime is 25 years, which is like other studies [40,41]. Consequently, the feasibility
    of the system needs to be guaranteed. A well-designed drip irrigation system may
    reduce the required energy to approximately 60% of that required by other conventional
    methods; therefore, the PV system in this case would be smaller and cost less.
    Additionally, a PV system for small applications does not require the use of trackers
    as suggested in Reference [40]. With a two-axis tracker, a PV system may produce
    up to 40% more energy than without one. Furthermore, more space is required (around
    2.5 times more), the tracker needs special maintenance, and the failure rate potentially
    increases. The base needs to be metallic, galvanized steel, to last 25 years exposed
    to ambient conditions. The use of batteries is not recommended as their life cycle
    is limited to four or five years. Also, long-term periods without use due to seasonal
    irrigating results in a reduction in the life cycle of batteries. In addition,
    batteries increase the capital and operational cost, and the final disposal of
    batteries may produce high environmental impact [11,42]. In Chile, battery disposal
    is voluntary, but there is not much recycling infrastructure [6]; however, in
    other similar countries as Peru and Ecuador, some References [43,44] have reported
    that batteries have been found abandoned and buried in rural areas. The PV system
    should instead supply electricity directly into the pumping system. 4. Discussion
    and Conclusions Four cases were studied. Two farms producing table grapes were
    tested in the northern zone (Atacama Region), and two farms producing strawberries
    were analyzed in the southern zone (Maule Region). In each zone, both an off-grid
    and an on-grid system were evaluated. Firstly, the water demand of the irrigation
    systems and their corresponding pressure head were determined. The electricity
    demand for the irrigation systems was then calculated. Finally, an optimal PV
    system was designed for each irrigation system. The off-grid system was designed
    to cover the maximum electricity demand; consequently, the system was oversized
    for the remainder of the year. The on-grid system was designed to have a net annual
    operational cost equal to zero, and as such, an economical assessment was performed
    for the first two years. In the first year, the effects of energy-efficient actions
    on the irrigation system were evaluated, and the payback periods for these actions
    were found to be approximately two years. In the second year, the implementation
    of a PV system in each demonstrative unit was evaluated. The payback periods for
    on-grid PV systems (around 12 years) were considerably lower than those for off-grid
    PV systems (more than 30 years). As shown in Table 7, the off-grid PV system requires
    a long payback period (more than 30 years); however, this may be feasible if promoted
    by a government program as suggested in Reference [17]. The feasibility is a key
    factor because of high investment. In Chile, although technical standards for
    rural electrification are defined [6], they are not mandatory; consequently, government
    programs need to include cooperation, transferring know-how, and training. Also,
    implementation of an off-grid PV system may be beneficial to promote local economic
    development when the electrical grid is not an alternative. Some recommendations
    may be obtained from the presented analysis for application to the installation
    of other PV systems in existing irrigation systems. Firstly, it is recommended
    to start by improving the existing irrigation system. After applying energy-efficient
    actions for the irrigation system, a PV system should be designed to supply electricity
    to an optimized irrigation system. Consequently, oversizing a PV system is avoided,
    and the investment (capital cost) is reduced, as well as the payback period of
    the project. Although the payback period appears lengthy (around 12 years), it
    is recommended to install on-grid PV systems when considering a life cycle of
    25 years. Neither off-grid PV systems nor on-grid PV systems are recommended for
    operation with batteries and tracking systems (whether one- or two-axis). The
    business model shows good profit when evaluated over a 25-year period; therefore,
    a PV system capable of lasting over 25 years should be designed, while paying
    attention to design aspects so as to guarantee the feasibility of the system.
    Self-consumption of electricity is also suggested due to the existence of the
    net billing regulation in Chile. From a practical point of view, the purchase
    cost of electricity is greater, under the net billing regulation, than the selling
    of excess electricity generated by the PV system back to the electrical grid.

  description: In intensive breeding farms, maintaining an adequate indoor thermal
    environment and air quality is crucial in order to establish healthy conditions
    and increase productivity. In the EU, fossil fuels and electricity are the main
    energy sources adopted for this purpose, yet introducing renewable energy sources
    and efficient Heating Ventilating Air Conditioning systems would reduce energy
    consumption and improve sustainability. Another environmental concern in agricultural
    production is related to the intensive use of fertilizers, causing nitrate contamination
    in surface water and groundwater. Therefore, innovative strategies to reduce fertilizers
    and simultaneously reduce primary energy consumption are worthy of investigation.
    This paper addresses both issues, studying the application of geothermal heat
    pumps in the agro-zootechnical sector, where they are rarely applied and thus
    their potential needs to be verified. The study considers systems based on the
    closed loop configuration, i.e. Ground Source Heat Pumps (GSHP), and on the open
    loop configuration, i.e. Groundwater Heat Pumps (GWHP). Firstly, a pilot GSHP
    system for a piglet stable in Northern Italy is presented. Thanks to the use of
    both ground source and thermal recovery of air ventilation, the system achieves
    an appreciable reduction in both primary energy consumption and running costs,
    compared with a more traditional system typically adopted in this kind of farm.
    Secondly, the feasibility of an innovative concept of a GWHP combined with the
    irrigation system is studied through numerical modelling. The area of the piglet
    stable is represented in a flow and heat transport model; groundwater used by
    the heat pump is re-injected up-gradient during the cold season, while it is used
    for irrigation during the warm season. The system would provide energy-efficient
    climatization to the farm stables and, at the same time, promote the reuse of
    nitrogen in cultivated fields as a result of groundwater recirculation through
    irrigation.

    to the Eurostat database (Eurostat, 2017), in 2014 in the European Union energy
    consumption by agriculture made up 2.8% of the final energy consumption, with
    the highest share in the Netherlands (7.2%) and Poland (5.6%). In all probability
    these figures are underestimated (Gołaszewski et al., 2012), since they account
    only for the so-called direct energy uses in agriculture, namely related to electricity
    and fuel consumption. Out of the total primary energy consumption in agriculture
    in the EU, the proportion of direct energy used is estimated at 61% (Meyer-Aurich
    et al., 2013), although it may largely vary for the specific activity. Considering
    pig production in Italy, according to the IPPC document (The European Commission,
    2003), fossil fuels and electricity represent up to 74% of the total energy consumption,
    depending on the farm size. Improving energy efficiency in agricultural production
    is important for reducing energy consumption, dependency on fossil energy input,
    energy related costs and greenhouse gas emissions. Energy efficiency measures
    have been proposed, impacting on the levels of crop production, greenhouse production,
    animal housing and system approaches (Meyer-Aurich et al., 2013). Among the measures
    aimed at reducing indirect energy consumption, the efficient management of fertilizers
    is expected to contribute to a large extent. Elevated levels of nutrients in both
    surface water and groundwater as a result of the leaching of excess fertilizers
    in agricultural regions have been acknowledged for decades (Thorburn et al., 2003,
    Zhang et al., 1996). In recent years, however, the magnitude of the phenomenon
    has increased in scale, resulting in one of the most common contamination problems
    worldwide (Baily et al., 2011, Buvaneshwari et al., 2017, Duwig et al., 2003,
    Kim et al., 2015, Rudolph et al., 2015), investigated by several authors and through
    different approaches (Carucci et al., 2012, Caschetto et al., 2017, Sorichetta
    et al., 2012, Stevenazzi et al., 2015). In Europe, the Council Directive (Consiglio
    delle comunità europee, 1991) aims to prevent nitrates from polluting surface
    water and groundwater, and promotes the use of good farming practices. In general,
    any strategy allowing a reduction in the use of fertilizers in agriculture would
    have a positive impact on both indirect energy consumption and pollution in aquifers.
    As far as direct energy consumption is concerned, interventions on animal housing
    are needed, aimed at reducing the energy demand of stables, increasing the efficiency
    of climatization systems and introducing renewable energy sources. Enhancement
    of indoor air quality (both in terms of thermo-hygrometric conditions and pollution)
    is also required to improve animal wellbeing and bolster production (Fabrizio
    et al., 2015). The climatization and ventilation systems currently installed are
    mostly based on fossil fuels or electricity from the grid, making livestock production
    a contributor to climate change (Rojas-Downing et al., 2017). Geothermal heat
    pump systems potentially represent an improvement both in energy consumption and
    indoor air quality; their applicability to the sector is eased by the fact that
    agro-zootechnical farms already withdraw groundwater from wells, or have the space
    to host them. Geothermal heat pump systems can be classified into Ground Source
    Heat Pump (GSHP) and Groundwater Heat Pump (GWHP) systems (Kavanaugh and Rafferty,
    1997). In the first case, the heat pump extracts heat from the ground by means
    of a closed water loop consisting in several Borehole Heat Exchangers (BHEs).
    In the second case, the heat pump operates on an open water loop circuit, where
    groundwater is extracted from a well and re-injected into another well after heat
    exchange. The advantage in both cases is the exploitation of a heat source (the
    ground or groundwater) whose temperature is unperturbed all year round (e.g. between
    13 and 17 °C in Milan (Davoglio and Ghezzi, 2014)), resulting in high energy efficiency
    and low running costs (Farabi-Asl et al., 2018, Lee et al., 2010, Lo Russo et
    al., 2009, Pulat et al., 2009, Yang et al., 2009). In both cases, the heat pump
    operation can be inverted in the warm season, so that the heat pump provides cooling
    to a building by injecting heat into the ground or the aquifer. While geothermal
    heat pumps are commonly installed in residential, public and commercial buildings
    (Allaerts et al., 2016, Zhou et al., 2016), their use in agriculture is mostly
    limited to greenhouse heating (Huang and Mauerhofer, 2016, Noorollahi et al.,
    2016), aquaculture pond heating and crop and food drying (Erbay and Hepbasli,
    2016, Lund and Boyd, 2016). The possibility to adopt geothermal heat pump systems
    in animal farms was investigated only recently by some authors (Borge-Diez et
    al., 2015, Islam et al., 2016, Wang et al., 2012). Wang et al. (2012) performed
    an economic comparison among different systems for a typical swine farm in Beijing,
    China. They concluded that considering the cooling effect obtained without increasing
    indoor relative humidity, as well as the energy saving in the heating period and
    the avoided air pollution from PM 2.5, the GSHP system is likely to be preferred
    in the upcoming future. Islam et al. (2016) experimentally investigated the performance
    of a GSHP and a conventional electrical heating system in a nursery pig house
    in Korea. GSHP provided a 46% reduction of energy consumption, and CO2 and other
    noxious gas emissions were significantly lowered. From the analysis of the state
    of the art, the necessity arises to verify the possibilities of implementing low-temperature
    geothermal solutions in the agro-zoo-technical sector. Geothermal heat pumps are
    rarely adopted in farms and, compared to conventional building applications, design
    for farms has to address specific issues: high ventilation requirements, deriving
    from the necessity to remove noxious emissions by the animals, and relatively
    high indoor temperature requirements, necessary in the first life stages of the
    animals. The possibility to improve the indoor thermo-hygrometric conditions and
    air quality as well as animal wellbeing can be foreseen, yet it needs to be proved.
    At the same time, application to the agro-zoo-technical sector opens the way to
    innovative strategies combining the traditional irrigation uses of groundwater
    with less common climatization uses. In order to demonstrate the potential for
    low-temperature geothermal solutions in this new field, the EcoZoo project was
    promoted by the Lombardy Region. The project, concerning both GSHP and GWHP, consisted
    of two parts: – design, installation and monitoring of a pilot GSHP system for
    heating and cooling a typical piglet room. The aim was to adapt the GSHP system
    design to animal housing applications and to verify energy performance and possible
    savings compared with more conventional solutions typically adopted in farms;
    – development of a new concept of a GWHP system integrated with the irrigation
    system of a farm. The objective was to assess the possibility to optimise the
    use of groundwater in farms, by coupling thermal and irrigation uses through a
    proper designing of the wells. At the same time, a further aim was to reduce pollution
    by agricultural inputs in groundwater by adopting a smart groundwater management
    strategy. The feasibility of this innovative system was numerically studied, assuming
    the well-known hydrogeological conditions of the Experimental Didactic Zootechnical
    Centre (EDZC) site, as well as the energy demand for heating and cooling of the
    entire Campus building dedicated to animal housing. 2. Case study 2.1. Location
    The case study for both parts of the research is a portion of the EDZC in the
    Lodi Campus of the Università degli Studi di Milano. The EDZC is located in the
    South Western part of Lodi, in an area where many agricultural and breeding farms
    are present (see Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Material). The pilot GSHP system
    was installed in the post-weaning piglet room, located in one of the sheds of
    the EDZC (Fig. 1) dedicated to experimental research on breeding (Savoini et al.,
    2002). At the same time, for the concept of the innovative GWHP system, it was
    assumed that the latter system would satisfy the heating and cooling demand of
    the entire shed, as shown in Fig. 1c. Download : Download high-res image (1MB)

    (c) a picture of the shed from the outside. (For interpretation of the references
    to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of
    this article.) 2.2. Hydrogeological characteristics The hydrogeological characteristics
    of the area were then investigated, both analysing literature and performing specific
    surveys on site, with a dual purpose. The first aim was to design the layout of
    the BHEs for the pilot system, drawing the maximum advantage from the groundwater
    flow: it is well known that locating the BHEs orthogonally to the preferential
    direction of the groundwater flow enhances the heat exchange and thus increases
    the total efficiency of the system. The second purpose was to create an accurate
    model of the aquifer to be used in the numerical simulations for the development
    of the innovative concept of a GWHP system. 2.2.1. Soil lithozone Based on literature
    (Alberti et al., 2016, Bersezio et al., 2007, Mele et al., 2012), two lithozones
    were identified in this area at regional scale: a shallow aquifer extended to
    a depth varying from 40 to 70 m, composed of gravel and prevalent sands, with
    few levels of clay lacking continuity; a deep aquifer, with sandy or gravelly
    levels having the frequent presence of clay and silty lenses. From literature
    and from stratigraphies of some wells located in the area of the Lodi Campus,
    the separation between the shallow and the deep aquifers was estimated to be about
    60 m below surface level. In order to verify and supplement information concerning
    the litho-stratigraphic and hydrogeological characteristics of aquifers, a geognostic
    survey was carried out on site. The drilling technique (in rotation with a continuous
    core sampling) allowed the extraction of cores and made it possible to draw the
    stratigraphic sequence of the subsoil up to the expected depth for BHE, i.e. 60
    m from ground level. As shown in Fig. 2, a sequence of silty sand and sandy silt
    was revealed in the first 18 m, followed by nearly 10 m of coarse sand and gravel.
    A local level of clayey silt layer was found between 30.5 m and 33 m from the
    surface, followed by coarse and medium sand layers, with an irregular presence
    of gravel or pebbles up to the end of the hole. Download : Download high-res image

    one pumping test and four pneumatic slug tests, were performed to investigate
    the hydraulic parameters of the aquifer. The results (Table S1 and S2 in Supplementary
    Material) made it possible to infer an equivalent value of aquifer permeability
    nearly equal to 10−4 m/s (Antelmi, 2016), revealing that the hydraulic response
    of the system was dominated by sandy layers; these are mainly present in the lower
    part of the aquifer and their hydraulic conductivity is an order of magnitude
    greater than the lithology of the first 10 m of the aquifer. 2.2.2. Water table
    As far as the groundwater flow direction is concerned, the water table from literature
    showed a SSW – NNE direction in the University area. In order to effectively position
    the BHEs while avoiding the superposition of the thermal plumes, it was also necessary
    to identify the water table at the local scale and to determine the groundwater
    flow direction with great accuracy. A piezometric monitoring network was set up,
    comprising both existing wells and four newly drilled micro-piezometers (named
    mp1, mp2, mp3 and mp4, see Fig. 1b). Five BHEs and some additional monitoring
    wells (namely the micro-piezometer mp5 and two piezometers, named P1 and P2) immediately
    down-gradient were subsequently placed (Fig. 1a). The water table at the site
    scale confirmed the direction of the groundwater flow achieved at Lodi scale,
    that is SSW – NNE as mentioned above (Fig. 1a). 3. Ground source heat pump system
    application 3.1. System description The pilot system was designed to provide heating,
    cooling and ventilation to the post-weaning piglet room of the EDZC. The piglet
    room (Fig. 3) is 43 m2 large, 3.3 m high and can host up to 100 piglets, located
    in two rows each made up of 12 boxes. Although small, the mentioned animal housing
    conditions can be considered representative of the typical pig farms in the area.
    Usually, the piglets arrive at the EDZC when they weigh about 6 kg and leave the
    room after 6–8 weeks when they weigh about 34 kg. The comfort temperature required
    decreases as the piglets grow, being usually around 30 °C at the beginning of
    their stay at the EDZC and generally decreasing by 1 °C every week. At the same
    time, a large ventilation rate of about 1000 m3/h is required, corresponding to
    8 Air Changes per Hour (ACH), in order to remove the pollutants emitted by the
    animals. Download : Download high-res image (395KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 3. The piglet room (left), the pre-existing gas burner (centre) and
    the new GSHP system (right). Before the EcoZoo project, a 16 kW fan gas burner
    (at the centre in Fig. 3) and two fans for the air suction installed in the piglet
    room provided the necessary heating and ventilation in winter. In winter the combustion
    occurred inside the room, whereas during summer no cooling system was available
    but some mitigation was obtained by running the fans at maximum velocity. Since
    the ventilation rate requirements are very large, as usually occurs in animal
    housing, the GSHP system was designed to be an air conditioning system, equipped
    with heat recovery from the exhaust air in order to reduce energy consumption.
    The system layout is shown in Fig. 4. The heating and cooling generator is a reversible
    GSHP (heating capacity 14.4 kW at 40/45 °C on the supply side and 3/0 °C on the
    ground side; cooling capacity 15.9 kW at 10/15 °C on the supply side and 30/35
    °C on the ground side). The warm/cold water produced by the heat pump was stored
    in a 300 l water tank supplying the heating/cooling coil of an Air Handling Unit
    (AHU) with a nominal ventilation flow rate of 1200 m3/h. The heat recovery heat
    exchanger in the AHU had a nominal efficiency equal to 78%. Download : Download

    system installed in the piglet room in the EDZC. Monitoring probes are shown.
    The GSHP was coupled to 5 BHEs with a single U-pipe 60 m deep in the ground, being
    distanced 5–6 m from each other. As already mentioned in Section 2, the BHE layout
    (Fig. 1a) was chosen, within the constraints expressed by the EDZC, in order to
    minimise thermal interference among neighbouring boreholes by taking advantage
    of the effect of the groundwater flow (Angelotti et al., 2014). 3.2. Data acquisition
    system In order to verify the thermo-hygrometric conditions achieved in the piglet
    room, so influencing animal wellbeing, and to measure the energy performance of
    the GSHP system, a monitoring system was installed based on an NI cDAQ data acquisition
    system and LabView. Several probes were installed (Fig. 4) to measure: water temperature
    and flow rate at the heat pump inlet/outlet on the ground and supply sides; air
    temperature and relative humidity in several points of the AHU unit and in the
    piglet room; air flow rate in the AHU and power consumption by the heat pump and
    by the AHU (parameters listed in Table S3 of the Supplementary Material). During
    a typical monitoring campaign, data are acquired every minute. From the measured
    data it is possible to calculate the thermal power produced by the heat pump as:
    (1) where is the mass flow rate in the supply loop of the heat pump, cp,w is the
    specific heat capacity of water, Tw,s,in and Tw,s,out are the water temperature
    at the inlet and outlet of the storage tank respectively. In a similar way the
    thermal power produced by the AHU can be calculated as: (2) where is the supply
    air mass flow rate, cp,a is the specific heat capacity of the air, Ta,sup and
    Ta,ext are the air supply temperature and the external air temperature respectively.
    3.3. Monitoring campaign A monitoring campaign was carried out for a month in
    2016, namely from October 26th to November 25th. During that period, 50 piglets
    were hosted in the EDZC post-weaning room. The request from the veterinary research
    team, for this special experimentation, was to maintain 30 °C at the beginning
    of the experimental period and gradually reach 28 °C at the end. The operation
    of the AHU and the thermo-hygrometric conditions in the piglet room in a representative
    week of the campaign are shown in Fig. 5. Considering the thermostat dead band
    as equal to 1 °C, the system was able to maintain the temperature set point, which,
    as shown in the graph, was varied from 29 °C to 28.5 °C in the late afternoon
    of the 14th day from the beginning of the campaign. The two indoor air probes
    installed in Boxes 5 and 16 provided very similar data, suggesting that temperature
    conditions were almost uniform in the room. Furthermore, it can be seen that the
    indoor relative humidity was generally kept below 55%, well below the limit of
    70% recommended by the International Commission of Agricultural Engineering (Dolz
    et al., 2015). Download : Download high-res image (793KB) Download : Download

    week. In Fig. 6 the electrical power consumed and the thermal power produced by
    the heat pump and the AHU are shown for a typical day, from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. While
    electrical power is directly measured by the power meters installed, thermal power
    is calculated from measured flow rates and temperature difference according to
    Eqs. (1) and (2). The fans of the AHU are always on, since they constantly provide
    the required ventilation rate, thus the electrical power consumption of the AHU
    is constant and equal to 0.5 kW. In turn, the heat pump switches off whenever
    the water temperature at the storage tank outlet rises above the set point, equal
    to 48.5 °C, then the electrical power falls to zero. When the heat pump is on
    the absorbed electrical power is in the range of 4.6-4.9 kW and the supplied thermal
    power is about 15 kW. Download : Download high-res image (765KB) Download : Download

    Starting from the measured data, the monthly energy balance of the EcoZoo GSHP
    system was performed and is shown in Fig. 7. The average heat pump COP, calculated
    as the heat produced by the heat pump (5096 kWh) over the electricity consumption
    (1651 kWh), was found to be 3.1. This value is coherent with the relatively high
    water temperature level on the supply side (around 50 °C) required by the heating
    coil in the AHU. However the overall system efficiency, namely the ratio of the
    heat delivered by the AHU (8276 kWh) over the total electricity consumed by the
    heat pump and the AHU (2002 kWh), was found to be 4.1. Therefore, although the
    heat pump COP was penalized by the medium temperature heat production and the
    system was handling a very high ventilation rate, the overall system operated
    with a high energy efficiency, also thanks to the presence of the heat recovery
    heat exchanger. The heat recovery energy is not measured directly, but can be
    approximately estimated as the difference between the heat delivered by the AHU
    and the sum of the heat produced by the heat pump plus the electricity consumed
    by the AHU. Although this is a rough estimatation disregarding any thermal losses,
    it allows to highlight the relevant role played by the heat recovery unit, accounting
    for 34% of the heat delivered to the piglet room. Download : Download high-res

    with the reference HVAC system The energy performance of the EcoZoo GSHP system
    measured during the monitoring campaign in 2016 can be compared with that of a
    traditional Heating Ventilating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system. The gas burner
    fan system originally installed in the piglet room was chosen as a reference system,
    being quite common in the zoo-technical farms operating in the area. Since the
    gas burner is placed inside the room, a 100% efficiency in converting gas energy
    into useful heat was assumed. According to the data sheets the fans consume 180
    W. In the comparison the two systems are assumed to provide the same heat and
    the same ventilation air changes. The primary energy conversion factors adopted
    were 1.05 and 2.42 for gas and electricity respectively, according to the current
    Italian regulation (Decreto Interministeriale 26/06/15, 2015). As summarized in
    Table 1, the EcoZoo system consumes 46% less primary energy than the traditional
    system. Considering the energy costs for non-domestic consumers in 2014 (as reported
    by Autorità per l’Energia Elettrica il Gas e il Sistema Idrico (AEEG), 2015),
    namely 0.31 €/kWh for electricity and 0.79 €/m3 for gas, the EcoZoo system gave
    a 14% saving in energy costs compared to the traditional system. The smaller cost
    savings compared to the primary energy savings were clearly due to the high ratio
    between the electricity and gas costs of the Italian market. In those countries
    where the cost of electricity is significantly lower, cost savings become consequently
    larger. Table 1. Comparison between the energy performance of the EcoZoo GSHP

    9009 In conclusion, the monitoring campaign performed at the EDZC shows that GSHP
    systems can be effectively adopted for animal housing. By coupling a GSHP with
    an AHU incorporating a heat recovery system, the high ventilation rates required
    to remove indoor emissions and guarantee animal wellbeing are provided with a
    high overall energy efficiency. Compared to the conventional systems typically
    adopted in animal housing, the system configuration proposed allows significant
    savings in both primary energy consumption and in energy cost. 4. Groundwater
    heat pump system development 4.1. System concept Among low temperature geothermal
    systems, open loop systems are currently considered more efficient and cheaper
    than closed loop systems. Therefore, the concept and feasibility of an innovative
    open loop system combined with irrigation is here assessed and discussed. Indeed,
    usually in farms there is at least one well used by the owners for specific functions,
    such as human or animal water supply, field irrigation or farm stable washing.
    Additional wells could possibly be added in operating of GWHP system, to be used
    either as extraction or injection wells. The concept of the geothermal open loop
    system presented here concerns the coupled use of water extracted from wells for
    both the thermal uses of the farm and irrigation. The eco-friendly idea is based
    on three items: – during the warm season (summer), groundwater is used for cooling
    farm stables by means of the GWHP, and subsequently to irrigate fields up-gradient
    of the extraction wells; – during the cold season (winter), groundwater is used
    by the same heat pump to provide heating to the animal housing stables, and then
    it is re-injected up-gradient into the ground; – finally, the extraction wells,
    if rationally positioned, could be used as a sort of hydraulic barrier to prevent
    or decrease nitrate pollution down-gradient of the agricultural fields. In this
    way, less surface water would be used for irrigation practices and lower pollution
    from fertilizers and pesticides should be detected in the shallow aquifer. The
    proposed system operation according to the season is briefly summarized in Table
    2 and Fig. 8. Table 2. GWHP system operation according to the season. Season Duration

    season producing a cold plume in the aquifer; (a) and in the summer season producing
    a warm plume in the aquifer (b). As far as the location of the extraction and
    injection wells is concerned, it has to be remarked that usually, in open loop
    heat pump systems, extraction wells are located hydraulically up-gradient with
    respect to the injection ones in order to avoid thermal interference (Casasso
    and Sethi, 2015). On the contrary, in the innovative GWHP application proposed
    here, extraction wells have to be positioned on a line perpendicular to the preferential
    direction of the groundwater flow and down-gradient in order to act as hydraulic
    barrier for nitrates. Consequently, the injection and extraction wells have to
    be drilled at an appropriate distance with the aim to prevent the cold water re-injected
    during winter operation from reaching the extraction wells too soon, decreasing
    the system energy efficiency. A validation of this concept was achieved through
    a numerical model. The implementation of the flow and transport numerical model
    was preceded by the conceptual model, based on the information gathered from the
    area of interest of the EDZC, as reported in Section 2. Specifically, we assumed
    that the groundwater flow present under crop fields – to be used by a hypothetical
    farm – could be extracted down-gradient of the fields through a series of wells
    30 m deep. We assumed that the water could be extracted at a temperature equal
    to 15.5 °C, approximately constant all year round, corresponding to the yearly
    average temperature of Lodi’s aquifer (Antelmi, 2016). The heat pump would provide
    winter and summer air-conditioning to the entire building dedicated to breeding
    (green building in Fig. 1a), whose peak heating load was roughly estimated to
    be ten times the piglet room load, namely 170 kW. 4.2. Numerical model The numerical
    model was developed through MODFLOW (Harbaugh et al., 2000) and MT3DMS (Zheng
    and Wang, 1999) codes. MODFLOW is a code that numerically solves the groundwater
    flow equations in a three-dimensional porous medium, using the finite differences
    method. The code, developed by the U.S. Geological Survey, is one of the most
    worldwide used codes in hydrogeology and it can work coupled with many other USGS
    codes (e.g. MODPATH, SEAWAT, MT3DMS, RT3D, etc.). MODFLOW includes a set of commands
    necessary to simulate and solve different site-specific mathematical models and
    to solve the equations of the groundwater flow it needs a horizontal and vertical
    discretization of the domain into unitary or homogeneous elements, to apply the
    set of numerical equations. MT3DMS is a modular three-dimensional multispecies
    code for the simulation of the fate and transport of contaminants in groundwater
    systems. MT3DMS can be used to simulate concentration changes of miscible contaminants
    or heat transport (Thorne et al., 2006, Angelotti et al., 2014, Alberti et al.,
    2017) in groundwater considering advection, dispersion, diffusion and some basic
    chemical reactions, with various types of boundary conditions and external sources
    or sinks. As shown in Fig. 9, the modelling domain is a square area of 4.5 km2
    with a number of cells equal to 291600. In the centre of this large domain, a
    study area of 200 m × 200 m was defined, where the geothermal open loop system
    – consisting of 8 down-gradient wells, 2 up-gradient wells – and the heat pump
    were located. The modelling domain was substantially widened beyond the study
    area in order to adequately distance boundary conditions, inferred by hydraulic
    heads measurements (see Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Material). In the domain,
    the grid size varied from a maximum of 100 m to a minimum of 1 m in the study
    area. Download : Download high-res image (946KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 9. Plan view of the model domain (left), including grid cell size refinement
    in the study area (right), EDZC area (green) in the center of the model and wells
    on the right (blue). (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure
    legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) Along the
    vertical direction, a homogeneous aquifer approximately 30 m deep was implemented.
    This is the upper part of the regional shallow aquifer, locally separated from
    the deeper portion by a clayey layer at 30 m. Therefore, considering the stratigraphy
    (Fig. 2), the vertical domain was divided into 4 layers, each representing a given
    lithology identified in the aquifer: sandy silt (layer 1, 9.4 m thick), fine sand
    (layer 2, 8.3 m), medium sand (layer 3, 12.8 m) and clayey silt (layer 4, 3.5
    m). The hydrogeological properties adopted for each layer are shown in Table S4
    of the Supplementary Material. Hydraulic conductivities (Kx, Ky and Kz), storage
    coefficient (Ss) for confined aquifer or specific yeld for unconfined aquifer
    and porosity values were assigned both on the experimental data (stratigraphy
    analysis, flow pumping test, slug tests) and on a flow model specifically built
    to simulate the pumping test carried out in Lodi (Marocchi, 2015). In the model,
    the difference between observed and simulated hydraulic heads was minimized with
    a trial and error approach. The advection term is variable along the layers, in
    fact the Darcy velocity, depending on hydraulic conductivity and porosity, varies
    from 10−11 m/s for the clayey layer to 10−7 m/s for the sandy layers, producing
    an averaged Darcy velocity of the aquifer equal to 1.6 10−7 m/s. Other hydrogeological
    properties, such as bulk density, distribution coefficient, thermal diffusion
    or thermal dispersivity were assigned starting from the Thermal Response Test
    carried out in Lodi and subsequently calibrated through trial and error method
    (Antelmi, 2016). The bulk density (ρb) was calculated for each layer, depending
    on the density of each material (ρ) and porosity (θ) of the same layer, as: (3)
    The distribution coefficient, depending on the specific heat capacity of water
    and soil, was calculated as: (4) while the thermal diffusion coefficients, depending
    on the thermal conductivities of each layer, were calculated as: (5) where θ is
    the porosity, λw and λs are the thermal conductivities of water and soil, cp,w
    and cp,s are the specific heat capacities of water and soil, and ρw is the density
    of water (Alberti et al., 2017). Thermal dispersivities along longitudinal, transverse
    and vertical directions were constant and uniform into the model (respectively
    equal to 0.5, 0.5 and 0.05 m) everywhere (Gelhar et al., 1992, Martone, 2014).
    In fact, the model is almost insensitive to this parameter as the heat transport
    is mainly driven by thermal diffusion. The hydrogeological properties values adopted
    for each layer are shown in Table S4 of the Supplementary Material. Two boundary
    conditions were assigned to the West and East boundaries of the model: they were
    two hydraulic constant heads (respectively 78 m and 69.6 m a.s.l.) inferred from
    the piezometric measurement, and the hydraulic gradient was 0.4%. The temperature
    at both boundaries, reproducing the unperturbed temperature of the aquifer, was
    set constant at the value of 15.5 °C. This was also assumed as the uniform initial
    temperature in the domain. 4.3. Numerical simulations – results and discussion
    Numerical simulations were carried out in order to assess the influence of two
    design parameters: the water flow rate to be extracted and the distance between
    extraction and injection wells. For a first estimation of the water flow rate,
    some energy considerations were carried out. If the GWHP COP is set equal to 4
    and the peak thermal load of the hypothetical building is 170 kW, the heat pump
    has to absorb 128 kW from the groundwater. By assuming a typical water temperature
    difference equal to 5 °C between the inlet and the outlet of the heat pump evaporator,
    the total water flow rate to be extracted from the aquifer was estimated in 6
    l/s. This flow rate was then adopted in numerical simulations and the capability
    of the 8 extraction wells to work as a hydraulic barrier was assessed. It was
    found that by extracting a total flow rate of 6 l/s (i.e. 0.75 l/s per well),
    a large part of the re-injected water was captured by the extraction wells during
    winter and summer. Fig. 10 shows a simulated piezometric map (blue lines identify
    hydraulic heads) in the area of interest for a typical warm season, corresponding
    to the irrigation period. The distance among extraction wells was previously evaluated
    analytically (Colombo et al., 2012) to guarantee an overlapping of wells capture
    areas. During both seasons, the extraction wells were able to capture a great
    amount of water flowing under crop fields and consequently also a large quantity
    of nitrates. A water mass balance carried out up-gradient and down-gradient of
    the 8 extraction wells (corresponding to the unconfined aquifer in the first three
    layers) confirmed that a percentage from 73.3% to 79.5% of the total groundwater
    flow was captured by the 8 wells, depending on the season. Download : Download

    the left represents the starting point of the particles. (For interpretation of
    the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
    web version of this article.) Moreover, the capacity to capture nitrates was assessed
    through a forward particle tracking simulation, which represents the effect of
    advective transport. Particles (red lines in Fig. 10) were seeded along a line
    (thickest black line in Fig. 10) in the aquifer, up-gradient of the field irrigated
    in summer. Then, through the MODPATH code, the path and fate of each single particle
    (Fig. 10) was calculated, according to the flow field previously calculated by
    MODFLOW. Fig. 10 shows that in Layer 3 less than 20% of the particles went beyond
    the hydraulic barrier. In Layer 1 and 2, corresponding to the shallow part of
    the unconfined aquifer, the percentage of the particles that escaped was even
    smaller, reducing to 5%. This is a relevant issue because nitrate concentration
    in groundwater generally decreases along the vertical due to the effects of de-nitrification
    processes supported by oxide-reductive conditions (Guffanti et al., 2010). Consequently,
    the designed GWHP system can be considered an efficient approach for limiting
    nitrate contamination linked to fertilization practices. Starting from 6 l/s,
    additional simulations were performed, increasing the extracted pumping rate so
    as to increase the number of particles captured. It was found that by extracting
    12 l/s, it would be possible to completely capture the total aquifer flow rate
    in the first three layers (more than 98% of water captured by 8 wells and less
    than 1% of particles beyond the hydraulic barrier). This flow rate corresponds
    to 1.5 l/s per well, which, being lower than the maximum rate of about 4 l/s per
    well suggested by Basta and Minchio (Basta and Minchio, 2007), prevents the transport
    of fine materials that could damage the heat exchanger. However, with this flow
    rate the heat pump thermal power would exceed the peak thermal load previously
    evaluated by factor 2. In this case, the excess thermal power could be used for
    the climatization of the adjacent building. The second parameter investigated
    was the distance between the injection and the extraction wells. Actually, this
    distance impacts on the temperature of the pumped groundwater and consequently
    on the GWHP energy efficiency. The heating mode energy efficiency (COP) decreases
    as the groundwater temperature decreases. As such, the distance should be large
    enough to prevent the cold water re-injected up-gradient during winter from reaching
    the pumping wells. At the same time, the cooling mode energy efficiency (EER)
    increases as the groundwater temperature decreases. The distance should then be
    small enough to exploit the winter cold plume during summer operation. Therefore,
    the wells should not be placed neither too close to each other, nor too distant.
    For this purpose, a numerical simulation of a typical yearly operation of the
    open loop geothermal system was carried out, according to the four periods reported
    in Table 2. On the basis of traditional and innovative irrigation practices in
    Lombardy (Alberti et al., 2016, Gandolfi, 2003, Masseroni et al., 2017), the flow
    rate of 0.42 l/s/ha is the seasonal average water demand for maize crops. Therefore,
    the 6 l/s extracted from the aquifer are adequate to irrigate an area of about
    10 ha, being the field dimension considered in the following simulations. The
    groundwater flow model running in unsteady state conditions gave, as outputs,
    four different head distributions for each simulated period. After this, the flow
    fields of the groundwater system were used to run the heat transport model. During
    the cold season, the water temperature implemented as input into the re-injection
    wells was equal to 10 °C, i.e. 5.5 °C lower than the unperturbed aquifer temperature
    (15.5 °C). Differently during the warm season, the temperature of the water supplied
    to the agricultural fields for irrigation was equal to 21 °C. Starting from a
    minimum value of 60 m derived from literature (Kavanaugh and Rafferty, 1997),
    the distance between the injection and the extraction wells was increased to up
    to 100 m. Fig. 11 shows the temperature of the extracted water as a function of
    time for different distances between the extraction and the injection wells. The
    temperature values are averaged for the eight pumping wells, in relation to the
    amount of water extracted from each layer; therefore, the temperature curves are
    not available during the intermediate periods (Table 2) because the wells are
    not in use. Considering, for instance, a distance of 70 m, the water extracted
    has a temperature equal to the unperturbed aquifer temperature approximately for
    the first 80 days. Subsequently, the temperature starts to decrease because of
    the influence of the cold water injected up-gradient, reaching 15 °C at the end
    of the first period (Fig. 11, point A) when the heat pump is turned off. During
    the second period, the cold thermal plume proceeds according to a groundwater
    velocity no longer affected by the presence of injecting/pumping wells, resulting
    in a water temperature equal to 14.0 °C at the beginning of the summer operation
    (Fig. 11, point B). This temperature, being lower than the unperturbed one, would
    increase heat pump energy efficiency. During the warm season, the average temperature
    of the water extracted decreases to a minimum of 13.4 °C (Fig. 11, point C), but
    then starts to increase as the effect of the cold plume weakens and simultaneously
    warm water from irrigation enters the aquifer. Download : Download high-res image

    water extracted from the 8 wells versus time, for different well distance values.
    The simulation starts on November 1st and A, B and C are the points discussed
    in the text. During the 2nd and 4th period data are not available as the wells
    are not in use. If the distance is increased to 100 m, the cold plume does not
    interfere in any negative way with the winter operation of the heat pump. Conversely,
    the positive influence on the summer operation is less relevant, since the minimum
    temperature is reached only at the end of summer. The temperature distribution
    can be observed also through a plan view of the isothermal curves in the model
    domain. Fig. 12 shows the thermal plume in layer 3, in each of the 4 periods during
    the first year of operation, resulting from the 70 m distance configuration between
    the injecting and the pumping wells. In particular, since layers 1 and 2 have
    a lower hydraulic conductivity than layer 3 (Table S4 of the Supplementary Material),
    they produce a shorter cold thermal plume than said layer, in which a higher Darcy
    velocity results in a very extended plume. As 95% of the water extracted from
    the hydraulic barrier comes from layer 3, and only the remaining 5% from layers
    1 and 2, the plume in layer 3 is considered to be more representative of the actual
    temperature of the aquifer. The cold thermal plume arrives at the pumping wells
    at the end of the winter (Fig. 12a), because of the increased hydraulic gradient
    produced between the injection and the extraction wells; in the second period
    (Fig. 12b) the injection wells are turned off and the cold plume moves forward,
    because of the natural groundwater flow. In the third period, the cold plume still
    moves forward, although it assumes a radial symmetry because of the warm water
    injected as irrigation (Fig. 12c). Lastly, it goes beyond the eight pumping wells,
    after the fourth period (Fig. 12d). Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download

    n. 3 (model zoom showed); the 2 injection wells are drawn only in the first period
    simulated. The results of the numerical simulations presented here demonstrate
    the feasibility of the innovative GWHP system concept. They show that through
    a proper configuration of the extraction and injection wells, the system can act
    as a hydraulic barrier towards nitrates, potentially improving the environmental
    conditions of the aquifer. At the same time, the results show that the distance
    between the injection and the extraction wells has an impact on the development
    and interaction of the cold and warm plumes generated by the integrated GWHP-irrigation
    system. Therefore, the yearly energy efficiency of the GWHP system depends on
    this key parameter. 5. Conclusions This study applied some alternatives to conventional
    climatisation in farms based on geothermal sources with the aim to improve temperature
    and ventilation control, while assessing the potential use of groundwater extraction
    wells for irrigation and the prevention of nitrate diffusion. The monitoring campaign
    on the pilot GSHP, installed in a piglet stable in Northern Italy, shows a 46%
    reduction in primary energy consumption and a 14% decrease in operating energy
    costs compared to a traditional gas fuelled heating system. The experimental results
    show that the specific needs of the animals in terms of thermo-hygrometric conditions
    and ventilation rates can be satisfied. GSHPs integrated with a heat recovery
    system are thus a promising option for energy-efficient heating and ventilation
    of breeding farms, avoiding combustion in stables and providing summer cooling
    in addition. As far as the new strategy for the optimised use of groundwater is
    concerned, the concept case of the GWHP system coupled to 8 extraction wells and
    2 injection wells is considered, and the yearly operation of the integrated system
    according to a seasonal schedule is numerically simulated. The influence of the
    extracted groundwater flow rate and of the distance between the extraction and
    the injection wells on the overall behaviour is investigated, with a focus on
    system efficiency and control of nitrate diffusion. The numerical investigation
    demonstrates the feasibility of the application of the GWHP combined with irrigation,
    showing the potential for reducing nitrate diffusion as well as primary energy
    consumption. Nevertheless, the prosecution of the research will need field experimentation
    to collect data on nitrate concentrations, water temperature and GWHP performance.
    This information will allow to calibrate a nitrate advective-dispersive transport
    model and estimate a contaminant mass balance, both useful to fully demonstrate
    the efficacy of the system in controlling nitrate diffusion. Furthermore, in case
    of a real application of the concept presented above, the system design should
    be optimised by adopting a detailed dynamic energy simulation, including the heat
    pump operation and the building. In a context where concurring purposes are to
    be attained, a detailed hydrogeological survey coupled with numerical modelling
    proved to be essential for exploring and designing effective strategies for more
    sustainable agriculture and breeding. Funding The EcoZoo project was co-funded

    Beijing, China SECTION I. Introduction Solar energy is emerging as a major power
    resource, steadily becoming an affordable and proving to be more effective than
    the conventional grid [1]. Solar photovoltaic (PV) energy promises a bright, clean
    and safe future. The PV assisted water pumping system, is a profitable replacement
    to the diesel engine based pumping system for water supply in remote areas. It
    is inexpensive, reliable, safe and eco-friendly. It also fares better against
    the wind powered pumping as the requirement of pumping for irrigation generally
    coincides with the solar insolation because pumping demand is highest during daytime
    and hot summer days. The isolated PV panel without any control has poor power
    transfer, so its performance necessitates an enhancement. Therefore, the proposed
    system utilizes an IC MPPT algorithm, which has a benefit of less oscillation
    at maximum power point (MPP) and fast tracking response [2]–[3]. A modified CSC
    converter is proposed to execute the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm.
    The circuit configuration of the proposed modified CSC converter is shown in Fig.
    1. In conventional CSC converter, the output current has high current ripple.
    Thus, it is modified in present work and a small size output inductor is connected
    at its output to minimize the output current ripple. Various traditional motor
    drives have been advocated for the solar powered water pumping. An induction motor
    though is favored because of low maintenance requirement but it suffers from low
    power factor and complex control. Some researchers have carried out the analysis
    of permanent magnet brushless DC (BLDC) motor and permanent magnet synchronous
    motor (PMSM) based water pumping [5]–[6]. Although these machines comprise the
    high efficiency and low maintenance requirement, the narrow range for constant
    power operation and comparatively high cost due to the presence of permanent magnet
    (PM) materials are the main limitations of BLDC and PMSM drives [7]. In contrast,
    SRM drive has rugged nature, low maintenance requirement and high efficiency and
    therefore can be an appropriate motor for water pump. Among the limited reported
    literature, which have discussed the PV energized SRM driven water pumping system,
    a good example has been suggested in [8]. The system utilizes a 6/4 pole, three
    phase SRM with PWM switching. Unfortunately, the utilized three phase SRM, suffers
    from the high torque ripple and torque dip. Moreover, the PWM switching of the
    SRM converter increases the switching losses thereby decreases the efficiency
    of overall system. Another system utilizing a 4-phase SRM and CSC converter has
    been reported in [9]. Although the system [9] has lower torque ripples and higher
    efficiency as compared to [8], it lacks the self-start and soft start features,
    which hinders their utilization in water pump systems. Acknowledging the inadequacies
    and shortcomings of conventional systems, an arrangement using 8/6 pole, four
    phase SRM drive utilizing a mid-point converter with fundamental switching is
    proposed in this work. The SRM drive encompasses optimal gating angle control
    and dwell angle control to enrich soft starting and self-starting of the motor
    [10]. Torque ripple minimization is achieved due to a structural advantages of
    8/6 pole and suitable angle and voltage control [11]–[13]. The proposed system
    is modeled in MATLAB and tested on hardware. The system is checked for environmental
    fluctuations and its responses are analyzed. The aptness of the responses authenticates
    the proposed drive suitability for PV powered irrigation pump. SECTION II. Configuration
    of Proposed System Fig. 1 shows the schematic of proposed PV array powered water
    pump utilizing SRM and the modified CSC converter. The proposed system constitutes
    a PV array as a power source, modified CSC converter as a DC-DC power conversion
    stage for power optimization and conditioning, a split-capacitor converter for
    phase commutation and control and SRM. The following sections elaborate the design
    and control approach of the proposed system. The following sections elaborate
    the design and control approach of the proposed system. Fig. 1 Proposed configuration
    of proposed SRM drive utilizing modified CSC converter for water pumping system

    SECTION III. Working of DC-DC Converter The operation of modified CSC converter
    is kept in CICM to reduce the stress on its devices and improves the performance.
    Its different modes of operation are inherently decided by the state of the switch
    whether on or off, which is governed by the MPPT requirement. The modified CSC
    converter operates in two modes: Mode 1 and Mode 2, which are expanded in Fig.
    2(a) and Fig. 2(b) respectively. Mode 1: In this cycle, switch ‘S’ is closed.
    This enables the charging of inductor L1 via the input PV array supply. At the
    same time, capacitor Cm discharges its stored energy through the inductors L1
    and L2. The diode ‘D’ is reversed biased due to the voltage across the inductor
    L2. The intricacies of operation of the modified CSC converter in this mode, is
    shown in Fig. 2(a). Mode 2: In this mode, the switch ‘S’ is in opened condition.
    This leads to a decrease in the current through the inductor L2 causing the diode
    ‘D’ to get into forward bias. The input from the PV array, which previously charged
    the inductor L1, now charges the capacitor Cm through the diode and inductor L1.
    The inductors L1 and L2 discharge their stored energy to DC link split capacitors
    of the midpoint converter. Operation of the modified CSC converter in this mode
    is shown in Fig. 2(b). SECTION IV. Proposed System Desigo The overall system is
    designed in such a way that there is no change in its effectiveness even under
    varying environmental conditions. A. Design of Solar PV Panel The HBL Power System
    Ltd. designed PV module HB-50 [10] with each cell having a maximum power of 50
    W is selected to design a PV array of 600W peak power capacity. The specification
    and parameter estimation of utilized PV array system is indicated in Table I.
    B. Parameter Estimation of DC-DC Converter The present system makes use of modified
    CSC converter as a DC-DC power conversion stage. The modified CSC converter is
    operated in CICM irrespective of surrounding conditions. The expression to evaluate
    the duty cycle, ‘D’ of the modified CSC is [9], V DC V PV =− D 1−D ⇒D= V DC V
    DC + V PV = 245 245+221 =.52 (1) View Source Considering the switching frequency
    ′ f sw ′=25kHz,′ V DC ′=245 V and the ripple current magnitude in the inductor,
    L1, Δ I L1 =25% of ‘IL1’, ‘L1’ is calculated as, L 1 = V PV ×D Δ I L1 × f sw =
    221×0.52 5.02×0.25×25000 =3.5mH (2) View Source The energy transfer capacitor
    Cm can be calculated as [10], C m = I PV ×(1−D) Δ V Cm × f sw = 2.64×0.52 40×25000
    =1.38μF (3) View Source The expression for output inductor L2 is derived from
    the basic charging-discharging equations. During ON state of switch i.e. mode
    1, the current through L2 and the capacitor Cm are same and is written as, I L2
    = I cm = ΔQ Δt = C m ×Δ V cm DT (4) View Source Where ΔQ is the charge accumulated
    in the capacitor Cm during mode-1 and T is complete duration for switch on and
    off i.e. 1/fsw. The ripple in inductor current, Δ I L2 is given as, Δ I L2 = Δ
    V cm ×T L 2 ×8 (5) View Source Rearranging (4) and (5) and considering 5% ripple
    in current through itself, the value of L2 is estimated as, L 2 = D× I ph1 8×Δ
    I ph1 × f 2 SW × C m =1.50mH (6) View Source The expression to estimate the DC
    link split is as [9], C DC1 = C DC2 = I ph1 (30−α) 2ωΔ V DC = 2.34×15×Π/180 2×157.07×0.02×245
    ≈397μF (7) View Source where, IPH1 = motor phase current, ω = speed in rad/s,
    =commutation angle and Δ V DC = ripple allowing across DC link voltage i.e. 2%
    of VDC. SECTION V. Control Scheme The control techniques adapted at different
    stages of proposed system are mainly categorized into following three parts. The
    1st control is responsible for PV power maximization, whereas, the other two controls
    are used to optimize the SRM drive performance. A. PV Power Optimization Through
    MPPT Technique The incremental conductance algorithm is associated with present
    topology to optimize the PV power, which facilitates the soft starting of the
    motor drive. An IC MPPT has negligible oscillations at the operating point and
    has fast tracking [2]–[3]. Table I Parameters of PV array [10] B. Commutation
    Control of Mid-Point Converter The functioning of a mid-point converter, is highly
    influenced by the instant and duration of excitation of the phases of SRM drive
    [14]. The gating signals for the switches, which control the energization of SRM
    windings are evaluated by the four Hall-Effect position sensors outputs. The SRM
    converter delivers pulse of currents to magnetize and reverse voltage to de-magnetize
    the windings of SRM using its DC link voltage. The DC link voltage is splited
    into two capacitors, which in turn pair up with the respective switch and antiparallel
    diode to help in the magnetization and demagnetization of the respective phases.
    The split DC-link converter has many advantages like lower number of components
    and fast energy feedback respective to other SRM converters. C. Self-Start and
    Soft Start Control of SRM Drive A technique to facilitate the automatic start
    and soft start of SRM drive, is implemented in proposed system. To eliminate the
    self-starting problem, a dwell angle as a speed dependent control technique is
    developed and introduced in the motor drive [10]. At starting, two phases conduct
    simultaneously by the aid of 30°conduction angle and then switch to 14° after
    the motor has achieved a speed of 27.54rad/sec or higher than it. The technique
    to compute the speed of SRM is shown in Fig. 3. The block named as capture-1,
    works as to enumerate the counter pulses between two consecutive instants of growing
    edges of the Hall-Effect sensor, H 1 . The output count is given by symbol ‘tcount’
    against the mechanical rotation of 60°. Therefore, the speed is estimated as,
    ω=(60/ t count )× K ω (8) View Source where, Kw=calibrated speed constant. Fig.
    3. Speed computation of SRM drive using hall-sensor. Show All SECTION VI. Simulation
    Results The behavior of system is examined using Simulink platform using sim-power
    system block sets. A. Start-Up and Settled Response at G=1000W/ m 2 and T= 25
    ∘ C The steady state behavior of proposed system parameters at highest insolation
    level, are shown in Figs. 4(a-c). The smooth tracking of MPP voltage and generation
    of maximum output power are demonstrated in Fig 4(a). Fig. 4(b) depicts the starting
    and steady-state nature of SRM parameters. The smooth starting of SRM is manifested
    in Fig. 4(b). The electromagnetic and load torque of the motor are also illustrated
    in Fig. 4(b). It can be seen in Fig. 4(b), that the speed of the motor gradually
    increases in a controlled fashion to reach the rated operating conditions. The
    maximum stresses on semiconductor devices of modified CSC converter in terms of
    voltage and current are demonstrated in Fig. 4(c). It also concludes the CICM
    operation of DC-DC converter. B. Dynamic Behavior of System Under Varying Insolation
    and Constant T= 25 ∘ C The dynamic response of proposed system are examined under
    varying irradiance conditions and demonstrated in Figs. 5(a-b). The approximately
    constant value of VPV even under varying irradiation advocates the effective accomplishment
    of an IC MPPT controller. The nearly constant value of VPV and change in IPV and
    P with both decrease and increase in insolation levels, ‘G’ is demonstrated in
    Fig. 5(a). The variation of motor parameters against the PV power generation is
    shown in Fig. 5(b). SECTION VII. Hardware Implementation The hardware validation
    of the proposed system has been also done to examine its aptness and suitability
    in real time. The PV array is realised by the help of an AMTEK make PV simulator.
    A DC generator with resistances bank is coupled to act as a load. A. System Response
    at Starting and in Steady State at G=1000W/ m 2 and T= 25 0  C Figs. 6(a-c) show
    the waveforms that display the various hardware parameters of the system at maximum
    irradiance. Fig. 6(a) illustrates the steady state nature of VPV, Ipv, P and N.
    The maximum stresses on semiconductor devices of DC-DC converter in terms of voltage
    and current are demonstrated by Fig. 6(b). Fig. 6(c) demonstrates the nature of
    voltage across middle capacitor and current through both the inductors of the
    modified CSC converter. The nature of current through inductors manifests the
    CCM operation of converter. B. Performance of System Under Varying Insolation
    Fig. 7 (a) governs the successful soft-starting of SRM drive. It also shows the
    starting responses of speed and nature of incrementing DC link voltage at starting
    condition. The efficient performances of MPPT controller with smooth variation
    in ‘N’ and ‘VDC’ under change in PV power are demonstrated in Fig. 7(b). Figs.
    8 (a-b) manifest the excellent MPPT performance and have efficiency greater than
    99% under both the insolation levels. Fig. 4 Simulated performance of system at

    PV array powered SRM driven water pump using modified CSC converter, has been
    proposed and its appropriateness has been verified through Matlab simulation results
    and hardware implementation. The self-start problem of 4-phase SRM, has been acknowledged
    and it has been efficiently eliminated by using an appropriate control. The soft
    starting of the motor is also achieved through dwell angle and MPPT technique.
    The method to eliminate the necessity of voltage and current sensors on the motor
    side by virtue of SRM commutation at fundamental switching, has been also executed
    efficiently. Moreover, the inherent benefits of CSC converter in addition to the
    minimum current ripple in output, have enhanced the system reliability and performance.
    The overall behavior of proposed system even under rapidly changing environmental
    conditions, testifies its aptness for solar PV powered water pump under any surrounding
    conditions. Fig. 7 Starting and dynamic response of proposed system under varying
    environmental conditions (a) PV array, phase current and speed of SRM at 1000W/m2

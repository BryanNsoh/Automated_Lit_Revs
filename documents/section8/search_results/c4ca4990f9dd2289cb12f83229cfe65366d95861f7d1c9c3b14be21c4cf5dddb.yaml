    Article 20 October 2023 Introduction In the nineteenth century, coffee cultivation
    in Brazil began to expand into the Cerrado region. The Cerrado is a vast region
    of savanna with poor soils. However, Brazilian coffee farmers developed new techniques
    for improving the soil, such as using lime and fertilizer. As a result, the Cerrado
    is now the world''s largest coffee-producing region. The components nitrogen,
    phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, Sulphur, and iron can all be found
    in soil that is considered fertile1. The optimal soil for growing coffee is loamy
    soil, found in the state of north Karnataka, India which has a good combination
    of texture, drainage, and water retention. Coffee plantation soil requires well-drained
    soil to prevent waterlogging and root rot. Coffee plants have extensive root systems
    that extend deep into the soil to absorb nutrients and water2. The presence of
    nutrient-rich soil serves as the fundamental basis for the optimal growth and
    development of coffee plants, hence facilitating the production of superior-grade
    coffee beans. Fertility refers to the soil''s ability to provide essential nutrients
    for plant growth, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Healthy soil leads
    to healthier coffee plants, which produce higher yields of high-quality beans.
    Coffee plants thrive in slightly acidic soil with a pH of 5.0–6.5. Crop covering,
    composting, organic fertilizer, reduced tillage, water conservation, and shade
    management are ancient soil fertility strategies. Restoration of dry land to rich
    soil using IoT sensors to monitor and enhance coffee plantation soil health is
    creative and successful3. Soil sensors measure nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
    Soil temperature sensors show how temperature affects plant growth and nutrient
    uptake. Farmers can protect coffee plants from extreme temperatures by tracking
    soil temperature patterns. Soil temperature sensors show how temperature affects
    plant growth and nutrient uptake. Analyzing soil temperature patterns protects
    coffee plants from extreme temperatures4. IoT sensors help farmers optimize irrigation,
    fertilization, and other soil management activities for healthier soil and higher
    crop yields by giving real-time soil data. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are
    a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that are well-suited for processing
    sequential data like IoT sensor time-series data. RNNs are useful for time series
    prediction, anomaly detection, and natural language processing because they can
    learn and understand temporal patterns and interdependencies in datasets. Recurrent
    neural networks (RNNs) provide the capability to analyze records of soil moisture
    data, enabling the prediction of forthcoming moisture levels. Conduct a comprehensive
    examination of soil nutrient data to predict potential nutrient deficits, hence
    facilitating the efficient and effective application of fertilizers by farmers.
    This research gap identifies characteristic patterns in soil sensor data, with
    a special emphasis on sudden changes in moisture and nutrient levels. Regular
    soil monitoring will monitor the alterations in soil condition and prompt safeguards
    will be implemented5. Develop predictive models that provide suggestions for optimal
    irrigation, fertilization, and other soil management practices. The limited scope
    of traditional soil testing often focuses on soil organic matter, microbial activity,
    and soil structure. However, the use of organic improvement in soil may result
    in delayed progress. Generalized suggestions derived from past data may not consider
    the particular soil characteristics, regional climate, or contemporary methods
    of management. The information provided Erroneous interpretation of soil test
    findings and suggestions might result in misguided conclusions and unproductive
    actions. Insufficient historical analysis, which fails to account for previous
    management techniques and local environmental conditions, can have an influence
    on evaluations of soil health status and long-term patterns. This paper is organized
    as follows: “Literature review” section presents a review of related work in Recurrent
    Neural Networks with the Internet of Things using deep learning. “The proposed
    model” section describes the proposed RNN-IoT approach in detail. “Results and
    discussion” section presents the experimental setup and results. “Conclusion”
    section discusses the results and compares RNN-IoT with existing methods. “Challenges
    and future possibilities” section concludes the paper and discusses future research
    directions. Literature review Aarthi, R., Sivakumar, D., et al., proposed the
    optimal watering schedule and fertilizer application rate. IoT software platforms
    that can be used to develop smart soil property analysis systems such as Thing
    Speak, Blynk, Cayenne, Node-RED, and Azure IoT Hub. Smart soil property analysis
    systems can provide real-time soil conditions data, allowing farmers to respond
    quickly to any changes. Future work is to develop more sophisticated machine learning
    models to improve the accuracy of the predictions6. Na, A., Isaac, W., Varshney,
    S, et al., proposed an Internet of Things (IoT)-based system for remote monitoring
    of soil characteristics a system that employs sensors to collect data on soil
    properties, such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC), moisture, temperature, and
    then communicates this data to a cloud platform or another remote location. These
    soil qualities include electrical conductivity (EC), pH, and temperature7. Jain,
    N., Awasthi, Y et al., proposed an IoT-based soil analysis system using optical
    sensors and multivariate regression is a system that uses optical sensors to measure
    the color and reflectance of soil and then uses multivariate regression to predict
    soil properties, such as pH, organic matter, and nutrient content. IoT-based soil
    analysis systems can be made small and portable, making them ideal for field use.
    Future work on IoT-based soil analysis systems could focus on making IoT-based
    soil analysis systems more affordable and accessible to small-scale farmers8.
    Patil, P et al., proposed the implementation of IoT to determine the level of
    bicarbonate in the soil a system that uses sensors to measure the pH and electrical
    conductivity (EC) of soil and then uses this data to calculate the bicarbonate
    level. IoT-based bicarbonate detection systems can provide users with the data
    they need to make informed decisions about irrigation, fertilization, and other
    agricultural practices9. Adrian Z et al. proposed integrating soil pH measurement
    into an Internet of Things (IoT) application a concept that involves using sensors
    to measure soil pH and then transmitting this data to a cloud platform or other
    remote location using a wireless communication protocol. The dataset collected
    by IoT-based soil pH measurement systems typically includes soil pH, Temperature,
    Humidity, Electrical conductivity (EC), and Timestamp10 as illustrated in Table
    1. Table 1 Literature review for soil health based on different proposed models.
    Full size table IoT (Internet of Things) is a key enabling technology for smart
    agriculture, as it allows for the collection and analysis of data from sensors
    in real-time. IoT-based soil parameter measurement systems can provide real-time
    data on soil parameters, which allows farmers to respond quickly to changes. Future
    work on IoT-based soil parameter measurement systems could focus on making the
    systems easier to set up and maintain18. The materials and methods section describes
    how the soil is fertilized using IoT sensors and Cloud storage. The proposed model
    The primary objective of this research study was to monitor the overall condition
    of the soil and to design an advanced algorithm called RNN-IoT. The present techniques
    for measuring soil health based on existing and past guidelines have yielded inaccurate
    results. The suggested approach has successfully addressed all of the aforementioned
    limitations and obtained a predictable outcome in transforming barren land into
    sustainable and rich soil suitable for coffee cultivation. Build an IoT sensor

    As demonstrated in Fig. 1, the N95S31B NB-IoT outdoor temperature and humidity
    sensor accurately measures air temperature and relative humidity. Figure 1 Working
    prototype for testing soil fertility. Full size image It subsequently sends data
    to an IoT server over NB-IoT. CO2 sensors measure CO. The waterproof, sturdy CO2
    concentration transmitter outputs 0–10 V. Nordic nRF9160 SiP is a low-power, single-chip
    cellular IoT solution. Its Arm Cortex-M33 CPU, low-power RF transceiver, and multiple
    ports make it adaptable. The Nordic nRF9160 SiP''s ADC peripheral measures soil
    moisture. SiP receives soil moisture sensor data20. The Soil EC NPK PH Sensor
    monitors NPK, EC, and pH. Soil electrical conductivity (EC) may indicate salt
    concentration. Higher EC values imply plant-harming soil salt. Growing plants
    need nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. It means 20% nitrogen, phosphorus, and
    potassium in the soil. Soil pH indicates acidity or alkalinity. Acidic soils have
    pH < 7, while alkaline soils have pH > 7. Electrical conductivity sensors detect
    soil solution. NPK sensors evaluate soil solution light absorption at different
    wavelengths. This data can track soil health trends and identify areas that need
    specialist soil management. LDR soil color sensors like the MNS2-9-W2-CM-020 improve
    coffee plantation soil health monitoring21. The Maxim Integrated DS3231 time stamp
    may improve coffee plantation soil health monitoring in numerous ways. Plantation
    operators can use time stamps to find patterns and trends in soil health data
    as indicated in Fig. 2. Figure 2 Virtual abstract for proposed system. Full size
    image Protocol for interfacing serial technology (IST) Soil moisture sensors measure
    volumetric water content. Two electrodes detect soil electrical resistance, which
    fluctuates with water content. Sensor output is usually a soil moisture-proportional
    voltage or frequency as indicated in Eq. (1). Where VWC is the volumetric water
    content which finds the percentage of soil volume occupied by water, can be calculated
    based on the weight of the wet soil minus the weight of the dry soil which divides
    the weight of the dry soil. εa is the apparent dielectric permittivity of the
    soil, εb is the dielectric permittivity of dry soil, εc is the dielectric permittivity
    of water. Where ρn is the neutron count rate in the soil, ρd is the neutron count
    rate in dry soil, and ρw is the neutron count rate in water as indicated in Eq.
    (2). $${\\text{VWC}} = \\left( {\\upvarepsilon {\\text{a}} -\\upvarepsilon {\\text{b}}}
    \\right)/\\left( {\\upvarepsilon {\\text{w}} -\\upvarepsilon {\\text{c}}} \\right)$$
    (1) $${\\text{VWC}} = \\left( {\\uprho {\\text{n}} -\\uprho {\\text{d}}} \\right)/\\left(
    {\\uprho {\\text{w}} -\\uprho {\\text{d}}} \\right)$$ (2) $${\\text{VWC}} = {\\text{M}}
    + {\\text{N}}*{\\text{R}}$$ (3) where R is soil electrical resistance and M and
    N are calibration constants from Eq. (3). A soil temperature sensor is needed
    to understand soil activity and plant growth22. It employs thermistors or thermocouples,
    whose resistance changes with temperature. Equation (4) shows that the sensor''s
    voltage or current output is proportional to soil temperature. Where T is soil
    temperature, R is thermistor electrical resistance, and A and B are calibration
    coefficients. $${\\text{T}} = {\\text{A}} + {\\text{B}}*\\ln \\left( {\\text{R}}
    \\right)$$ (4) Water level indicators assess soil water table depth. It employs
    a pressure transducer or ultrasonic sensor to detect water-induced pressure or
    sound reflection. Sensor output is generally a water level-proportional voltage
    or frequency. An NPK color value indicator evaluates soil nitrogen, phosphorus,
    and potassium levels. It measures soil extract color with a colorimetric sensor.
    Sensor output is generally an RGB color value or a numerical NPK level value.
    A GPS sensor locates the soil monitoring spot. GPS satellites inform it of its
    latitude, longitude, and altitude. The sensor sends NMEA messages with location
    coordinates as indicated in Eqs. (5), (6), and (7). $${\\text{Latitude}}={\\text{ArcTan}}2\\left({\\text{sin}}\\left({\\upvarphi
    }\\right),{\\text{cos}}\\left({\\upvarphi }\\right)*{\\text{cos}}\\left(\\uplambda
    \\right)\\right)$$ (5) $${\\text{Longitude}} = {\\text{ArcTan}}2\\left( {\\sin
    \\left(\\uplambda \\right),\\cos \\left(\\uplambda \\right)*\\cos \\left( {\\upvarphi
    } \\right) - \\sin \\left( {\\upvarphi } \\right)*\\sin \\left(\\updelta \\right)}
    \\right)$$ (6) $${\\text{Altitude}} = {\\text{R}}*\\left( {\\sin \\left( {{\\upvarphi
    } - {\\upvarphi }_{0} } \\right) - \\left( {{\\text{R}}_{0} + {\\text{h}}} \\right)/{\\text{R}}*\\sin
    \\left( {{\\upvarphi }_{0} } \\right)} \\right)$$ (7) where \\({\\upvarphi }\\)
    is the geodetic latitude, \\(\\uplambda\\) is the longitude, \\(\\updelta\\) is
    the sun’s declination, R is the Earth''s mean radius (6371 km), R0 is its equatorial
    radius (6378 km), h is the GPS antenna’s height above the Earth’s surface, and
    \\({\\upvarphi }_{0}\\) is the reference ellipsoid’s latitude (43.66° LDRs (light-dependent
    resistors) measure soil color to determine nutrient content. It usually uses an
    LDR, which changes resistance when exposed to different wavelengths of light.
    Sensor output is generally a resistance value that fluctuates proportionately
    with soil color as indicated in Eq. (8). $${\\text{R}}=({\\text{Cr}}+{\\text{Cg}}+{\\text{Cb}})/({\\text{Cw}}+{\\text{Cg}}+{\\text{Cb}})$$
    (8) where R is the reflected light, Cr is the red light component of the incident
    light, Cg is the green light component of the incident light, Cb is the blue light
    component of the incident light, and Cw is the white light component of the incident
    light. Soils with higher organic matter content tend to reflect more red light
    and less blue light, while soils with lower organic matter content tend to reflect
    more blue light and less red light. A pH sensor monitors the acidity or alkalinity
    of the soil. Typically, it employs a glass electrode that generates a voltage
    that varies by the pH of the solution that it is surrounded by. The output of
    the sensor is often in the form of a voltage, and its magnitude is typically proportional
    to the pH of the soil as shown in Eq. (9). $${\\text{pH}}=-{\\text{log}}10\\left({\\text{aH}}+\\right)$$
    (9) pH is soil acidity or alkalinity and pH+ is hydrogen ion activity in the soil
    solution. Each soil health measurement is timestamped. Even when the gadget is
    off, its real-time clock (RTC) preserves precise time. Synchronizing soil health
    data with other sources and tracking changes requires the timestamp. Table 2 estimates
    dry land-rich soil in coffee plantations2. IoT sensors may be connected to Arduino
    using IST. The simple and efficient IST protocol is ideal for connecting many
    sensors to an Arduino microcontroller. It includes Master Out Slave, in Master
    in Slave Out, Slave Select, and Serial Clock. SCLK synchronizes master–slave data
    transfer. MOSI and MISO signals send data from master to slave and slave to master.
    The owner chooses the slave via SS. A start condition from the master device starts
    IST communication with the slave. Most starts are high-to-low SS signal changes.
    After supplying the start condition, the master device can send a MOSI bit per
    SCLK clock pulse to the slave device. The slave device receives MISO data and
    delivers a bit to the master device for each SCLK clock pulse. Stop signals from
    master devices to slave devices halt IST communication. SS signals typically rise
    during a standstill. Arduino microcontroller board with enough computing power
    for data handling and communication interfaces. Use appropriate cables to connect
    each sensor to the microcontroller board for proper pinout and voltage. In Algorithm
    1, each sensor''s communication protocols are configured for data acquisition.

    communicating with linked sensors, reading output values, and processing sensor
    data as requested. Arduino microcontrollers gather soil health data from sensors
    as the main data-collecting unit communicating with linked sensors, reading output
    values, and processing sensor data24. The Node MCU stores data in the cloud and
    uses AWS IoT Core for visualization, and these services are accessed through the

    tools to monitor the uploaded sensor data in real time or over time. The data
    can be analyzed to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies, providing valuable
    insights into the monitored environment or process. Analyzed sensor data can be
    used to trigger actions, such as sending alert messages based on soil health conditions.
    Recurrent neural network The raw data was delivered to the input layer, where
    it was often preprocessed and normalized to ensure network interoperability. Load
    the CSV file into Panda’s data frame. Preprocess the data by performing necessary
    steps such as cleaning, handling missing values, and feature selection. Sequence
    formation has sequence length is a variable that determines the length of each
    sequence to be created. An empty list called sequences is initialized to store
    the generated sequences. Formula for GRU-based Soil Health Monitoring where, h_t
    is the hidden state of the GRU at time step t, h_{t − 1} is the hidden state of
    the GRU at time step t − 1, h_t̃ is the candidate hidden state at time step t,
    gate_update is the update gate, gate_reset is the reset gate. $${h}_{t}=gat{e}_{update}*{h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}+gat{e}_{reset}*{h}_{\\widetilde{t}}$$
    (10) The update gate controls which information is allowed to flow into the hidden
    state from the previous time step where W_h is the weight matrix for the hidden-to-hidden
    state connection, U_x is the weight matrix for the input-to-hidden state connection,
    b_h is the bias vector for the hidden state, x_t is the input at time step t.
    $${h}_{\\widetilde{t}}=tanh\\left({W}_{h}*{h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}+{U}_{x}*{x}_{t}+{b}_{h}\\right)$$
    (11) Loops from 0 to len(data)—sequence length + 1. This loop generates dataset
    sequences. Unfold the RNN into interconnected layers with input, forget, cell,
    and output gates. Input the current input into the input gate to regulate information
    flow into the hidden state. Apply the forget gate on the previous hidden state
    to determine how much to remember. Update the cell state depending on the input
    gate, forget gate and previous hidden state cell state that stores sequence long-term
    memory. $${C}_{t}={f}_{t}*{C}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}+{i}_{t}*tanh\\left({W}_{h}*{h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}+{U}_{x}*{x}_{t}+{b}_{c}\\right)$$
    (12) Consider Ct as the cell state at time step t, \\({C}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}\\)
    at time step t − 1, and \\({h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}\\) as the forget gate
    \\({i}_{t}\\) is the input gate, tanh is the hyperbolic tangent activation function,
    \\({W}_{h}\\) and \\({U}_{x}\\) are the hidden-to-hidden and input-to-hidden weight
    matrices, respectively. At time step t, \\({b}_{c}\\) is the bias vector for the
    cell state, \\({x}_{t}\\) is the input, and \\({h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}\\)
    is the hidden state. Use the output gate to create the current time step output
    that passes cell state information. Gated recurrent units (GRUs) architecture
    trains the dataset properly depending on soil prediction features. At each time
    step, calculate the error between expected and actual output. Back propagates
    the error via the unrolled RNN to calculate weight error gradients. Update weights
    to reduce inaccuracy. Prediction and Analysis in the RNN model increase warnings
    and suggestions by predicting soil health metrics from real-time sensor inputs.
    Historical sensor data, growth trends, and FFNN soil health results train the
    model25. Change specifics to simulate scenarios. Counter-factual recommendation
    generation Parameters within historical data to represent various ‘what-if’ situations.
    It compares with the actual generated out with historical data to generate recommendations.
    They are comparing the recommendation using three ways Present data—Historical
    data, Historical data—Historical data, and Present data—Present data as illustrated
    in Fig. 5. Figure 5 Counter-factual recommendations. Full size image For example,
    let us contemplate a hypothetical situation in which a soil health monitoring
    system, based on feedforward neural network (FFNN) architecture, provides a recommendation
    for the optimal application rate of fertilizer for a particular agricultural area.
    Counterfactual suggestion has the potential to be employed to generate alternative
    fertilizer recommendations. Manhattan distance, often known as taxi cab distance,
    is calculated by adding the absolute coordinate differences of two places. Imagine
    traveling solely horizontally or vertically in Manhattan’s grid. Distance is calculated
    using present and historical data. Consider N points in K-dimensional space, where
    2 <  = N <  = 10^ {5} and 1 <  = K <  = 5. Find the location with the lowest Manhattan
    distance from the N places. Manhattan distance is two points measured along right-angle
    axes. It is |x1 − x2| +|y1 − y2| on a plane with p1 at (x1, y1) and p2 at (x2,
    y2). Sorting the points in all K dimensions and outputting the middle components
    of each dimension reduces the Manhattan distance. $$Manhattan\\;Distance = \\left|
    {s1 - s2} \\right| + \\left| {r1 - r2} \\right|$$ (13) The Manhattan Distance,
    which indicates the dissimilarity between the current suggestion and several alternative
    fertilizer options, may be calculated as shown in Eq. (13), where |s1 − s2| denotes
    the absolute difference between the two points’ s-coordinates. |r1 − r2| is the
    absolute difference in r-coordinates. The calculation considers nutritional content,
    application rates, and environmental effects. The system may create counterfactual
    suggestions with Manhattan Distances below a threshold. This keeps alternate options
    comparable to the original advice while allowing for varied perspectives. The
    implementation phase collects and analyzes data. Results and discussion The field
    implementation of the AI-powered system involved deploying IoT sensors in selected
    infertile agricultural fields to collect real-time soil data. These sensors continuously
    monitor soil properties such as moisture, temperature, pH, nutrient levels, and
    electrical conductivity. XG-booster is used for the pre-training model for predicting
    specific soil properties (e.g., nutrient content, and moisture levels) based on
    sensor data. The collected data was then fed into the AI system, which employed

    False Negative, True Positive, True Negative, and False Positive metrics using
    the Recurrent Neural Network and Counter-Factual Recommendation Generation. Field
    setup for improving soil fertility Enhancing the fertility of the soil is essential
    for achieving sustainable agriculture and achieving maximum crop yields. To evaluate
    and enhance the fertility of the soil throughout a range of monitoring periods,
    this experiment describes a field design that makes use of several land portions.
    Datasets are collected in real-time from Madikeri, Coorg, Karnataka total of 640,
    monthly monitoring based on historical data from the past three years recorded
    around 300582. Performance evaluation compared with RNN A proposed model is compared
    to existing models to determine its accuracy. Table 3 shows random forest, SVM,
    K-means clustering, GAN, and feed-forward neural network. This performance is
    measured using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1
    score. Accuracy is the most straightforward metric, measuring the proportion of
    correct predictions made by the model. Precision measures the proportion of correct
    positive predictions. Recall, also known as sensitivity, measures the proportion
    of actual positive instances that are correctly identified as positive. Table
    3 Performance analysis for the proposed model. Full size table $$Accuracy = (True\\;
    Positives + True \\;Negatives) / (Total\\; Samples)$$ (14) $$Precision = True\\;

    * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)$$ (17) $$Specificity = True \\;Negatives
    / (True \\;Negatives + False\\; Positives)$$ (18) The proposed method achieves
    94.25% accuracy, while random forest, SVM, K-means clustering, GAN, and FFNN obtain
    81.22%, 81.66%, 82.12%, 88.12%, and 89.73%. Existing approaches take longer to
    calculate all datasets. Figure 7 shows that the suggested technique detects events
    better than current methods. High EC and TDS readings indicate excessive salinity,
    which can stress and reduce coffee plant output. Most of the 30-day monitoring
    period had optimum EC and TDS values. NPK levels reflect coffee plant nutrient
    availability. Low nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) levels can decrease
    coffee plant output. The reduction in NPK levels from day 11–30 suggests dietary
    replenishment. During days 1–10, the soil moisture was a little dry, but otherwise,
    it was excellent. The rain prevented soil desiccation and reduced coffee plant
    stress. Figure 8 shows that soil temperature also affects coffee plant development.
    Coffee plants like soil temperatures between 20 and 25 °C. During the monitoring
    period, soil temperature stayed within the optimal range, promoting root growth
    and nutrient absorption. Figure 7 Result analysis for the proposed approach. Full
    size image Figure 8 Mobile application. Full size image Optimization of the model
    To keep the coffee plants healthy and the farm skiing, it is important to monitor
    the soil health of the plantations. Beans with more robust scents and tastes are
    a product of soil that is both healthy and well-tended. Farmers may maximize water
    and fertilizer efficiency and cut down on production expenses by learning what
    their soil requires to be healthy. To maintain healthy and fertile soil over the
    long term, it is important to evaluate it regularly for signs of nutrient imbalances.
    Weekly data analysis utilizing the RNN model is used to monitor soil conditions,
    and farmers are updated on health-related information and comments about soil
    quality. For a more precise prediction, we compare the soil condition from the
    second week of monitoring with that from the first week. In a similar way comparing
    week 2 with week 1 generates correct results, comparing week 3 with week 2 and
    so on also yields accurate results. Measurements taken to enrich the soil of coffee
    plantations in arid regions When substantially monitoring and tracking various
    essential indicators such as electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids
    (TDS), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), soil moisture, soil temperature,
    carbon dioxide (CO2), and soil pH, agricultural practitioners can promptly detect
    potential issues and implement appropriate measures to uphold an optimal ecosystem
    for their coffee crops. The soil solution''s EC and TDS levels indicate salt content
    as indicated in Table 4. Table 4 Measurement Range to fertile the coffee plantation
    soil from dry land. Full size table CO2 levels rose somewhat from day 11–20, indicating
    a healthier soil microbial community. Coffee plants thrive best at 5.5–6.5 soil
    pH as illustrated in Fig. 9. The soil pH remained within the correct range during
    the monitoring period, ensuring that coffee plants could easily obtain nutrients
    as shown in Table 5. Rainfall is vital to soil hydration. The monitoring period
    was without significant precipitation from day one to day fourteen. This shows
    that irrigation was needed to maintain soil moisture levels throughout this era.
    Day 15 brought 15 mm of rain, restoring soil moisture. Coffee plant soil health
    measurements were within optimal levels for most of the 140-day monitoring period
    from week 1 to week 20. Figure 9 Weekly monitoring using the IoT Platform. Full

    Full size table Counter-factual recommendation RNN-IoT model uses historical data
    and real-time sensor readings to predict future soil states and potential crop
    threats. Based on these predictions, the system generates counterfactual recommendations—alternative
    actions your farm could take to achieve desired outcomes. Mobile application sample
    The mobile application was created with the open-source Google framework Flutter,
    employing JavaScript. The RCNN model has been integrated and implemented, resulting
    in the generation of recommendations. These recommendations are created using
    Counterfactual suggestions. Figure 10 is a discussion based on the question raised
    by the agriculturist from various parts of the coffee plantation growers. Soil-rich
    mobile-based applications will provide recommendations after analyzing sensor
    data. Agriculturist question was “How do soil conditions that are too dry, too
    wet, too cold, or too hot affect coffee plants”. The recommendation is generated
    as High or low soil pH can make it difficult for coffee plants to absorb nutrients.
    Solution: Apply soil amendments to adjust the pH to the optimal range. The specific
    type of soil amendment to apply will depend on the current soil pH and the desired
    pH range. Similarly, “How does rainfall affect coffee plants, and what can coffee
    growers do to mitigate the negative effects of extreme rainfall events”. The recommendation
    is generated as Insufficient or excessive rainfall can lead to water stress or
    soil erosion. Irrigate during periods of low rainfall and implement erosion control
    measures during periods of high rainfall. Monitoring rainfall patterns is important
    to ensure that coffee plants receive the right amount of water26. The proposed
    model is trained using the Training Set, which enables it to discover hyperlinks
    and patterns in the data. To minimize loss and enhance predictions. To evaluate
    the model''s performance and adjust its hyper-parameters, a validation set is
    utilized during its development. Evaluates the model''s ability to be extrapolated
    to new data, which helps avoid excess fitting. The testing set is utilized for
    the final and unbiased evaluation of the model''s performance once all training
    and hyper-parameter adjustments have been finished. Ensures the model''s ability
    to apply knowledge to unfamiliar data and offers an accurate evaluation of its
    capabilities as shown in Fig. 11. The total dataset is divided into 60% for training,
    20% for validation, and 20% for testing. The difference between predicted and
    actual values is computed using a loss function by mean square error. The loss
    is propagated backward through time, updating model parameters (weights and biases)
    to minimize the loss. Figure 10 Farmer’s query-based recommendation. Full size

    exhibits the success of a proposed theory27. The data represents the observed
    vs projected results for each week of monitoring. Within the realm of soil fertility,
    weekdays may be classified as several tiers of fertility. For instance, weeks
    1–7 exhibit low fertility, weeks 8–14 demonstrate medium fertility, and weeks
    15–20 showcase high fertility, making them suitable for cultivation as shown in
    Fig. 12. Figure 12 Multiple confusion matrix for monitoring soil accuracy. Full
    size image By using IoT sensors to track soil moisture, temperature, pH, and nutrient
    levels, coffee farmers can gain valuable insights into their crops'' health and
    needs. Figure 13 data can then be used to make informed decisions about irrigation,
    fertilization, and other agricultural practices—a 20-week soil monitoring study
    that tracks the soil condition in a coffee plantation. The study was conducted
    in a coffee plantation in Madekari, Coorg, and Karnataka, India. Ten IoT sensors
    were installed on the plantation, and data was collected every hour for 20 weeks.
    The sensors measured soil moisture, temperature, and pH at a depth of 10 cm throughout
    20 weeks. Due to heavy rainfall in the early weeks of the research, soil moisture
    was maximum. Dry weather diminished soil moisture. The study''s soil temperature
    peaked in the first weeks and then dropped as the weather cooled. pH was almost
    consistent throughout the investigation. Figure 13 IoT sensors monitoring land
    view. Full size image 20-week. The investigation produced soil moisture, temperature,
    and pH maps. These maps helped identify under and over-watered crop regions and
    regulate the irrigation system. The maps were also utilized to identify acidic
    and alkaline soil on the farm and adapt the fertilization program. Conclusion
    The foreseeable future of coffee production demands beyond merely cultivating
    a diverse range of coffee beans; it involves establishing a sustainable and lucrative
    coffee business that will endure for future generations. Utilizing sophisticated
    sensors allows for the monitoring of environmental variables, including precipitation,
    humidity, and temperature, to optimize agricultural productivity. Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices have the potential to accurately assess the levels of water
    and nitrogen present in soil. Furthermore, by assessing the CO2 concentration
    in agricultural areas, it is possible to accurately monitor evapotranspiration
    rates, therefore enhancing the monitoring of soil health. This requires equipping
    coffee growers with the necessary tools and expertise to develop intelligent soil—a
    flexible and robust ecosystem that supports the growth of healthy coffee plants
    while reducing environmental harm. Farmers are provided with immediate updates
    on the condition of their soil and receive alerts on any potential issues. This
    enables farmers to promptly address any early signs of soil degradation. The Recurrent
    Neural Network and Counterfactual Recommendations utilize advanced algorithms
    to forecast future trends and provide tailored soil cures for youthful agriculturists.
    Knowledgeable farmers make well-informed choices regarding their soil, leading
    to higher crop production, better quality, and more profitability. The proposed
    method has overcome all of the above drawbacks and achieved the predictable result
    for converting infertile land to fertile land sustainable for coffee plantations.
    The future direction is moving towards installed outside Internet of Things devices
    are subject to severe weather, dust, wind, temperature, and other environmental
    hazards. This is one of the main issues with these devices. Unexpected mechanical
    failure of the complex devices could occur as a result of unfavorable environmental
    circumstances. Therefore, the raw materials used to construct the Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices used in smart farming must be able to endure such harsh climatic
    conditions. This will ensure that the devices last longer and provide more consistent
    results. Coffee cherry early detection and recommendation based on advanced deep
    learning technology which empowers farmers to cultivate a sustainable future for
    coffee, one smart earth revolution at a time. Challenges and future possibilities
    Global research on the Internet of Things (IoT) and sensor-based smart farming
    have revealed positive results. It is employed in several small-scale agricultural
    domains a rural farm, where farmers have less technological expertise, may provide
    more challenges. Even so, the execution of the project on a broad scale is still
    awaiting completion. An obstacle of great importance is the financial burden associated
    with the deployment and installation of IoT-tagged sensors and accessories in
    vast agricultural areas. Furthermore, there is ambiguity regarding the expenses
    associated with implementation and the monetary benefits that may be obtained.
    Deploying IoT-enabled technology incurs substantial expenses for hardware, software,
    and system operation. Supplementary costs may encompass energy usage, system upkeep,
    service enrollment, and labor fees for operating combined hardware and software.
    Enhancing farmers'' digital literacy on a global scale is crucial to facilitating
    the extensive use of IoT technologies. Lack of comprehension and consciousness
    of IoT-based technologies in agriculture might result in the underutilization
    of intelligent systems in farming28. Government policymakers should develop economic
    strategies to facilitate the successful and efficient implementation of Internet
    of Things (IoT) technology by farmers in agricultural areas. Data privacy and
    security issues might hinder large-scale IoT and smart system adoption. Attackers
    can manipulate cloud server data to harm automated agricultural activities in
    farmlands. Attacks can negatively impact agricultural output and prevent good
    environmental management. IoT data security concerns contribute to the sluggish
    adoption of smart farming systems. Encryption is crucial for protecting critical
    data and digital systems in smart farming from global cyberattacks. Integrating
    cryptography with strong keys can reduce cyber threats on cloud systems. Additional
    methods, such as integrating multiparty computing with homomorphic encryption
    or block-chain, can yield accurate results. Experimental statement No plants and
    Animals are disturbed for research work. All image datasets information regarding
    plant-based processes or applications was obtained from publicly available and
    ethically sourced data and publications. Plant Collection materials are complying
    with institutional, national, and international guidelines and legislation. So
    we confirm that all methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines/regulations/legislation.

  description: Saudi Arabia's agriculture heavily depends on effective water management,
    given its limited freshwater resources and arid climate. Real-time monitoring
    of soil moisture levels, weather conditions, and crop watering needs, facilitated
    by IoT integration, plays a crucial role in conserving water and minimizing waste.
    The resultant improvements in crop yields and quality are essential for the long-term
    success of agriculture in the country. This study employs the Technique for Order
    of Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method to investigate
    the transformative potential of the Internet of Things (IoT) in enhancing water
    management practices in Saudi Arabia's agriculture sector. The research begins
    by highlighting the significance of water management in agriculture, emphasizing
    the proportion of land in Saudi Arabia allocated to agricultural purposes. The
    problem statement underscores the pressing challenges in water management, encompassing

    Keywords: Internet of Things, Saudi Arabia , TOPSIS, Water management ABSTRACT
    Saudi Arabia''s agriculture heavily depends on effective water management, given
    its limited freshwater resources and arid climate. Real-time monitoring of soil
    moisture levels, weather conditions, and crop watering needs, facilitated by IoT
    integration, plays a crucial role in conserving water and minimizing waste. The
    resultant improvements in crop yields and quality are essential for the long-term
    success of agriculture in the country. This study employs the Technique for Order
    of Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method to investigate
    the transformative potential of the Internet of Things (IoT) in enhancing water
    management practices in Saudi Arabia''s agriculture sector. The research begins
    by highlighting the significance of water management in agriculture, emphasizing
    the proportion of land in Saudi Arabia allocated to agricultural purposes. The
    problem statement underscores the pressing challenges in water management, encompassing
    issues such as water scarcity, inefficient irrigation methods, and the need for
    real-time data to inform decision-making. To address these challenges, the study
    proposes an IoT-based Agricultural Water Management System (IoT-AWMS) that leverages
    sensors, real-time data analytics, and machine learning algorithms. This system
    is designed to optimize water utilization in agriculture. Simulations conducted
    within the study demonstrate a significant enhancement in water usage efficiency,
    resulting in reduced water wastage and increased crop yields. In conclusion, this
    research underscores the critical importance of the proposed IoT-based water management
    system for Saudi Arabia. It is positioned as a valuable tool for mitigating water
    scarcity challenges and promoting environmentally sustainable agricultural practices
    in the country. AUTHOR BIOGRAPHY Mohammed Baljon, Department of Computer Engineering,

    Preview 1. Introduction It’s very difficult for you to check out any sector of
    the economy without noticing the use of drones. Drones are employed in the agricultural
    industry for a wide range of duties, including spraying fertilizer, aerial surveillance,
    crop monitoring, land inspection, mapping, looking for damaged or rotting crops,
    and many others. The potential of different drone types in farming, agriculture,
    and gardening is being investigated. Drones like quad copters are the greatest
    option for crop fertilization because of their multi-rotor design. The massive
    construction of fixed-wing drones, which requires a large landing area, makes
    them impractical for agricultural fertilization. Some reports revealed that they
    expect the drone industry in the agricultural sector to grow from USD1.2 billion
    in 2019 to a whopping USD4.8 billion in 2024. All data obtained by the drones
    in farmlands is mostly used to make better agronomic decisions, which makes it
    part of the “precision agriculture” sector. Large-scale precision farming operations
    have become increasingly dependent on the usage of drones in a number of regions.
    Farmers may plan planting and treatment strategies to produce the best harvest
    possible using the information obtained from the drones'' recordings. According
    to some reports, using precision farming technologies has the potential to boost
    yields by up to 5%, which is a substantial increase in a market with narrow profit
    margins. One of the most popular uses of drones in agriculture is their swift
    movement to their desired locations. Drones with this skill can apply fertilizer
    and insecticides to crops to hydrate and provide them with the nutrients they
    need. Such additives can help crops thrive and stay healthy. To prevent worms,
    pests, and insects and prolong crop life, drone commanders have complete control
    over the drone spraying nutrients. Powerful drone capabilities help with the time-consuming
    procedure of evaluating the soil''s health. The character and health of the soil
    may be monitored, modified, and maintained using UAVs, which collect and analyze
    data from monitoring systems. The soil can benefit from drone technology by receiving
    the nutrients it needs to become healthier. Through data processing and 3D mapping,
    drones carry out the role of monitoring the condition of the soil. Agriculture
    is by definition a labor-intensive and time-consuming sector because it requires
    a high level of skill to do its tasks. Particularly seeding requires human labor
    because it is a lengthy procedure. To make this strenuous operation easier, drone
    technology is employed to sow the seeds of several crop species. They can quickly
    and efficiently plant seeds thanks to the drones'' built-in lasers, sensors, tanks,
    and other functions. Drones'' great ability to evaluate, diagnose, and survey
    crops for any deficiencies is another fantastic benefit of employing them to fertilize
    crops. Their laser-equipped sensors and high-resolution cameras help with the
    quick completion of a variety of activities. These defects are also mapped in
    real-time by unmanned aerial vehicles, and crop management decisions can be made
    using the data that is gathered and processed. In general, the time-consuming
    procedure of agricultural fertilization has been made easier thanks to drones
    and their applications. Farmers benefit immensely from their entrepreneurism and
    strong personalities for a variety of tasks and operations. The time-consuming
    procedure of agricultural fertilization in general has been made simpler by drones
    and their applications. Farmers benefit immensely from their strong will and entrepreneurial
    spirit in a wide range of tasks and operations. For one thing, drones are excellent
    for monitoring and sensing methods since they can swiftly cover a region to examine
    crop development and soil health. The majority of drones are utilized for this
    because their sensors can identify the absorbance of a particular wavelength,
    producing a color contrast image that clearly depicts potentially problematic
    areas. Ranchers have used drones to track cattle on ranches and inspect fences
    for damage, proving that this monitoring capability does more than just enable
    quick processing of spatiotemporal data. To further monitor livestock, rangers
    have also used night cameras and thermal imagers to find any animals disrupting
    or attacking herds. Continue Reading References Follow Reference Abdullahi, H.

    IEEE Conference Location: Tashkent, Uzbekistan SECTION I. Introduction In recent
    years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a transformative technology,
    revolutionizing various industries with its ability to connect and automate devices.
    One sector that stands to benefit significantly from IoT implementation is agriculture
    [1]. By integrating IoT into agricultural practices, farmers can gain real-time
    insights, optimize resource allocation, and enhance productivity while ensuring
    sustainability [2]. Smart agriculture management involves the integration of advanced
    technologies and data-driven solutions to streamline farming operations. An integrated
    IoT system plays a pivotal role in achieving these objectives by enabling the
    seamless connection and communication between sensors, devices, and agricultural
    equipment [3] This comprehensive system harnesses the power of IoT, cloud computing,
    data analytics, and machine learning to create a holistic approach to agriculture.
    At its core, an integrated IoT system for smart agriculture management comprises
    a network of sensors strategically deployed throughout the farming landscape [4].
    Sensors collect various environmental data points such as soil moisture levels,
    temperature, humidity, light intensity, and even atmospheric conditions. Through
    the connectivity provided by IoT, this data is transmitted in real-time to a centralized
    cloud platform. The cloud platform acts as a central hub where the collected data
    is stored, processed, and analyzed. Advanced analytics algorithms and machine
    learning models process the data to extract valuable insights and action- able
    recommendations for farmers [4] These insights can range from optimal irrigation
    schedules and nutrient management to pest detection and disease prevention strategies
    [5]. The integration of IoT devices extends beyond environmental monitoring. It
    also includes the connectivity of agricultural machinery and equipment. For instance,
    IoT-enabled tractors, harvesters, and drones can be equipped with sensors and
    GPS technology to perform precise and automated tasks such as planting, spraying,
    and crop monitoring. By automating these processes, farmers can improve efficiency,
    reduce labor costs, and minimize environmental impact. Moreover, an integrated
    IoT system can enable farmers to remotely monitor and control their operations
    using mobile applications or web- based interfaces [3]. This allows farmers to
    access real-time data, receive alerts and notifications, and make informed decisions
    from anywhere at any time. Whether they are in the field or managing multiple
    farms, the power of IoT empowers farmers with greater control and flexibility
    in managing their agricultural practices [6]. Furthermore, the integration of
    IoT in agriculture goes beyond individual farms. It opens up opportunities for
    collaboration and knowledge sharing among farmers, agronomists, and researchers.
    By leveraging data from multiple sources, farmers can gain valuable insights into
    industry trends, best practices, and market demands. This collective intelligence
    fosters innovation and facilitates sustainable agricultural practices at a larger
    scale. In short, an integrated IoT system solution for smart agriculture management
    holds immense potential for revolutionizing the way we approach farming. By connecting
    devices, collecting data, and leveraging advanced analytics, farmers can optimize
    resource utilization, improve productivity, and ensure environmental sustainability.
    With continuous advancements in IoT technology, the future of agriculture looks
    promising, with smarter and more efficient farming practices that contribute to
    global food security. Fig. 1 shows some of major benefits of AgroIoT [7]. Fig.
    1: Advantages of IoT in Agriculture. Show All A. Background The integration of
    Internet of Things (IoT) technology in smart agriculture management has garnered
    significant attention from researchers and industry experts in recent years. The
    need to address challenges such as food security, resource scarcity, and environmental
    sustainability has driven the exploration of IoT -based solutions in the agricultural
    sector [8]. Numerous studies have highlighted the potential benefits of implementing
    an integrated IoT system in agriculture. For instance, research has demonstrated
    that IoT -enabled environmental monitoring can provide real-time data on crucial
    factors like soil moisture, temperature, and humidity. This data empowers farmers
    to make informed decisions regarding irrigation, fertilization, and pest control,
    leading to optimized resource utilization and improved crop yields [3]. Additionally,
    the integration of IoT devices with agricultural machinery and equipment has shown
    promise in streamlining farming operations. Studies have explored the use of IoT
    -enabled tractors, drones, and sensors to automate tasks such as seeding, spraying,
    and harvesting. By leveraging IoT technology, farmers can enhance efficiency,
    reduce labor costs, and minimize the use of agrochemicals, thus contributing to
    sustainable agricultural practices [7] Furthermore, researchers have investigated
    the potential of data analytics and machine learning algorithms in leveraging
    the vast amount of data collected by IoT sensors. By analyzing this data, valuable
    insights can be gained regarding crop health, disease detection, and yield prediction.
    These insights enable proactive decision-making and timely interventions, helping
    farmers mitigate risks and optimize production. Collaborative research efforts
    have also focused on the scalability and interoperability of IoT systems in agriculture.
    The integration of multiple farms, agricultural institutions, and stakeholders
    through IoT networks facilitates knowledge sharing, best practices dissemination,
    and the development of industry-wide standards [1], [9], [10]. Such collaborations
    promote innovation and foster the development of sustainable farming practices
    on a broader scale. However, despite the promising potential of integrated IoT
    systems for smart agriculture management, there are still challenges to address.
    Issues related to data privacy and security, standardization, and the high initial
    investment costs of IoT infrastructure require further research and development.
    In conclusion, the research background on integrated IoT system solutions for
    smart agriculture management showcases the growing interest in leveraging IoT
    technology to transform traditional farming practices [11], [12]. Through environmental
    monitoring, automation, data analytics, and collaboration, IoT holds the promise
    of enhancing productivity, sustainability, and efficiency in agriculture. Further
    research and technological advancements are necessary to overcome challenges and
    fully unlock the potential of IoT in the agricultural sector. SECTION II. Litrature
    Review The implementation of an integrated IoT system for smart agriculture management
    requires a well-defined methodology that encompasses various stages of deployment
    and operation. The following paragraphs outline the key steps involved in the
    methodology. The first step in the methodology involves identifying the specific
    needs and objectives of the farm or agricultural operation. This includes understanding
    the key challenges faced by the farmers, such as water management, crop health
    monitoring, or pest control. By clearly defining the goals, the subsequent steps
    can be tailored to address the specific requirements of the farm [1]. In [10],
    a comprehensive analysis of the farm''s infrastructure and environment is conducted.
    This involves identifying the areas where IoT sensors and devices can be strategically
    deployed. Factors such as soil type, topography, and crop types are considered
    to determine the optimal sensor placement for data collection. Additionally, the
    integration of IoT -enabled machinery and equipment is evaluated to automate farming
    operations. Once the sensor and device placement is determined, the next step
    involves selecting the appropriate IoT hardware and connectivity solutions. This
    includes choosing sensors for measuring environmental parameters such as temperature,
    humidity, soil moisture, and light intensity. The selection of IoT gateways or
    hubs, communication protocols, and network connectivity options (e.g., cellular,
    Wi-Fi, LoRa Wan) are also important considerations. After the hardware selection,
    the IoT system''s deployment phase begins. This involves installing the sensors
    and devices in the designated locations across the farm. Careful calibration and
    testing of the IoT infrastructure are conducted to ensure accurate data collection
    and reliable connectivity. The integration of IoT -enabled machinery and equipment
    also takes place during this phase. Once the IoT system is deployed and operational,
    the focus shifts to data management and analytics. The collected sensor data is
    transmitted to a centralized cloud platform, where it is stored securely and processed
    in real-time. Data analytics techniques, including statistical analysis and machine
    learning algorithms, are applied to derive meaningful insights from the collected
    data. These insights can be related to irrigation scheduling, crop health monitoring,
    disease detection, and other relevant factors [6]. The final step in the methodology
    involves the utilization of the generated insights to make informed decisions
    and take necessary actions. Farmers and agricultural professionals can access
    the cloud-based platform through user- friendly interfaces, enabling them to monitor
    the farm''s performance, receive alerts and notifications, and access actionable
    recommendations. This allows for proactive management of the farm, optimizing
    resource allocation, and enhancing productivity. Throughout the entire process,
    continuous monitoring and maintenance of the IoT system are essential. Regular
    checks are conducted to ensure the proper functioning of sensors, connectivity,
    and data transmission. Firmware updates, security patches, and system upgrades
    are performed to keep the IoT infrastructure up to date and protected against
    potential vulnerabilities [5]. to summarize, the methodology for implementing
    an integrated IoT system for smart agriculture management involves identifying
    needs, analyzing the farm''s infrastructure, selecting appropriate IoT hardware,
    deploying the system, managing and analyzing data, and utilizing insights for
    decision-making. Continuous monitoring and maintenance ensure the system''s reliability
    and effectiveness in optimizing farming practices. SECTION III. Proposed Architecture
    The proposed architecture of an integrated IoT system solution for smart agriculture
    management comprises several interconnected components that work together to enable
    efficient data collection, processing, and decision-making. The following paragraph
    provides an overview of the key elements of the architecture. At the core of the
    architecture is the network of IoT sensors strategically deployed across the farm.
    These sensors, such as soil moisture sensors, temperature sensors, and humidity
    sensors, continuously collect environmental data relevant to farming operations.
    The sensors are equipped with wireless communication capabilities to transmit
    the collected data to a central hub or gateway. The central hub serves as a data
    aggregation point and communication interface between the sensors and the cloud-based
    platform. It collects the data from the sensors and performs initial processing,
    such as data filtering and data normalization. The hub also ensures reliable connectivity
    and secure transmission of the data to the cloud platform. The cloud-based platform

    Germany SECTION I. Introduction The importance of agriculture in sustaining economies
    and feeding the global population is well-established [1], [2]. In countries like
    India, where agriculture is the backbone, ensuring efficient water management
    is crucial for enhancing crop yield and conserving water resources. Smart irrigation
    systems have emerged as a promising solution to address water scarcity challenges
    and optimize irrigation practices [3], [4]. IoT-based smart irrigation systems
    leverage the power of interconnected devices and sensors to collect real-time
    data from the agricultural environment. These systems monitor factors like soil
    moisture, temperature, humidity, and weather conditions, providing valuable insights
    for precise irrigation management. Researchers have emphasized the importance
    of IoT in agriculture, as it enables remote monitoring, automation, and data-driven
    decision-making, thereby reducing water wastage and improving water-use efficiency
    [5]–[6]. Several studies have demonstrated the positive impact of smart irrigation
    systems on crop yield. By maintaining optimal soil moisture levels and delivering
    water precisely when needed, these systems prevent water stress and promote healthy
    plant growth. This better water-use efficiency translates into greater agricultural
    productivity and output. Furthermore, the ability to remotely control and monitor
    the irrigation process provides farmers with vital information that allows them
    to make timely and educated decisions. [7], [8]. A prominent machine learning
    approach, the KNN algorithm, has found popularity in a variety of applications,
    including smart irrigation. KNN is a non-parametric classification technique that
    is appropriate for real-time decision-making in smart irrigation systems. By comparing
    the current sensor readings with historical data, the KNN algorithm classifies
    the irrigation needs as “Dry” or “Wet,” guiding the pump operation accordingly.
    Several researchers have found the KNN algorithm to be effective in precise irrigation
    control and water conservation [9], [10]. The integration of IoT and the KNN algorithm
    in smart irrigation systems has garnered attention due to its potential in addressing
    water management challenges. IoT devices provide continuous data streams to the
    KNN model, enabling dynamic decision-making based on real-time environmental conditions.
    Studies have shown that this integration improves irrigation accuracy, reduces
    human intervention, and optimizes water usage, ultimately leading to enhanced
    crop yield [11]–[13]. Rice is a major crop in India, and its successful cultivation
    heavily depends on proper irrigation practices. Over-irrigation or under-irrigation
    can significantly impact rice yields. Implementing smart irrigation systems, especially
    for rice cultivation, has been explored as a solution to address water scarcity,
    boost water-use efficiency, and enhance rice productivity [14]–[16]. Research
    in this context emphasizes the role of IoT-based smart irrigation systems, coupled
    with the KNN algorithm, in achieving sustainable rice production. The field of
    smart irrigation is rapidly evolving with advancements in technology. Studies
    have discussed the incorporation of data analytics, cloud computing, and artificial
    intelligence (AI) to further enhance irrigation efficiency. AI-based algorithms
    like Deep Learning and Neural Networks are being explored to improve prediction
    accuracy and optimize irrigation schedules. Additionally, researchers are investigating
    the integration of satellite data and IoT networks to monitor large-scale agricultural
    areas. This research focuses on the development and implementation of an IoT-based
    remote-operated smart irrigation system aimed at enhancing crop yield, particularly
    for rice cultivation in India. The system integrates a microcontroller, temperature
    and moisture sensors, and employs the K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) algorithm for
    real-time decision-making. The sensors collect data on environmental conditions,
    which is processed by the KNN algorithm to classify irrigation needs as “Dry”
    or “Wet. ” Based on the classification, the system activates or deactivates the
    pump to provide precise irrigation, preventing over-irrigation and conserving
    water resources. The smart system also facilitates user interaction for manual
    control, allowing farmers to intervene as needed. By optimizing water usage and
    improving irrigation accuracy, this research holds promise for sustainable agriculture
    and crop yield enhancement in regions like India, where water management is critical
    for agricultural productivity. SECTION II. Methodology Appropriate irrigation
    is essential for rice farming, and smart irrigation is a new discovery that solves
    over- and under-irrigation difficulties. An Arduino microcontroller, temperature
    and moisture sensors, a power supply, a Raspberry Pi, and 4G connectivity capabilities
    are all part of the system. The sensors collect data on the temperature and moisture
    content of the agricultural area and send it to the microcontroller. The Raspberry
    Pi communicates information from the Arduino to the user through cloud storage
    and 4G WiFi connection. Figure 1 depicts the operation of the suggested system.
    The following is a step-by-step description of each component and the system''s
    operation: The Arduino microcontroller acts as the smart irrigation system''s
    primary processing unit. It is in charge of collecting data from temperature and
    moisture sensors and making irrigation choices based on that data. For efficient
    irrigation, the Arduino is programmed with algorithms that analyze sensor signals
    and compare them to specified set point values. The Arduino operates the motor
    to start the pump and provide water to the crops when the temperature and moisture
    content above the specified point value, signaling the need for irrigation. Fig.
    1. Methodology of the proposed research Show All Temperature and moisture sensors
    are strategically located across the agricultural area and are critical to the
    system''s performance. The temperature sensor detects the outside temperature,
    while the moisture sensor checks the moisture level of the soil. These sensors
    give real-time data, which is critical for precisely estimating rice crop water
    needs. Sensor data is sent to the Arduino microcontroller for processing and decision-making.
    A dependable power supply is required to keep the smart irrigation system running.
    Depending on the location and availability of power, several choices such as mains
    electricity or renewable sources such as solar panels with battery storage may
    be utilized to power system components. The power supply ensures that the Arduino,
    sensors, and motor pump remain operational at all times. The Raspberry Pi acts
    as the gateway for remote control and monitoring of the smart irrigation system.
    It makes it easier for the Arduino microcontroller and the user to interact. Sensor
    readings and system status are sent to the Raspberry Pi by the Arduino. This data
    is then communicated to the user via the Raspberry Pi through cloud storage and
    4G Wi-Fi networking, allowing farmers to get real-time information on the agricultural
    area and irrigation operations from anywhere. The use of 4G connectivity enables
    the smooth and rapid transfer of data between the smart irrigation system and
    the user. The Arduino and Raspberry Pi both include 4G modules that allow them
    to send and receive data through cellular networks. This ensures that the user
    receives timely performance information from the system and that irrigation operations
    may be handled remotely via the cloud-based interface. The suggested system operates
    as follows: Temperature and moisture sensors gather data from the agricultural
    area in real time, detecting ambient temperature and soil moisture content. The
    sensor data is received by the Arduino microcontroller and processed using established
    algorithms. It compares sensor data to temperature and moisture set point values
    to predict watering needs. The Arduino determines whether or not irrigation is
    required based on data analysis. If the temperature and moisture levels reach
    the predetermined point, signaling a need for water, the Arduino activates the
    motor. The motor is turned on, and the pump begins to transport water to the rice
    fields. The quantity of water provided is adjusted to avoid over-irrigation and
    preserve water resources while still ensuring crops get the necessary amount.
    The Raspberry Pi allows the smart irrigation system and the user to communicate.
    It transmits real-time data to the user, such as sensor readings and system status,
    through cloud storage and 4G connection. This information may be accessed remotely
    by the user, enabling for more effective monitoring of the agricultural area and
    irrigation operations. The user may also manually control the functioning of the
    motor pump through communication with the Raspberry Pi. Farmers may use this capability
    to adapt irrigation schedules depending on unique demands or unforeseen changes
    in weather conditions A. Control Architecture of the Proposed System In this research,
    the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is employed as an analytical tool to process
    and interpret the sensor readings, subsequently driving the necessary actions
    for the smart irrigation system. Figure 2 depicts the functioning of the proposed
    model. At the outset, the user provides the set point value as input to the system.
    In real-time, the system collects a set of input data from the temperature and
    moisture sensors and communicates it to the KNN-based machine learning (ML) model.
    The KNN model is then trained on the historical sensor readings, effectively classifying
    and processing the incoming real-time input data. Based on the processed input
    readings, the model takes decisions on irrigation needs and activates the pump
    when the measured values fall below the set point. Moreover, to avoid excessive
    irrigation, the ML model can intelligently stop further action once sufficient
    sensor readings have been obtained, ensuring precise and efficient water management.
    Fig. 2. Construction of the proposed system Show All The data created by the system
    is safely kept in the cloud, allowing the user to access it from any remote location.
    Users may monitor sensor readings, irrigation operations, and overall system condition,
    providing them with important insights into their crops and water resources. Furthermore,
    customers may remotely manage the irrigation process by halting or resuming the
    pump based on real-time data. When the system receives a command from the user,
    it sends the instructions to the KNN-based ML model, which instantly responds
    with the relevant actions. The bidirectional connectivity allows for smooth interaction
    between the user and the smart irrigation system, which improves user convenience
    and ensures effective irrigation management. To better illustrate the functionality
    of the KNN-based ML model, Figure 3 presents the working flow diagram. The model
    first receives the set point value and continuously acquires real-time sensor
    readings from the agricultural area. These readings are processed by the KNN algorithm,
    which compares them to the historical dataset. Based on similarity measures, the
    model classifies the current sensor readings and determines the irrigation needs.
    If the values fall below the set point, indicating the requirement for irrigation,
    the ML model triggers the activation of the pump. Throughout this process, the
    ML model maintains communication with the user interface and cloud storage, allowing
    users to access data and monitor the system''s performance remotely. Furthermore,
    the model is designed to adapt and optimize its decision-making based on the most
    recent data. Once the desired sensor readings are achieved, the ML model intelligently
    stops Fig. 3. Flow diagram of the proposed system Show All further irrigation,
    ensuring resource conservation and preventing over-irrigation. By utilizing the
    KNN algorithm in the smart irrigation system, the research aims to improve water
    management, enhance crop yield, and support sustainable agricultural practices.
    The model''s capability to learn from historical data and provide real-time decision-making
    contributes significantly to water conservation efforts and efficient irrigation
    practices, especially for rice cultivation in India, where precise irrigation
    is vital for optimal growth and productivity. SECTION III. Result and Discussion
    The laboratory setup for the proposed methodology is depicted in Figure 4, where
    the set point for temperature and moisture is configured to 25 degrees Celsius
    and 70%, respectively. The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is implemented
    to analyze the sensor readings and make decisions regarding the irrigation process.
    When the sensor readings fall below the set point, indicating the need for irrigation,
    the KNN model displays a message stating “dry” and activates the pump until the
    set point values are reached. Conversely, if the sensor readings indicate that
    the soil moisture level is higher than the set point, the KNN model displays a
    message indicating “wet” and stops the pump to prevent over-irrigation. Moreover,
    the system allows user interference to operate the pump physically if needed.
    Fig. 4. Flow diagram of the proposed system Show All The sensor readings were
    continually monitored during the tests, and the data was analysed by the KNN model
    to determine irrigation decisions. When the sensor readings fell below the set
    point, indicating that the soil was dry, the KNN model showed the message “Dry”
    and actuated the pump to supply water to the crops. The pump kept running until
    the sensor readings reached the intended set point, ensuring that the crops received
    the moisture they needed for optimum development. If the sensor readings exceeded
    the set point, indicating moist soil conditions, the KNN model showed the message
    “Soil is wet” and immediately stopped the pump to prevent over-irrigation. The
    laboratory studies confirmed the KNN algorithm''s ability in properly identifying
    sensor signals and making real-time irrigation choices. The model could efficiently
    discriminate between dry and wet soil conditions by utilising the historical information
    and the KNN''s capacity to calculate similarity metrics, ensuring accurate management
    of the irrigation process. This skill is critical for optimising water consumption
    and saving important resources, particularly in areas where water shortage is
    a major problem, such as India. The ability of the system to run the pump in response
    to the classification findings of the KNN resulted in effective water management.
    When the soil moisture fell below the set point, the pump was triggered immediately,
    giving the crops with the necessary water and preventing water stress. Controlled
    irrigation not only increased agricultural productivity but also helped to conserve
    water by limiting over-irrigation. When the KNN model recognised wet soil conditions,
    the pump was immediately turned off, saving water waste and potential crop damage
    from excess moisture. Furthermore, the user''s ability to manually run the pump
    when necessary added flexibility to irrigation operations management. Users might
    make changes based on crop requirements, weather circumstances, or other unanticipated
    changes in the field. This interactive component improved the system''s flexibility
    by allowing farmers to fine-tune irrigation practises based on their knowledge
    and observations. In terms of the system''s performance, the laboratory setup
    showed reliable and accurate decision-making by the KNN model. The classification
    messages displayed by the model aligned well with the actual soil conditions,
    demonstrating the model''s capability to assess the sensor readings effectively.
    The quick response time of the system, combined with the remote control and monitoring
    features, empowered users with real-time information and enhanced convenience
    in managing the irrigation process. The table I and figure 5 presents 10 readings
    from the sensor deployed in an agricultural area, measuring temperature and moisture
    levels. The “Temperature (°C)” column represents the temperature readings in degrees
    Celsius, while the “Moisture (%)” column indicates the corresponding moisture
    levels as a percentage. These readings are obtained in real-time, reflecting the
    dynamic environmental conditions of the agricultural field. The “KNN Decision”
    column represents the options made by the K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) algorithm
    based on sensor data. The KNN algorithm divides each set of sensor readings into
    two categories: “Dry” and “Wet.” When the KNN algorithm determines that the soil
    moisture is below the desired set point, the measurement is labelled “Dry,” suggesting
    that irrigation is required to provide enough water to the crops. When the soil
    moisture level surpasses a certain threshold, the KNN algorithm classifies the
    signal as “Wet,” meaning that the soil is adequately moist and that watering is
    not required. The “Pump Operation” column displays the results of the KNN algorithm''s
    choices, including whether the pump is enabled or deactivated. The pump is turned
    on (“ON”) to irrigate the crops and maintain the proper soil moisture levels when
    the KNN algorithm determines that irrigation is required because the sensor readings
    are “Dry,” suggesting that irrigation is required. The KNN algorithm turns the
    pump off (“OFF”) to prevent over-watering and conserving water when it deems that
    the sensor data is “Wet,” indicating sufficient soil moisture. Fig. 5. Sensor
    readings Show All Table I. Sensor reading and the response The development of
    an IoT-based remote-operated smart irrigation system that employs the KNN algorithm
    for decision-making might be one solution to the problem of efficient water management
    in agriculture. By combining sensors, microcontrollers, and machine learning,
    the system provides real-time monitoring and automation of irrigation operations.
    Because the KNN algorithm classifies sensor signals more accurately, the pump
    may be regulated precisely, avoiding over-irrigation and conserving water. The
    system''s adaptability is increased by the user''s remote access and manual control
    functions, making it a helpful tool for farmers. This breakthrough provides the
    path for sustainable agriculture in economically crucial nations like India. Conclusion
    Finally, research on a KNN-based IoT-based remote-operated smart irrigation system
    offers a substantial improvement in precision agriculture. The creation of an
    effective and automated irrigation system has emerged from the employment of sensors,
    microcontrollers, and machine learning algorithms. The KNN algorithm''s ability
    to reliably detect sensor data has proven useful in calculating irrigation demands,
    resulting in better water management and increased agricultural yield. Because
    of the system''s user-friendly interface and remote control capabilities, farmers
    have better flexibility and control over irrigation operations, allowing them
    to adjust irrigation operations to changing environmental conditions and crop
    needs. This smart irrigation system offers significant promise as a long-term
    solution for safeguarding water resources, reducing water shortage issues, and
    increasing agricultural production, particularly in countries like India, where
    agriculture is still the backbone of the economy. This technology, with additional
    research and application, has the potential to revolutionise agricultural practises
    and contribute to a more sustainable and food-secure future. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT We

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Sonbhadra, India SECTION I. Introduction
    With 54% of its total area under cultivation, India is the second-largest agrarian
    economy in the world. Industrial agriculture employs 60% of the population and
    accounts for 18% of India''s GDP. The practice of cultivating primarily for one''s
    own consumption is known as subsistence farming. A significant future for our
    society lies in agriculture. Because there is a serious issue with water conservation.
    The adoption of the smart irrigation system [20] contributes to national development
    and high-water consumption. Uttar Pradesh is thetop farming state in India out
    of all the states. The smart irrigation system assists in anticipating the soil
    moisture and lowering costs because farming is done in accordance with the climate
    and soil fertility. Because plants require adequate amounts of minerals, we must
    ensure that there is a sufficient supply of water for both planting and harvesting.
    Water management is a crucial component of dailylife. The benefit of the intelligent
    irrigation system is that itcan provide water to crops during the summer and in
    timesof scarcity. The soil''s moisture content, humidity, and temperature are
    predicted by a machine learning system. The model provides accuracy and the ideal
    window of time for crop production. The system calculates the interval between
    waterings of the plant based on the irrigation schedule. Farmers encounter numerous
    challenges when producing crops since they are unable to predict the weather.
    Artificial intelligence (AI)[28] and machine learning algorithms help determine
    soil condition as well as monitoring temperature and humidity. The implementation
    of smart irrigation systems [14] with the aid of machine learning algorithms and
    artificial intelligence can reduce manual labour requirements and allocatethe
    farmers to focus on other crucial tasks. Farmers may save time and labour by automating
    these operations with smart irrigation systems, freeing them up to concentrate
    on other important chores like crop management, harvesting, and marketing. Also,
    it can lower the price of manual labour related expenses like salary and benefits
    while increasing productivity. Also, data-driven decisions based on the study
    of numerous characteristics including soil moisture, humidity, and temperature
    can be made by farmers with the use of smart irrigation systems. These devices
    can assist farmers in streamlining theirirrigation plans and increasing crop yields
    by giving precise information on crop water requirements and the ideal time to
    water plants. A system using artificial intelligence (AI) [15] can include economic
    and commercial considerations, such as the demand for specific crops, price, and
    other resources. Generally speaking, the use of intelligent irrigation systems
    can greatly increase the productivity and efficiency of agricultural operationswhile
    lowering the needs. Al can assist farmers in selecting the best crops to grow,
    when to plant them, and how to manage them for the highest yield and profits.
    An AI -based smart irrigation system''s goal is to maximize water use in agriculture
    by calculating theprecise volume of water needed for crops to develop to their
    full potential using real- time data and predictive analytics. The system''s primary
    goal is accomplished through the integration of multiple technologies, including
    sensors, weather stations, and MLA,[11] which allow the system to gather and analyse
    information on crop water requirements and soil moisture levels. This model''s
    ultimate objective is to improve crop yields, decrease water waste, encourage
    sustainable agricultural practices, as well as to help farmers save time and money.
    This paper discussed crop yield prediction and water saving. A significant amount
    of water is needed for agriculture. The management of water could become problematic
    in the future. Using a smart irrigation system with artificial intelligence and
    machine learning algorithms, this is facilitating sustainable, lucrative agricultural
    production SECTION II. Literature Survey Here are some previous publications that
    are related to this project. [1] The KNN algorithm is used in this paper to predict
    soil condition, water level, and humidity, temperature. To overcome the issue
    that K means and SVM had created, it used KNN. KNN used to minimize cost of water
    and provide accurate data. The author [2] employed three methodologies in this
    study: time-series analysis, neural networks, and regression. This regression
    tells the relationship between two qualitative variables, which helps predict
    the outcome. The goal of this projectis to forecast rainfall in order to design
    an effective and smart irrigation system. The time series analysis used to sequencethe
    data which comes in specific time interval. The artificially [19] created neural
    network guides this model in computationand functioning in the manner that the
    brain of humans does. The decision should be made by the model [3] of this research
    based on climatic and environmental changes. It employs the Gradient Boosting
    Regression Tree (GBRT) inconjunction with the internet of things. This model''s
    data is not pre-prepared, and it learns how to irrigate all different types of
    plants very well. The dataset [26] contains information about moisture in the
    soil, temperature, and humidity, that may be utilized to predict proper plant
    watering. When irrigation hasbeen done by hand or instantly, the performance is
    documented and archived in a database. The paper proposes [4] preserving water
    resources by properly scheduling irrigation. This information is gathered by a
    wireless sensor network (WSN). The methodology is broken down into four stages.
    First, the dataset was created andclassifies which lands includes water and which
    even have water. The second phase eliminates unwanted data that does not incorporate
    training stage, leaving only valuable data from thedataset. Third, the data is
    trained with five machine learning algorithms that used Python programming to
    determine which one offers greatest accuracy. The fourth phase, known as the final
    phase, includes testing the algorithm that has been chosenin the third phase and
    predicts the reliability of the suggested model. In comparison to other machine
    learning algorithms, random forest provides the highest accuracy. This model is
    based [5] on real-time information that may be gathered in the field just using
    IOT base sensors. It developed a microcontroller [24] that enables us to operate
    the irrigation system remotely, removing the need for manual watering. It facilitates
    in forecasting the best crop for the land where itwas grown by monitoring the
    PH level of the soil along with other parameters. The water motor and solenoid
    are governed by a mobile app that makes use of a WIFI module. The datais stored
    in the IOT database server to predict the ideal crop production. In this research
    article, [6] it suggests a smart irrigation system that makes use of IoT sensors
    to alleviate the issues with wireless connectivity that many metropolitan areas
    encounter. The solution is meant to overcome the communicationhurdles and generate
    a robust internet grid that can support effective data flow. In order to do this,
    it used the Lora WAN architecture, which allows for long-distance communication
    and allows the system to cover a huge area. The smart irrigation system is made
    up of a number of sensors thatkeep an eye on the irrigation process and collect
    critical information about factors like the weather, humidity, and [23] soil moisture.
    Technology called LoRa WAN is widely used. The right greenhouse solution is provided
    by the (WSN). The Reacher suggested the approach based on multiple phases. These
    phases as data gathering in a one-year period, datais collected by removing it
    from sensor nodes and gathering it hourly for 20 days. The weather information
    includes thesea level, temperature, and humidity. 480 samples total were collected
    from prior measurements of temperature. A machine learning technique [13] called
    LS-SVM solves SVM problems using a linear equation approach. There are two stages
    in the model classification process: sigma and RBF. The combination of parameters
    allows this algorithm to carry out different categorization tasks. To execute
    a specific task, the model uses the WDO algorithm, which leads to the invention
    of novel regression schemes known as WDO-LS-SVM. The alpha, constant, RT coefficient,
    and Coriolis efficiency make up the coefficient parameter. The size, problem dimension,
    and band of the search space are the approach parameters. The search space has
    a size of 100 and a rangeof 0.00l to 10000. Based on the parameters of the regression
    model, the LS-SVM model is trained and tested, and the datais predicting accordingly.
    Naive Bayes [7] is a prominent supervised learning algorithm used to predict the
    best crops for beginning farmers based on various critical characteristics such
    as temperature, humidity, and soil moisture. The information gathered for this
    algorithm is crucial for ensuring the sustainable development of crops. Mobile
    technology has made the process more sophisticated by enabling users to input
    variables like location and temperature through their Android phones, which aids
    in more precise process prediction. The Naive Bayes algorithm uses a classification
    model to improve the efficiency and accuracy of crop and production prediction.
    Consolidation and decision-making are two of the key processes[27] in this process,
    which aid in choosing the optimum crop [22] for a specific farmer based on the
    available information. 30% of the data is utilized for testing with the library,
    while the remaining 70% is used to train the model. With this procedure, the Nave
    Bayes algorithm''s[16] performance and the previously collected data are used
    to estimate the soil moisture for the seed. This enables farmers to choose the
    crops they should plant with knowledge, assuring the greatest outcomes for theirfarming
    enterprise. Ultimately, for farmers and agriculturalistsaiming to maximize crop
    yields, the Nave Bayes algorithm isa great tool. The author proposed [8] efficiency
    and productivity of the agricultural sector have significantly increased thanks
    to the development of smart irrigation systems using Internet of Things (IoT)
    and machine learning techniques show in fig. 1 tab. One such system is based on
    labelled data and employs supervised machine learning algorithms to forecast the
    water needs of crops. The size and calibre of the dataset, which is taken from
    real-time data,[21] determine the model''s accuracy. The decision tree algorithm,
    which divides the parameters intosmaller subsets and applies the algorithm, is
    used to anticipatethe outcomes in a proper sequence. Starting at the root and
    validating each root node one at a time, the process determinesthe class label
    for the record. The suggested approach [9] seeks to optimize the irrigation process
    by leveraging Machine Learning (ML) techniques to anticipate the future soil moisture
    of the yield. The model makes use of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, which measure
    a variety of characteristics like humidity, temperature, soil moisture, pH level,
    and radiation. The ML algorithms use the real-time data [18] from the sensors
    to produce predictions. The best algorithm for predicting soil moisture levels
    is found to be GBRT. For comparison, the model also uses alternative ML methods
    including Multiple Linear Regression(MLR) and Random Forest Regression (RFR).
    The model''s goal is to reduce water consumption while assuring effective irrigation
    for the following farming seasons. The study offers two methods for forecasting
    soil moisture: 1) Forecasting soil temperature 2) Prediction of soil moisture
    taking into account soil temperature. The findings show that GBRT performs betterin
    predicting soil moisture levels than RFR and ENR, making it the best option for
    the irrigation process. Overall, this modeloffers a novel strategy for improving
    irrigation techniques and protecting water supplies. The goal of this study [10]
    is to use fewer energy and money while increasing crop output. For the current
    irrigation system, many machine learning algorithms are used. It presents the
    concerns face during cultivation and how to tacklethese issue utilizing artificial
    intelligence. IOT techniques [12] used for Effective result to streamlined water
    usage and yield production. Dataset classification and prediction have been completed.
    In irrigation facilities, aspects like precise estimate, effective resource management,
    and data rate are taken account. SECTION III. Proposed Methodology The suggested
    methodology demonstrates the potent super- vised machine learning technique, which
    depends on labelled data to produce accurate results. The results get more precise
    as the amount of data available for analysis increases. This approach includes
    analyzing [17] various data types that demonstrate various approaches to specific
    issues and tracking down the patterns that underlie them. Data training is theprocess
    of finding connections, trends, and patterns within the data that may be applied
    to forecasting outcomes. The process then moves on to testing the data, where
    a problem is already established and the most effective and appropriate response
    is found by using the solution pattern created during the training phase. In order
    to find the optimumsolution for the given problem, the algorithm uses the training
    patterns identified during the previous phase. Researchers and practitioners can
    produce accurate results with a high degree of confidence by using this supervised
    [25] machine learning methodology. Additionally, the algorithm''s accuracy can
    be improved further as it continues to learn from the labelled data, giving rise
    to ever-more-accurate resultsover time. This technique is widely applied in many
    different fields, such as speech recognition, computer vision, and naturallanguage
    processing, making it a useful and important tool for both researchers and practitioners.
    The amount of information being used has a significant impact on the accuracy
    and precision of data analysis. The more training data there is, the more accurate
    the model''s output will be in machine learning. The algorithm is used in this
    process as the input to train the data. The dataset is split into training and
    testing portions using this technique. The training phase seeks to classify the
    data by spotting trendsand connections in the dataset. On the other hand, the
    tested stage is where the trained model is applied to fresh data to forecast their
    results. Utilizing an effective classification algorithm during the learning phase
    is crucial for getting the best results. The decision tree algorithm is one such
    algorithm. When working with complicated and sizable datasets, this technique
    is very helpful because it aids in locating the most crucial aspects for decision-making.
    It functions by building a tree-like model of judgements based on dataset attributes,
    which results in a moreprecise and effective categorization. In conclusion, the
    quantity and calibre of training data directly relates to the accuracy and precision
    of machine learning models. The accuracy of the outcomes can be in-creased through
    the employment of an effective classification system, such as the decision tree
    algorithm. Data scientists andresearchers can provide trustworthy and perceptive
    outcomes by applying these methods, which promote innovation and advancement in
    a variety of sectors. Fig. 1. Flow of AI based smart irrigation system Show All
    A. Algorithm Decision trees can handle categorical and numerical data and can
    be utilized for both classification and regression problems. The decision tree
    method chooses a feature at each internal node that divides the data optimally
    depending on some criterion, such as information gain or Gini impurity. Decision
    trees have the benefit of being interpretable since people can envision and quickly
    comprehend the tree''s structure. The splitting procedure repeats itself until
    either a haltingrequirement is satisfied or all leaf nodes are pure. The classification
    process in decision trees uses if and else conditions to create a tree-like structure.
    The entire dataset is contained in tree with (‘S’) main root. It estimates the
    gain and entropy of the training data usingthe target value from the dataset.
    It separates the main root into useful data-filled subtrees to create the decision
    tree. This approach is continuing until the leaf roots of all unclassified nodes
    are reached and a new completed tree is created. SECTION IV. Result The technique
    can forecast the best crops for yield witha 90% accuracy, as shown in table 1,
    based on the sample dataset utilised in this study. For farmers, this can be a
    useful tool when deciding which crop to grow in order to maximise yields and earnings.
    The predicted amounts are plotted on the line graph in figure 2. The decision
    tree was able to createan acceptable crop yield prediction model using the suggested
    dataset. The decision tree is represented graphically in Figure 3. The starting
    place for the decision-making procedure is the root node of the decision tree,
    which separates the data intoa pair of subtrees based on a certain characteristic.
    The tree''s leaves display the final anticipated result. Following that, each
    node indicates a decision point depending on a specific quality.It''s important
    to keep in mind that the training data (X train and Y train) are used to fit the
    decision tree. Demonstrating that the model was altered to yield on this particular
    set of facts, accurate forecasts. In Figure 4 also has a bar graph. Fig. 2. Line
    graph of predicted values Show All Fig. 3. Decision tree Show All SECTION v. Conclusion
    The application of machine learning models to agriculture has the potential to
    completely alter how we raise crops and manage farmland, resulting in more productive
    and sustainablefarming methods. The technique discussed in this research assists
    farmers or anyone working in the agricultural sector with water management and
    conservation. Table I. Result using entropy By using the certain parameters, such
    as soil moisture sensors and temperature sensors, which produce data that is recorded
    in a database, it also supports farmers in predicting the right crop suitable
    for a certain yield. Hence, the decision tree applied algorithm trains the database-
    stored data and facilitates in predictions. By managing irrigation schedules,
    artificial intelligence can decrease water waste and boost agricultural productivity.
    By using artificial intelligence to find anomalies in the irrigation system, crop
    damage can be avoided and costs can be kept down. The demand for a particular
    crop and other commercial and economic aspects can be taken into account by AI
    systems. The paper''s model demonstrates a special fusion of artificial intelligence,
    machine learning algorithms, and the internet of things, and it serves as a potent
    tool for increasing agriculturalprofitability. Fig. 4. AI Based Bar Graph Show

    many different models: SVM, Simple Bayes, KNN, and Regression using logit. The
    outcomes showed that K-Nearest Neighbours outperformed other models (LR, SVM,
    NB) with a 98.6% identification rate and a 0.12 root mean square error (RMSE).
    In addition, we finally made available the online tool that combines the predictions
    made by our models with the different data released by the sensors for improved

    Conference Location: Vellore, India SECTION I. Introduction Precision farming,
    also called “agriculture 4.0,” is a form that analyses agriculture management,
    calculates, and reacts to changes in the same setting and additional environmental
    yields. The primary focus of the study of the research of agricultural industry
    4.0 is to develop a judgement support system to control the entire agricultural
    sector to maximise resource earnings and input conservation. The first steps towards
    Crop monitoring and remote sensing health sensors, agriculture 4.0 includes anticipating
    the pumping and the results of various fertilisers. Crop Monitoring and Management:
    Sensors, drones, and satellite imagery can monitor crops in real-time, collecting
    data on soil moisture, temperature, nutrient levels, and plant growth. This data
    can then be analysed to make informed decisions about irrigation, fertilisation,
    and pest management, optimising crop yield and reducing resource waste. The former
    expression was analysed to ascertain agricultural yields in the ag assiduity.
    The husbandry business blockchain includes seed force, marketing and distribution
    strategy, agrochemicals, agrarian tools, yield products, and beast husbandry.
    This agri- food structure includes actors in and organisations that affect the
    food and fibre force chain. Plans must be made for water., developed because it''s
    a limited and significant natural resource that''s also a necessity, it must be
    defended, managed, and most importantly, utilised wisely. Effective oversight
    of the Water coffers is needed at the ranch position because of increased demand
    and confined force. Crop yields must be enhanced in regions with limited water
    force to maximise agrarian productivity and satisfy the demands for unborn food
    products. To wash further land with the same quantum of water, the limited water
    force must be utilised effectively. Some academics have lately employed machine
    literacy and the Internet of Effects to handle An irrigation issue precisely.
    Ref [1] enforced an real-time irrigation control model to assess root zones with
    inadequate soil humidity(RZSMD). The authors[2] identified the data on the water
    balance to produce a direct time series model using a system. LSTM, or Deep Long
    Short-Term Memory, predicts soil humidity for lychees using successional processing
    over time. The authors introduced the estate in [3] as a medium to allow automatic
    irrigation decisions. The authors of [3] proposed timber (SIDSS) two models, including
    element least places regression (PLSR), and a straight retrogression model was
    created. This fashion enables the estimate of the irrigation conditions for a
    week. Although these models enable more precise irrigation control, their slice
    is fairly slow and defined to the area where they''re calibrated due to the use
    of data analysis ways. We seek to effectively manage intelligent, independent
    irrigation in this work by presenting a fashion to irrigation vaticination. In
    four-way, we moved forward Detector installation (Detectors for soil humidity,
    temperature, and rain) Detectors and accession system integration Using the knot-RED
    platform, aims to simplify monitoring, storing, and waking. And Several ways,
    including KNN, coadjutor vector machines, and logarithmic retrogression with naive
    Bayes are used to reuse the acquired data. The findings demonstrated that, with
    a decision-making rate of 98.6, the KNN algorithm outperformed the others. This
    tactic will be particularly salutary for large-scale irrigation systems or domestic
    operations. The tough task of soddening shops will be simplified, and water operations
    will be bettered. Then''s how the remainder of the paper will be presented The
    fine conception of husbandry4.0, artificial intelligence, and the result to treatment
    using a direct model all be covered in the alternate section. Finally, the database
    structure, methodology, findings, and ultimately a conclusion and outlook will
    all be presented in the third section. SECTION II. Related Work Smart agriculture,
    also known as precision agriculture or digital agriculture, involves using modern
    technologies to optimise and enhance agricultural processes. Here are some examples
    of smart agriculture applications: Livestock Monitoring: Sensors and wearables
    can be used to monitor the health and well-being of livestock, tracking parameters
    such as body temperature, heart rate, and location. This helps farmers detect
    early signs of illness or distress, allowing for timely intervention and reducing
    losses due to diseases or injuries. Precision Fertilisation: Soil and plant nutrient
    sensors can provide data on nutrient levels in the soil and plants, enabling farmers
    to apply fertilisers more precisely and efficiently. This minimises over-fertilisation,
    reduces nutrient runoff, and lowers costs while optimising crop nutrition. Automated
    Pest Management: Smart agriculture technologies can help monitor and manage pests
    and diseases in crops. For example, drones with cameras or sensors can detect
    early signs of pest infestations or diseases, allowing farmers to take prompt
    action and minimise crop losses. Supply Chain Management: Blockchain technology
    can improve transparency and traceability in the agricultural supply chain, ensuring
    that food products are produced, processed, and transported safely and sustainably.
    This helps improve food safety, quality, and consumer trust. Farm Automation:
    Automated machinery and robotics can be used for planting, harvesting, and packing,
    reducing labour costs and increasing operational efficiency. This can also help
    address labour shortages in agriculture, particularly in regions where labour
    is scarce or expensive. These are just a few examples of the many smart agriculture
    applications developed and adopted worldwide. Integrating modern technologies
    into agriculture can revolutionise farming practices, making them more efficient,
    sustainable, and productive. Traditional agriculture has played a significant
    role as the foundation for development in many parts of the world. Traditional
    agricultural practices have been the primary means societies have produced food,
    fed their populations, and sustained their livelihoods for thousands of years.
    In addition, traditional agriculture has been the backbone of rural economies,
    providing employment opportunities, generating income, and supporting local food
    systems. One of the key ways in which traditional agriculture has served as the
    foundation for development is through food security. Traditional agricultural
    practices, such as subsistence farming, have helped communities meet their basic
    food needs, ensuring they have enough to eat and sustain themselves. In addition,
    in many regions, traditional agricultural practices have allowed communities to
    adapt to local environmental conditions and sustainably produce food using local
    knowledge and resources. Traditional agriculture has also contributed to economic
    development. It has provided employment opportunities, particularly in rural areas
    where agriculture is a primary economic activity. Conventional agricultural practices
    often involve labour-intensive activities, such as planting, harvesting, and processing
    crops, which create jobs and generate income for farmers and their families. Additionally,
    traditional agriculture has often served as a source of raw materials for local
    industries, such as textiles, handicrafts, and food processing, contributing to
    economic growth and development. Furthermore, traditional agriculture has been
    vital in preserving cultural heritage and fostering social cohesion in many communities.
    Traditional agricultural practices are often deeply rooted in local customs, traditions,
    and knowledge systems, passed down through generations. This has helped to maintain
    cultural identities and promote social cohesion within communities, strengthening
    social bonds and preserving traditional ways of life. A. Husbandry 4.0 All types
    of husbandry fall under the marquee of “agrarian 4.0,” which pays further attention
    to every aspect of the food force chain, climatic conditions, irrigation ways,
    water operation, and crop recovery, to name a many. We''ll carry the numerous
    instruments to have agrarian4.0 or husbandry to guarantee this. [16], [17] Lately,
    the assiduity ecosystem has invested in the technological invention, fastening
    primarily cheaply and largely effective product conduct with expertise-grounded
    growth acquired throughout visualisation and data collection that has been fruitful
    in developing an IoT system grounded on In addition to an IoT system built on
    smart lighting, irrigation and water exercise have both saved 5.5 billion m3 yearly.
    B. Artificial Intelligence for Husbandry AI4AI is an acronym for Innovation in
    Agriculture Using Artificial Intelligence, another rule that''s beginning to benefit
    scholars'' confidence in the field. The use of machine literacy(ML), artificial
    intelligence(AI), and fleetly espoused in husbandry regarding ranch practises
    and agrarian affairs. [6], [7] Cognitive computing is fleetly arising as the husbandry
    services technology that''s utmost disruptive because it can learn, comprehend,
    and reply to varied conditions to increase delicacy. To deliver these services,
    presently, Microsoft is uniting with 175 growers in India''s Andhra Pradesh services
    for seedlings, land, toxin, and other advice. The average yield per hectare has
    formerly increased by 30 due to this action. C. Vector Support Outfit The Support
    Vector outfit(SVM), a supervised classifier, is described as a separation hyperplane
    in formal language. Table I. Comparison between machine learning models SVMs may
    produce a hyperplane that categorises lately attained unlabeled data using labelled
    training data. An educational where i=1,2,…, n, and set(yi; xi). xi R n. Multitudinous
    SVM types represent the target element and the itch vector have been developed
    to accommodate a variety of problem and, more significantly, types of situations
    of complexity. The ideal hyperplane produced by this study''s direct SVM has the
    following shape. f(x)=wT∗x+b (1) View Source where: yi(wT∗x+b)≥1−ξi;ξ≥0 ; or each
    i=1,2, … n Various kernels are compatible with SVM models straight, polynomial,
    and outspread premise capability, both sigmoid. The input data are restated into
    an advanced-dimensional point space, and The core operation is a point product
    of those points. D. Naive Bayes The probabilistic machine learning algorithm,
    Naive Bayes Naive Bayesian, is grounded on Thomas Bayes ‘ theorem(1702 - 1761).
    The probability that A will do if B has formerly passed can be used to illustrate
    this theorem. Considering that X = (xl, xn) In the Naive Bayes(NB) algorithm,
    the variable determining the class is the dependent variable. In contrast, the
    remaining features are independent variables (X) . NB considers that the features
    aren''t affected by one another, making it stand out from other algorithms. Although
    it seems straightforward, NB is an effective bracket tool with a good track record.
    The logistic function is used when the measured outgrowth can only be one of two
    options(similar as a yea or no answer). The formulaS represent this function is
    a variable that affects how wide the wind is and where its peak (when p(x) = 1/2)
    is located. Its formula is p(x)=1/(1e(x)/s) . E. K-Nearest Neighbors The K-Nearest
    Neighbors algorithm stores all cases and assesses new cases predicated on a similarity
    metric. When categorising a case with this system, it''s assigned to the class
    with the topmost number of near neighbours. This is determined by calculating
    the distances between the case and its k nearest neighbours, among the on-point
    remote capabilities. Then, one computes the Euclidean distance by taking the square
    root of the squared-discrepancies between corresponding rudiments in both vectors.
    The Manhattan distance is determined by adding up the absolute differences in
    corresponding rudiments in both vectors. Minkowski distance is computed by taking
    the qth root of the total of absolute differences in corresponding rudiments in
    both vectors; each raised to the power of q. Former studies on supervised machine
    literacy were compared. SECTION III. Discussions A. Proposed Method This document
    provides a detailed account of our process in creating the irrigation system.
    The entire process, as shown in Fig. 1, involved colourful stages. The first stage
    involved opting for the detectors demanded for the smart irrigation commencing
    with the soil humidity detector in the model. Weather Monitoring and Prediction:
    Weather stations and weather prediction models can provide farmers with accurate
    weather data, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and
    solar radiation. This information helps farmers plan planting, harvesting, and
    other farm operations more effectively, reducing weather-related risks and optimising
    resource use. To monitor soil humidity, temperature/ moisture, and rain, we connect
    detectors to an Arduino and then program the board to collect real-time data.
    We also ensure data storehouse in MongoDB via Node-Red and group months of data
    to train it for predicting when to start or stop pumping. [12] Fig. 1. Machine
    learning based irregation system Show All Fig. 2. Proposed model for intelligent
    irrigation system Show All Fig. 3. Sensor data processing with controller Show
    All B. Data Collection and Storehouse After that, we connected a system to the
    storehouse and supervision systems using the knot-RED platform, making producing
    connected objects easier. Then, we started to collect and visualise data from
    detectors with the same pretensions in mind as ahead. During this phase, our card
    must be integrated with the knot-Red terrain, a system must be erected around
    the detector data inflow, and each data set must be preprocessed. Mobile and Web
    Applications: Mobile and web applications can provide farmers with access to real-time
    data, remote monitoring and control, weather forecasts, market prices, and other
    information critical for making informed decisions. These applications can be
    accessed on smartphones, tablets, or computers, enabling farmers to manage their
    farms from anywhere, anytime. With the assistance of experts in husbandry, the
    data reused through Several algorithms were used and suitable to assemble multiple
    feathers of information, such as Information gathered by the detectors information
    on the rush, air and soil temperature, and moisture. Information attained using
    water pumps Pumping(On/ Off) data process when assembling and storing data is
    depicted in Fig. 3 The Arduinoknot communicates with our Arduino card and the
    knot-red garcon, preparing a knot This knot is utilised to facilitate data that
    detectors emit by virtue of broken up. Birth from the preparation of certain data
    knot is completed utilising bumps to soil moisture, wetness in the atmosphere,
    weather, and rain. A sequence of notifications can be sent through email using
    the Notify and Mail nodes, enabling efficient sensor monitoring. MongoDB nodes
    permit direct recording of sensor-generated info on MongoDB storage. Allows the
    use of local data nodes to store local information. Nuclei on a dashboard enable
    real-time data display Two storage strategies that both make use of the MongoDB
    solution have been suggested for our system: Local MongoDB: Data training for
    the forecasting models can be connected via Node-Red flow to a local MongoDB server.[5]
    The storage component transmits cloud storage for data via a Dedicated to application,
    the Python method enables data reception, real-time pumping prediction, and time-based
    actual environment visualisation. C. Dataset Data Analytics and Decision Support:
    Advanced data analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence (AI) can
    analyse large amounts of agricultural data, such as weather data, crop data, and
    market data, to provide farmers with valuable insights and decision support. This
    can help optimise farm operations, reduce risks, and improve profitability. We
    began using these devices in a variety of settings, with numerous home Vegetation
    used in the process of mass gathering in the inescapable lack of knowledge using
    Internet of Things (IoT) technologies[8], [9], which include a large number of
    autonomous sensors with self-organising capabilities, to distribute the data utilising
    a formula to build a crucial console for our system''s expansion, which was a
    virtually finished version of our dataset. At junction, we find the timestamping
    Inbound, digital, and data from centrally located sensors. Alongside this expansion,
    we discover: Information on soil moisture: The table below displays an analogue
    sensor''s data over the 0–1023 range. The average value is 371.5; the smallest
    value is 308.47 and the greatest value is 972.41. Data on temperature: Those facts,
    which are increasing in number crucial, were gathered using a temperature sensor
    that displays the current measurement in Celsius. As may be seen, the typical
    Throughout the months of collection, the average temperature was 23.34 C, with
    the minimum and highest values being 17 C and 40 C, respectively. Proof of what
    is expected. Data on air humidity: We were able to get information on air humidity
    using the same sensor that allowed us to collect temperature measurements, and
    the following analysis is done on these data: While gathering the enormous amount
    of data, the average is 67.40%, with the smallest value being 39% and the maximum
    value being 82.40%. We find the following output data in the race toward computerisation:
    We have suggested a peer-to-peer architecture that uses categorical data with
    a value of “0” to indicate that pumping must be halted. A value of “1” indicates
    that pumping must be activated. We have implemented aportion of the ultimate architecture
    to demonstrate that the feasibility is far from a generalised failure. SECTION
    IV. Results The graph illustrates a conceptual data manipulation that entails
    meticulous modelling of the findings attained to report on the dental plan and
    concretise it as a particular outcome. Because they are inductive in character,
    the predictions remain about this practice in many ways. Then, using empirical
    data, we found that peer-to-peer reviews regularly summarise the classification
    of two unique hues. On the other hand, peer-to-peer Green signifies class “1,”
    it relies on pumping heat vs impacted simultaneously by active, which is expressed
    in Table II. Massive data teach the model to exhibit the predefined plant sections.
    Table II. Sensor output vs processed output Table III. Machine learning model
    vs accuracy With rates of 98.6% in a training set and (RMSE) of 0.12, (95.0%/
    0,17), and (96.18%/ 0,19), respectively, the K-NN model beat Gaussian Naive Bayes,
    SVM, and logistic Regression with sequential result warehousing. The various experiments
    carried out to train the predictions are utilised in the next table''s framework
    (Table III). This is done to evaluate potential advantages and precisely pinpoint
    developing data. We choose to standardise the data first, then divide it into
    the training and test data to increase the applicability of our models. Compared
    to other models, Based on the findings, K-Nearest Neighbours had a recognition
    rate of 98.6%. To make it simpler to visualise and keep using a simple phone or
    laptop to keep track of the surroundings, all one of the roles carried out during
    this course was finally grouped into a web application. The database''s capacity
    is something we wish to boost by adding more data. Still, we also want to apply
    more algorithms-particularly semi-supervised learning-to make sure that our choices
    are accurate. SECTION V. Conclusions In summary, traditional agriculture has served
    as the global foundation for development by ensuring food security, generating
    income and employment opportunities, supporting local economies, preserving cultural
    heritage, and fostering social cohesion. While modern agricultural practices have
    also brought significant advancements, traditional agriculture is vital to many
    societies and plays a crucial role in sustainable development. Recognising and
    respecting the value of conventional agricultural practices while promoting innovation
    and sustainability in agriculture is essential. To increase productivity and satisfy
    the growing global food demand, intelligent irrigation is a crucial step, compared
    to other models, the findings revealed that using K -Nearest Neighbours had a
    98.6% acceptance rate. Finally, a website program was presented collectively,
    all of the functions performed during this course to simplify things to visualise
    and use a simple phone or laptop to monitor the surroundings. On the one hand,
    We need to expand the database''s capacity by adding more data, and on the Additionally,
    we aim to employ more algorithms, particularly semi-supervised learning, to guarantee.

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Sakheer, Bahrain SECTION I. Introduction
    Agriculture has always been the main supplier of food for society, being responsible
    for more than 74% [1] of the population daily consumption. In order to keep these
    production values and evolving them to meet the needs of the increasing population,
    water consumption has been the main concern. In this topic, resources to technological
    solutions have demonstrate to be the best bet to meet the needs. Regarding the
    issue of water consumption, its application continues to be mostly controlled
    by human means, leading many times to mismanagement, higher than necessary consumption
    and consequently to higher financial expenses and the waste of this natural resource.
    Technological solutions have been increasingly concerned with monitoring the fields
    in order to understand the best times for their harvest and controlling their
    values throughout the season. This fact makes possible a more in-depth research
    in order to predict the best water management heights, leading to less waste and
    an improvement in harvests. Thus, the main objective of this paper is to understand
    the possibility to predict, automatically, using machine learning solutions, the
    best time of day for irrigation, based on local sensor and weather data. So, and
    based on related work in the area of agricultural land monitoring, it is possible
    to make the correct analysis of which data are the most important to take into
    account when developing the algorithms [2]. The system already implemented by
    the authors in [2] will be the basis of the research for this paper. This system
    uses a wide range of sensors that are strategically spread over the agricultural
    fields in order to collect the data needed for correct monitoring. Then this data
    is sent, using Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), to a central server, where a database
    is hosted, in order to be able to store the data collected over long periods of
    time. This high number of data will allow the correct development and training
    of the algorithms to accomplish the proposed goal of this paper, understating
    which is the best machine learning algorithm to predict the ideal irrigation hours.
    According to the results obtained by the authors in [3], it is possible to reach
    savings up to 40% in water. These water saving results are obtained only through
    the study of formulas that calculate the amount of water that needs to be administered
    to the fields. So, the implementation of machine learning algorithms, as this
    paper will study, is in a good position to achieve even better savings results
    of this natural resource. This article presents a study of Machine Learning Classification
    algorithms where Random Forest (RF), Neural Networks (NN), XGBoost, Decision Trees
    (DT) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) will be studied. In addition, and in order
    to be able to study correctly the algorithms already mentioned, a dataset and
    a methodology were created in order to enable the correct study, leading to the
    best possible optimization. The whole process of creating the spoken dataset and
    the methodology followed will be explained later. Later will be presented the
    conclusions drawn from the study present in this paper. SECTION II. Related Work
    With the evolution of technology and the constant development of solutions in
    the area of the Internet of Things (IoT) in parallel with intelligent solutions
    produced in the area of artificial intelligence and machine learning, multiple
    solutions have already been developed with the aim of combining the two in order
    to obtain cheaper solutions and with the purpose of saving natural resources.
    In the study made in [4], the author developed a system that applies artificial
    neural network techniques \"for water level prediction, a fuzzy logic control
    algorithm for sluice gate setting period estimation, and hydraulics equations
    for sluice gate level adjusting\". As input for the pretended prediction, the
    author only gives to the algorithm a dataset with the last three days of water
    level, being this a small amount of data since the main goal is to reach the most
    exact prediction possible being the amount of data given as input a concern. Regarding
    to the study made by the author of [5], this article presents a study of machine
    learning applications in agricultural supply chains. Although the author have
    not developed any system or script, had conclude, through a heavy research that
    the most explored algorithms are neural Networks, being these the most used for
    agricultural solutions. In [6], the authors present, through the collection of
    land data using a WSN, a study where machine learning algorithms (SVM and RF)
    are applied in order to understand the irrigation needs of the land under study,
    with an accuracy in the order of 80%. Although the study developed in [6] has
    an intensive research on the level of collected data, and there has been an investment
    in the analysis of the values through formulas that allow the calculation of the
    necessary water values, with regard to the algorithms used, the whole Machine
    Learning solution was based on previous research on the algorithms and the development
    of the dataset. This may lead to a poor adaptation of the developed technology
    to the solution where it will be applied. SECTION III. Dataset & Data Pre-processing
    In order to develop the correct algorithm that can predict the best time of day
    for water administration, it is necessary to compose a correct and useful dataset.
    The dataset used, as said before, was created from a range of data previously
    collected through the implementation of the system studied in [2]. Furthermore,
    the data were complemented by values provided by the Portuguese sea and Atmosphere
    Institute (IPMA). This data contains a vast number of features, as can be seen
    in Table I. All entries were individually analyzed, and extra features were added
    to each one, making the dataset richer and more substantiated in order to facilitate
    the process of training the algorithms under study and achieving better results.
    Within these are the features \"Is_favorable\", which classifies the ground conditions
    at that specific time as favorable or unfavorable for sustainable irrigation,
    \"Need_Irrigation\" which indicates if irrigation is needed and \"Had_Irrigation\"
    where it is indicated if the land has already been watered. These values were
    calculated based on the sensor data collected. Finally each entry was manually
    classified with the best irrigation hour according to the real time sensor data,
    within the label \"Suggested_Hour\". After conclusion, the dataset used has 105217
    entries. TABLE I Dataset properties SECTION IV. Machine Learning Classification
    Algorithms Classification algorithms are the chosen ones to use in this study.
    Classification is the process of predicting decision values in the qualitative
    or category class of a given data point. Random Forest (RF) is a tree-based method
    that conglomerates several self-determining decision trees developed for classification
    and regression. Through the combination of the various trees it is able to understand
    which is the best option, being the main objective to reach one in pure i.e, a
    node formed by a single class, giving it high predictive capabilities [7]. Decision
    Trees (DT) are tree based methods in which each path begin in a root node representing
    a sequence of data divisions until reach a Boolean outcome at a leaf node. These
    methods can be applied for classification and regression. The final goal of this
    method is to reach a model that can predict the search value for that specific
    scenario by learning simple decision rules [8]. support Vector Machines (SVM)
    are a set of supervised learning methods developed for classification, regression
    and outlier''s detection which is known by his high effective in high dimension
    spaces and for its use for training points in the decision function, being also
    memory efficient [9]. For the study of Neural Networks algorithms, which are defined
    as computational models of nervous system, the Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) method
    was used, which is a super-vised learning method that learns a function f(.) :
    Rm → Ro by training on a data set, where m is the number of dimensions to input
    and o the number of dimensions for output. These MLP networks are characterized
    by being general-purpose, flexible and non-linear. Their complexity can be changed
    according to their application by varying the number of layers and units of each
    layer [10], [11]. Regarding XGBoost, this is a boosting tree based method which
    in turn are based on decision trees. Considering that the linear combination for
    multiple trees capabilities that can well fit the training data and describe the
    complex non linear relationship between input and output data, makes this method
    considered one of the best methods in statistical learning [12]. SECTION V. Methodology
    The methodology followed in the development and improvement of the algorithms
    previously described was divided into 4 phases. In a first phase the dataset was
    built, following the steps previously described. After the dataset was completed,
    all values were analyzed and each entry classified as favorable or unfavorable
    for water administration, whether or not it needs water, if the land has already
    been watered and the best hour to irrigate (\"Is_favorable\", \"Need_Irrigation\",
    \"Had_Irrigation\" and \"Suggested_Hour\" respectively). In a second phase, with
    the completed dataset, and before testing the various algorithms, a test was made
    on the importance of each feature of the dataset, allowing to understand which
    are the most important and which should not be considered at the time of training,
    in order to optimize the dataset and leading to the elimination of noise. Fig.
    1. Feature importance Show All As can be seen in Figure 1, the features \"Day\",
    \"Need_Irrigation\", ’’Month\", \"Total_Precipitation_Low\" and \"Had_Irrigation\"
    have a low importance for the training and later result of the algorithms, so
    they were discarded. This discarding also results in a shorter time in the training
    of the algorithms and no significant variation was observed in the results obtained
    after the discarding. The third phase of the methodology consisted in training
    the five algorithms under study using the parameters of each one with default
    values. In order to study and improve these algorithms, scikit-learn was used.
    This is an open source Machine Learning library developed for Python implementation
    [13]. For the implementation of XGBoost, a library made available by this same
    algorithm was used. It implements machine learning algorithms under the Gradient
    Boosting framework [14]. In this phase the goal is to understand which algorithms
    have better results using the dataset to predict the best irrigation time. In
    the fourth and last phase, the best algorithms from the previous phase were exhaustively
    tested in order to understand what would achieve better accuracy values. In these
    tests an hyperparametrization tuning was done to each algorithm, in order to understand
    the best scenario possible. For this, a method provided by scikit-learn called
    RandomizedSearchCV was used, which performs the fit and training of the algorithm
    under study, calculating which parameters are best suited to it [15]. The final
    algorithm is then adapted to be running on the central server of the system under
    test, where the database is hosted and where the values will be received in real
    time. Thus, the algorithm receives the collected values and calculates the best
    time for water administration. When crossing the resulting values of the algorithm
    developed with the algorithms previously spoken and already developed by [2] that
    calculate the amount needed to administer the terrain under analysis, it will
    lead to a better management an to higher water saving values, being this the main
    objective. Figure 2 shows the flowchart of the described methodology. Fig. 2.
    Methodology Flowchart Show All SECTION VI. Results & Discussions In order to put
    into practice the described methodology, it is necessary to precede the training
    and subsequent testing of the various algorithms under study to understand what
    best suits the intended application. To check if the algorithms have a good applicability
    when receiving real values, the dataset was divided in two parts. One with 70%
    of the dataset, that will be used to train the algorithm, and other with the remaining
    30%, will be used to test the accuracy of the trained models. Table II shows the
    default parameters used for each of algorithms. The accuracy results obtained
    for each model can be seen in Table III. As can be seen, the accuracy values of
    each algorithm trained were quite varied, which allowed to see which were best
    suited to the dataset and application under study. It is possible to notice that
    the SVM does not fit in the proposed goal, having a low accuracy value and, even
    with the variation of some parameters, it would not be possible to achieve acceptable
    values. As for the other algorithms, although higher when compared to SVM, it
    is possible to conclude that only two stand out even before any optimization.
    As such XGBoost and RF will be further evaluated, since DT and NN, even after
    optimized, will not be able to reach better accuracy. Moving forward to the next
    training phase, using only XGBoost and RF, and based on the parameters shown in
    Table II and the documentation for each of these algorithms, the hyperparametrization
    tuning was made only for the most important parameters, mainly those who have
    a numerical value. Table IV shows the tuning options for each of the selected
    algorithms. The results obtained with the hyperparametrization tuning, including
    the best parameters settings and accuracy, can be observed in Table V. Through
    the analysis of the results, after the optimization of the various parameters
    of the two algorithms under study it is then possible to conclude that by choosing
    the best parameters, instead of the default configuration, it is possible to improve
    the accuracy of the models. Although is is not a huge improvement, 1% for XGBoost
    and only 0.1% for RF, this improvement can lead to the saving of a huge amount
    of water. In terms of the algorithm that has the best accuracy for the situation
    and dataset tested is the XGBoost, which will be used for the solution. SECTION
    VII. Conclusion In this article a study of machine learning algorithms was made
    in order to understand which will have the higher accuracy when classifying the
    ideal hour to irrigate an agricultural field, based on local sensor and weather
    data. The algorithms tested included Random Forest, Neural Network, XGBoost, Decision
    Trees and Support Vector Machine. The literature on this topic showed that research
    is already being done to calculate the amount of water to be administered to the
    agricultural field, however the time of day at which this administration was done
    continues to be decided by the owner and in a poorly founded way. A methodology
    was followed to obtain a suitable dataset for the study and several scenarios
    were explored in order to understand which algorithm best suited the situation
    under study, and it was concluded that XGBoost was the most suitable. After the
    optimization of the tested algorithm it was possible to reach an accuracy in the
    order of 87%, which leads to believe that the final result can improve water management
    and consequent savings of this natural resource. Comparing to the results obtained
    by [6], with 80% accuracy using RF, our methodology obtains better results with
    XGBoost. Also, in terms of comparison, when using RF, our methodology also gets
    better results, with 84% accuracy. As future work for this study is included the
    implementation of the algorithm developed in a real situation in order to test
    the water saving values that can be achieved and also the attempt to optimize
    even further the system. In order to be even more effective, and since the proposed
    algorithm predicts the best hour of the day for irrigation, the developed algorithm
    should be implemented in parallel with algorithms that calculates the amount of
    water needed to manage the land under study. All of these implementations should
    have in mind the collection of data in real time, leading to a quick response
    for any type of situations. TABLE II Default Configuration Parameters TABLE III

  description: The main source of water in the Indian Subcontinent is Groundwater.
    It is also the most rapidly depleting resource due to various reasons such as
    rampant unchecked irrigation and exploitation of groundwater by industries and
    other organizations. The current system is limited by short communication range,
    high power consumption and the system monitors only the water level and the report
    is available only to the consumer i.e. it is a single-user system. Due to the
    unavailability of a centralized system to monitor and prevent overuse of water
    resources, sudden water crises have become a major issue in India. This project
    aims at implementing an IoT (Internet of things) based water monitoring system
    that monitors the water level and the quality of groundwater and updates real-time
    data to the database. This system is designed to monitor the groundwater level
    of an entire village or a town. It updates the people and the concerned government
    authorities in case of any decrease in water level and water quality below the
    threshold value, and also monitors the water consumption during a period and predicts
    exhaustion time. This system predicts the availability of water in the future
    based on current demand and usage and the recharge rate using machine learning
    algorithms. The data collected and the analysis of the data is made available
    in a Public Cloud. The modules are based on Raspberry Pi Zero, sensor nodes and
    LoRa (Long Range) Module or Wi-Fi module according to the network requirement
    for connectivity.

    Vol 5 | Issue 3 | June 2020 \n1 \n \n \n \nAbstract—Recently, there was a struggle\
    \ to control the \nvolume of production and the volume of production between \n\
    countries and regions in the world. Rather, western countries \nhad a desire to\
    \ attract investments in the east to their own \ncountries and regions. This desire\
    \ has led to the emergence of \nthe Industry 4.0 phenomenon of the West, which\
    \ is Germany. In \nother words, with this phenomenon, the industry is aimed to\
    \ \ndigitize production more and contribute to the issues of speed, \nefficiency\
    \ and flexibility by providing digitalization in \nproduction. With these changes,\
    \ Industry 4.0, was seen that the \nsystem was working better than it was and\
    \ production was made \ncheaper than the system, when taking the muscle strength\
    \ out of \nthe system. While the positive contributions of Industry 4.0 have \n\
    resonated with all sectors, it has also started to have an impact \non the agricultural\
    \ sector. Problems such as scarcity in the \nworld, not using natural resources\
    \ effectively and not using \ntechnology in the agricultural field, have caused\
    \ the emergence \nof digitalization in the agricultural sector. \"Agriculture\
    \ 4.0\", \nwich means making smart production with smart farming \npractices by\
    \ using the concepts, information and technologies in \nthe literature. In line\
    \ with the possibilities and technological \ndevelopments offered by Industry\
    \ 4.0, it enables the sensors to \nbe seen in all agricultural machines from the\
    \ tractor to the crop \ntools and the communication of the machines in the entire\
    \ \nproduction process by entering the internet of things into the \nagricultural\
    \ sector. As a matter of fact, with the agriculture 4.0, \nthe traditional agriculture\
    \ paradigm has not been sufficient \nanymore and it contributes to sustainability,\
    \ to be productive, to \nprotect the rural texture, to protect the environmental\
    \ quality \nand to provide accessible food by undergoing changes and \nagricultural\
    \ practices. In the study, the problems experienced in \nthe agricultural sector,\
    \ the effects of Agriculture 4.0 on these \nproblems and how they will benefit\
    \ are discussed. The use of \ntechnology has given the system its name and agriculture\
    \ has \nalso taken its share in the developments. Accordingly, what are \nthe\
    \ practices of Agriculture 4.0 in the world and how their \ncontributions are\
    \ investigated.  \nIndex Terms— Agriculture, 4.0, Digital Revolution  \nI. INTRODUCTION\
    \ \nSince nutrition chain and agriculture is a basic and \nindispensable issue\
    \ for humanity, its place in the world is also \nimportant. It is also considered\
    \ as one of the critical issues \nfacing humanity in the production, transportation,\
    \ storage and \ndistribution of food. However, it is known that agricultural \n\
    production is under great pressure due to both increasing \npopulation and important\
    \ changes in climate [36].    In the \nUN's 2015 report of “Transforming Our World”\
    \ for \n \n1 Published on June 24, 2020.  \n  M.Atilla Arıcıoğlu, Necmettin Erbakan\

    \ Mehmet Bey University, Vocational \nSchools of Social Sciences, Turkey. \n(e-mail:\
    \ aylinyilmaz@kmu.edu.tr) \nsustainable development, it points out that approximately\
    \ 800 \nmillion people in the world experienced hunger problems and \nby 2030,\
    \ 8% of the world will experience problems caused by \nmalnutrition. In the United\
    \ Nations report, he emphasized \nthat $ 265 billion should be invested in the\
    \ agricultural sector \nto prevent hunger and deal with poverty [54]. On the other\
    \ \nhand, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization \n(FAO) needs to\
    \ increase 70% of food production by 2050 in \norder to keep up with the increase\
    \ in the world population . \n[17]. In addition, how to ensure climate stability\
    \ necessary for \nagricultural sustainability is discussed through greenhouse\
    \ \ngas. It is possible to intervene in climate change by reducing \nthe world\
    \ greenhouse gas, with less fertilizer and less water \nuse techniques and it\
    \ is stated that it will be possible to \nproduce 70% more food until 2050 [5].\
    \ \nIn this context, poverty and the inefficient use of natural \nresources provide\
    \ significant opportunities for innovations \nthat may occur in the agricultural\
    \ sector. Because agriculture \nis affected by many factors, including economic\
    \ conditions, \ntechnological developments and environmental constraints, \nand\
    \ these situations cause paradigm changes. The traditional \nagricultural paradigm\
    \ largely emphasizes productivity. \nHowever, agriculture exists not only to increase\
    \ production \nand productivity, but also to protect resources and the \nenvironment\
    \ [6]. On the other hand, as it is known, \nnegativities such as global warming,\
    \ climate change, drought \ndecrease efficiency and productivity in agriculture.\
    \ For this \nreason, agricultural practices and research; agriculture that \n\
    will ensure sustainability, be productive, protect the texture \nand environmental\
    \ quality of rural society, provide economic \n/ social gains to individuals and\
    \ firms in the production \nsystem, provide a holistic economic development, increase\
    \ \nsocial welfare, and ultimately provide a crop yield and an \naccessible food\
    \ source. sector is targeted [20], [31]. From the \nperspective of economic inequality\
    \ or distribution, this target \nappears to be even more important for the underdeveloped\
    \ \ncountries. Increasing the growth potential of underdeveloped \ncountries and\
    \ reducing poverty can be achieved through \nsustainable agriculture. In other\
    \ words, countries in Africa, \nunlike Asian countries, must realize a broad-based\
    \ \nagricultural \nrevolution \nin \norder \nfor \nthe \neconomic \ntransformations\
    \ to take place successfully [12]. It is possible \nto understand what agricultural\
    \ development means for the \nsustainability of the expected revolution and the\

    \ 2020 \n2 \n \n \nprocess by removing the obstacles to agriculture, not only\
    \ in \nAfrica but in a global world. \nIn order for the process to be better understood,\
    \ if the \nnegativities experienced in the agricultural sector are \ngenerally\
    \ classified under three headings, these are; The \nfamine of the world is not\
    \ using the natural resources \neffectively and not using the technology correctly\
    \ in the \nagricultural field [35]; [12]; [11]. These problems are social \nsuch\
    \ as inequality and distribution inequality, technical and \nstructural problems\
    \ such as efficiency and effectiveness that \ndetermine this and these problems\
    \ need to be solved. In other \nwords, the use of technology and technology should\
    \ give the \nsystem its name, and agriculture should take its share from \nthe\
    \ revolution in a significant way within the framework of \nthe developments.\
    \ For this, it is important to define the \nresponse of industry 4.0 in the agricultural\
    \ field and to handle \nthe process with a correct expression. Because, in line\
    \ with \nthe possibilities and technological developments offered by \nIndustry\
    \ 4.0, it enables the sensors to be seen in all \nagricultural machines from the\
    \ tractor to the crop tools and \nthe communication of the machines during the\
    \ entire \nproduction process by entering the internet of objects into the \n\
    agricultural sector. With agricultural machinery and \nagricultural fields equipped\
    \ with digital sensors, it is seen that \nthe farmer facilitates the work of the\
    \ farmer by providing \nopportunities such as how much fertilizer is given to\
    \ which \nareas, weather conditions, what minerals the plants need, \nirrigation,\
    \ soil condition, estimated harvest time. Using the \nnew techniques brought by\
    \ technology in the agricultural \nsector, the production of different products,\
    \ increasing the \nefficiency in the food chain, bringing food production to \n\
    consumers and using technology are promising in terms of \nsustainability and\
    \ solution of problems. \nII. THE MEANING OF AGRICULTURE FOR THE WORLD \nThe world's\
    \ number of population given in 2020 is about \n7.5 billion. When the population\
    \ distribution in the world is \nanalyzed, it is seen that China has the most\
    \ population [64]. \nChina takes the first place with a population of about 1.5\
    \ \nmillion, then in the second place is India with a population of \nabout 1.4\
    \ million, and the USA is ranked with approximately \n350 million, Indonesia with\
    \ approximately 270 million. \nApproximately 10% of the world population also\
    \ struggles \nwith poverty. Because the growing population and the \nincrease\
    \ in the production of agriculture do not proceed in \nequidistant [55].   \n\
    When we look at 2019 agricultural production area in the \nworld, 36,81 million\
    \ hecrates have been planted. 72,61 \nmillion metric tons of production was obtained\
    \ from this area. \nIt contributed to the agricultural sector with 7,00 million\
    \ \nhecrates production in the European Union region, Canada \n9,00 million hecrates\
    \ production and China with 6,15 million \nhecrates area. Europe Union produced\
    \ 20,06 million metric \ntons, Canada 20,01 million metric tons and China 13,28\
    \ \nmillion metric tons [18]. \nThe contribution of agriculture to economic production\
    \ in \nthe world has been determined as 6.4 percent. The total \nproduction of\
    \ the sector is $ 5,084,800 million [61]. \n \nFig. 1: Share Graph of Agricultural\
    \ Production in the World Economy [62]  \n \nCountries with the largest economy\
    \ in the world; US ($ \n20,412,870 million), China ($ 14,092,514 million), Japan\
    \ ($ \n5,167,051 million) and Germany ($ 4,211,635 million). In the \nranking\
    \ of agricultural income in the world, it is seen that \nChina (13.608.2 $ billions),\
    \ India (2.726.3 $ billions), Israel \n369.7 $ billions, Netherlands 913.7 $ billions\
    \ [62]. \nChina and India account for 19.49 and 7.39 percent of total \nglobal\
    \ agricultural production. The world's largest economy, \nthe United States, ranks\
    \ third, followed by Brazil and \nIndonesia(https://www.statisticstimes.com/economy/countri\n\
    es-by-gdp-sector-composition.php). While the agricultural \nsector is an important\
    \ source of employment in some \ncountries, it provides input to the industrial\
    \ sector, creating \ndemand for industrial products and contributing to total\
    \ \nexports through the export of agricultural products. For \nexample, 70% of\
    \ the population in India provides a livelihood \nfrom agriculture and agriculture\
    \ contributes to only 18% of \nGDP. It is stated that the main reason for this\
    \ low \nperformance is that automation is not used sufficiently in \nagricultural\
    \ production [14].  When evaluations are made on \nthe basis of countries in the\
    \ agricultural sector, developing \ncountries and developed countries also differ.\
    \ Agriculture has \na lower share in GDP in developed countries, but developing\
    \ \ncountries also make less but more stable progress in GDP [2]. \nThe reason\
    \ for this is that agricultural production may be the \nonly industry of the current\
    \ industry in developing countries \n[35]. \nIII. OVER INDUSTRY 4.0 \nMany variable\
    \ variables such as the speed of economic and \ncommercial changes in the world,\
    \ increasing population and \ninstability of resource constraints, sustainability\
    \ pressure, \ntechnological changes, climate change, urbanization, political \n\
    interactions, demographic change and diversified customer \nexpectations have\
    \ affected the formation of industrial \nrevolutions. Due to these factors, innovations\
    \ in the industry \ncause revolutions and paradigm shifts in the same way [41].\
    \ \nWhile Industry 4.0, the new name for this change, proposes a \nnew paradigm\
    \ shift, discussions and definitions are \ncontinuing. The main direction characterized\
    \ by Industry 4.0, \nwhich was announced at the Hannover fair in 2011 in \nGermany,\
    \ is referred to as the smart production application \n[43], [37]. Robots of 75%\
    \ of the Amberg factory of Siemens \nin the city of Germany have robots, while\
    \ the remaining 25% \nhave employees who are engaged in corporate affairs. The\
    \ \nfactory, which has over a thousand product types, produces \nover a million\
    \ and its margin of error is very low [45]. A \nfactory on telephone manufacturing\
    \ in Dongguan, China is \n \n \n \n \nEJBMR, European Journal of Business and\

    Vol 5 | Issue 3 | June 2020 \n3 \n \n \nknown as the world's first unmanned robot\
    \ factory. While \n80% of the factory is robots, 20% is technical team. A robotic\
    \ \narm can do the work that an average of 68 workers take on. \nIn other words,\
    \ it has positive results in terms of employees, \ntime and productivity [52].\
    \ With Industry 4.0, it reorganized \nits understanding of production and marketing\
    \ focused on \nspeed, efficiency, cost and innovation [46]. \nIndustry 4.0, which\
    \ is based on the integration of \ninformation, communication and industrial technologies,\
    \ \nestablishes a flexible production model through cyber-\nphysical systems and\
    \ interacts in real time with people, \nobjects and products [65]. Industry 4.0\
    \ is also defined as the \nintegration of the value chain with modern technologies.\
    \ \nWithin the framework of these definitions, within the basic \ncomponents of\
    \ Industry 4.0; cyber physical systems, internet \nof things, 3D printers (additive\
    \ manufacturing), cloud \ncomputing, big data, artificial intelligence, vertical\
    \ and \nhorizontal integration, cyber security, augmented reality and \nsimulation\
    \ [60]; [48]; [40]; [21].It is the robots that take the \nmost active role in\
    \ Industry 4.0 [41]. Because they play an \nactive role in autonomous decision\
    \ making and cooperation \nbetween units [60]. The Internet of Things is the ability\
    \ to \ncollect, increase and organize data from different sources. \nThe Internet\
    \ of Things allows for disconnected data \nmanagement that speeds up process audits\
    \ and enables data \nto be transformed into information that will take action\
    \ on the \ncyber-physical system [27]. Big data that plays a remarkable \nrole\
    \ in the correct management of the whole process; These \nare clusters of data\
    \ that cannot be achieved with typical \ndatabase software, which are methods\
    \ of capturing, storing, \nmanaging and analyzing data [33]. Cloud, which is another\
    \ \nactor, has five characteristics: self-service, wide network \naccess, resource\
    \ pool, fast elasticity and measurable service \npossibilities. It has important\
    \ benefits such as mediation [7]. \nCyber-physical systems that provide access\
    \ to data and data \nprocessing services over the internet for Industry 4.0, and\
    \ \nsystems that are in connection with the physical world and \nprocesses are\
    \ Cyber Physical Systems [34]. Process; In the \nvirtual world, operators will\
    \ be able to interact with their \nmachines and change their parameters by clicking\
    \ a cyber \nbutton. It will be possible to receive operational data and \nmaintenance\
    \ instructions. Due to these advantages; \ncompanies will use Augmented Reality\
    \ to improve decision \nmaking and business procedures [42]. Thus, in real systems,\
    \ \nsimulation tools are needed to monitor the positive / negative \neffects of\
    \ this change before changing certain parameters and \nvariables on the system.\
    \ The agility of the system can be \nmonitored against changing situations [4].\
    \ All this raises \nintegration for 4.0. Collaboration of many businesses with\
    \ a \ncommunication network is called Horizontal Integration. \nVertical integration,\
    \ on the other hand, is to increase the \ninformation exchange of enterprises\
    \ and to cooperate \nbetween different hierarchical levels [8]. 3D printers, which\
    \ \nare expected to further affect this revolution and the working \nprocess,\
    \ flatten production and cause the emergence of new \ntypes of business oriented\
    \ individuals, are the infrastructure \nof the revolution and the paradigm of\
    \ the new economy. 3D \nemphasizes horizontal power among individuals rather than\
    \ \nhierarchical force. With additive manufacturing, there is a \nshift towards\
    \ the concept of urea / consumer instead of \nconsumer [39]. Ultimately, the security\
    \ of this virtual and \neclectic structure is ensured by cyber security. Cyber\
    \ security; \nIt is the technological system that allows the machines to \nwork\
    \ in integration with each other and allow information \nexchange to be carried\
    \ out safely [4].  These technological \ndevelopments provide the basis for the\
    \ implementation of \nnew production processes and business models called smart\
    \ \nsystems [30]. Thanks to the digital connectivity offered by \nIndustry 4.0,\
    \ integration in all functions of the business is \nprovided. This provides convenience\
    \ in increasing the \nefficiency of the enterprises, providing flexibility in\
    \ \nproduction, reducing costs, providing increased customer \nsatisfaction, ensuring\
    \ the traceability of the system and \nfacilitating the detection of failures,\
    \ and ensuring a \nsustainable operation with environmentally friendly and \n\
    resource saving behavior. Industry 4.0 also reduces \nproduction, logistics and\
    \ management costs, which are \namong the operational functions, by up to 30%\
    \ and brings \nimprovements in these functions [3].  \nIV. WHY AND HOW FOR AGRICULTURE\
    \ 4.0 \nInnovations in the field of agriculture must meet the real \nneeds of\
    \ the consumers and continue their activities by \nmaximizing the technology.\
    \ Thus, developments experienced \nincrease the adequacy and efficiency of agricultural\
    \ activities. \nTherefore, it is necessary to first understand what agricultural\
    \ \nactivities are and how agriculture works so that it will be \neasier to determine\
    \ what will be the future innovations in the \nfield of agriculture or what the\
    \ deficiencies are in the field of \nagriculture [14]. \n \n \nFig. 2. Agricultural\
    \ Activity Processes [19] \n \nIn this process, the activities performed before\
    \ the harvest \nare presented first. Things to be done before harvest; there are\
    \ \npossibilities to choose the right crop seedlings, the suitability \nand selection\
    \ of the land, information on when to produce, \nand to cooperate with cooperatives.\
    \ The pre-harvest step is \nthe stage that determines the productivity in agriculture.\
    \ Then \nthe second step is soil preparation and planting. What are the \nactivities\
    \ that facilitate the works in preparing the soil during \nproduction, during\
    \ planting, irrigation, fertilizing and \nspraying, and what is considered in\
    \ these stages. The last \nstage is post-harvest activities, these include marketing\
    \ of the \nproduct, logistics service of the product, processing and \npackaging\
    \ of the product. This process is also mentioned in \nthe literature as farmer\
    \ decision support systems [19].  It also \nshows the disruptions in the operation\
    \ of agriculture that \n \n \n \n \nEJBMR, European Journal of Business and Management\

    Vol 5 | Issue 3 | June 2020 \n4 \n \n \noccur during the stages of agricultural\
    \ activity. There are \nmany factors that decrease productivity in agriculture\
    \ and \nthese factors vary. 35-40% of the foods produced in \nagriculture are\
    \ not consumed by consumers and this is \nrecorded as food losses [51]. Improper\
    \ land use in agriculture, \nincreases in energy, water and fertilizer consumption\
    \ are \namong other important factors that decrease productivity in \nagriculture\
    \ [16]. Climate change affects the continuity of \nwater resources [59] and the\
    \ safety of food, because \nproduction timings are also changing [29]. Global\
    \ warming \nand climate changes have also changed the course of using \nenergy\
    \ resources, so that not using resources properly has \nreduced productivity in\
    \ agriculture. In order to eliminate the \nfactors that reduce inefficiency in\
    \ the agricultural sector, \ninnovations are taken in the field of agriculture\
    \ [32]. The aim \nof the world is to increase productivity in agriculture, which\
    \ \nis possible by increasing productivity in agriculture. The way \nto increase\
    \ efficiency is by integrating technology with \nagriculture. The digitization\
    \ of agriculture eliminates most \nevents that reduce productivity. For this reason,\
    \ the \nrealization process of agriculture should first be considered \n[14].\
    \ \nWith the application of Industry 4.0 in agriculture, there \nare many innovations\
    \ and these innovations also provide new \nperspectives in the agricultural sector.\
    \ The issue that has been \ndiscussed recently is the digitalization of agriculture.\
    \ \nDigitalization in agriculture is not an instant developing \nevent, it has\
    \ emerged after a certain period of time. As it is \nknown, the first production\
    \ activities in the field of \nagriculture were carried out by humans and animals,\
    \ and then \nmechanizations played a role when electricity came to life. \nWith\
    \ the innovations brought by computer and automation \nsystems, developments in\
    \ greenhouse and irrigation \nautomations, \nand \ninnovations \nin \ninformation\
    \ \nand \ntechnologies have caused the emergence of the “smart \nfarming” phenomenon\
    \ [14].  This system, which is called \n“Smart Agriculture” Precision Agriculture\
    \ or Agriculture 4.0 \nin most sources, is becoming more and more widespread \n\
    every day [1]. “Big Data” has a significant importance in \nagriculture as well\
    \ as in industry [56]. \nWith the rapid progression of the internet of things\
    \ and \ncloud processing [63]; [44], digital agriculture defines as an \nextension\
    \ of the concept of the “Digital World” proposed in \nthe 90s and emphasizes the\
    \ production method in the \n“Sensitive Agriculture” process. However, prevalence\
    \ and \npace are slower than industry. Especially land, open air, \nclimatic conditions\
    \ and a complex level of relationship in the \nprocess explain this slowness.\
    \ According to the research \nconducted at McKinsey Global Institute, agriculture\
    \ sector is \nseen as the sector with the lowest digital transformation \ncompared\
    \ to other sectors. However, the way to increase \nproduction and increase productivity\
    \ in agriculture is through \nthe integration of agriculture with technology [33].\
    \ Digital \nagriculture, also known as knowledge-based agriculture \nmodel, places\
    \ and advances the processing and interpretation \nof digital data based on agricultural\
    \ production and \nmanagement systems [28]. It focuses on the agricultural \n\
    production process and emphasizes rational connections in \nthe process. This\
    \ helps to take into account local, spatial, \nenvironmental \nheterogeneities\
    \ \nand \nglobal \nclimate \nphenomena, as well as making informed decision making,\
    \ \nsocial demands as well as satisfying individual producer and \nconsumer needs\
    \ in terms of efficiency and profit [61]. \nAgriculture 4.0 is aimed to increase\

    Vol 5 | Issue 3 | June 2020 \n5 \n \n \nof the society from agricultural food\
    \ production and \necosystem services. This suggests increasing crop yields, \n\
    increasing the efficiency of nitrogen, phosphorus and water \nuse, improving ecological-based\
    \ management practices, \nrational use of pesticides and antibiotics, and covering\
    \ major \nchanges in some livestock practices [56].  In addition, it \nprovides\
    \ convenience in efficient use of resources in soil \npreparation, planting, irrigation,\
    \ care and harvesting, \nreducing product losses, increasing online shopping in\
    \ food \nand providing price-quality optimization [10], [24], [50].   \nThere\
    \ are other applications that can be added to smart \nfarming applications. These;\
    \ auxiliary arrangement and \norientation systems, sensor-based product detection\
    \ and \nvariable rate technologies in fertilization in field agriculture, \nmap-based\
    \ variable rate technologies in fertilization, sensor-\nbased variable rate technologies\
    \ in spraying, variable rate \ntechnologies in irrigation, variable rate technologies\
    \ used in \nseed, isobus, robot applications, vertical agriculture and using \n\
    driverless technologies. With these practices, the deficiencies \nin agricultural\
    \ activities are eliminated and the activities \nbecome easier. For example; vertical\
    \ agriculture is the \nprocess that produces food in harsh environments where\
    \ \nsuitable land cannot be used, and provides food production in \nvertically\
    \ stacked layers. In vertical agriculture, it uses soil, \nsoilless or aeroponic\
    \ cultivation methods and uses 95 percent \nless water, less fertilizer and nutritional\
    \ supplements, and is \nprotected from harmful plants and animals without using\
    \ \npesticides [35].   \nAgriculture 4.0 is complemented by smart farming \npractices\
    \ in the sector. The anaerobic system reduces waste \nvolume and is an efficient\
    \ waste treatment technology that \nuses natural anaerobic decomposition in biogas\
    \ production. It \nis used in the treatment of wastes from agricultural and \n\
    industrial activities [10].  On the other hand, nanotechnology \nshows \ngreat\
    \ \npotential \nin \nsmart \nagriculture. \nNanoencapsulation can also improve\
    \ herbicide application by \nproviding better penetration through the introduction\
    \ of \nnanoparticles based on nanotechnology, resistance to plant \ndiseases,\
    \ special plant growth with the help of controlled \nrelease formulations of nanoparticles\
    \ in special plant growth \nand nutrition [13]. One of Agriculture 4.0 applications\
    \ is \ndigital slipmeter; it is expected to bring better fuel economy. \nThanks\
    \ to this application, optimum fuel consumption is \nprovided. Smart agriculture,\
    \ of course, provides tremendous \nbenefits to sustainable agriculture and increases\
    \ the efficiency \nof food production [38].   \nBy using the Internet of Things\
    \ with Agriculture 4.0, \nfarmers can observe the crop productivity. The realized\
    \ \nexample of this application is John Deere tractors. The \nperformance of tractors\
    \ has increased with the application of \nthe internet of objects and the estimated\
    \ time of the area to be \nplanted has been shortened [51].  An example of agriculture\
    \ \n4.0 applications; to combat the desert and sea in the world \ninto food production\
    \ facilities to combat the food crisis. King \nAbdullah University of Science\
    \ and Technology (KAUST) in \nArabia is at the forefront of research on desert\
    \ agriculture. It \nworks on minimizing the losses in front of plant development\
    \ \nand makes use of smart farming practices while doing these \nstudies [35];\
    \ [49].   \nAnother development with Agriculture 4.0 is advanced \nsensors and\
    \ low-cost microchips, cloud-based systems. \nThanks to these practices, control\
    \ in agriculture becomes \neasier and innovation in agriculture increases. Bioenergy\
    \ \nproductions such as vertical farming activities, installation of \nsmart greenhouses,\
    \ reduction of ecological footprint are \noffered to increase the value chain\
    \ effectiveness, and \ninnovative developments such as drones, robots and sharing\
    \ \nplatforms are being developed to increase product efficiency \n[35]; [60];\
    \ [10].  \nAgriculture 4.0 has applications in the world. German \nagricultural\
    \ machinery Class firm checks the health of \nanimals in the herd through sensors\
    \ [24].  With the smart \nirrigation application of Bosch, olive trees were irrigated\
    \ in \nSpain, and they determined how much water they needed and \ncarried out\
    \ irrigation activities through sensors [9].   \nThere are two countries that\
    \ are leaders in digitalization in \nagriculture; Israel and the Netherlands They\
    \ implemented \nagriculture 4.0 practices more quickly than other countries. \n\
    The Netherlands ranks 4th in the 2017-2018 Global \nCompetitiveness Index [53].\
    \ The Netherlands is one of the \nsmallest countries in Europe, it has an area\
    \ of 37 378 km2. \nThe total exports of the Netherlands in 2018 were set at 641\
    \ \n805 million Euros. Agricultural production amount of the \nNetherlands is\
    \ recorded as 89 877 million Euros. The country, \nwhich is in a very good condition\
    \ in terms of production \ndespite its low agricultural area, reveals the difference\
    \ in \nactivities it has [15]. Analysis of the Netherlands by Porter \nmodel [58];\
    \  \n-Geographical concentration of relevant and supportive \nenterprises, \n\
    -Providing companies with reliable information from each \nother and their cooperation,\
    \ \n-Interaction \nbetween \nseed \ncompanies, \nagricultural \ncompanies, suppliers,\
    \ logistics and educators, \n-Presence of other supportive agricultural organizations\
    \ \nThe existence of these factors in the Netherlands reveals its \ndifference\
    \ in agriculture. In the Netherlands, agricultural \nuniversities have enabled\
    \ agriculture to develop and studies \nare conducted on the question of how to\
    \ get the most output \nwith less input. Then the Netherlands a considerably high\
    \ \nshare of the companies allocated for R&D activities. It has a \nuniversity-industry\
    \ \ncooperation, \nhouses \nsuccessful \nbusinesses in innovation, and is a global\
    \ giant in agricultural \nexport. The Netherlands also allocates a high share\
    \ of its \nbudget to R&D activities [23].   \nThe Netherlands is from countries\
    \ where expertise in \nagricultural production is declared and consists of countries\
    \ \nwith high agricultural productivity. As in the Netherlands, \nsome areas have\
    \ managed to achieve high rates of growth that \nincrease GDP and labor productivity\
    \ [2].  The Netherlands is \nin a good position to shape the Fourth Industrial\
    \ Revolution, \nto design and work with high-tech preparation among \nindividuals.\
    \ The world-famous Wageningen University \nsupports the development and awareness\
    \ of farmers. [58].   \nIsrael is one of the developed countries in high technology\
    \ \nproducts and agricultural technology. It is ranked 21st in the \nGlobal Competitiveness\

    Vol 5 | Issue 3 | June 2020 \n6 \n \n \nworld. Israel allocates 17% of its budget\
    \ to R&D activities. \nIsrael started smart agriculture with a smart irrigation\
    \ system. \nIt wishes to increase product yield and quality by using less \nwater.\
    \ According to the 2017 data of Israel, it exports \napproximately 60.5 billion\
    \ dollars and it is an example of \nAgriculture 4.0. Israel; It has advanced technology\
    \ in \ngreenhouse, livestock and plant protection. It is in a very good \ncondition\
    \ in exporting agricultural technology to the world \nand constantly attaches\
    \ importance to R&D activities [49].   \nIt is not surprising that Africa is actually\
    \ enthusiastic about \nagriculture 4.0 as a whole. The region needs an inclusive\
    \ and \nenvironmentally sustainable agricultural transformation in \norder to\
    \ provide more food safety, improve nutrition and \nimprove economic opportunity.\
    \ It provides more efficient and \nsmall-scale farm installation, decreases food\
    \ imports, tries to \nincrease agricultural exports and carries out activities\
    \ to \nreduce post-harvest losses. The eager steps of Africa's \nagricultural\
    \ transformation attract attention [11].  As can be \nseen, the importance of\
    \ correct and effective use of \nagricultural areas is important not only for\
    \ the relevant \ncompany and country but also for the world. Agriculture is \n\
    one of the most strategic issues of the world, and the waste of \nresources increases\
    \ and the living spaces shrink. \nV. CONCLUSION \nDrones, robots, the internet\
    \ of things, vertical farms, a \nsystem using artificial intelligence and renewable\
    \ energy \nsources 4.0. or digitalization. The application of digital \ntechnologies\
    \ \nto \nthe \nagricultural \nsector \nsignificantly \ncontributes to increase\
    \ agricultural productivity and reliable \nfood production. \nEspecially developments\
    \ in information technology \nprovide effective supply chain management and obtaining\
    \ \nreal-time data throughout the supply chain contributes to the \nplanning of\
    \ decisions. The use of this data contributes to \nminimizing waste, producing\
    \ higher quality products and \nminimizing food waste. There are improvements\
    \ expected \nfrom Agriculture 4.0. Technology, R&D, intelligent growth \nbased\
    \ on information and innovation, provides sustainable \ngrowth with resource efficiency\
    \ and decreasing losses, and \nalso enables healthy growth in food safety and\
    \ increased \ntraceability and covering the supply chain, including the \nproducer.\
    \ With Agriculture 4.0, reducing waste and \nincreasing productivity become the\
    \ main tool in the \nagricultural sector. By means of sensors, it is ensured that\
    \ soil \nloss is reduced and erosion is prevented. A significant \nincrease in\
    \ the number of farmers using IT technologies \nagainst climate change and environmental\
    \ pollution is also a \npositive outcome of smart farming practices. There are\
    \ \nnatural uncertainties in the agricultural industry, introducing \nsensors\
    \ and M2M (machine to machine) based monitoring \nwill be an important step in\
    \ preventing disasters. \nIn small countries (Taiwan, Israel, the Netherlands)\
    \ and \ndeveloping countries, the development of agricultural \ntechnologies is\
    \ remarkable and the technologies that these \ncountries use have also caused\
    \ the development of the \nagricultural sector. In other words, it can be deduced\
    \ that \nbenefiting from Agriculture 4.0 opportunities enables \ncountries to\
    \ develop in agriculture. When we look at 2019 \nagricultural production data\
    \ in the World. \nAgriculture 4.0, which enables cooperation between \ndifferent\
    \ stages of the value chain and increases traceability \nin food safety with increased\
    \ visibility in the value chain. It \nwill lead to increases in safe food production\
    \ by taking \nadvantage of technology and ensuring efficient distribution of \n\
    resources. In agriculture, the recycling of the investment is \nlong-term and\
    \ the risk area is wide and the variables are \nuncontrollable, making 4.0 an\
    \ effective strategic tool. \nHowever, factors such as investor profile, level\
    \ of countries' \nunderstanding of process, resistance of beneficiaries, and low\
    \ \nnumber of agriculture 4.0 installations are seen as the biggest \nobstacle.\
    \ With Agriculture 4.0, a smart, sustainable and \nhealthy growth has been achieved.\
    \ With the R&D activities \nprovided by technology, healthy growth occurs with\
    \ smart \ngrowth, efficient use of resources and reduction of losses, and \nsustainable\
    \ development and improvements in the supply \nchain. \nIndustry 4.0 has a transformative\
    \ and changing effect on \nevery sector. In the agricultural sector, breakthroughs\
    \ for 4.0 \ndevelopments should be taken. At the same time, countries \nthat still\
    \ produce inefficient production with traditional \nmethods in agriculture and\
    \ that have foreign dependence \nshould give the necessary importance to Agriculture\
    \ 4.0. \nREFERENCES \n[1] \nAkay, M. (2018). Endüstri 4.0 İle Akıllı Tarıma Geçiş,\

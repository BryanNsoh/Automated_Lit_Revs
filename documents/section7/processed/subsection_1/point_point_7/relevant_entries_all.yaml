    SECTION I. Introduction(Heading 1) All most all countries population is depending
    on agriculture by using water and land resources optimally. Still most of the
    countries depending on labor work and they do not use proper pest/disease control,
    crop management and quality management systems. Hence in addition to that, still
    in traditional agriculture they don''t use proper optimal uniform water distribution
    in field''s. Hence, a novel IoT [1] technology based agricultural monitoring system
    is greatly required for IT people, farmers in developing countries. It is predicted
    that 87% world''s using fresh water for irrigation and 33% of world''s population
    produced food uses irrigation at every year. Hence, per capita fresh water is
    declining. On the other hand, world global warming increases. Fig. 1. Sensor-based
    machine communication networks. Show All The above diagram shows Hundreds of energy,
    low cost and computational power wireless sensor nodes are mostly used as agricultural
    monitoring system. IoT[2] devices are included in M2M area networks since cameras;
    sensors can be deployed easily, monitored remotely and controlled automatically.
    26% of world population depends on irrigation for present food production. Soil
    nutrients and food production dependent on each other. Because, soil nutrients
    of agriculture fields are decreased than food production also decreased of the
    developing countries. Hence, a new technology based agricultural monitoring system
    is greatly required. Machine to machine (M2M) communication [2], [12] is a new
    g technological framework in which daily human life use machines such as micro-oven,
    refrigerator, laptop, cell phone, smart phone, tablet, electric meter can communicate
    with each other when they are included with internet network and send data to
    the cloud central server or cloud through agriculture area networks (e.g., Li-Fi,
    sensor, Bluetooth, RFID) and core networks (e.g., WiMAX, 3GPP, IP, Li-Fi, WLAN).
    Agriculture monitoring systems mainly focus on monitoring and controlling the
    growth of crops, irrigation systems, monitoring and control of animals disturbance.
    Fig. 2. Low level agriculture monitoring system Show All The IoT refers to the
    coverage area with networked interconnection of everyday tools, devices, objects,
    or computers. These things may be vary with respect to place and time and they
    may be large or small. The idea is to tag every object using a related sensor
    or RFID or electronic technology such as GPS. Cloud computing refers an Internet
    cloud of resources can be either a distributed or a centralized computing system.
    The cloud applies parallel or distributed computing, or both. Clouds can be built
    with virtualized or physical resources over large data centers that are distributed
    or centralized. Li-Fi stands for Light-Fidelity. Li-Fi technology, proposed by
    the German physicist-Harald Haas, provides transmission of data through light
    illumination by sending data through an light bulb LED that varies in fast intensity
    when compared with human eye can follow. The proposed system focuses on developing
    a Li-Fi based system and analyzes its performance with respect to existing technology.
    Wi-Fi is better useful for general wireless coverage within buildings, whereas
    Li-Fi is high density wireless data coverage in confined area interference issues.
    Li-Fi provides greater bandwidth, availability, efficiency and security than Wi-Fi
    and it has already proved with high speed in the lab. Basically low-cost is the
    nature of LEDs and with lighting units they has many opportunities to prove this
    medium, from general public internet access through street light lamps to auto-light
    fitted cars that communicate through their headlights. SECTION II. Aricultural
    Monitoring System Based on Sensors A. Precision Agricultural Precision agriculture
    (PA)[l] is playing a vital role mainly in developing countries. In PA, there are
    many types of the agriculture related parameters such as humidity, temperature,
    rainfall, soil moisture among different fields are considered. Based on these
    parameters we can analyzed how far these required resource efficiently utilized
    like utilizing water, fertilizer, pesticides, seeds etc in fields. Hence, it is
    used to increase the profit, maintain quality products and reduce waste. Though,
    GPS and GIS are used for PA, but they are costly. Wireless communication cameras,
    sensor networks provide a low cost technological solution for PA, for instance,
    in field crop management [12] where wireless cameras, sensor networks monitor
    crop conditions/growth for a longer period of time without fail and they also
    made a decision remotely and generate or evaluate the potential of new crops.
    Moreover, using the data collected from wireless cameras and sensors, it is possible
    to create a new related database or knowledge base of in-fields crops. Graphical
    user interfaces are integrated and adopted with the wireless camera and sensor
    network in these monitoring systems. The PA can evaluate agriculture area fields
    differently based on the ground level of water, saline, area field structure etc.
    The prototype maps of the fields help to manage the fields and design the relevant
    topology of wireless camera and sensor network (e.g., grid architecture). In this
    connection, different agriculture area field management zones can be defined based
    on the humidity, temperature, sand quantity and water availability etc.”. B. Field
    Assessment Agriculture farmers are follows traditional methods that require the
    state of the crop field to decide about the irrigation, applying required fertilizers
    and pesticides. Farmers mostly rely on their mental models (traditional methods)
    for this purpose; however, mental models might not always be perfect optimal.
    Hence we propose wireless camera and sensor network based area field management
    and monitoring system for this purpose, in which uses solar powered moisture nodes
    and low resolution camera for long of use. Hence, the collected information from
    cameras and sensors are in two different sources are available for assessment,
    comparison and analysis. Self-powered, self contained low resolution, long performance
    sensor, camera nodes send the height, coverage and greenness information of the
    agriculture area field grass through wireless sensor and camera networks to the
    base server or BS. Then the BS allocates time for these wireless camera nodes
    to send images. The camera, sensor nodes can also be used to observe cattle position
    and behavior C. Cattle Monitoring and Behavior Control Observing and monitoring
    the behavior of animals or cattle that is, how they interact to destroy in area
    field each other and movements towards to the field are very important in order
    to utilize properly the limited field resources (e.g. grass). For this purpose,
    Wark et al. propose wireless sensor network based cattle monitoring system [11]
    where Fleck-2 cattle nodes (sensors) are contained in a plastic box before putting
    into the collars(protection component) that the animals wear into neck. GPS, radio
    antenna and two batteries are also placed in the collar. The design of the collars
    (protection component) is very important so that animals cannot damage it easily.
    Authors propose placing the radio frequency antenna horizontal on top of the collar.
    Zebranet [10] is a related project to monitor zebras using GPS positioning data.
    Controlling animals from craft is a challenge in the agricultural monitoring systems
    because their mental and positional state (e.g., stress, desire, mood) are very
    difficult to calculate or measure. Moreover, the animal''s behavior depends on
    many factors such as season, age, temperature, food availability etc. Sensor-based
    M2M networks can play a vital role in behavior measure/control. In [9], Wark et
    al. focus on modeling cattle behavior based on their inertial and position data.
    Hence, adjusting the inertial or position of sensors is very important to get
    needful information. A sensor calibration/monitoring model is developed based
    on the distribution of inertial or position data. For example, during day time,
    the activities of animals are a lot more than that of during night time. Hence,
    their ruminating, sleeping, grazing, (behavioral) data will have different time
    in different shape (e.g., day and night). Calibration model is based on comparing
    these dataset to different parameters. From inertial sensors can collecting data
    about the speed, movement energy and turning rate of cattle. These collected information
    help identifying cattle behavior. Wark et al. [11] also propose to integrate radio
    frequency identification tag (RFID) with wireless camera, sensor networks to record/track
    the amount of food each animal takes and send this information through the wireless
    network communication. SECTION III. Sensor-Based Agriculture Monitoring Systems
    in Developing Countries This sensor based agriculture monitoring system should
    include a decision support system to maximize production, optimize resource utilization
    and can decrease environmental hazards. Moreover, this system should be autonomous,
    affordable (by poor farmers), accurate and remotely controllable. The lifetime
    of this sensor based agriculture monitoring system should be at least one crop
    season (4 −6 months) in developing countries. Though sensor-based agriculture
    monitoring systems had a high potential in traditional agriculture in developing
    countries, only a few project have been implemented in developing regions, which
    are still in evaluation, iteration or exploratory phase. A. Design Challenges
    in Developing Countries As sensor based agriculture monitoring networks are application
    specific, designing a sensor network for each application leads to the problem
    with limited resources and cost. Designing sensor-based agriculture monitoring
    communication[12] framework to use in multiple applications can optimize these
    problems. On the other hand, sensor-based agriculture systems used in the precision
    agriculture of developed countries are not suitable in developing countries because
    almost throughout world 87% farmers are depending on labor. It is different in
    developing countries to collect required data as eeconomic conditions and information
    of field to the farmers. Thus, the existing sensor-based M2M agriculture monitoring
    systems[12] are required to be modified in this context. Cost-is the most important
    factor in the case of developing countries. Cost can be reduced by using sensor-based
    agriculture monitoring communication networks in which it is not currently being
    used in agricultural monitoring systems. Moreover, this single framework of sensor-based
    agriculture monitoring network can be used in multiple applications and also in
    precision agriculture in which require densely deployed camera, sensor nodes.
    Reliability-in all most developing countries, sensor and camera nodes are climates
    extreme and scarce. Hence, important point those sensor nodes must be covered
    to protect from outdoor conditions including heat and moisture. One important
    challenge is availability and reliability of telecommunications and wireless infrastructure
    in rural areas of developing countries are very difficult. Resource-throughout
    world most of poor farmers are relying on rain fed farming for production of food.
    Moreover, traditional irrigation methodology is not efficient in semiarid areas
    in developing countries. Hence, a sensor-based agriculture monitoring irrigation
    systems with a decision support system is required to maximize food production
    of irrigation while minimize the intake of good water. A limited number of node
    deployments prevent a novel sensor agriculture monitoring network management scheme
    that uses alternate node scheduling. It also limits the usage of a power aware
    multi-hop routing that requires more camera and sensor nodes. B. Technical Frameworks
    of Sensor-Based Monitoring Systems Topology-one of the important primary requirement
    of this sensor based agriculture monitoring network fields in developing countries
    are homogeneous in terms of soil type, crop and structure type, one preferable
    method is zone-based topology can be used, which requires less number of sensor-based
    MTC devices. However, the zone-based topology suffers from network coverage problem
    and reliability (i.e., how the system works when a node in a zone fails). In [5],
    Kabashi and Elmirghani propose a dynamic zone-based topology for the VESEL project.
    Initially, nodes are distributed to the zones based on the optimized condition
    that each node remains within the range of the nodes of at least two zones. Hence,
    this overcomes the problem of node isolation. Then, each node identifies their
    neighboring nodes by broadcasting node/zone ID that is assigned by the gateway/coordinator
    nodes. Each zone node elects nodes in the neighboring zones to which they can
    connect with a minimum transceiver power. This generates several connected graphs,
    and the graph that requires minimum transmission power is selected for routing.
    Task Scheduling-This is another important basic requirement for better performance.
    Task scheduling considers or includes the parameters for sensing data, environmental
    factors (that affect sensing and network operations) and energy of the resources.
    This mechanism effectively schedules three system parameters: frequency of transmission,
    sampling rate and bit resolution. Initially, all values of these parameters are
    optimized for assigned or scheduled and then, adaptively rescheduled by a trigger
    from another neighbor environmental sensor (as agriculture parameters are inter-dependent).
    For example, rainfall or humidity sensors are triggered with soil moisture sensors.
    On other hand to adjust the parameters is based on the profile of the parameters.
    available node energy is the based on depending of System parameters. For instance,
    when the energy is crucial, the bit resolution can be decreased to save the energy
    in conversion process and analog-to-digital converter. Task scheduling is done
    at application layer by coordinator nodes and external server. Routing-Kabashi
    and Elmirghani [5] propose a delay back-link/storage aware and tolerant multi-sink
    architecture routing protocol for the VESEL project. Multiple sinks provide more
    distributed data collection and storage capabilities. several sink nodes have
    a aggregated data. at the edge of a field located with Sinks and thus, it supports
    automatic data logging when some hand-held community devices such as PDA (with
    wireless communication capabilities) pass by the sinks. In back-link/storage aware
    routing protocol, sinks and other nodes broadcast available memory/storage capacity.
    balances or optimizes memory usage. SECTION IV. Proposed Sensor-Based Agricultural
    Monitoring System Based on the design challenges and existing technical framework
    of the agriculture monitoring systems we identify and present differences in sensor-based
    agriculture monitoring systems of developed and developing countries. Considering
    all these challenges and technical frameworks, we propose a novel agriculture
    monitoring systems (with improved Li-Fi technology, topology and routing protocol)
    for farmers in developing countries. In this proposed technology is proved with
    the below mentioned results. Usually low level network system was fixed in with
    IoT devices. Like sensors, relevant object and cameras are covered with communication
    network i.e Li-Fi technology which is clearly mentioned in above phases. A. Block
    Diagram of Praposed System Architechture The below mentioned diagram represents
    with new technology. At first relevant fields data are collected from relative
    sensors and that data/information sends to data collection server. This communication
    done with new Li-Fi technology because that area was fixed with topology based
    on area structure. Actually lot of technologies is present with previous methods.
    But lack of communication leakage we are forwarded to this present technology
    for better performance. Fig. 3. System architecture Show All After receiving data
    from sensors that information must transfer to cloud server with the help of GPRS
    and WImax technologies. Than cloud server take a responsible to analysis the data
    based on requirement. Based on collected data sever will take a decision and that
    decision need to distribute over the subscribed users. Mean while any disturbance
    are accrued than that notification must received through mobile. This process
    is called alarm with beep sound. B. Flowchart for Process Management This proposed
    method can be explained with step by step process like flow of sequentional process
    with the below figure (4). Fig. 4. Flow chart of proposed method Show All The
    proposed system starts and first executed by user validation weather that user
    is authorized or not. If user valid that all connected sensors are activated than
    that collected information send to cloud server. That will take an action regarding
    that query. Actually that data is two types compared and assessed. at last if
    the problem solved that the process terminated otherwise recycle that execution
    process. 1): Tempareture SensorA temperature sensor refer a device, usually an
    RTD (resistance temperature detector) that recived the data about temperature
    from a particular source sensors and make a convertion of the data into human
    understandable form for an observer or a device. Temperature sensors are used
    in many more applications like HVand AC system food processing units, environmental
    controls, medical devices, automotive and chemical handling under the food monitoring
    and controlling systems, etc. One of the most commonly used temperature sensor
    is a thermometer, in which temperature can measure of solids, liquids and gases.
    This sensor is mostly used for nonscientific purposes because it is not so accurate.
    Different types of temperature sensors are as follows: Thermocouples Resistor
    temperature detectors Thermistors Now we explained briefly about each and every
    sensor in detailed manner. •: ThermocouplesOne of the most commonly used temperature
    sensor is a thermocouple and it is abbreviated as TC.TC is used for long distance
    because it is extremely rugged, low-cost. There are many types of temperature
    sensors that have a wide range of applications. Fig. 5. Thermocouple sensor Show
    All A thermocouple can be used as a voltage device because it indicates temperature
    by measuring a change in the voltage. It consists of two different metals: opened
    and closed. The principle used for working of these metals is thermoelectric effect.
    When two dissimilar metals produce a voltage, a thermal difference exists between
    the two metals. Thermocouple voltage rises when the temperature rises. •: Resistor
    Temperature DetectorsRTD is one of the most commonly used accurate sensors. In
    a resistor temperature detector, the resistance is proportional to the temperature.
    Platinum, nickel & copper is used for preparing this sensor\\cdot Fig. 6. RTD
    sensor Show All RTD can be used for measuring a wide range of temperature. It
    can be used to measure a temperature between 270oC to +850oC. To function properly
    it requires an external current source. The current produces heat in a resistive
    element causing an error in the temperature measurements. The error is calculated
    by this formula: DeltaT= P ∗ S View Source Where, ‘T’ is temperature, ‘P’ is I
    squared power produced and‘S’ is a degree C/mill watt. •: ThermistorsThe other
    type of temperature sensor is a thermistor. It is relatively inexpensive, adaptable,
    and easy to use. When the temperature changes like RTD sensor it changes its resistance.
    Oxides of manganese &nickel are used in the manufacture of thermistor because
    they are susceptible to damages. So, these materials are called ceramic materials.
    Thermistor offers high sensitivity compared to resistor temperature detectors.
    In the thermistors temperature increases when the resistance decreases. so, thermistor
    has a negative temperature coefficient. Fig. 7. Thermistor temperature sensor
    Show All 2): Soil Moisture SensorIn the life of plant Soil moisture plays a key
    role. Nutrients in the soil solution provide the plant with the food it needs
    to grow. By using transpiration, water is the essential element for regulating
    the temperature. when growing in moist soil plant root elements are well developed.
    Excessive levels of soil moisture, however, can lead to anaerobic conditions that
    can promote the growth of plant and soil pathogens. Fig. 8. Soil moisture sensor
    Show All For measuring soil moisture tensiometric and volumetric are the two primary
    sensor types. Tensiometric sensors measure soil moisture tension. Tensiometers
    are sensitive to soil properties by measuring how tightly a particular soil type
    retains water. The actual volume of water in the soil is measured by volumetric
    sensor. Soil moisture sensors work with irrigation system by signaling the need
    for water and turning on the system. Soil moisture sensors can prevent sprinklers
    from coming on if there''s enough moisture in the soil. 3): Water Level SensorBased
    on the specific application of sensor wide spectrum of sensors is available in
    the market. Fig. 9. Water level sensor Show All Sensor is also called as humidity
    sensor because it is used for measuring humidity. It is also called as pressure
    sensor, because it is used for measuring pressure. sensor used for measurement
    of displacement is called position sensor and the principle used is sensing principle.
    The sensor used for measurement of fluid levels is called a level sensor. Base
    server/station-A base station is a wireless communication station. A base station
    is used to communicate and is installed at a fixed location. It is also called
    as a push-to-talk two-way radio system Data Analysis Table 1 Different agriculture
    values SECTION V. Practical Results End users can analyze output result in things
    peak application. That the below figure shows practical representation. This involved
    a lot of IoT devices. Fig. 10. Experimental setup Show All The below figure shows
    optimized results of temperature value of soil in the area field. Fig. 11. Analysis
    of temperature value Show All Fig. 12. Analysis of light value Show All The above

  description: The aim of this work is to address the water scarcity prevalent in
    our country through smart irrigation practices. In this work we take certain environmental
    factors such as soil moisture content into consideration for creating a sustainable
    and smart irrigation system. The models proposed here for the day to day estimation
    of evapotranspiration are derived by using the daily data parameters such as temperature,
    solar radiation, wind speed and humidity for a period of 4 years (2009–2013) from
    Karunya University’s meteorological station, at Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India.
    An Artificial Neural Network approach is adopted to run the software part using
    the environmental parameters and the output obtained from the ANN method with the
    least RMSE error is taken into account for the ETo value. The reliability of the
    computational models used are done based on the results achieved through two prominent
    empirical methods. These include Penman-Monteith equation and Hargreaves equation
    and comparing their respective Mean Square Errors (MSE) and also the Root Mean
    Square Errors (RMSE). Hargreaves method is suitable with the least RMSE error.
    In the hardware approach Hargreaves method has been implemented using Raspberry
    PI controller. The real-time data from the field controller is relayed to a hardware
    setup at the local base station. This is done through a wireless ZigBee protocol
    which eventually transmits the necessary data via a GPRS link to the remote station.
    The output volumetric water content was calculated using Crop coefficient ETC. Solenoid
    valves are remotely controlled to release a calculated value of water based on
    the data acquired at the local base station. This method of automated irrigation
    will mitigate the problems usually associated with farming and will finally result
    in generating greater yields of crop production.

    Introduction Agriculture is man’s oldest known profession. Even in the Indian
    Economy Agriculture output is an important component in calculating the GDP growth
    apart from providing sustenance to the entire population. In rural India, agriculture
    acts as a primary source of employment and trade. With globalization and exponential
    rise in population, the agriculture industry is facing a lot of more pressure
    than ever before. In the agricultural sector, according to statistics estimates
    that 60% of all the water taken for irrigation is taken from reservoirs, lakes
    and rivers alone. With the revolution in technology farmers and agriculturists
    across the globe have taken to more mechanized ways of irrigation to ensure judicious
    use of water. Even though we have many ways of irrigation the onus is always on
    to find the most efficient way to use water. The primary goal of agriculture is
    to provide safe, fresh food and staples to the public at the most reasonable price
    possible. The day to day demand on the agricultural sector makes it necessary
    to automate the overall irrigation process. This type of automated irrigation
    considers factors such as temperature, humidity and also the topography of the
    surrounding environment are taken into consideration. Therefore, to achieve a
    successful and high quality harvest it is necessary to design an irrigation system
    which takes all these factors into consideration. The main objective of irrigation
    is to provide plants with sufficient water to prevent stress that may reduce the
    yield. The frequency and quantity of water needed depends upon local climatic
    conditions, crop and stage of growth, and soil moisture plant characteristics.
    The quantity of water required can be determined in different ways which do not
    require the knowledge of “Evapotranspiration (ET)” rates. By using the reference
    Evapotranspiration (ETo), the Evapotranspiration (ET) rates can be calculated.
    Though the number of equations available to estimate ETo are available in abundance,
    the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith (FAO-56 PM) [1] equation along with Hargreaves equation
    are used for this work. Soft computing methods have proved to be superior and
    reliable in forecasting and estimating ETo [2]. The primary aim of this study
    is to study and select from different evapotranspiration methods such as Penman
    Monteith and Hargreaves method, the best method to estimate the daily reference
    evapotranspiration by running it through Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model.
    The data used for these methods is sourced from a meteorological station situated
    in the southern part of India. The results achieved above are compared with the
    reference values calculated through the Penman Monteith method. The product achieved
    by multiplying the reference evapotranspiration (ETo) and the crop coefficient
    (Kc) forms the term crop evapotranspiration (ETc) [3]. In the hardware approach
    drip irrigation has been laid for 4 rows and sensors has been placed. Using wireless
    sensor network in a real-time field for tomato plant has been demonstrated using
    raspberry pi controller by considering the best technique (MLP) using Hargreaves
    method was used. The real-time data in order to calculate the water required for
    irrigation based on the respective crop’s ‘Evapotranspiration’ coefficient. 2
    Drip Irrigation Drip irrigation is a process through which water and fertilizers
    used could be saved by allowing the aforementioned quantities to drip slowly,
    through a network of valves, pipes, tubes and emitters, thus reducing wastage
    of water and nutrients therefore improving the application efficiency in certain
    cases even up to 90%. The components involved include Pump, pipelines, fittings,
    lateral pipe, emitters, end cap, tee connector, straight connector. 3 Evapotranspiration
    3.1 Evapotranspiration Both the processes of Evaporation and transpiration tend
    to occur simultaneously and it isn’t easy to differentiate between both. The amount
    of solar radiation, reaching the soil surface is primarily used to determine the
    evaporation from a cropped soil. As the crop grows, the amount of solar radiation
    received by the plant reduces due to the increase in canopy shade area. In the
    initial part of crop development, the primary loss of water is due to soil evaporation
    whereas in the later stages it is due to transpiration. The FAO Penman-Monteith
    method based on expert consultation was recommended as the sole standard method
    for computing the reference evapotranspiration. This method requires certain parameter
    such as sunshine hours, solar radiation air humidity, air temperature and wind
    speed data. 3.2 Penman-Monteith Equation The FAO Penman-Monteith equation determines
    the evapotranspiration from the hypothetical grass reference surface and [1] provides
    a standard to which evapotranspiration in different periods of the year or in
    other regions can be compared and to which the evapotranspiration from other crops
    can be related $$ {\\text{ETo}} = \\frac{{0 \\cdot 408\\Delta \\left( {R_{\\text{n}}
    - G} \\right) + \\gamma \\frac{900}{T + 273}U_{2} \\left( {e_{\\text{s}} - e_{\\text{a}}
    } \\right)}}{{\\Delta + \\gamma \\left( {1 + 0 \\cdot 34U_{2} } \\right)}} $$
    (1) where, ETo reference evapotranspiration [mm day−1], Rn net radiation at the
    crop surface [MJ m−2 day−1], G soil heat flux density [MJ m−2 day−1], T air temperature
    at 2 m height [°C], u2 wind speed at 2 m height [m s−1], es saturation vapour
    pressure [kPa], ea actual vapour pressure [kPa], es–ea saturation vapour pressure
    deficit [kPa], D slope vapour pressure curve [kPa °C−1], g psychometric constant
    [kPa °C−1]. 3.3 Hargreaves Equation As [4] an alternative when solar radiation
    data, relative humidity data and/or wind speed data are missing, reference evapotranspiration,
    ETo (mm d-1), can be estimated using the Hargreaves equation [5]. The FAO-56 Hargreaves
    equation [3] for daily computation is given by: $$ {\\text{ETo}} = C_{H} (T_{{\\max}
    } {-}T_{{\\min} } )^{\\text{Eh}} \\left( {{\\text{T}}_{\\rm mean} + 17.8} \\right){\\text{Ra}}
    $$ (2) where Tmaxmaximum day temperature Tmin minimum day temperature, Ra extraterrestrial
    solar radiation, Environment constants Eh, CH 3.4 Crop Coefficient (ETc) The reference
    evapotranspiration rates are multiplied by a crop coefficient to calculate the
    crop evapotranspiration. Here the crop coefficient expresses the difference in
    evapotranspiration between the cropped and reference grass surface. The differences
    achieved with respect to the evaporation and transpiration between both the surfaces
    can be combined into a single coefficient or described separately [6]. Certain
    factors which determine the selection approach are the climatic data available,
    the time at which the calculations are executed, also the accuracy required, play
    a pivotal role. $$ {\\text{ET}}_{\\text{Crop}} = {\\text{ ETo}} *{\\text{Kc}}\\quad
    {\\text{mm}}/{\\text{day}} $$ (3) where ETo—Evapotranspiration, Kc-Crop Coefficient.
    The crop coefficient for tomato plant is given in Table 1. Table 1 Crop coefficient
    for tomato plant Full size table 4 Artificial Neural Network (ANN) ANN architecture
    is based on the structure and function of biological neural network. Similar to
    neurons in the brain ANN also consists of neurons which are arranged in various
    layers [7]. The popular neural network namely multilayer perceptron (MLP) consists
    of input layer to receive the external data to perform pattern recognition, output
    layer which gives the problem solution and hidden layer is an intermediate layer
    which separates the other layers. The adjacent neurons from input layer to output
    layer are connected through acyclic arcs. The MLP uses training algorithm to learn
    (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 Multilayer perceptron Full size image The datasets which modifies
    the neuron weights depending on the error rate between target and actual output.
    First, for model establishment, various networks like generalized regression neural
    network, radial basis function neural network, probabilistic neural network and
    multilayer perceptron network were selected because of its wide application and
    high accuracy [8]. Total 4 years of data of Karunya (Karunya University weather
    station) was taken and 3 years were considered for training and 1 year was considered
    for testing using different models of Artificial Neural Network. The statistical
    error was calculated for a given area and equation to predict the better model
    for evapotranspiration calculations. For a given data, the neural network acquires
    the data and generates an ETo value which is referenced with the one calculated
    by equations such as Penman and Hargreaves. The model with the least RMSE error
    is chosen and implemented (Fig. 2; Table 2). Fig. 2 Results for hargreaves equation
    Full size image Table 2 Statistical error achieved through penman and hargreaves
    model Full size table From the above table it is evident that among Generalized
    Regression Neural Network (GRNN), Probabilistic Neural Network, Radial Basis Function
    (RBF), the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is the least for the Multi-layer Perceptron
    Neutral Network model. Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN) is generally
    used extensively for function approximation and consists of layers such as radial
    basis layer and special linear layer. There is no need for an iterative training
    procedure here. It internally consists of four layers. Radial Basis Function Neural
    Network (RBF) has the abilities of quick training and generalization ability.
    The approximation of a non-linear object is done through RBF neural network. Multilayer
    Perceptron (MLP) is widely chosen for its ability ti solve tough and various issues.
    The output is influenced by several parameters to get the desired results. Probabilistic
    Neural Network (PNN) is a feed forward neural network, is used in pattern recognition
    problems and classification problems. This method ensures that mis-classification
    is minimized to a greater extent. 5 Study Area and Data The study area involves
    an agricultural plot rectangular in size amounting to 11 square yards, with 30
    tomato plants and 30 inline emitters. These plants are supplied by LDPE (Low Density
    Polyethylene) tubes which are 12 mm in diameter. The data such as temperature,
    solar radiation, wind speed and humidity are acquired for a period of 5 years
    from the meteorological station of Karunya University at Coimbatore (Latitude
    of 10.9397487° and Longitude of 76.7458484°), Tamilnadu, India. It is located
    in the Western Ghats in southern part of India which is surrounded by high mountains.
    6 Hardware Block Diagram 6.1 Hardware Implementation The hardware requirements
    for this setup require a Solar panel. Through the concept of photovoltaic effect,
    solar panels are used to generate electricity from the sun. A Lead Acid battery
    is used in this setup, this is dependable and inexpensive when calculated on a
    cost-per-watt base. Most common types of Lead Acid battery used are the gel type
    also known as Valve-Regulated Lead Acid (VRLA). The battery used in this system
    is Sealed Lead Acid battery to prevent the batteries from overcharging, a charge
    controller is used. This is basically a voltage cum current regulator which regulates
    the voltage and current coming from the solar panels to the battery. Charge controller
    used here is a 3 A controller for a Lead-acid Battery. In the area of sensor networks,
    devices such as Tran’s receivers play a very important role. It is necessary for
    sensor networks to use wireless modules to communicate and relay data. This setup
    uses one of the easiest modules named XBee wireless module. The Co-coordinator
    XBee is connected to the micro-controller board for transferring the data to processor.
    These are connected to the Transmitter and Receiver pins of the controller. An
    electronic component, model or subsystem whose primary aim is to act as a detector
    for detecting changes in the environment surrounding it and to further transmit
    the information to another processor or a data base is termed as a sensor. In
    Base station sensors used are Temperature, Humidity and Water Flow Sensor. The
    data of each sensor is logged in a coma separated value (csv) file in the system
    after a time interval. The first sensor used in this setup is a temperature and
    humidity sensor. This uses components such as a capacitive humidity sensor and
    thermistor to measure the surrounding air and transmits the digital signal on
    a data pin. One main disadvantage of this sensor is that the new data gets transmitted
    only once every 2 s. The temperature and humidity sensor used here works in the
    power range of 3–5 V and has maximum Input and Output current of 2.5 mA. The water
    flow sensor consists of parts such as a water rotor, valve body made out of plastic
    and a hall effect sensor. It works when the water flows through the rotor and
    the rotor rolls. The Hall Effect sensor further generates a consequent output
    based on the rotor rotation. This sensor was connected at the outlet-valve of
    the pump to measure the actual water applied to the plants each day. This sensor
    has a minimum dc working voltage of 4.5 V and a maximum working current of 15
    mA. It has a DC working voltage of 5–24 V. Soil Moisture sensor is used to sense
    the moisture content in the soil at a particular place. It gives out the analog
    signal which is connected to the ADC of the XBee [9]. Their range ranges from
    0 to 45% if volumetric water content in soil and has an accuracy of ±4% and power
    rating of 3 mA and 5 V DC supply. A relay circuit plays a crucial role in the
    hardware setup at the base station. A relay switch is used in this setup and the
    it has a coil which is driven by an NPN transistor switch. This switch acts in
    the cut-off region when base voltage of the transistor is zero. In such a condition
    no collector current flows into the base and no current flows through the relay
    coil too. Remote Sensor Node plays an important role in the whole system. This
    device is used to sense the soil moisture in the field and send the data to the
    base station. These are low power consuming unit with solar power and rechargeable
    Lithium ion battery for usage at time of inadequate solar radiation. These features
    include a programmable Charge Current Up to 1000 mA/Pre-set 4.2 V Charge Voltage
    with 1.5% Accuracy. A Raspberry pi is used as here which has a quad core ARMv8
    processor with 1.2 GHz clock speed. This is preferred for systems which require
    multitasking with high [10] speed and memory, for processing and storing the data
    obtained from remote sensor nodes. The programming language used in raspberry
    pi is Python. Python is versatile and provides multi-threading, hence two or more
    programs can run at same time using CPU time sharing. Both the equations are run
    through python and the results are noted (Figs. 3 and 4). Fig. 3 Overall block
    diagram of system Full size image Fig. 4 Overall setup of the system Full size
    image 7 Working The working of the system all starts with the deployment of remote
    sensor node in the field near to the tomato plant root at 20 mm safe distance.
    It reads the soil moisture content for every pre-set time interval and sends it
    to the base station, where the packets of data received by the co-coordinator
    XBee are decrypted and data is obtained. The obtained values are Remote Node Battery
    Voltage and soil moisture with the node address. Upon receiving this, base station
    senses the environment temperature and Humidity and then logs the data into a
    CSV file and at the same time to the cloud server. The data upon reaching a certain
    count are then imported into a new program and the required parameters are calculated
    for finding the ETc required for the tomato plant. The calculations and crop parameters
    are given in Table 1. Then the water required is calculated and the pump is turned
    ON, post this operation the water flow from the laterals are continuously monitored
    using water flow sensor, and upon reaching the calculated amount of water needed
    the pump will be turned OFF. All these process details are updated to the server,
    upon which a user can view in their personal devices in the form of a webpage.
    The volumetric analysis performed allows an average of 9.1(L)/day of water for
    the tomato crop on a daily basis. The calculations are achieved by applying the
    formulas below [11]. $$ {\\text{ETo}} = C_{H} \\left( {T_{ {\\max} } - T_{ {\\min}
    } } \\right)^{\\text{Eh}} \\left( {{\\text{T}}_{\\rm mean} + 17.8} \\right){\\text{Ra}}

    Database Server A data base server is generally a computer program which is tasked
    with providing database services for other computer programs and computers. Several
    DBMS softwares provide database-server functionality and some exclusively rely
    on a client-server model in order to access the database (Fig. 5). Fig. 5 Flowchart
    representing the working of the system Full size image 7.2 Cloud Computing Cloud
    computing is a recently developed type of computing which is based on the concept
    of sharing computer re sources rather than having other network related hardware
    to handle applications. Cloud computing is offered by various companies either
    as open source or a licensed version, for example IBM’s Blue Cloud. Cloud computing
    is used in this setup to make the data acquired by the local base station accessible
    for anyone anywhere (Fig. 6). Fig. 6 Cloud connected system Full size image 8

    and Communication Technologies (ICT) are used extensively. The foremost concern
    in the Indian Agricultural sector is the lack of efficient irrigation techniques.
    Drip irrigation to a certain extent solves this issue. By considering cum monitoring
    environmental parameters such as temperature, relative humidity, sunshine hours,
    the water required can be calculated. This enables us to efficiently use the natural
    resources available to us ensures that a high yield is achieved. The work done
    here highlights the need for a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) enables irrigation
    network. The most relevant input variables for predicting the evapotranspiration
    are found to be Minimum Temperature, Maximum Temperature, and Minimum Humidity,
    Maximum Humidity, Wind Speed and Sunshine hours. The Penman and Hargreaves equation
    are used to calculate the Evapotranspiration rates and these models are run in
    a python program which is fed into the Raspberry pi. The Raspberry pi acts as
    an interface between the soil and the computations involved. It is found that
    wind speed has minimum effect on evapotranspiration prediction. From the trained
    models for P-M and Hargreaves equation, Hargreaves equation was more accurate.
    For Karunya data, Hargreaves equations the root mean square error (RMSE) and Mean
    square error (MSE) obtained were 6 and 2.5%, showing, high accuracy for MLP which
    utilizes the most relevant input variables. The developed MLP model can be used
    for prediction of evapotranspiration rates for particular location depending on
    the environmental factors. Also, the hardware model was tested in the real time
    under an experimental setup in university premises. Thus, in conclusion, the proposed
    ANN technique increases the irrigation efficiency, which ultimately results in
    reducing the labor cost thus saving water and electricity. References Pandey,

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Semarang, Indonesia SECTION I. Introduction
    Greenhouse is a building which aims to modify the climate to meet the plants need.
    Greenhouse is generally used to produce crops outside the normal season [1]. The
    type of cover material in a greenhouse aims to make solar radiation easily absorbed
    by plants. Greenhouse cultivation method aims to make plants'' growth out of the
    natural environment and to make the environment control more optimal [2]. Greenhouse
    technology is used to provide a controlled microenvironment for optimal plant
    growth so that it can protect plants from unfavorable weather conditions [3].
    The control system needs to be done to control the environmental conditions of
    the greenhouse. The previous research which has been carried out by [4], in 2016
    on the greenhouse control system used fuzzy logic type Mamdani. Fuzzy logic type
    Mamdani is implemented to regulate the duration drip of plants to be more dynamic
    based on the the input values of greenhouse temperature and humidity [4]. The
    Mamdani control system is carried out to adjust the temperature and humidity in
    the greenhouse which refers to climate factors presented by the sigmoid curve
    [4]. Fuzzy logic type Mamdani is usually suited to intuitive problems rather that
    to handle control systems. The sigmoid curve has a weakness where the membership
    value range is equal to one shorter by [5] using cloud computing technology. Greenhouse
    automation systems controls temperature, humidity, soil moisture effectively [5].
    The system retrieve sensor acquisition data and send data to users through the
    cloud [5]. Cloud computing was designed using remote servers on the internet to
    manage, store and process data using a personal computer. Cloud computing has
    briefly transformed information technology dramatically by providing some enormous
    benefits for users of information technology, including eliminating information
    technology investments, scalability, proportional costs. However, cloud computing
    has a weakness: the more devices connected, the more network latency problems
    is experienced by the application [6]. Based on previous researches, [4] and [5],
    this study builds an information system using fuzzy rule-based to control and
    monitor climate parameters in fog-based greenhouses. Rule-based systems have benefit:
    the created rules can imitate human thinking and reasoning to facts that are known
    based on expert knowledge about the problems of a domain [7]. Fuzzy logic and
    rule based system can be combined to create rules that are very similar to natural
    languages, thus fuzzy rule-based can make information extracted from rules so
    that they are easier to understand [8]. Fuzzy rule-based systems can work in fog
    network and can provide problem information from the input provided [9]. The fuzzy
    rule-based system type Tsukamoto has the advantage of having high accuracy and
    high interpretation of data [10]. Fog computing is used as a computing paradigm
    between cloud data centers and IoT devices [11]. Fog uses a network device called
    fog node to process data collection form IoT so that it doesn''t experience network
    latency problems. Fog computing is a promising computing technology that is able
    to overcome network latency problems during the process of collecting data form
    IoT [6]. In this study, the fog network is able to handle network latency problems
    in real-time while sensor data acquisition, and bandwidth is more efficient compared
    to cloud networks. Fuzzy rule-based is implemented to determine the proper rule
    for trip duration which is appropriate with the data of temperature variable,
    soil moisture, humidity and intensity variable. The data of variables was obtained
    from the result of the greenhouse observation. Thus, the controlling system in
    greenhouse is more efficient and more superior that the previous research. SECTION
    II. Related Work A. Fuzzy Rule-Based Fuzzy rule-based basically comes from fuzzy
    logic and fuzzy set theory [12]. Fuzzy logic and rule-based system are combined
    into fuzzy rule-based. Three are three popular types of fuzzy rule-based, they
    are Mamdani, Sugeno, and Tsukamoto. Fuzzy rule-based generally applied to problems
    classification, such as output or discrete values. Fuzzy rule-based system are
    a classic rule system that is one of the most important fields of fuzzy set application
    and fuzzy logic [8]. Fuzzy rule-based systems are successfully applied to various
    problem in different domains in the uncertainty and obscurity of problems [10].
    Several forms of membership function are used in fuzzy rule-based, such as trapezoid,
    triangular and rectangular [8]. Trapezoid membership function can be seen as a
    generalizing triangle and rectangular membership function. At the testing stage,
    fuzzy classification involves five important steps namely fuzzification, application,
    implication, aggregation, and defuzzification. Triangle Fuzzy A[x], can be presented
    by A (a, b, c; 1) with the membership function μ [x] shown in Figure 1 [12]. Fig.
    1. Triangle fuzzy membership function [12]. Show All The formula for the triangle
    membership function is as follows [12]. μ[x]= ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ 0, (x−a)/(b−a), 1,
    (c−x)/(c−b),   x≤a or x≥c;         a≤x≤b;                x=b;         b≤x≤c. (1)
    View Source Trapezoid fuzzy shown in Figure 2. Fig. 2. Trapezoid fuzzy membership
    function [13]. Show All The formula for the trapezoid membership function is as
    follows [13]. f T (x)= ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ 0, (x−a)/(b−a), 1, (d−x)/(d−c), x≤a or x≥d;          a<x<b;           b≤x≤c;            c<x<d.
    (2) View Source B. Fog Computing As a new computing paradigm, fog computing is
    able to expand cloud computing and services to the network edge. Fog computing
    has several advantages dealing with computation, communication, control, storage
    and service on the edge of the network. The fact is that computational computing
    is an extension of cloud computing, not as a substitute for cloud computing [14].
    There are two categories of fog nodes namely Fog Gateway Nodes (FNG) and Fog Computational
    Nodes (FCN), as shown in Figure 3 [11]. Fig. 3. Fog organization [11]. Show All
    C. Greenhouse A greenhouse is a building that function to modify the climate based
    on plants'' need. Greenhouse is used to produce food crops and flowers outside
    the normal season. Greenhouses has similar structures with conservatories: the
    rooms that usually attached to houses provide living space for plants and humans
    [1]. The shape of a greenhouse is characterized into five different types. Greenhouses
    are most commonly used in hot and arid environments, namely Quonsets, arch-tunnels,
    even-span and uneven-span [17]. D. Chilies Chilies require temperature, soil moisture,
    air humidity, and optimal intensity. Chili plants can growth well at temperature
    of 20–30 °C, Soil moisture of 60-80%, air humidity from 50 to 70 and intensity
    of 3,000-10,000 [18]. SECTION III. Realization Fuzzy Rule-Based for System Controlling
    Plant Growth Parameters in Greenhouse Using Fog A. Instrumentation The instruments
    used in this study consist of hardware and software. The hardware used to support
    the system building are computer and an Acer Aspire laptop. The specifications
    of Acer are intel processor core i3327U, Windows 10 Pro, and RAM 4.0 Gb. The other
    hardwares used to support the design of fog network architecture''s building are
    sensors of SHT-11, YL-39, BH-1750, Microcontroller WIFI ESP8266, DAQ-SYSTEM, WIFI

    of Fog Model The system for controlling plant growth parameters in a greenhouse
    uses a fog network consisting of sensor nodes and fog servers. The data needed
    in this study are temperature, humidity, soil moisture and intensity. The control
    system is built using an ESP8255 Microcontroller which has connected the sensor
    data acquisition system and data communication system using WIFI. The design of
    the fog network system for the greenhouse control system in this study is shown

    (SHT-11), soil moisture sensors (YL-39) and intensity sensors (BH-1750). The ESP8266
    Microcontroller is programmed to read SHT-11 sensors, YL-39 sensors and BH-1750
    sensors with the TWI protocol. The design of the fog network system for a climate
    control system in a greenhouse is shown in Figure 6. Fig. 6. Fog network system
    design in greenhouses. Show All In this study using two gateways, namely WIFI
    network for data communication in the fog area and internet network in the cloud
    area. Climate parameter data obtained from sensor data acquisition using the fog
    network. In this study Arduino IDE is set to produce data acquisition every once
    a minute. Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) as a publisher block sends
    sensor acquisition data. After the sensor acquisition data is obtained, it is
    then stored in the database on the local monitor. Sensor acquisition data is sent
    by a cloud server to interface user for processing fuzzy rule-based using web-based
    programming. The system framework for controlling plant growth parameters in a
    greenhouse using fog networks are shown in Figure 7. Fig. 7. Control system framework.

    success of the system work D. The Testing of Cloud and Fog Network Performance
    The result of transmission time shows that using fog network is faster that cloud
    network. The average of data''s speed for fog network is 471 ms, while the speed
    of data transmission for cloud network is up to 1349 ms. The speed is affected
    by the network architecture, such as the using of fog network, the measurement
    data of object from sensors in the shorter range network. SECTION V. Conclusion
    The controlling system parameters of growing plants in greenhouse using fog network
    technology has been improved successfully. The system does not experience the
    latency problem during the collecting data in a real-time. The controlling systems
    in greenhouse is more efficient because it is supported by fog network technology.
    The simulation using fuzzy rule-based algorithm in PHP programming language obtained
    watering control can be done remotely and the duration of watering is also adjusted
    to the climate conditions in the greenhouse so that it can reduce the risk of
    dead plants due to the influence of uncertain climate factors. Authors Figures

  description: All glaciers are subject to mass fluctuations in the current context
    of climate change. For daily requirements like food, drink, irrigation, and the
    generation of hydroelectric power, these glaciers provide water to important basins
    including the Indus, Ganga, and Brahmaputra. Changes in glacier patterns are a
    blatant sign of local climate variability. Monitoring of glaciers requires long-term
    studies on glacier dynamics. Himalayan glaciers, because of their disposition
    in a complex topographic setting and inaccessible terrain render difficulty in
    the glacier observations in a continuous mode. Glacier mass fluctuations can be
    associated with glacier area shrinkage or expansion and concomitant snout shift.
    In the current study, two adjoining glaciers of different sizes, Pensilungpa and
    Drang Drung glaciers in the Zanskar Valley, Ladakh, India are selected. The period
    of the study was taken between the years 2000–2022. Earlier studies used a single
    day per year Accumulation Area Ratio (AAR) method to compute mass balance, which
    had limitations due to snow cover variability. The present study calculated and
    averaged all the AAR values for cloud-free images per year during the peak ablation
    period (mid-July to early September). Digital Elevation Model (DEM) difference
    technique was also employed for computing the mass budget between 2000 and 2021
    b y utilizing two-time period DEMs. It was revealed that in the case of the AAR
    method, the Pensilungpa glacier showed 7 years of positive and 16 years of negative
    mass balance. The years 2003–2005 and 2011 to 2016 were depicted with negative
    mass balance with the highest value up to −0.752-m water equivalent (m.w.e.) for
    the year 2015. It has negligible areal fluctuations ranging from 0.01 to 0.6 km2.
    Drang Drung Glacier has shown 12 years of positive and 11 years of negative mass
    balance. The years 2002–2004 and 2009 to 2012 were depicted with positive mass
    balance with the highest value up to 0.305 m. w.e. Except, for the year 2009–2012
    (areal increment ∼ 2.65 km2), years 2013–2015 showed a negative mass balance with
    negligible areal fluctuations. Mass balance estimation using DEM differencing
    method revealed an average estimated mass balance of −0.03 m. w.e. For Pensilungpa
    glacier though, it is 0.08 m. w.e. For Drang Drung glacier which shows good matches
    with the mass balance estimated using AAR method in m. w.e. Such contrasting behavior
    of mass balance suggests higher sensitivity of smaller glaciers to climate change.

    commonly known as the “Water Tower of Asia,” are home to one of the world''s greatest
    mountain glacier networks (Bolch et al., 2012). The Himalayan glaciers, which
    have a wide range of topographical and morphological characteristics, are distinct
    from the Inner Asian and European Alpine glaciers in that they have fewer condensed
    valleys, slopes that can cause avalanches, and ablation zones that are heavily
    covered in debris (Benn and Lehmkuhl, 2000; Scherler et al., 2011). For daily
    requirements like food, drink, irrigation, and the generation of hydroelectric
    power, these glaciers provide water to important basins including the Indus, Ganga,
    and Brahmaputra (Immerzeel et al., 2012; Tawde et al., 2017). According to Lepparanta
    and Granberg (2010), changes in glacier patterns are a blatant sign of local climate
    variability and climate change. Along with meteorological influences, geography,
    and morphometric traits also control changes in glacier systems (Ghosh and Pandey,
    2013). The Hindu Kush-Karakoram-Himalayan range has seen retreating glacier fronts
    since the middle of the 19th century (Bolch et al., 2012; Dehecq et al., 2019).
    Approximately 17% of the Himalayan mountain area is covered by glaciers (Ahmad
    et al., 2004). The climate change impact on the glacier system is the focal key
    for understanding and forecasting the global environment (Dehecq et al., 2019).
    Climate change directly influences the overall health (width, area, and mass)
    of the glaciers (Poddar and Pandey, 2014). Therefore, to understand the impact
    of climate change, the study of glaciated regions is of major concern (Bahuguna
    et al., 2014). Overall cumulative river basin runoff from the Himalayan catchment
    reflects the contribution from rivers and glacier melting (Immerzeel et al., 2009).
    During the last century on account of climate change, around 12.5% of the Himalayan
    glaciers have retreated (Bahuguna et al., 2014; Bhambri and Bolch, 2009; Prasad
    et al., 2009) with annual snout fluctuations between 16 and 35 m (Dobhal and Thayyen,
    2004). During the years 1962–2001, parts of Zanskar Valley, Ladakh, India depicted
    with glacier areal retreat of 18.16% with a snout retreat of 6–33 m/year (Nathawat
    et al., 2008). According to recent studies, the Himalayas, the Alps, the Andes,
    and the Rocky Mountains have shown wide-scale retreats (Kulkarni et al., 2002).
    Mass balance estimation is imperative to understand the spatiotemporal changes
    in the glacier area, length, and volume. In order to map the impact of changing
    climate, studies related to growth/shrinkage, motion, thickness as well as the
    mass exchange of glaciers are important (Bhattacharjee and Pandey, 2023; Kaser
    et al., 2003). All glaciers signify climate change by indicating their mass fluctuations,
    which can be either decreasing or increasing (Lepparanta and Granberg, 2010).
    The position of the glacier snout and glacier area can be reflected by mass fluctuations.
    Studies of long-term mass balance are required for monitoring the health of any
    glacier (Bolch et al., 2012). Remote sensing methods have been used extensively
    to map glacial patterns in regions with rugged terrain conditions, rough weather,
    and logistic issues like the Himalayan glaciers (Racoviteanu et al., 2008; Li
    et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2010). In general, the mass budget of a valley glacier
    is calculated using the stratigraphic/glaciological method, the hydrological method,
    and the geodetic method (Ostrem and Stanley, 1969). In India, in-situ glaciological
    mass balance observations are confined to a few glaciers and are limited to a
    few years which makes satellite-based remote sensing techniques more reliable
    (Azam et al., 2018; Kulkarni, 1992; Macgregor et al., 2005; Wagnon et al., 2007).
    The utility of Equilibrium line altitude (ELA) and AAR methods to compute glacier
    mass balance over the Himalayas is well documented (Bhattacharjee and Pandey,
    2021; Pandey et al., 2011; Poddar and Pandey, 2014; Kulkarni, 1992). Kulkarni
    (1992) showed the best fit AAR method by establishing regression relations between
    AAR and mass balance developed by field glaciological observations for the Himalayan
    range. The use of the AAR approach in a recent study by Bhattacharjee and Pandey
    (2021) in the Himalayan-Karakoram region on select 13 glaciers between 1996 and
    2021 demonstrated an increasing trend of mass loss as the glaciers moved from
    the Karakoram Range to the Eastern Himalayas. The hydrological method was used
    for computing the mass balance of the Siachen glacier of Nubra Valley (Bhutiyani,
    1999). Another traditional method is called DEM differencing which uses remote
    sensing and surveying imagery to compute mass balance estimates. It is an indirect
    approach for estimating mass balance that computes the difference between surface
    elevations from DEMs developed from historical topographic data and remotely sensed
    products such as Satellite pour l''Observation de la Terre (SPOT), Shuttle Radar
    Topography Mission (SRTM), and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection
    Radiometer (ASTER) (Berthier et al., 2007). Glacier mass changes were studied
    on select six glaciers in parts of Zanskar Valley, Ladakh, India using AAR-ELA
    methods over a continuous period from 2000 to 2010 with Landsat and Indian Remote
    Sensing (IRS) satellite images revealed that glaciers experienced negative mass
    balance for years 2000, 2001, 2004, and 2008. For the remaining years, glaciers
    gained mass which indicated as compared to the mass gain, mass loss was marginal
    (Poddar and Pandey, 2014). In Jammu & Kashmir (Greater Himalayan range), India,
    patterns of temporal glacier variability of 34 glaciers during 3 periods of observation
    based on IRS and Landsat satellite datasets were carried out. The results showed
    an area shrinkage of 1.5% for all glaciers during the first period (1975–1992)
    with a snout retreat rate of 3–42 m per year which further rose to 4% with a snout
    retreat rate of 0–88 m per year in the second period (1992–2001). The third period
    (2001–2007) has shown similar behavior to the second. (Pandey et al., 2011). A
    study using the AAR-ELA method in the parts of Zanskar Valley revealed a transition
    of mass balance measurements from positive (∼42.61 cm) to negative (∼−13.17 cm)
    between the years 1980–2000 and 2000–2011 (Ali et al., 2014). A study on glacier
    mass balance using the DEM differencing method over the central Nyainqentanglha
    Range for the duration of 1968–2013 using topographical maps, TanDEM-X and SRTM
    DEM revealed a significant mass loss of 0.46 ± 0.04 m. w.e. Per annum since 1968,
    with exceedingly more diminishing/thinning at the debris-covered part than the
    smoothened clean ice (Kunpeng et al., 2019). Mass balance estimates of glaciers
    of the Pamir mountains in central Asia shown by Zhou et al. (2019) using KH-9
    imagery and SRTM DEM during the study period (1975–1999) revealed values of −0.03
    ± 0.24 m. w.e. Per annum. The present study focuses on analyzing two adjoining
    glaciers of different sizes: Pensilungpa and Durung Drung glaciers in the Zanskar
    Valley, Ladakh, India. Mass balance was modeled over a continuous period from
    the years 2000–2022 using the AAR and DEM differencing methods for comparison.
    2. Study area The study area (Fig. 1) incorporates Zanskar Valley (elevation ∼
    3700–6400 m), in the south of Ladakh, Greater Himalayan range, India. During extensively
    long winter periods (November to late April), most of the precipitation occurs
    as snowfall. The Zanskar Valley''s southwestern and northeastern halves are where
    the highest and lowest relief regions exist. During the winter, which typically
    lasts from mid-October to May, nearly the whole valley is blanketed in a thick
    layer of snow. In the Zanskar Valley, the wintertime temperature hovers around
    −20° Celsius. May marks the start of the summer season, and temperatures rise
    pretty quickly. In comparison to other regions of Ladakh, the summer season lasts
    comparatively longer, till August. Heavy snowfall occurs in the more northern
    and western mountains during the winter, with moisture provided by mid-latitude
    westerlies (Owen and Benn, 2005). Although a good crop thrives in the broad valley
    of the Padam area throughout the summer, the high slope lacks any tree cover.

    1. Location map showing Pensilungpa and Drang Drung glaciers in Zanskar Valley,
    Ladakh, India. There are a series of glaciers in Zanskar Valley that can be easily
    mapped using satellite imagery. Two adjoining glaciers, Pensilungpa and Durung
    Drung have been selected at the northwest corner of the valley with longitudinal
    extensions from 76⁰12′E−76⁰26′E and latitudinal extensions from 33⁰41′N-33⁰51′N.
    Pensilungpa glacier is a small glacier (area = 15 km2) with the majority of its
    ablation zone being debris-covered (Table 1). The glacier is 8.34 km long which
    lies in an average relief of 5178 m. River Suru originates from the snout (altitude
    ∼ 4700 m) of this glacier. Drang Drung Glacier is a larger glacier (area = 71.5
    km2) and is mostly debris-free (Table 1). The glacier is about 21 km long which
    lies in an average relief of 5185 m. River Stod originates from the snout (altitude
    ∼ 4160 m) of this glacier and flows in the opposite direction to the Suru River.
    Details on the morphometric parameters for both glaciers were presented in Table
    1. Table 1. Parameterization of selected glaciers. Glaciers Area (km2) Perimeter

    Landsat satellite data (resolution ∼ 30 m) acquired from the United States Geological
    Survey (USGS) Earth Explorer was used based on satellite scene availability and
    clarity with reference to snow cover, cloud, and shadow. Two-time period DEMs
    were also used. NASA-SRTM Global DEM v003 (horizontal resolution ∼ 30 m) for the
    year 2000 and ASTER DEM (ASTER 14 DMO) of resolution 30 m for the year 2021 was
    obtained from NASA Earth Data Explorer. Global air temperature data for the months
    of July and August from the National Centre for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) (resolution
    ∼ 0.5 × 0.5°) was used for temperature analysis. The datasets used in the present
    study, their resolution, purpose, and sources were given in Table 2. Table 2.

    4. Methodology 4.1. Mass balance 4.1.1. AAR method In the present study, Landsat
    satellite images (Fig. 2) from the period 2000 to 2022 were used to delineate
    and map glacier boundaries. For obtaining minimum snow cover and exposed glacier
    i.e. for the peak ablation period, images from mid-July to early September were
    preferred. Glacier boundaries have been mapped using a SWIR-red-green band combination.
    Before mapping glacier boundaries, the Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI)
    (equation (1)) was computed using visible (high reflectance of snow) and SWIR
    (total absorption) bands for effective differentiation of snow from bright soil,
    rock, and clouds, etc. (Hall et al., 1995). (1) NDSI = (Green – SWIR) / (Green

    image Fig. 2. Methodological flowchart for the present study. After obtaining
    the proper glacier boundary and respective atmospheric corrections, the satellite
    image was draped over the DEM for understanding the topographic variability. Indices
    like NDSI and band ratio (NIR/SWIR) have been used to distinguish accumulation
    from ablation zone. To minimize the effect of errors, digital image processing
    techniques such as adaptive (for detecting edges), crisp (for enhancing slope
    variability), and morphological (for smoothening) filters have been used. Unsupervised
    classification has also been performed for segregating accumulation with ablation
    areas. Earlier studies have used a single day per year AAR value for computing
    mass balance which can induce a lot of error due to the variability of snow cover
    (Kulkarni et al., 2004; Poddar and Pandey, 2014). For addressing this issue, AAR
    values were computed for all the cloud-free images between mid-July to early September
    and then averaged for discarding this single-day-per-year induced error. Calculation
    of accumulation area ratio was performed using the expression (equation (2)):
    (2) AAR = (Accumulation area) / (Total area) Kulkarni et al. (2004) developed
    a regression relationship (equation (3)) between in-situ-based mass balance data
    and AAR estimates for Shaune Garang and Gor Garang glaciers in the western Himalayas,
    yielding a correlation of 0.8. (3) Specific Mass balance (in cm.w.e) = 243.01*AAR-120.187
    According to equation (3), there should be a neutral or almost zero mass balance
    when AAR equals 0.5, for the western Himalayas. Hence due to similar climatic
    patterns of the western Himalayas, the same equation was used to compute the long-term
    mass balance of both the adjoining glaciers of Zanskar Valley, as the field-based
    long-term mass balance is not available for the region. 4.1.2. DEM differencing
    method Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) altimetry data downloaded
    from National Snow and Ice Data Centre (NSIDC) for the same area was used for
    penetration bias correction. Generally, SRTM C-band penetrates through the medium
    which introduces penetration biases (Nuth and Kaab, 2011). Non-glaciated terrain
    is stable and cannot move. Thus, stable terrain was selected with the help of
    the slope. Over the stable terrain, SRTM elevation values were extracted into
    the ICESat points for computing absolute accuracy and discarding the penetration
    biases. The precision of the product produced by DEM differencing is hampered
    by the horizontal and vertical offsets associated with both DEMs as a result of
    their capture at different times by different satellites in distinct datums. Therefore,
    elevation-dependent bias was discarded after co-registering both DEMs to eliminate
    registration-oriented errors (Nuth and Kaab, 2011). First, non-stable topography
    (i.e. glaciers) was removed from both DEMs. Then, using the universal co-registration
    model (equation (4)), which considers terrain slope and aspect, the planimetric
    adjustment/co-registration of both DEMs for stable (non-glacierized) terrain was
    carried out (Nuth and Kaab, 2011). (4) dh = a.cos(b - ᴪ).tan.α + dH Where dh is
    the independent elevation difference, α is the terrain slope, and ᴪ is the terrain
    aspect. The cosine function''s (a, b, and dH) parameters stand for shifts in the
    horizontal direction of the dh, a directional shift vector, and an overall elevation
    bias. These parameters were solved using the least-squares approach. The shift
    in the orientations of the horizontal (a) and directional vector (b) are negligible
    because both DEMs had the same spatial resolution (30 m), while the bias in elevation
    (dH) was adjusted using equation (4). In this scenario, three iterations were
    completed before the bias in elevation was close to zero. Elevation-dependent
    biases result from the spatially asymmetric distribution of GCPs in 3-D coordinate
    planes. The height-dependent bias was eliminated using a second-order polynomial
    correlation (equation (5)) provided by Nuth and Kaab (2011) that depicts the link
    between elevation and elevation difference over terrain without glaciers. Agarwal
    et al. (2017) also employed this trend correction. (5) dh = Σ kn.Zn + τ Where
    dh is the elevation difference, Z is the elevation, k, and τ are regression parameters
    and the order of the polynomial is represented by n (in this case 2). Some points
    in the stable terrain were collected and uncertainty in elevation difference was
    ascertained by computing Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) (Xu et al., 2022). By subtracting
    the elevation of the years 2021 and 2000, the elevation change was calculated.
    Equation (6) (Cogley, 2011) was used to determine the glacier mass balance utilizing
    elevation change, glacier area, and glacial ice density: (6) Where is the mean
    glacier area for years 2000 and 2021, B is the glacier mass balance in m. w.e.,
    is the change in glacier volume (calculated using elevation change), and and are
    the densities of the ice (∼850 kg/m3) and water (∼997 kg/m3). Uncertainty in mass
    balance has been carried out using equation (7) which is obtained by differentiating
    equation (6): (7) Uncertainty in the volume change can be obtained by using uncertainties
    in the ice thickness change and glacier boundary area. Uncertainty in the ice
    density was taken as ±60 kg/m3 and uncertainty in the mean glacier area can be
    computed using the method suggested by Pfeffer et al. (2014). 5. Results & discussions
    5.1. Mass balance 5.1.1. AAR method Mapping of both Pensilungpa and Drang Drung
    glaciers was performed for the period 2000–2022. After obtaining accumulation
    areas of both glaciers (using the methodology detailed in Section 4), the study
    found that Pensilungpa glacier (Fig. 3a) observed 7 years of positive and 16 years
    of negative mass balance. The years 2003–2005 and 2011 to 2016 were depicted with
    negative mass balance with the highest value up to −75.23-cm water equivalent
    (cm.w.e.) for the year 2015. Additionally, the consistency of negative mass balance
    from the year 2020–2022 was also witnessed. The year 2008 shows a higher negative
    mass balance value up to 80 cm. w. e. Between positive mass balance years 2006,
    2007, 2009, and 2010. Drang Drung glacier (Fig. 3b) shows 12 years of positive
    and 11 years of negative mass balance. The years 2002–2004 and 2009 to 2012 were
    depicted with positive mass balance with the highest value up to 30.5 cm. w. e.
    Except, for the years 2009–2012 (areal increment ∼ 2.65 km2), years 2013–2015
    showed a negative mass balance with negligible areal fluctuations However, the
    consistency of negative mass balance from the year 2020–2022 was observed as was
    for the Pensilungpa Glacier. Download : Download high-res image (565KB) Download

    glaciers during 2000–2022. Both glaciers witnessed similar mass balance patterns
    for some of the same years viz. 2000–2001, 2006–2007, 2013–2015, and 2020–2022
    due to snowfall variability in the peak ablation period. After converting the
    specific mass balance from cm. w.e. To m. w.e., the results have been validated
    with field-based mass balance data of the Chotta Shigri glacier (Table 3) of Himachal
    Pradesh in Western Himalaya computed by Wagnon et al. (2007); JNU-SAC (2008);
    JNU-IFCPAR (2009); Jnu Dst (2011) for years 2008, 2009 and 2010. Table 3. Comparison

    generated from temporal DEMs along with the corresponding mass balance estimates.
    High elevation difference indicates an increase in elevation at that particular
    pixel due to snowfall, or avalanche. Over that time period, whereas negative elevation
    difference indicates a decrease in height due to melting, and deformation. Therefore,
    a positive elevation difference indicates positive mass balance and a negative
    elevation difference represents negative mass balance. The study revealed that
    the glacier elevation differences ranged from < −40 to 46 m. Average elevation
    changes for Pensilungpa glacier lay in the range from −11 to 15 m. Negative changes
    at the junction of the tributary glacier to the main glacier represent thinning
    and which leads to fragmentation of the glacier (Vijay and Braun, 2018). Drang
    Drung glacier (average elevation changes ∼ −18 to 17 m) depicted the dominance
    of positive elevation changes with negative changes near the snout region reflecting
    glaciation of the snout zone. Radiation absorption by clean ice and the higher
    temperature at lower altitudes seemed to be the possible reason for the maximum
    thinning at the terminus of the Drang Drung Glacier (Vijay and Braun, 2018). These
    elevation differences were validated by the results obtained for the Pensilungpa
    glacier shown by Pandey et al. (2012). They used the Survey of India (SOI) toposheet
    and ASTER DEM during the study period (1962–2007) which revealed an increment
    of 30–90 m of glacier elevation in the accumulation zone and a similar decrement
    in the ablation zone was witnessed. Download : Download high-res image (2MB) Download

    between 2000 and 2021. 5.1.3. Comparison of mass balance estimates Average values
    of mass balance over accumulation and ablation zones were extracted and compared
    with the calculated mass balance using the AAR method. AAR-based mass balance
    has given average values of −0.09 and 0.16 m. w.e. For Pensilungpa and Drang Drung
    glaciers. Average values of mass balance over the glaciers obtained from the DEM
    differencing method have shown −0.03 m. w.e. For Pensilungpa and 0.09 m. w.e.
    For Durung Drung glacier holding a good correlation with the values obtained by
    the AAR method. These results are validated by the mass balance results of glaciers
    of the Pamir mountains in central Asia shown by Zhou et al. (2019) using KH-9
    imagery and SRTM DEM during the study period (1975–1999) which revealed values
    of −0.03 ± 0.24 m. w.e. Per annum. The results are also validated by the elevation
    difference of the glaciers in the Zanskar region shown by Vijay and Braun (2018)
    using interferometric SRTM and bistatic TanDEM-X DEMs during the study period
    (2000–2012) which revealed values of −0.19 ± 0.22 m/yr. The study also revealed
    that while computing height difference, some traces of a major height gap is observed
    in the range of −40 to −25 m in the lower accumulation reaches of Pensilungpa
    glacier and nearby snout areas of Drang Drung glacier which represents the development
    of longitudinal crevasses and supraglacial erosional features (Dobreva et al.,
    2017; Vijay and Braun, 2018). The crevasses can be considered an indicator of
    glacial deformation and future glacial lake formation. 5.2. Glacial dynamics Pensilungpa
    glacier area (Fig. 5a) increased during 2005 (∼15.6 km2), 2006 (∼15.58 km2), 2016
    (∼15.15 km2), and 2017 (∼15.2 km2) and was mostly stable from 2000 to 2003 (∼14.65
    km2), 2007 to 2015 (∼14.7 km2), and from 2018 to 2020 (∼14.57 km2). During the
    years 2000–2005, area change ranged between 0 and 0.6 km2 with snout fluctuation
    of 1 m/yr. The snout retreated up to 4.3 m/yr with a net areal retreat of 1 km2
    between the years 2005 and 2019. The area change for Drang Drung Glacier (Fig.
    5b) is small and varied between 71.8 and 71.2 km2. Glacier was stable from the
    year 2000–2009 (71.75–71.85 km2) with the snout retreating up to 2.8 m/yr. A net
    areal fluctuation of 0.6 km2 with an increased snout shift of 6 m/yr was observed
    between the years 2009 and 2019. Download : Download high-res image (806KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Glacier area changes (a) Pensilungpa (b) Drang
    Drung glaciers during 2000–2022. During the years 2000–2003, the Pensilungpa Glacier
    area was stagnant and the mass balance increased a little. The mass balance increased
    incredibly in the year 2002 (∼22.32 cm. w.e.) due to the snowfall in the acquisition
    month of the satellite (Ghosh and Pandey, 2013). Glacier area increased during
    the period 2004–2006 and so did the mass balance (−40.5 to 21.42 cm. w.e.). Mass
    balance decreased rapidly between 2006 and 2008 (21.42 to −79.55 cm. w.e.) which
    was due to the rapid rate of glacier areal thinning. The year 2009 depicted a
    rapid rise in mass balance (∼36.22 cm. w.e.) due to the snowfall in the acquisition
    month of the satellite. During the years 2009–2011, the Pensilungpa Glacier area
    decreased so did the mass balance (36.22 to −3.42 cm. w.e.). An increasing-decreasing
    behavior in glacier area and mass balance was observed between the years 2011–2015.
    The mass balance increased incredibly between 2015 and 2017 (−72.42 to 9.92 cm.
    w.e.) due to the rapid rate of glacier areal increment. Glacier area decreased
    during the period 2017–2018 and so did the mass balance (9.92 to −70.62 cm. w.e.).
    Continuous series of negative mass balances were observed during the years 2020–2022
    (−54.33 to −44.32 cm. w.e.) due to glacier areal thinning. The study by Rana et
    al. (2023) for Parkachik Glacier, Zanskar Valley also observed a major glacial
    retreat after the year 2015. During the years 2000–2006, the Drang Drung Glacier
    area was stagnant and the mass balance increased (−43.42 to 29.67 cm. w.e.). A
    similar pattern of areal fluctuations and mass balance was observed between the
    period 2006–2009. Glacier area decreased rapidly during the period 2009–2013 but
    the glacier maintained a stagnant mass balance (∼15.96 cm. w.e.) during 2009–2012
    and further decreased (∼– 17.42 cm. w.e.) in the year 2013. The glacier area was
    stagnant during the period 2013–2015 and so did the mass balance (−17.42 to −18.76
    cm. w.e.). The mass balance increased incredibly between 2015 and 2017 (−21.47
    to 19.97 cm. w.e.) due to the rapid rate of glacier areal increment. An increasing-decreasing
    behavior in glacier area and mass balance was observed between the years 2017–2020.
    Years between 2020 and 2022 were depicted with an area decrement but the mass
    balance increased (−33.33 to −8.48 cm. w.e.). There was a decrement in the glacier
    mass balance after the year 2009 which is possibly linked with the areal shrinkage
    of the glacier. The linkages between glacial dynamics and mass balance indicated
    a direct relationship. Meanwhile, Pensilungpa Glacier due to its smaller size
    was more sensitive to glacier areal fluctuations. The sensitivity of small glaciers
    of Zanskar Valley to areal fluctuations was also observed by Rana et al. (2023).
    As Pensilungpa Glacier is partially debris-covered, hence the reason can also
    be attributed to the fact that glacier melting is also triggered by variable debris
    thickness (Mehta et al., 2021, 2023). 5.3. Air temperature Temperature conditions
    over both the glaciers (Fig. 6) in the lower ablation zone or glacier snout were
    analyzed, for the period of study (2000–2022) in the month of August. A temperature
    of around −6 °C was recorded in the years 2001, 2002, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2013,
    2015, 2016, and 2020. An average temperature of −2 °C was mostly recorded during
    the study period and the years 2003 and 2017 recorded high-temperature up to 2
    °C. The years 2003 and 2017 witnessed a sudden increase in temperature from −6
    °C to 2 °C and then between the years 2003–2005, the temperature further decreased
    to −7 °C. The years 2020–2022 depicted a rise in temperature. Download : Download
    high-res image (386KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Specific mass
    balance Vs Average Air Temperature. During the years 2000–2002, the air temperature
    decreased and the mass balance of the glaciers increased. The temperature increased
    from 2002 to 2004 but both glaciers have shown variable behavior. The Pensilungpa
    Glacier was depicted with a negative mass balance whereas Drang Drung Glacier
    was stagnant during 2002–2004. The years 2004–2007 have shown a similar pattern
    as the years 2000–2002 viz. A decrement in air temperature and an increment in
    mass balance of both the glaciers. But the increment was more prominent for Drang
    Drung Glacier as compared to Pensilungpa Glacier. It is interesting to note that
    between the years 2008–2012, the temperature shows increasing-decreasing behavior.
    Drang Drung Glacier mainly showed near positive mass balance between the years
    2009–2012 and Pensilungpa Glacier showed negative mass balance between 2010 and
    2012. Between the years 2012–2016, the temperature was depicted with an increasing-decreasing
    pattern but the variability in mass balance during the period for Pensilungpa
    Glacier was more negative as compared to Drang Drung Glacier. A cumulative increment
    in air temperature was observed between 2016 and 2020 but both glaciers have shown
    an increasing-decreasing behavior. But again, the increment in mass balance was
    more prominent for Drang Drung Glacier as compared to Pensilungpa Glacier. Between
    the years 2020–2022, the temperature rose continuously but the variability in
    mass balance during the period for Pensilungpa Glacier was more negative as compared
    to Drang Drung Glacier. The linkages between air temperature and mass balance
    mostly indicated an inverse relationship. Meanwhile, Pensilungpa Glacier was more
    sensitive to climate forcing. The sensitivity of small glaciers of Zanskar Valley
    to areal and temperature fluctuations was also observed by Ghosh and Pandey (2013).
    Possible limitations of the study are the absence of high-resolution DEMs for
    recent years, cloud hindrance issues for optical remote sensing images, resolution
    of the Landsat imagery (which hindered detailed glacier mapping) and air temperature
    dataset, and lack of field-based measurements for validations. Some possible recommendations
    and future aspects could be using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images for resolving
    the resolution and cloud cover constrain, and a detailed relationship of estimated
    mass balance with climate factors (temperature, precipitation/snowfall, etc).
    Exploring energy balance models for computing mass can also form future scope
    to check the accountability of radiation budgets of the glaciers. 6. Conclusions
    The present study demonstrates a methodology for comparative assessment of glacier
    mass balance using satellite data-based techniques suited for areas where in-situ
    data is not available. Mass balance results indicates the contrasting relationship
    between smaller and larger glaciers in the Zanskar Valley, Ladakh, India. Pensilungpa
    Glacier was depicted with more negative mass balane years as compared to Drang
    Drung Glacier. DEM differencing method indicates its reliability in elevation
    change aspects. These elevation changes uncover long-term glacier thinning, mass
    changes, and the evolution of glacial erosional landforms. Relationship with areal
    fluctuations and air temperature proves higher sensitivity of small glaciers to
    glacial dynamics and climate forcing. Declaration of competing interest The authors

    advanced technologies, including the internet of things (IoT), cloud/fog/edge
    computing, artificial intelligence, and agricultural robots to monitor, track,
    analyze and process various functions and services in real-time. Additionally,
    these technologies can make the agricultural processes smarter and more cost-efficient
    by using automated systems and eliminating any human interventions, hence enhancing
    agricultural production to meet future expectations. Although the current agriculture
    systems that adopt the traditional cloud-based architecture have provided powerful
    computing infrastructure to distributed IoT sensors. However, the cost of energy
    consumption associated with transferring heterogeneous data over the multiple
    network tiers to process, analyze and store the sensor's information in the cloud
    has created a huge load on information and communication infrastructure. Besides,
    the energy consumed by cloud data centers has an environmental impact associated
    with using non-clean fuels, which usually release carbon emissions (CO2) to produce
    electricity. Thus, to tackle these issues, we propose a new integrated edge-fog-cloud
    architectural paradigm that promises to enhance the energy-efficient of smart
    agriculture systems and corresponding carbon emissions. This architecture allows
    data collection from several sensors to process and analyze the agriculture data
    that require real-time operation (e.g., weather temperature, soil moisture, soil
    acidity, irrigation, etc.) in several layers (edge, fog, and cloud). Thus, the
    real-time processing could be held by the edge and fog layers to reduce the load
    on the cloud layer, which will help to enhance the overall energy consumption
    and process the agriculture applications/services efficiently. Mathematical modeling
    is conducted using mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) for a smart agriculture
    environment, where the proposed architecture is implemented, and results are analyzed
    and compared to the traditional implementation. According to the results of thousands
    of agriculture sensors, the proposed architecture outperforms the traditional
    cloud-based architecture in terms of reducing the overall energy consumption by
    36% and the carbon emissions by 43%. In addition to these achievements, the results
    show that our proposed architecture can reduce network traffic by up to 86%, which
    can reduce network congestion. Finally, we develop a heuristic algorithm to validate
    and mimic the presented approach, and it shows comparable results to the MILP
    model.

    of Things (IoT) is one of the emerging technologies that promise to transform
    the way on how people work and live. The term IoT refers to a network of physical
    objects “things” that contain embedded systems with connectivity and computing
    power to exchange data with other devices and systems over the Internet. By 2025,
    the number of IoT devices connected to the Internet is projected to be 100 billion,
    with an economic impact of more than $ 11 trillion [1]. The recent development
    of IoT devices presents a new dimension in the agriculture field, where the IoT
    has become an ideal choice for smart agriculture due to its highly scalable and
    ubiquitous architecture. Moreover, the IoT-based smart agriculture value is estimated
    to reach $ 18.45 billion in 2022, and 75 million IoT devices are used for the
    agricultural sector in 2020 [2]. Furthermore, smart farms are projected to have
    12 million IoT points by 2023 [3]. Smart agriculture has started incorporating
    IoT solutions to improve operational efficiency, maximize yield, and minimize
    wastage through real-time field data collection, data analysis, and deployment
    of control mechanisms. Also, the diverse of IoT-based applications such as precision
    farming and smart irrigation is very helpful to the enhancement of agricultural
    processes. Thus, the IoT is considered as one of the promising solutions for embracing
    connected farms to address agriculture-based issues and increase the quality and
    quantity of agricultural production. IoT solutions are highly associated with
    cloud computing to process the huge amount of heterogeneous data sent or received
    by agriculture sensors/actuators [4]. Although cloud computing can handle smart
    agriculture applications, some of the applications and services produce a large
    amount of data and need to be processed in a real-time manner, which may cause
    a heavy load on the network, long response time, and poor quality of service,
    due to limited bandwidth [5]. Therefore, using the traditional cloud-based architecture
    may not be efficient to support these applications, which may also result in high
    energy consumption due to the transfer of agriculture data to and from the cloud.
    The Information and Communication Technology (ICT) industry is projected to account
    for 20% of the global electricity demand by 2025 [5]–[8], [9]. Usually, consuming
    electricity is accompanied by carbon emissions (CO2). fossil fuel usage is the
    primary source of CO2 [10]. Consequently, this causes the growth of carbon dioxide
    emissions. According to [11], ICT uses 730 Million ton (Mt) CO2 equivalents (CO2e)
    or 1.4% of worldwide carbon emissions. To overcome the above shortcomings, edge
    and fog computing architecture are introduced to process the real-time IoT applications
    and services at the proximity of data sources in an efficient way, which have
    several benefits (e.g., reduce energy consumption, network traffic and improve
    quality of service) compared to traditional cloud-based architecture, that does
    not exploit the latest paradigms such as fog and edge in the agriculture system
    [4], [6]. However, edge and fog computing are not a replacement for cloud computing,
    as cloud computing will still be preferable and suitable for analyzing and processing
    heavy tasks, as well as storing data in a long term. The collaboration between
    edge, fog, and cloud computing is the best practice to achieve smart agriculture
    solutions. Several related works in the literature, (e.g. in [12], [13]), have
    discussed various architectures, techniques, and methods applied for smart agriculture
    systems considering different technologies such as IoT, big data analytics, and
    cloud computing. However, none of the existing works focused on the edge-fog-cloud
    architecture intending to reduce the energy consumption, CO2 emission, and network
    traffic as considering the three computing layers (edge, fog, and cloud). Therefore,
    this paper presents a new approach for smart agriculture systems to develop an
    energy-efficient offloading of IoT agriculture applications over an edge-fog-cloud
    computing architecture, according to the resource requirements of each agriculture
    task. Also, this approach could help to enhance the solutions of many traditional
    agriculture issues by taking the advantage of edge and fog computing, which will
    improve the overall energy efficiency and reduce CO2 emission, network traffic
    of smart agriculture systems. The major contributions of this paper are summarized
    as follows: ∙ Develop an energy-efficient architecture based on mathematical modeling
    and heuristic algorithm to study the offloading of IoT applications from agriculture
    sensors to edge, fog, and geo-distributed cloud, while considering minimization
    of the overall power consumption of networking and processing of the IoT agriculture
    services. ∙ Optimize the offloading of IoT agriculture applications over an edge-fog-cloud
    architecture, which connected to the access network, metro area network, and wide
    area network, respectively, thus eliminating the associated power consumption
    and telecommunication network traffic. ∙ Evaluate the usability and the capability
    of the proposed architecture and its models, using the mixed-integer linear programming
    (MILP) model, and compared the results to the traditional approach. The remainder
    of this paper is organized as follows: Section II introduces the edge-fog-cloud
    system architecture and its interaction layers. Section III presents the mixed-integer
    linear programming (MILP) model for optimizing the offloading of IoT agriculture
    applications in the edge-fog-cloud architecture. The model’s design, scenarios,
    and the input parameters of the models are presented in Section IV. This is followed
    by discussing the optimization model results and analysis in Section V. In Section
    VI, we introduce energy-efficient agriculture IoT applications distribution heuristic
    over the edge-fog-cloud architecture (EEAIOT-EFC). Finally, Section VII concludes
    the paper and discusses future work. SECTION II. Proposed Architecture for Smart
    Agriculture System Today, the traditional cloud-based architecture for agriculture
    systems is inefficient to satisfy all the requirements of the current scenarios
    [4], [5], [7], [8], as it lacks the essential efficiency prerequisites such as
    energy consumption, CO2 emission, network traffic, and so on [6]. Consequently,
    there is a need to develop an energy-efficient architecture for a smart agriculture
    system to fulfill these requirements. This section provides an outline of the
    proposed edge-fog-cloud architecture and its role in providing dynamicity and
    efficiency based on different IoT agriculture applications. The proposed architecture
    of the smart agriculture system is shown in Fig. 1; and it consists of four essential
    layers, namely, IoT sensor layer, edge layer, fog layer, and cloud layer. The
    description of each layer of the proposed architecture is presented as follow:
    FIGURE 1. An IoT-based edge-fog-cloud architecture for smart agriculture system.
    Show All A. IoT Sensor Layer IoT sensors generate massive heterogeneous data to
    the gateways by using various sensors deployed in different areas of the agriculture
    field. Also, this layer can receive decisions from to control actuators (e.g.,
    turning on/off irrigation system) [14]. In smart agriculture, there is a range
    of IoT sensor nodes used to identify several phenomena over the urban areas including
    but not limited to soil pH, soil temperature, soil moisture, soil electrical conductivity,
    and ambient temperature [15]. In the IoT agriculture system, low power wide area
    (LPWA) technologies have paved the way due to their low power consumption and
    wide area coverage. Long range (LoRa) is proved its efficiency, as a transmission
    protocol for IoT sensors. Besides its low power consumption, it ensures an extent
    of 10 kilometers coverage or more. In addition to LoRa, multiple wireless technologies
    can be used for smart agriculture urban areas such as narrowband (NB)-IoT, WiFi,
    Zigbee, and the 5G. The Zigbee technology has been successfully used in the field
    of agriculture at a low power cost. However, the limited distance coverage for
    wireless data transferring (about 20 meters) is reducing its efficiency. A comprehensive
    comparison of different IoT wireless network technologies (Zigbee, LoRa, NB-IoT,
    and 5G), is presented in Table 1. TABLE 1 IoT Wireless Network Technologies Comparison
    B. Edge Layer Edge computing refers to a new computing model that implements the
    computation of sensors/actuators data at the edge of the network. With this concept,
    some applications and services that do not require a lot of computing resources
    can be processed in the edge layer (close to the data source) and no longer need
    to traverse the network to be processed by the fog or the cloud. Thus, edge computing
    can improve data transmission performance, ensure real-time processing, and reduce
    the computational load as well as the amount of data transmitted to and from the
    fog or cloud data centers [8]. However, in case of unavailability/unsuitability
    of the resources in the edge layer, the sensors will automatically request to
    process their data in the fog or the cloud, and this will be done hierarchically.
    C. Fog Layer The fog computing concept was initially proposed by Cisco in 2014
    to expand the resources of cloud computing to the edge of the telecommunications
    network. In this context, the fog layer has the responsibility to process and
    analyze data sent from IoT sensors, which helps to minimize the latency for agriculture
    applications and services. Also, the fog layer has the ability to process and
    analyze complex data more than the edge layer. Both fog and edge can provide computation,
    networking, and storage services in between the sensor layer and the cloud layer.
    It means that instead of executing all processing at the cloud layer, the fog
    and edge layers can process and analyze agricultural data locally and close to
    the sensor layer (based on their ability) to reduce latency and cost [5], [7].
    D. Cloud Layer At the same level of importance as edge and fog, cloud computing
    is a vital enabler for the growth of IoT agriculture applications. It offers on-demand
    computing resources and services (e.g., storage, networking, and processing) in
    a scalable way. The cloud layer handles the agriculture data received from the
    sensor layer or the fog layer to process, analyze and store them into the cloud.
    Cloud computing can process and analyze heavy data, that requires more complex
    operations (e.g., big data processing and predictive analysis like weather forecasting,
    fire warning, and soil droughting), which exceeds the fog computing capability
    [6]. Also, it could provide a large-scale secure platform and cheap data storage
    services for the IoT agriculture applications [5], [8]. E. Telecommunication Networks
    The traditional telecommunication network architecture consists of three layers
    [16]: the core layer, the metro layer, and the access network layer. The wide
    area network (WAN) is the key network infrastructure that provides interconnection
    between different regions and cities. The Internet protocol (IP) over wavelength
    division multiplexing (WDM) is widely implemented in the core network as it can
    provide high scalability, large capacity, and fast communication network transfer
    speeds. Based on the reference hierarchy in Fig. 1, every core network has a direct
    connection with a metro area network (MAN), which covers a metropolitan area.
    Metro Ethernet is the technology commonly used in the metro network. It offers
    connectivity between the core network and users located in the access network.
    The local area network (LAN) supports Internet access to numerous user premises.
    We adopted the passive optical networks (PONs) which considered as the leading
    networking in the LAN network. SECTION III. MILP Model In this section, a new
    approach is developed based on mathematical mixed-integer linear programming (MILP)
    optimization model to study the energy-efficiency of offloading IoT agriculture
    applications over an edge-fog-cloud architecture, considering the three telecom
    network layers: LAN equipped with an edge layer, MAN equipped with a fog layer
    and the WAN equipped with a cloud layer. In the following, we introduce the parameters
    and variables of our proposed architecture. The architecture consists of the IoT
    sensor, edge, fog, and cloud layers. Then, we provide the mathematical model to
    find the optimum distribution of IoT agriculture applications to serve the offloaded
    requests from the IoT sensor layer based on their energy consumption over an edge-fog-cloud
    architecture. A. IoT Sensor Layer The parameters and variables that represent
    the IoT sensor layer, are shown in Tables 2 and 3. TABLE 2 IoT Parameters TABLE

    Networks As described in Section II-E, a typical telecom network is considered
    including WAN, MAN, and LAN networks. The traffic traverse through these layers
    as well as the corresponding power consumption are represented by the parameters
    and variables described below. 1) Local Area Network (LAN) The parameters and
    variables that define the LAN network are shown in Tables 6 and 7. TABLE 6 LAN

    Carbon emissions [18] can be defined as the carbon emission intensity per an energy
    consumption and the unit of carbon emission intensity is kgCO2e / kWh. The research
    found that using solar, wind or nuclear plants creates a low carbon footprint
    compared with fossil fuels [19]. However, there are multiple limitations to the
    usage of low carbon sources including but not limited to the cost of installing
    these clean plants. Thus, in this work, we assume that only the IoT sensor layer
    and edge layer are powered by low carbon sources (i.e., solar plants panels) to
    reduce the power consumption of the proposed architecture. In the following Tables
    12 and 13, we define parameters and variables related to carbon emissions. TABLE
    12 Emission Parameters TABLE 13 Emission Variables Total carbon emission (CO)
    is composed of: (WAN O)+(MAN O)+(LAN O)+(IoT S) +(Cloud O)+(Fog O)+(Edge S) (26)
    View Source Considering that IoT sensors, gateway, and edge processing layers
    are powered by solar energy sources. While others are powered by oil energy sources.
    SECTION IV. MILP Model Design In this section we explain the scenarios and the
    design of the model conducted in order to evaluate the proposed architecture.
    A. Scenarios As shown in Fig. 1, different scenarios can be implemented with this
    proposed architecture to show its effectiveness. In this work, the following scenarios
    are considered in a hierarchical order based on the edge, fog, and cloud ability.
    Edge/fog layers can be deployed in the proposed architecture according to the
    resources required by the agriculture tasks. Essentially, all tasks from heterogeneous
    IoT devices/sensors in the agriculture field, using different IoT wireless network
    technologies will be offloaded to the network gateways and then directed to edge/fog
    or cloud layer. Each layer has pros and cons. For example, processing the tasks
    within the edge layer will save the power and traffic cost of request transmission
    from/to the fog or cloud layer. However, handling all types of tasks within the
    edge layer is not possible, as it has limited capacity. Therefore, fog and cloud
    layers can be the choice for processing heavy tasks (e.g., resource-intensive
    applications). In our model, we assume that a scheduler in the gateway of the
    IoT layer checks if the edge node has available resources and can handle the request
    of IoT applications (e.g., CPU capability - the number of million instructions
    per second (MIPS)), the tasks will then pass to the edge layer to process them.
    In case of insufficient/unavailability of processing the tasks in the edge layer,
    the request will be transferred to the fog layer and check if there is enough
    capacity. Otherwise, the tasks will be forwarded to the cloud layer for processing,
    which supports resource-intensive applications. Also, we have assumed that the
    cloud has enough resources and capability to handle all kinds of tasks. B. Input
    Parameters of the Models In the MILP model, we have configured four layers in
    a smart agriculture system, which is composed of the IoT sensor layer, edge layer,
    fog layer, and cloud layer. The configuration of edge, fog, and cloud layers depend
    on the type of tasks (e.g., number of MIPS) requested by each IoT sensor/device
    at the IoT sensor layer. The model input parameters of different layers (IoT sensor,
    edge, fog, and cloud layers), in addition to networks and carbon emissions parameters,
    are shown in Tables 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18, respectively. TABLE 14 IoT Sensor
    Layer Input Parameters TABLE 15 Cloud, Fog, and Edge Input Parameters TABLE 16
    LAN, MAN, WAN Network Input Parameters TABLE 17 Carbon Emission Inputs for Each
    Fuel Type [17], [22] In our model, we assume that there are 100,000 sensors distributed
    in each farm The sensors task requirements are divided into three types (sensing
    60%, processing 30%, heavy processing 10%). The sensing processing task is usually
    limited to handling offloaded reading data sent by the sensors (e.g., temperature
    reading or send control commands for the irrigation system). The processing task
    is the requirement of light processing (e.g., soil analytics and event detection).
    The heavy processing task is the requisite of higher processing power and resources
    (e.g., weather prediction and analysis). SECTION V. Results and Discussion In
    this section, we discuss the proposed energy-efficient edge-fog-cloud architecture.
    In addition to its energy efficiency, we evaluate our model to find the consequence
    CO2 emission, and network traffic compared to the traditional cloud-based architecture.
    We have evaluated the proposed architecture and models using MILP optimizer based
    on the AT&T network topology, as shown in Fig. 2. To solve the MILP model, we
    use the CPLEX solver over a laptop with an Intel Core i7–7660U CPU, running at
    2.50 GHz, with 16 GB RAM. FIGURE 2. AT&T WAN network topology. Show All As shown
    in Table 1, we have categorized all IoT wireless network technologies used in
    this work based on their data rate, range, number of devices, power consumption
    of both gateway/base-station, and sensors. This work has identified that the power
    consumption of different IoT wireless network technologies almost the same, as
    shown in Fig. 3. The Zigbee technology delivers connectivity with low power consumption
    compared to other technologies. However, using Zigbee in the urban area is not
    the best choice as it only covers 20 meters, thus, hundreds or thousands of gateways
    are required to cover a large area. FIGURE 3. Comparison of different IoT wireless
    network technologies based on their energy consumption. Show All Since we aim
    to use a technology that covers a large area with the least amount of energy consumption.
    Therefore, LoRa has been chosen as an IoT wireless communication technology between
    the IoT sensors and the gateway, that covers long-distance communication, with
    low power consumption, and considers one of the most suitable technology for IoT
    agriculture applications, as shown in Fig. 3. A. Energy Consumption Fig. 4 illustrates
    the power consumptions of different tasks in the proposed edge-fog-cloud architecture
    versus the traditional cloud-based architecture. Also, it shows the placement
    location of each task/application in edge-fog-cloud architecture, as well as the
    power consumption values of each task individually. FIGURE 4. The energy consumption
    of the proposed architecture vs. the traditional cloud-based architecture, considering
    the IoT LoRa technology. Show All The results showed that the sensing tasks are
    offloaded to the edge layer, as it has enough capacity (i.e., sensing requires
    500 MIPS, and the edge layer has the capability to process up to 1800 MIPS). The
    normal processing tasks are offloaded to the fog respectively, as the fog layer
    has sufficient resources (i.e., 4000 MIPS) to process the tasks (i.e., 2000 MIPS).
    All remaining requests are offloaded to the cloud layer as there is no capacity
    in edge neither fog layers to accommodate heavy processing tasks. Fig. 5 shows
    the power consumption of our proposed architecture compared to the traditional
    cloud-based architecture, considering different IoT wireless technologies. Also,
    the figure displays power saving achieved by the proposed architecture. It is
    clearly shown that our proposed architecture outperforms the traditional cloud-based
    architecture by up to 36% of the total power consumption. However, the power savings
    have slightly ranged between 33.6% and 35.6% based on the different IoT wireless
    technologies. The Zigbee shows a higher power saving as it capable of offloading
    sensor data with lower power consumption. FIGURE 5. The energy saving of the proposed
    architecture vs. the traditional cloud-based architecture, using different IoT
    wireless technologies. Show All B. CO2 Emission Fig. 6 illustrates the total carbon
    emissions of the proposed edge-fog-cloud architecture versus the traditional cloud-based
    architecture, considering powering the IoT sensor layer and edge layer by a solar
    power source. FIGURE 6. The total carbon footprint emission of the proposed architecture
    vs. the traditional cloud-based architecture. Show All It shows that our proposed
    architecture can reduce up to 42% of CO2 emission, for real-time IoT applications
    in agriculture systems. The results also show a comparable carbon emission using
    different IoT wireless technologies. The power consumption of these technologies
    has been eliminated, as all IoT sensors and gateways are power by a solar plant,
    that emits very low carbon footprints (solar plants emit only 0.048 kgCO2/kWh).
    C. Network Traffic Fig. 7 shows the total traffic in each network tier in our
    proposed architecture versus the traditional cloud-based architecture. The results
    showed that our proposed architecture is capable to reduce the total traffic by
    14% and 86% in MAN and WAN tiers, respectively, compared to a cloud-based approach.
    FIGURE 7. The network traffic of the proposed architecture vs. the traditional
    cloud-based architecture. Show All In the traditional cloud-based architecture,
    the process of sending/retrieving the data to/from the cloud in real-time requires
    high-capacity bandwidth, which may cause a burden on the three network tiers.
    Thus, employing edge and fog computing has allowed processing most requests locally
    in edge or fog layers, which significantly decreases the flow of data traverse
    to the cloud and reduces network traffic, as shown in Fig. 7. SECTION VI. Energy
    Efficient Agriculture IoT Edge/Fog/Cloud Architecture Heuristic The problem over
    energy-efficient offloading of IoT applications in edge-fog-cloud architecture
    for smart agriculture environment is a non-deterministic polynomial (NP)-hard
    problem. For instance, if i is IoT applications count and n is the count of locations
    in edge-fog-cloud architecture, then we will have ( ∑ z=1 n n! (n−z)! ) combinations
    of possible applications locations to find the optimum locations that result in
    optimal power consumption. Thus, applying MILP to large-size problems is not feasible.
    Therefore, heuristic provides a simple and fast real-time implementation. Also,
    the optimal solution provided by the heuristic can provide validation to results
    obtained from MILP. To provide that, a heuristic algorithm was developed, referred
    to as energy-efficient agriculture IoT applications distribution heuristic over
    the edge-fog-cloud architecture (EEAIOT-EFC). In the EEAIOT-EFC heuristic, IoT
    application i is checked based on their total MIPS processing requirements. Firstly,
    the algorithm tries to place and run the application on the edge layer. If there
    is not enough MIPS capacity at the edge layer, then, agriculture IoT application
    is placed in the fog layer, if it has enough capacity. In case of unavailability
    resources in both edge and fog layers, the cloud layer will host the IoT application,
    as it has enough processing capability to handle all types IoT applications. After
    distributing all IoT applications, the power consumption of EEAIOT-EFC is determined.
    The heuristic flowchart process is shown in Fig. 8. FIGURE 8. Flowchart of EEAIOT-EFC
    heuristic. Show All The heuristic is assessed using a PC with an Intel Core i7–7660U
    CPU, running at 2.50 GHz, with 16 GB RAM. Similar to MILP, the AT&T network is
    considered a WAN network example. The heuristic took 5 seconds to evaluate the
    EEAIOT-EFC, and the MILP and EEAIOT-EFC show a comparable result, as shown in
    Fig. 9. The gaps between them are limited to 0.7% and 4.7% of the total power
    consumption under the proposed and the traditional cloud-based, respectively.
    FIGURE 9. Difference between the MILP model vs. EEAIOT-EFC heuristic. Show All
    SECTION VII. Conclusion and Future Works In this paper, the concept of an edge-fog-cloud
    architecture is introduced in the smart agriculture system, which solved existing
    real-time processing issues in terms of reducing energy consumption, CO2 emission,
    and network traffic, compared to the traditional cloud-based architecture. The
    proposed architecture employed the edge and fog layers, which are placed close
    to the agriculture fields to collect heterogeneous data from various kinds of
    IoT agriculture sensors and process them at these layers. Although the proposed
    architecture was significantly reduced the computational load and the amount of
    transmitted data to and from the cloud due to the use of edge and fog layers,
    however, the cloud layer is inevitably used to process the heavy and complex data/task
    requested by IoT agriculture devices/sensors. Most of the processing tasks are
    completed on the edge and fog layers, while few tasks are offloaded to the cloud
    layer for processing. In the paper, different metrics have been taken into consideration,
    including energy consumption, CO2 emission, and network traffic to study the performance
    and the outcomes of the proposed architecture. Using mathematical modeling, the
    proposed architecture is compared with the traditional cloud-based architecture.
    The model results showed that our proposed architecture can reduce the overall
    power consumption, carbon footprints, and network traffic by up to 43%, 36%, 86%,
    respectively. Moreover, we developed energy-efficient agriculture IoT applications
    distribution heuristic over the edge-fog-cloud architecture (EEAIOT-EFC) algorithm,
    which showed comparable results to the MILP model. Though this proposed solution
    is based on the idea of smart agriculture, it also can be suitable for other IoT
    applications and sectors, such as e-healthcare, smart city, and smart home. In
    the future, we intend to extend the proposed approach in a distributed real agricultural
    environment, considering machine-learning and decision-making algorithms to further
    understand the capability of the proposed work. ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would

  description: Surface soil moisture (SSM) is a significant component in the modeling
    of climatological, hydrological and ecological systems. In this study, an approach
    is presented and validated for combining the water cloud and Change Detection
    models to invert surface soil moisture using ENVISAT ASAR Global Monitor mode
    images (ASAR-GM data). A total of 25 images were selected in HH polarization.
    We have used parameters of the water cloud model best suited for eliminating the
    influence of vegetation cover on ASAR-GM and MOD15A2 LAI data in the Jiangsu Province.
    In our algorithm, Leaf Area Index (LAI) was used to substitute Vegetation Water
    Content (VWC). Relative soil moisture was calculated using the Change Detection
    method which eliminates the influence of surface roughness. Due to the relatively
    high rainfall and efficient irrigation system in this area as observed from in-situ
    measurement data, the lowest relative soil moisture (degree of duration) is about
    30%. Therefore, the formula for the Change Detection method should apply a gain
    of 0.7, and an offset of 0.3, and thereafter converting the results to volumetric
    soil moisture (mv) in accordance with local soil parameters. Finally, the retrieved
    volumetric soil moisture was validated with in-situ data, determination coefficient
    (R2) is 0.348 and a root mean square error (RMSE) in 0.087 cm3/cm3 was recorded,
    based on the method involving the combination of water cloud and Change Detection

    Metrics Abstract: Surface soil moisture (SSM) is a significant component in the
    modeling of climatological, hydrological and ecological systems. In this study,
    an approach is presented and validated for combining the water cloud and Change
    Detection models to invert surface soil moisture using ENVISAT ASAR Global Monitor
    mode images (ASAR-GM data). A total of 25 images were selected in HH polarization.
    We have used parameters of the water cloud model best suited for eliminating the
    influence of vegetation cover on ASAR-GM and MOD15A2 LAI data in the Jiangsu Province.
    In our algorithm, Leaf Area Index (LAI) was used to substitute Vegetation Water
    Content (VWC). Relative soil moisture was calculated using the Change Detection
    method which eliminates the influence of surface roughness. Due to the relatively
    high rainfall and efficient irrigation system in this area as observed from in-situ
    measurement data, the lowest relative soil moisture (degree of duration) is about
    30%. Therefore, the formula for the Change Detection method should apply a gain
    of 0.7, and an offset of 0.3, and thereafter converting the results to volumetric
    soil moisture (m v ) in accordance with local soil parameters. Finally, the retrieved
    volumetric soil moisture was validated with in-situ data, determination coefficient
    (R2) is 0.348 and a root mean square error (RMSE) in 0.087 cm3/cm3 was recorded,
    based on the method involving the combination of water cloud and Change Detection
    models. Compared with the conventional Change Detection method, the R2 of 0.104
    was increased and the RMSE of 0.014 cm3/cm3 was reduced, indicating the robustness

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Fairfax, VA, USA SECTION I. Introduction
    Surface soil moisture (SSM) is a significant component in climatological, hydrological,
    and ecological systems. Information on the distribution of soil moisture has been
    proven useful for watershed management to determine the allocation of limited
    resources during times of drought and in the mitigation of water-logging conditions
    [1]. Retrieval of surface soil moisture using active microwave data is becoming
    the most potential method due to the all-weather imaging capabilities of microwave
    sensors. However, it is complicated by the scattering from rough surfaces and
    vegetation whose geometries are unknown. Large-scale of soil moisture mapping
    often relies on empirical radiative transfer (RT) models such as the Oh [2] and
    Dubois models [3], or on change detection approaches. The Oh model and Dubois
    model have been proven to be effective in the retrieval of surface soil moisture
    in specific regions. A change detection method was presented in 1999 by Wagner
    [4]–[6], which assumes that the surface roughness and vegetation effects on the
    scattering are time-invariant for the ERS, therefore the changes in surface soil
    moisture is the only factor that changes the value of the backscattering coefficient.
    It describes radar backscatter in terms of empirical backscatter parameters and
    the relative surface soil moisture. The empirical backscatter parameters define
    the variation of radar backscatter between dry surface soil moisture conditions
    at wilting point level and saturated conditions at field capacity. The change
    detection method was utilized to retrieve surface soil moisture in large amount
    of regions in Ukraine, North American, Canada, the Iberian Peninsula, Mekong Basin
    and so on [4]–[11]. However, when the same method is applied to ASAR-GM data at
    different spatial resolution of ERS, the effects of vegetation may be different
    to the value of the backscattering coefficient. Several previous researches firmly
    believe that the changes in backscatter due to vegetation growth are, in general,
    much smaller than changes due to soil moisture. Even though scholars like M. Zribi
    [12] analyzed the effect of vegetation on radar signals, but there is not yet
    a practical approach due to the lack of validated satellite products such as optical
    thickness or LAI. As a consequence, in our research, we take advantage of the
    Water Cloud Model [13], [14] by using MOD15A2 LAI product to eliminate the effects
    on the backscattering coefficient from the vegetation, and suppose that the surface
    roughness is stable in the time series. The combination of water cloud and Change
    Detection models is expected to provide a better retrieval result. SECTION II.
    Study Area and Data Set A. Study Area Jiangsu Province is located in China''s
    eastern monsoon region, see Fig. 1. It is one of the 13 major grain producing
    areas in China. This region belongs to the temperate to subtropical transition
    climate (mild climate). The climate has obvious transition from south to north,
    and the annual precipitation ranges from 600 to 1617 mm. Being located in a flat
    terrain, Jiangsu always suffer from both drought and waterlogging. Fig. 1 Location
    of study area Show All B. Satellite Data ENVISAT was launched on 1 march 2002.
    It images the earth surface at an altitude about 800km, and has a revisit cycle
    of 35 days. The Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) onboard ENVISAT is able
    to collect C-band (5.331GHz) σ 0 measurements in several imaging modes. Dostalova
    [11] compared different types of ASAR data, and illustrated that the ASAR-GM was
    the most suitable data for retrieving the SSM in regional scales due to its high
    temporal resolution and large spatial coverage. The MOD15A2 is the level-4 MODIS
    product which is composited every 8 days at 1-kilometer resolution on a Sinusoidal
    grid. Dabrowska [15] compared 3 kinds of different index to calculate the Vegetation
    water content (VWC), and asserted that the LAI have the obvious positive correlation
    with VWC. Therefore, in this research we choose the LAI data that closest with
    the time of the ASAR-GM to substitute VWC. The parameters of the selected data
    are shown in table 1. Table 1 Dates of ASAR-GM and MOD15A2 The land cover products
    of China, the WESTDC, which were derived from the Cold and Arid Regions Science
    Data Center, were used to mask out the cropland, see Fig 2. Fig. 2 Simplified
    land cover map of jiangsu province Show All The ERS1/2 AMI 50km Soil Moisture
    Time Series Product from Vienna University of Technology(TU Wien) was used to
    find out the probabilities of wet and dry reference of the research area [6],
    [16]. In-situ volumetric soil moisture of croplands was obtained from the Agricultural
    Meteorological Automatic Observatory of the Jiangsu Meteorological Bureau. SECTION
    III. Methodology A. Preprocessing of the Data The pre-processing of ASAR-GM was
    done in the software developed by European Space Agency (ESA), the NEST4C. Preprocessing
    included radiation correction, geographic correction, and filtering. The ASAR-GM
    scenes were transferred from DN data into backscattering coefficient in σ 0 (
    m 2 / m 2 σ 0 ( m 2 / m 2 )= D N 2 K ⋅sinθ (1) View Source In the above formula,
    K is the absolute calculation factor. After Speckled Filtering, the images were
    reprojected to the UTM WGS84-Zone 51. The MOD15A2 LAI product data were mosaicked
    and reprojected using MODIS Reprojection Tools (MRT) and croplands were figured
    out through WESTDC. B. Water Cloud Model The simple approach to eliminate the
    effect of the backscattering coefficient from vegetation, water-cloud model, was
    first developed by Ulaby in 1978[13], who proposed to represent the canopy in
    a radiative transfer model as a uniform cloud whose spherical droplets are held
    in place structurally by dry matter. The original model was modified by various
    authors. In water cloud model, the canopy is represented by “bulk” variables such
    as LAI or VWC. The water cloud model represent the power backscattered by the
    whole canopy σ 0 as the incoherent sum of the contribution of the vegetation σ
    o veg and the contribution of the underlying soil σ o soil , which need to be
    attenuated by the vegetation layer twice. The interaction between the vegetation
    canopy and the soil are neglected in the water cloud model, therefore: σ o ( m
    2 / m 2 )= σ o veg ( m 2 / m 2 )+ τ 2 ⋅ σ o soil ( m 2 / m 2 ) (2) View Source
    Where τ 2 is the two-way vegetation transmissivity. σ 0 veg ( m 2 / m 2 )=A⋅VWC⋅cosθ(1−
    τ 2 ) τ 2 =exp(−2B⋅VWC/cosθ) (3) (4) View Source C. Change Detection The so called
    TU Wien change detection algorithm assumes a linear relationship between changes
    in volumetric soil moisture and changes of backscatter expressed in decibels.
    The degree of saturation in a given pixel is estimated by relating each backscattering
    value to the wet and dry soil conditions. Wet and dry conditions refer to a completely
    dry soil (0%) and saturation of the soil (100%), respectively, that is: m s (%)=
    σ 0 soil (dB)− σ 0 dry (dB) σ 0 wet (dB)− σ 0 dry (dB) (5) View Source Where m
    5 is the saturation of soil moisture, σ 0 dry (dB) and σ 0 wet (dB) is the smallest
    and largest value of the backscattering coefficient in the time series. Here,
    the backscattering coefficient was transferred into dB mode in the following formula:
    σ o (dB)=10⋅log( σ o ( m 2 / m 2 )) (6) View Source In the research of C. Path
    [8], due to high noise level in the ASAR GM data and uncertainty connected with
    the question, if the ASAR GM time series data for one location really captured
    the lowest and highest radar backscatter, the estimation of the reference values
    σ 0 dry (dB) and σ 0 wet (dB) is not straight forward. The estimation of reference
    values is based on the assumption that the probabilities P dry and P wet of acquiring
    backScatter measurements during dry and wet conditions are known. To calculate
    the number of measurements N taken during dry and wet conditions in the followed
    formulas: N dry =N⋅ P dry N wet =N⋅ P wet (7) (8) View Source Then, the reference
    values of σ 0 dry (dB) and σ 0 wet (dB) can be calculated by averaging the driest
    and wettest measurements: σ o dry ≈ 1 N dry ∑ N dry i=1 σ o i σ o wet ≈ 1 N wet
    ∑ N wet i=1 σ o i (9) (10) View Source The probabilities P dry and P wet depend
    on the climatic conditions and other properties of the land surface. In this study,
    the 50km spatial resolution ERS soil moisture product was chosen as an ancillary
    data to figure up the probabilities. Fig. 3 and Fig4. shows the reference value
    of σ 0 wet (dB) and σ 0 dry (dB) respectively. Fig 3. The wet reference of ASAR-GM
    data Show All Fig 4. The dry reference of ASAR-gm Show All SECTION IV. Result
    and Analysis A set of 25 ENVISAT ASAR GM scenes has been processed and analyzed.
    Maps showing the surface soil moisture conditions covering the study area were
    matched with the climate type of our research area, Jiangsu Province. Fig. 5 shows
    the saturation degree of SSM, during the growing season of winter crops. From
    late December to early March, it is relatively dry, and from early March to December,
    it is relatively wet. This soil moisture trend is consistent with the precipitation
    data provided by the Jiangsu province meteorological bureau. Fig. 5 Temporal V.
    Of surface soil moisture of jiangsu province Show All In-situ data from several
    Agricultural Meteorological Automatic Observatory were used to validate the inversion
    results, recorded in volumetric soil water content. Therefore, a conversion from
    degree of saturation (%) to absolute units (cm3/cm3) is possible by multiplying
    by the porosity: m v =(1− ρ S ρ r )⋅ m s 100 (11) View Source ms is the volumetric
    soil moisture in cm3/cm3 p s is the soil dry bulk density, p r is soil specific
    gravity which usually values as 2.65g/cm3, and m s is degree of saturation. As
    it can be seen in this equation, the accuracy of soil porosity is as important
    as the relative soil moisture content. The comparison between measurements and
    estimations shown in Fig. 6(a) is found to have an RMSE equal to 0.087 V. This
    is slightly larger than the RMSE recorded in previous studies. This is attributable
    to the relatively higher soil water content in our research area. But compare
    to the original change detection methods, see Fig. 6(b), the process in combining
    water cloud and change detection models has reduced RMSE by 0.014cm3/cm3, and
    increased R2 by 0.104. Fig. 6 Comparison of retrieval results from different methods
    Show All SECTION V. Conclusion Many studies [4]–[8] have demonstrated that the
    change detection methods can successfully be applied to active microwave satellite
    images such as ERS and ASAR-GM to retrieve surface soil moisture. But, none of
    them applied water cloud model to eliminate the effect from the vegetation. In
    our research, we make use of the MOD15A2 LAI data to remove the disturbing factor
    from the vegetation through water cloud model. And the result shows a coefficient
    of determination (R2) between volumetric soil moisture and in-situ data of 0.348
    and a root mean square error (RMSE) in volumetric water content of 0.087 cm3/cm3
    was recorded based on the method involving the combination of water cloud and
    Change Detection models. Compared with the conventional Change Detection method,
    the increase in R2 of 0.104 and the decrease in RMSE of 0.014cm3/cm3 indicates
    the robustness of our proposed soil moisture retrieval algorithm. ACKNOWLEDGES

  description: Irrigated agricultural expansion is one of the main reasons for water
    scarcity in the Lake Urmia basin. Although previous studies have analyzed the
    impact of cropland expansion on the Lake Urmia Shrinkage, there is a lack of comprehensive
    annual assessment of historical irrigation expansion in the Lake Urmia basin and
    its impact on water resources of this region. In this study, we developed an automatic
    and efficient workflow using Landsat and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment
    (GRACE) data, GRACE Follow-On (GRACE-FO) data, and a sample migration technique
    within the Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform to comprehensively investigate
    the impact of irrigated agricultural expansion on the shrinkage of Lake Urmia,
    as one of the most severe environmental crisis in the world. Additionally, using
    the global surface water data, we proposed a fully automatic procedure to obtain
    reference samples from water bodies. The Lake Urmia basin was first classified
    into the water, irrigated, and Non-Water/Irrigated classes using the random forest
    algorithm. The average overall accuracy of the produced annual land cover maps
    during 1987–2020 was 92.2%, representing the great potential of the developed
    method for land cover mapping. We found that the irrigated lands expanded by nearly
    890 km2 during the study period. Coincident with this change, although the area
    of water bodies in Lake Urmia partially recovered after 2015 (reached from 1,050
    km2 in 2015 to 3,370 km2 in 2020), it is currently far beyond its original condition
    (i.e., ∼5,400 km2, average record during 1987–2000). Moreover, the information
    of the Terrestrial Water Storage (TWS) from the GRACE and GRACE-FO data between
    2003 and 2020 showed a dramatic decrease in TWS level (∼−11.5 cm). The findings
    of this research will assist the local stakeholders and authorities to better
    understanding the environmental costs of irrigation expansion in the Lake Urmia
    basin.

    Water and food scarcity, which are interlinked with each other, have been extensively
    exacerbated by global warming and world population growth during past decades
    (Rosa et al., 2020). It also has been reported that rain-fed cropping systems
    could not meet agricultural commodities’ needs because the demand for food has
    increased in recent decades (Ayala et al., 2016). As such, expansion of irrigated
    cropping systems through exploiting surface water and groundwater has been adopted
    to respond to this issue in many areas of the world (Ayala et al., 2016, de Moraes
    et al., 2017). However, irrigated agricultural extensions can increase the pressure
    on water resources, particularly in arid and semi-arid areas, including the Lake
    Urmia basin in Iran. Lake Urmia, as one of the United Nations Educational, Scientific
    and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) biosphere reserves, has experienced an environmental
    tragedy in recent years (Khazaei et al., 2019). This lake has become an endangered
    ecosystem and experienced a dramatic decline in the area and water level due to
    both climatic change and anthropogenic interventions (Panahi et al., 2020, Chaudhari
    et al., 2018, Jaberizadeh, H., 2020, Wurtsbaugh et al., 2017). Among many consequences
    of the Lake Urmia shrinkage, the appearance of salt dust storms that threatens
    the lives of humans and species (Feizizadeh et al., 2021) is a serious threat
    that can directly damage agriculture, livestock, and cause significant loss of
    property and life. Salt dust storms can also bring indirect costs. For instance,
    it can lead to a loss of business, and increase or cause health issues. An increase
    in water salinization and a decrease in the quality of the natural environment
    are other negative side effects of intensive dust storms in this region. So far,
    several studies have been devoted to examine the roles of human activities and
    climate change on the shrinkage of Lake Urmia. For example, multiple studies assessed
    the role of climate variability on the shrinkage of Lake Urmia (Alborzi et al.,
    2018, Fathian et al., 2015), while some others compared the similarity of this
    disaster with other cases around the world (Destouni et al., 2013, Aghakouchak
    et al., 2015). The environmental impacts of Lake Urmia shrinkage (Feizizadeh et
    al., 2021, Garajeh et al., 2021), over extraction of groundwater (Amiri et al.,
    2016), and infrastructures developments were also broadly discussed in different
    studies (Sabbagh-Yazdi et al., 2020). Although there is no exact consensus on
    reporting the most influential driver of this issue, it is widely reported that
    the role of human intervention was more significant than climate change (Saemian
    et al., 2020, Sabbagh-Yazdi et al., 2020, Khazaei et al., 2019, Chaudhari et al.,
    2018). As an example of human intervention, the substantial impact of irrigated
    area expansion on the shrinkage of the lake has been reported (Balkanlou et al.,
    2020, Shirmohammadi et al., 2020). However, previous studies rather did not extract
    annual changes in irrigated agricultural and water areas and/or failed to extract
    small-scale changes. Moreover, previous studies mostly focused on cropland expansion
    (both rain-fed and irrigation), hence leaving a gap in the comprehensive analysis
    of the impact of irrigation expansion on the Lake Urmia tragedy. For example,
    Khazaei et al. (2019) and Saemian et al. (2020) assessed the role of agricultural
    area expansion on the water shrinkage of the basin using the yearly LC products
    of MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) satellite. However, due to
    the coarse resolution of the MODIS products (250 m or 500 m), the estimated locations
    of small irrigated lands are fairly uncertain, and it is hard to extract changes
    at fine-scale from their results. In another study, Shirmohammadi et al. (2020)
    analyzed the impact of irrigation expansion on water scarcity in the Mordagh Chay
    basin, one of the Lake Urmia’s sub-basins between 1993 and 2015. Since the Mordagh
    Chay basin covers relatively a small area of Lake Urmia basin, it may not be accurate
    to extend the results of this study to the entire basin. In this regard, LC mapping
    by classification of the freely available Landsat collection (Landsat-5, 7, and
    8), which provide long time-series satellite images from 1985 to present, can
    be a viable alternative to thoroughly investigate agricultural changes at fine
    scale around the world. When the objective is LC change analysis, it is important
    to have reliable reference data to train and validate machine learning algorithms
    (Stehman and Foody, 2019, Naboureh et al., 2020a). However, sufficient and reliable
    reference sample data are not always available especially in long-term LC change
    analyses (Chen et al., 2019, Naboureh et al., 2021). In this regard, the reference
    sample migration technique has been proposed as an effective solution to address
    this obstacle (Huang et al., 2020). In this manner, sample migration methods,
    which mostly try to transfer reference sample data from a specific reference time
    to another desired time, have been employed for LC mapping in different studies.
    For example, an automatic approach for LC mapping in a rapidly urbanizing state
    was introduced based on migrating data from the GlobeLand30 data (Lin et al.,
    2019). Moreover, a sample dataset (30-m resolution) collected in 2015 was used
    to produce a global LC map at 10-m resolution in 2017 (Chen et al., 2019). However,
    the migration of reference samples in LC mapping, in particular for long-term
    LC change monitoring, is in its infancy yet and needs more investigation from
    scholars. Timely and accurate information on irrigated agricultural areas and
    their spatial changes can help decision-makers at various disciplines, such as
    food security management, hydrologic modeling, and sustainable development (Deines
    et al., 2017). As a result, several studies have been devoted to characterize
    and investigate the impacts of the spatiotemporal changes of irrigated areas in
    different parts of the world (Demarez et al., 2019, Peña-Arancibia et al., 2014).
    In the case of Lake Urmia, although a few studies have so far examined the effects
    of agricultural activities on the shrinkage of the Lake Urmia basin, the impact
    of irrigated agricultural expansion on surface and groundwater levels of this
    Lake has not been well documented and presented. To this end, historical consistent
    field data along with powerful machine learning and cloud computing algorithms/platforms
    are required. Therefore, we proposed an efficient and robust workflow within the
    GEE platform to extract annual surface water bodies and irrigated agricultural
    areas and their changes in the Lake Urmia basin from 1987 to 2020 through an efficient
    sample migration framework. Moreover, we investigated the impacts of the irrigated
    agricultural expansion on TWS changes derived from the GRACE and GRACE-FO data.
    We also presented an automatic sample reference extraction technique for water
    class. 2. Study area and materials 2.1. Study area The Lake basin (Fig. 1), which
    covers an area of nearly 54,000 km2, is one of the main hydrological basins located
    in the North-West of Iran. As the second-largest inland salt lake worldwide, Lake
    Urmia receives water from 29 rivers and 39 floodways. The basin is home to more
    than 5 million people, where the economy of most people is largely dependent on
    agricultural production. The average water discharge into Lake Urmia declined
    from 2112 million cubic meters to 750 million cubic meters between 1960 and 2010,
    and the water level significantly decreased from 1278 m in 1995 to 1270 m in 2014
    (Khazaei et al., 2019). Download : Download high-res image (276KB) Download :

    collection and image pre-processing For the period of 1987 to 2020, all available
    Landsat (TM/ETM+/OLI) surface reflectance products between June 26th and October
    1st (dry season), where most of rain-fed agricultural areas were already harvested
    and shared similar spectral reflectance to barren areas, were acquired to extract
    irrigated areas. Since the available Landsat-5 could not cover the whole study
    area in 2003, 2005, and 2008 (Fig. 2.a), on the one hand, and Landsat-7 from June
    2003 to December 2011 were reported unsuitable for extracting water bodies due
    to scan line corrector failure issue (Tulbure and Broich, 2013), on the other
    hand, we discarded the mentioned years from our analyses. Overall, 1,733 Landsat
    images, including 1,112 Landsat-5, 104 Landsat-7, and 517 Landsat-8 images were
    processed to analyze the annual changes in three classes of water, irrigated,
    and Non-Water/Irrigated (NWI) from 1987 to 2020 (Fig. 2.c). The FMASK algorithm,
    which is available in the GEE platform, was applied to each image to remove snow,
    clouds, and cloud-shadows (Gorelick et al., 2017, Bian et al., 2020). Then, for
    each year, a stacked layer of the acquired Landsat images for the given year was
    generated. Finally, the 50th percentile (i.e., median) of the Landsat bands were
    calculated to create the mosaic images for LC classification. Download : Download

    reference sample datasets via fieldwork for the irrigated class, fieldwork and
    visual interpretation of very high-resolution images for the NWI class, and an
    automatic procedure for the water class. This step also contains extracting robust
    samples during two epochs of 1987–2008 and 2009–2020 based on a simple reference
    migration technique. (3) Implementing the Random Forest (RF) classifier for generating
    LC maps and validating the produced LC maps based on three well-known accuracy
    evaluation metrics. (4) Analyzing the TWS condition in the study area using the
    GRACE and GRACE-FO datasets. 3.1. Input features In this study, along with main
    spectral bands of Landsat, five spectral indices (Table 1) of the Normalized Difference
    Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Normalized Difference
    Water Index (NDWI), Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), and Soil-Adjusted
    Vegetation Index (SAVI) were also generated from the cloud-free Landsat stacks
    (see Section 2.2) to be used in the classification procedure. Moreover, we employed
    the topographic products of the elevation, aspect, and slope, which were generated
    using the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission data. Overall, we used six Landsat
    bands (Blue, Green, Red, Near-infrared, Short-wave infrared 1, and Short-wave
    infrared 2), five spectral indices, and three topographic products for LC classification
    of each year. Table 1. List of produced spectral indices (SWIR = short-wave infrared

    (Huete, 1988) 3.2. Producing reference samples In the present study, three different
    procedures were used to generate high-quality reference sample data. For the water
    class, a fully Automatic Water Sample Generation (AWSG) method was developed using
    the yearly water maps provided by the Joint Research Center (JRC) (Pekel et al.,
    2016). Within the proposed method, a pixel had to meet two criteria to be included
    in the samples of the water class. First, it should be classified as water in
    all the annual JRC LC products of the examined epoch (1987–2008 or 2009–2020).
    Second, based on the suggestion of (Wang et al., 2020), we considered three spectral
    indices (i.e., MNDWI, NDVI, and EVI) for achieving better results. Accordingly,
    a given candidate pixel should also meet the following condition. (1) ((MNDWI
    > NDVI or MNDWI > EVI) and EVI less than 0.1) After these two steps, the obtained
    samples were visually double-checked to remove possible errors. The code for AWSG
    is available in the Supplementary data (part 1). Since it is very difficult to
    precisely distinguish irrigated areas from natural vegetated regions using the
    visual interpretation method, reference sample data for this class was collected
    by fieldwork during summer 2020. Moreover, sample data for the NWI class were
    collected using both fieldwork (summer 2020) and visual interpretation of very
    high spatial resolution satellite images. 3.2.1. Reference sample migration A
    sample migration workflow inspired by Huang et al. (2020) was designed to generate
    annual reference sample data of irrigated and NWI classes for previous years (2019–1987).
    To this end, first, the spectral information of candidate sample data (Spectral
    Angle Distance (SAD) and Euclidean Distance (ED)) from different spectral bands
    in the given reference year (e.g., 2020) and target years (e.g., 2019) were extracted
    from the generated final cloud-free mosaic images. Then, spectral differences
    of candidate sample data in the reference year and target year were calculated
    and those data that showed small spectral differences (i.e., less than a predefined
    threshold) were marked as unchanged samples. The predefined threshold value of
    each class was obtained based on a trial-and-error procedure. Furthermore, only
    spectrally unchanged sample data during 1987–2008 and 2009–2020 were extracted
    for further analysis. Finally, after a visual interpretation by raw Landsat images
    of the target year, spectrally unchanged sample data in two classes (irrigated
    and NWI) were identified in two separate sample datasets in epoch 1987–2008 (dataset-1)
    and 2009–2020 (dataset-2) (Table 2). Consequently, dataset-1 and dataset-2 were
    used to generate annual LC maps for the periods of 1987–2008 and 2009–2020, respectively.
    Table 2. The number of reference samples for different LC classes in different
    time periods Empty Cell Water Irrigated NWI Dataset-1 (1987–2008) 400 581 750
    Dataset-2 (2009–2020) 250 581 750 Based on a detailed visual interpretation of
    very high-resolution satellite images and local knowledge, we selected 80 unchanged
    reference samples and 20 changed samples of irrigated class during the 2015–2020
    period to obtain the optimal threshold value for spectral similarity checking
    as well as evaluating the efficiency of the sample reference technique. Accordingly,
    to maintain a fair analysis, three experiments were conducted for the years 2017,
    2016, and 2015. As randomly splitting reference samples can lead to a low bias
    performance assessment of a classifier, each reference dataset was randomly divided
    into two equal groups (50–50%) of independent training and test samples. The training
    data were used for training the RF classifier and the test data were used for
    assessing the accuracy of the produced LC maps. 3.3. LC classification and accuracy
    assessment The training reference samples and the generated features were ingested
    into a RF classifier to produce the LC maps. RF was selected in this study due
    to its high performance in different LC mapping tasks (Rodriguez-Galiano et al.,
    2012). RF, as an ensemble of multiple independent individual decision trees, is
    an enhanced form of the bagging method (Breiman, 1996). It resamples the input
    datasets until the model reaches a stable situation which also declines the over-fitting
    risk. Obtaining the high classification accuracy using an RF classifier depends
    on optimization of two parameters, namely the number of variables (input features)
    for splitting at each tree node (mtry) and the number of produced trees (ntree)
    (Rodriguez-Galiano et al., 2012). Accordingly, after a trial-and-error procedure,
    mtry and ntree were set to 4 and 500, respectively. The test samples were utilized
    for the statistical accuracy assessment of the LC maps. To this end, the three
    well-known accuracy evaluation metrics, extracted from the confusion matrix (Foody,
    2002), were employed. These metrics were the Overall Accuracy (OA), User Accuracy
    (UA), and Producer Accuracy (PA). The code for applying the proposed classification
    scheme is available in the Supplementary data (part 2). 3.4. TWS analysis In this
    study, the 5° GRACE Tellus monthly data was used to calculate annual TWS between
    2003 and 2016. Since the GRACE Tellus data is provided by three different centers,
    namely Geo Forschungs Zentrum Potsdam (GFZ), U. Texas/Center for Space Research
    (CSR), and NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), a mean value of all three datasets
    was calculated following the recommendations in Forootan et al. (2017). Additionally,
    the GRACE-FO data from the CSR and JPL centers were used to estimate annual TWS
    for 2019 and 2020. It should be noted that since the GRACE-FO data are available
    for the winter and spring seasons of 2017 and 2018 (not the whole year), we discarded
    2017 and 2018 from our analyses. Then, the annually averaged TWS data for 2003–2020
    were used to explore the relationship among the changes of surface water, irrigated
    areas, and TWS data in the Lake Urmia basin. 4. Results and discussion 4.1. Reference
    sample generation The AWSG method was proposed to automatically generate water
    samples in this study. Within the AWSG method, a total of 400 samples for each
    year between 1987 and 2008 and 250 samples for each year between 2009 and 2020
    were acquired. Since the presented methodology relies on the freely and publicly
    available JRC data and the GEE platform, the high cost and difficulty of traditional
    reference sample collection approaches for water class are obviated by AWSG. Another
    advantage of the proposed method is that the AWSG method not only can generate
    samples of water class for each year from 1985 to the present but also is able
    to produce stable samples of water class since 1985. On the other hand, after
    analyzing the spectral differences (SAD and ED) of the candidate samples and visual
    interpretation of raw Landsat images, we generated 581 and 750 samples for the
    irrigated and NWI classes, respectively, as unchanged samples during 1987–2020.
    We also picked 100 samples that are labeled as irrigated in 2020 and migrated
    them to the years 2017, 2016, and 2015 to thoroughly evaluate the efficiency of
    the adopted sample migration technique. The obtained high accuracies (Table 3)
    over three experiments revealed that the designed sample migration technique is
    a robust approach in dealing with the shortage of high-quality reference samples
    in LC mapping. The visual assessment illustrated that less than 5% of the candidate
    samples (5 samples in 2017, 3 samples in 2016, and 4 samples in 2015) were removed
    due to spectral differences between reference (i.e., 2020) and target year (i.e.,
    2017,2016, and 2015) while those samples did not experience LC changes. In general,
    the success of the proposed reference sample migration methodology was mostly
    attributed to the combination of spectral differences and visual interoperation,
    as their vital importance in sample migration had been reported (Ghorbanian et
    al., 2020). Overall, integration of the proposed sample migration methodology
    and AWSG can be considered as a robust practice to deal with the shortage of high-quality
    reference sample in long-term LC change analysis. Table 3. Accuracy evaluation

    the accuracies of the generated LC maps using the migrated reference samples were
    initially assessed using a visual interpretation with the available very high-resolution
    satellite images in Google Earth. Visually, it was observed that the final LC
    maps were noise-free and provide satisfactory depictions of all three classes.
    As demonstrated in Fig. 4, the proposed method was not only capable of precisely
    extracting water bodies but also properly discriminated the irrigated and NWI
    classes from each other. Download : Download high-res image (299KB) Download :

    areas of the generated LC maps and corresponding satellite images. Regarding spatial
    changes from 1987 to 2020, most shrinkage occurred in the south part of the lake
    while the north part had the largest share of the stable surface water bodies
    (Fig. 5). As the 16-km Shahid Kalanatri causeway divides these two parts (Fig.
    5-D), it was reported that the construction of this causeway in the early 1990s
    disrupted water circulation between the north part (lower salinity) and the south
    part (higher salinity) of the lake that increased the salinity and evaporation
    in the south part (Sabbagh-Yazdi et al., 2020). We also found that several dams
    have been constructed in the basin over the study period (the year of the construction
    for the major dams is presented in Fig. 5) where irrigated areas mostly expanded
    around these dams. Download : Download high-res image (300KB) Download : Download

    areas between 1978 and 2020. Moreover, three statistical accuracy metrics (i.e.,
    OA, UA, and PA) were calculated for all the produced LC maps. Over the examined
    period, OA values of the LC maps varied between 90.1% and 94.2%, achieving an
    average OA of 92.2 % for all generated LC maps (Table 4). Regarding individual
    LC classes, the water class showed the highest average PA and UA. This can be
    explained twofold: the spectral response of the water class is more distinguishable
    than the other two LC classes, and the water spectral index (i.e. NDWI) has a
    high ability in extracting water class (Mcfeeters, 1996, Naboureh et al., 2020b).
    In general, all the assessed accuracy metrics of the classified LC maps were reasonably
    good considering the long-term change analysis performed using Landsat imagery
    (Zhu, 2017, Zhu and Woodcock, 2014). Table 4. Average values of user accuracy

    Change in irrigated and water areas In this part, we assessed the changes in the
    areas of water and irrigated lands. Overall, as shown in Fig. 6 (a), the area
    of the irrigated class experienced an upward trend reaching 8,300 km2 in 2020
    from 7,410 km2 in 1987. By further investigation, it was observed that the irrigated
    class slightly expanded until 2009 and, then, there was a sharp rise in 2010 (∼700
    km2 increase), where the area reached 8,210 km2. Finally, it peaked at 8,300 km2
    in 2020 after witnessing some fluctuations during 2010–2020. In contrast, there
    was a dramatic decrease in the area of water class, where the total water areas
    dropped from 5,390 km2 to 3,370 km2 during the period of 1987–2020. Download :

    and water land area change in the Lake Urmia basin. A) Annual changes in areas
    of water and irrigated lands between 1987 and 2020. B) Spatiotemporal variations
    of water and irrigated classes during 1987–2020. After a decade of fluctuations
    in the area of water class, the highest coverage of water area was recorded in
    1998 (5,600 km2) covering approximately 11% of the whole basin (Fig. 6 (b)). Then,
    the lake started to substantially shrink, where in 2014 the area of the water
    class was around 1,050 km2 (∼2% of the whole basin). Despite a moderate expansion
    in the area of the water class after 2015 and reaching 3,370 km2 in 2020, Lake
    Urmia still needs a rise of nearly 2,000 km2 to return to its primary state in
    1987 (5,400 km2). The moderate recovery of the lake after 2015 can be explained
    as the outcome of the Lake Urmia Restoration Program (LURP), which was established
    by the Iran government to revive the lake in 2013 based on a 10-year program (Saemian
    et al., 2020), and a substantial increase in precipitation in this area (Ghale
    et al., 2019). 4.4. Changes in TWS level By analysing the mean values of TWS from
    the three centers during the 2003–2016 period, it was observed that there was
    a remarkable drop in the TWS level in the study area (Table 5). The TWS level
    experienced an upward trend and reached from +2.2 cm to +5.1 cm between 2003 and
    2004. Furthermore, there was a downward trend during the period of 2004 to 2009
    (drop to −7 cm) which was followed by a sudden increase (with an increase of +1.5
    cm, reached to −5.5 cm) in the amount of TWS in 2010. However, from 2010 to 2016,
    the level of TWS considerably declined and reached −16.4 cm at the end of the
    period. The lowest point of TWS was −17.5 cm in 2014, while the highest point
    was 5.1 cm in 2015. Finally, as shown in Table 5, the mean values of TWS experienced
    substantial growth for the years 2019 (−8.4) and 2020 (−9.3). Table 5. Mean annual
    values of TWS in the Lake Urmia basin between 2003 and 2016. Year 2003 2004 2005

    Investigating driving factors on Lake Urmia shrinkage It is generally accepted
    that the warming climate can exacerbate water scarcity (Rosa et al., 2020). In
    the case of Lake Urmia, Chaudhari et al. (2018) reported weak correlations on
    annual Lake water level with temperature (R2 = −0.36) and precipitation (R2 =
    0.15) from 1980 to 2010. Khazaei et al. (2019) also argued that climate change
    cannot properly explain the Lake Urmia crisis and the impacts of human activities
    are more dominant. Moreover, the two neighbor lakes of this lake, namely Lake
    Van and Lake Sevan, with less than 200 km distance and almost similar size and
    climate conditions, have witnessed stabilized situations during the last decades
    (Fig. 7). Taravat et al., 2016, Sabbagh-Yazdi et al., 2020 reported only about
    30 and 35 km2 reduction in surface water areas between 1975 and 2015 for the Lake
    Sevan and Lake Van, respectively. All these imply that the impact of anthropogenic
    activities on the Lake Urmia crisis is likely higher than the impact of climate
    change and variability. Download : Download high-res image (331KB) Download :

    expansions on the Lake Urmia crisis, as an example on human activities, we analyzed
    the changes in irrigated lands, water areas, and TWS values in the basin. We also
    used Lake water level information obtained from the Iranian Water Resources Management
    (2019) during 1987–2019 where there was an over 5 m drop in water level of the
    lake (Fig. 1 (c)). It was observed that irrigated expansions negatively affected
    the surface and underground water levels in the Lake Urmia basin (Fig. 8). The
    expansion in the irrigated area and a decreasing trend in water area showed a
    moderate relationship (R2 = 0.52) during 1987–2020. Meanwhile, water level with
    R2 = 0.49 (during 1987–2019) and TWS with R2 = 0.44 (during 2003–2020) also moderately
    reacted to the expansions of the irrigated area in the Lake Urmia basin. Download

    The impact of irrigated agricultural expansions on the Lake Urmia crisis. a) Water
    area, (b) TWS, and (c) water level. During the last decades, consistent growth
    in population and investments in the agricultural sector have been reported in
    the Lake Urmia basin (Balkanlou et al., 2020). Based on the Statistical Center
    of Iran (2016), the population of the basin significantly increased from approximately
    5 million to about 7.2 million from 1985 to 2016. All these changes and the growing
    food requirements in the region have led to irrigation expansion. As a result,
    extensive water abstraction, well drilling, and dam construction have been reported.
    Based on a report published by the Iranian Water Resources Management in 2019,
    nearly 60 dams have been built in the Lake Urmia basin during the last four decades
    which corresponds well with our results (Fig. 6). Jaberizadeh (2020) reported
    these constructions not only could not help to compensate for the water shortage
    in the Lake Urmia basin but also have led to deforestation and ecological transformations.
    It was also reported that the number of wells in the Lake Urmia basin has increased
    from 55,199 in 1984 to 106,200 in 2017 (Bashirian et al., 2020), which stressed
    the pressure on underground water. In this regard, Ghale et al. (2019) reported
    that the annual inflow from rivers to the lake has declined in the basin because
    of growing discharge water from dams and wells during the 1975–2019 period. Therefore,
    the Lake Urmia crisis was intensified by the expansion of irrigated agricultural
    lands and its associated issues (e.g., constructions of dams, drilling wells,
    river diversion/damming, and excessive water abstractions). This was in agreement
    with the findings of different studies where human activities have been introduced
    as one of the main driving factors of the Lake Urmia crisis (Ghale et al., 2019,
    Khazaei et al., 2019, Schulz et al., 2020, Chaudhari et al., 2018). However, it
    does not mean that the impacts of global warming and severe droughts are negligible.
    5. Conclusion During recent years, the water crisis of Lake Urmia enormously damaged
    its ecosystem and socio-economic activities of the surrounding areas. Here, we
    presented the long-term annual LC changes based on Landsat images and the GEE
    platform to investigate the impact of irrigated agricultural expansion on water
    resources in the Lake Urmia basin. We also examined the feasibility of automatic
    generation of reference samples for the water class from the JRC data. Although
    this was the first attempt at long-term annual LC monitoring using a reference
    sample migration technique, the high OA of 92.2 % (on average) for all generated
    LC maps showed the efficiency of the proposed workflow. Through the performed
    analysis, it was observed that surface water, underground water, and the Lake
    water level were moderately impacted by the irrigated expansions. From 1987 to
    2020, the irrigated lands of the basin increased by 890 km2 while surface water
    areas experienced a 2,020 km2 reduction. During 1987–2019, there was also nearly
    a 5 m drop in the Lake water level. Furthermore, an 11.5 cm reduction in TWS level
    witnessed during 2003–2020. In general, to set better environmental management
    policies, decision-makers and authorities should take into account the fact that
    irrigation expansion can cause serious environmental costs. CRediT authorship

    and content Abstract In fog-based IoT systems, every fog can behave differently
    due to context and vulnerabilities. In smart irrigation systems, some fog nodes
    use more or fewer computing resources to analyze the data according to sensor
    location, soil moisture, plant species, or seasons. Therefore, fog behavior should
    consider distinct contexts. Federated learning support fog-based IoT systems to
    detect faster the behavior of fog nodes as it enables them to perceive previous
    behaviors from their peer nodes. We develop and assess an unsupervised federated

    and the system merges them in the cloud to calculate global centroids, sending

    Intelligent edgeFederated learningFog computingInternet of ThingsUnsupervised
    learning 1. Introduction Fog computing can reduce the volume of data transferred
    to the cloud and decrease the IoT system response time [1,2] as it is physically
    located near the end devices, like sensors and actuators [3]. Besides these advantages,
    fog nodes are vulnerable to attacks and anomalous behaviors [4], which is not
    feasible to monitor manually [5], due to their massive numbers and distinct performance
    behaviors during execution. Cook et al. [6] ratify that detecting anomalies using
    supervised learning algorithms may cause adversities because the system cannot
    perceive new unknown behaviors on the fly. The heterogeneity of fog nodes considers
    the diversity of hardware resources, security policies, data analysis duration,
    and demands CPU and RAM usage [28]. Therefore, each fog node may have different
    expected performance behaviors. Let us consider, for example, two fog nodes with
    the same hardware configurations, where the expected behavior of the first one
    is receiving 200 packets per minute and 60 % CPU usage, but the second one expects
    1000 packets per minute and 20 % CPU usage. Therefore, each fog node can have
    distinct and unlabeled anomalous behaviors, which makes it appropriate to use
    unsupervised learning [14] to detect new behaviors. Knowing every fog behavior
    is essential because the expected behavior can vary according to context features.
    For example, in a smart hospital, a fog node can demand more or less hardware
    and network resources to store and analyze data because the data analysis frequency
    and duration depend on attributes like the number of patients, seasonality, and
    specific sickness endemic peaks. The same happens in a smart irrigation system,
    where some fog nodes use more or fewer computing resources to analyze the data
    according to sensor location, soil moisture, plant species, or annual seasons.
    This paper proposes the FL-Means system that uses unsupervised federated learning
    [7] to streamline the detection of fog node performance behavior (where one behavior
    is a single data cluster). FL-Means addresses the fog node''s veracity challenge
    (detection of expected and unexpected performance behaviors), preliminarily introduced
    by the TW-IoT framework [9]. However, TW-IoT focuses on general concepts without
    proposing or evaluating fog behavior veracity. Here, we consider that the same
    IoT system can have many fog nodes demanding different levels of computing resources
    (behaving differently). Our system can detect every fog node''s expected and anomalous
    performance behaviors, regardless of context variations. Also, it perceives these
    behaviors faster because it uses federated learning. Our system executes an unsupervised
    learning K-Means algorithm [8,31] in every fog node to recognize its performance
    behaviors individually. It also transmits these behaviors as local cluster centroids
    to the cloud side, and the cloud calculates global centroids, sending them to
    all fog nodes. Therefore, all fog nodes use global centroids to identify behaviors
    that occurred previously in other fog nodes and can make accurate predictions.
    Our system also preserves data privacy among fog nodes and the cloud because it
    only transmits data centroids [10], improving the IoT data trustworthiness [9].
    We assess FL-Means in three scenarios, using simulated sensors: (1) agility: evaluate
    FL-Means against a non-federated baseline approach, simulating several behaviors
    in two fog nodes, (2) scalability: explore the system scalability by varying the
    number of fog nodes sending local centroids to the cloud, and (3) heterogeneity:
    analyze the heterogeneity using different fog node hardware to verify the sample
    prediction time, the time to compute local centroids, and the time to receive
    the global centroids. In Scenario 1, we observe two situations where FL-Means
    predicts the fog node behaviors from 1710 to 8043 times faster than the baseline
    approach. Our approach also shows that FL-Means presents higher prediction accuracy
    for these cases but has similar accuracy to the baseline for other situations.
    In Scenario 2, we perceive that the number of behaviors and fog nodes affects
    the CPU usage and time to compute global centroids. When we test 100 local centroids
    for 12 cluster centers, the cloud calculates the global centroids in 1.02 ± 0.01
    s, and for 1000 fog nodes, this computation took less than seven seconds. Finally,
    in Scenario 3, we observe that even in the worst case, using Jetson Nano CPU computation,
    the fog node obtains the local centroids in 2.46 ± 0.02 s, it receives the global
    centroids in 3.18 ± 0.15 s (considering 100 fog nodes), and executes sample predictions
    in 46.77 ± 0.41 ms. We also have evidence that the FL-Means system may support
    the cloud in monitoring all fog node behaviors because the cloud receives the
    behaviors'' centroids from every fog node, decreasing IoT management costs. This
    paper unfolds the sections as follows: Section 2 details the background, Section
    3 covers the related work, Section 4 explains our unsupervised federated learning
    system, Section 5 reports the used methodology, Section 6 reveals our results,
    Section 7 presents the discussion, and finally Section 8 presents the conclusions
    and future work. 2. Background This section clarifies concepts about IoT Stages,
    clustering (unsupervised learning), and federated learning. 2.1. IoT stages This
    paper considers a fog-based IoT system unfolding four computing stages, three
    (thing, mist, and fog) at the edge and a fourth stage at the cloud side. The thing
    stage [11] perceives a context by sensors and executes the system''s decisions
    using actuators. The mist stage [12] can pre-process data before transmitting
    it to the fog stage [3], which can perform system decisions, and may reduce network
    traffic between the edge and the cloud. The cloud stage [13] has more computing
    power than fog and can analyze historical data to improve and make robust decisions.
    2.2. Clustering Unsupervised machine learning, also known as clustering, can cluster
    data samples without prior knowledge of any data category [14,35]. Clustering
    algorithms identify similarities between data samples to generate clusters through
    different strategies, like data density or distance between samples. Consequently,
    these algorithms use the data to create a data model that represents the found
    clusters. Some clustering algorithms only group data samples but do not predict
    which group a new data sample belongs. The algorithms K-Means, Mean-Shift, and
    BIRCH do not have this prediction limitation, also, it is well-known that K-Means
    compute predictions faster than Mean-Shift and BIRCH [14,31,36]. K-Means also
    is faster than other algorithms, according to the results in [36], which evaluated
    data reduction based on machine learning algorithms for fog computing in agriculture.
    The K-Means algorithm begins by randomly defining values for K clusters centroids.
    After that, K-Means iteratively calculates the arithmetic mean distance between
    the centroid and the cluster data points, assigning the computed mean values to
    each K centroid until the data points stay in the same cluster. The Mean-Shift
    algorithm uses the density-based clustering strategy to iteratively search the
    centroids of regions with the highest data points density. Then, Mean-Shift assigns
    these regions as the final clusters. BIRCH is a hierarchical algorithm that builds
    a data tree with leaves corresponding to subclusters and has a threshold value
    that limits each subcluster radius. BIRCH also groups subclusters at the ending
    of execution to obtain a K number of clusters. For K-Means, we mandatory need
    to determine the number of K clusters to generate a data model. However, it is
    impossible to speculate the number of K that obtains the best model. Therefore,
    we can evaluate it by calculating a validation index like Calinski–Harabasz [15].
    The Calinski–Harabasz index can decide the optimal number of clusters, revealing
    the best clustering when the index reaches the highest possible value. 2.3. Federated
    learning Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique that
    enables a computing system to train models from decentralized data sources [7].
    In other words, the federated learning approach supports an IoT system to collaboratively
    join different information from distinct edge nodes, enhancing the system''s decisions.
    In IoT, for example, the cloud can create a global model by aggregating individual
    local models of edge nodes. Imteaj et al. [16] and Hosseinalipour et al. [17]
    describe an FL approach in which the edge nodes collect data, generate a local
    model, and send the local gradients to the cloud. When the cloud receives these
    gradients, it runs a federated averaging algorithm to create a global model and
    transmit the global model gradient to edge nodes [7,10]. In IoT, using federated
    learning can also preserve local data privacy because it does not require exposing
    raw data records through the network [10]. 3. Related work Cook et al. [6] expose
    the challenge of detecting anomalies in IoT systems, considering contextual information,
    prior knowledge, scalability, and resource constraints. They also suggest that
    using a classifier for anomaly detection may pose difficulties in perceiving unexplored
    anomalies. Li et al. [18] present a literature review for federated learning,
    and they mention that “existing FL frameworks construct based on supervised learning
    method.” Moreover, they mention federated training for unsupervised machine learning
    as a new research frontier. Sater and Hamza [19] present a federated learning
    approach called FSLSTM to detect sensor energy consumption anomalies in smart
    buildings. They tested the FSLSTM against deep learning models with three types
    of sensors and observed that their proposal presented higher accuracy for detecting
    these anomalies. Yadav et al. [20] propose a federated unsupervised deep learning
    approach. Their approach uses autoencoders to learn unlabeled data and generate
    its own feature set. They evaluate their proposal using a dataset named CICIDS
    without the data labels, obtaining an accuracy of 97.75 % after 100 training rounds.
    Servetnyk, Fung, and Han [21] present an unsupervised federated learning approach
    for unbalanced data that combines the weight computation strategy with an algorithm
    like K-Means. They artificially generate a dataset with 16 clusters and 50 data
    points per cluster. In experiments, they observed that their proposal clustered
    the data better than centralized K-Means, and their results only focused on measuring
    clustering performance metrics. Ahmad et al. [32] proposed a streaming anomaly
    detection algorithm named HTM and evaluated their approach against other techniques
    using a benchmark called NAB. In the evaluation, they mainly measured latency
    and the NAB score. The study considered sensor temporal noise anomalies but did
    not concern a fog-based scenario. Sivanathan et al. [33] categorized the behavior
    of different IoT devices and developed an unsupervised clustering method to identify
    each device''s normal network traffic behavior. The authors also considered retraining
    models for detecting behavior changes due to a firmware upgrade of devices and
    obtained 94.7 % accuracy. Kumar, Karthik, and Nair [22] present a federated K-Means
    clustering that uses K-Means models as local models and calculates the cluster''s
    centroids average in the cloud. The authors assessed their proposal using well-known
    MNIST and EMNIST datasets. However, the study only focused on measuring the model''s
    accuracy. They also do not consider the continuous changeability of the optimal
    number of clusters for every single edge node. Examining the related work, the
    authors do not consider an IoT scenario containing thousands of fog nodes with
    distinct expected behaviors that can individually change according to the seasonality
    (such as the period of the day, month, or season of the year). Therefore, the
    main contribution of this paper is to present a system that can iteratively identify
    new behaviors of fog nodes using a clustering approach to predict the expected
    behavior of individual nodes, also considering the temporal features for distinct
    contexts, like in a smart irrigation system, where some fog nodes use more or
    fewer computing resources to analyze the data according to sensor location, soil
    moisture, plant species, or annual seasons, for example. Our system can also select
    the best model and identify all the fog node behaviors, which may favor diagnosing
    future faults of each node behavior. 4. FL-means system In this paper, we propose
    a system named FL-Means [34] that uses unsupervised federated learning to discover
    new unlabeled fog node behaviors during system execution, also enabling a fog
    node to identify the other fog nodes’ behaviors. FL-Means has a component executing
    on fog nodes and another on the cloud side, respectively named Fog-FL and Cloud-FL
    (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3). Fog-FL and Cloud-FL only transmit clusters centroids
    between fog nodes and the cloud side. In other words, these components do not
    transfer raw data; thus, our system enhances data privacy because it does not
    expose any collected information. Download : Download high-res image (375KB) Download

    cloud-FL component. Fog-FL collects a dataset named workingDB (Figs. 1 and 2),
    which has data samples such as CPU and RAM usage (%), packet delay among sensors
    and fog node (in milliseconds), throughput (Kbps), and the number of packets arriving
    in fog node by every T seconds. Before loop1 execution (Fig. 1), we feed the WorkingDB
    with a few data samples to obtain the known behaviors. During loop1 running, the
    Fog-FL continues to collect these data samples, inserting them in another dataset
    named samplesDB. On the fog side (Fig. 1), the FL-Means system executes five steps
    iteratively: (i) it uses WorkingDB as input to train different K-Means data models
    by varying K values, and it utilizes the Calinski–Harabasz index to decide the
    best model to select (ii) it extracts the clusters centroids of the selected model
    and sends it to the cloud, (iii) it receives new global centroids from the cloud,
    (iv) predicts each sample behavior (cluster) calculating the Euclidean distance
    of these samples from the global centroids and decide if the sample behavior is
    anomalous or not (we consider the expected behavior as the cluster that has more
    data points occurrences in workingDB), and (v) it updates workingDB by inserting
    the data samples of samplesDB in workingDB, because, during Fog-FL execution,
    samplesDB may have new behaviors that are not already stored in workingDB. Additionally,
    the FL-Means system normalizes every input data sample before generating a model
    or predicting its clusters. The Fig. 2 example details the steps presented in
    Fig. 1 and the interaction between the model generated from workingDB and the
    samplesDB. In the Fig. 2 example, the system contains a model from workingDB with
    two known behaviors (A0 and A1). Initially, the system generates a local model
    from workingDB and receives the global model from the cloud. During loop2 execution
    (step 4), it predicts every sample (line) of samplesDB as A0 or A1 behavior. After
    round 1 (all steps''s first execution), the system creates a new workingDB (by
    joining it with samplesDB). In rounds 2 and 3, the system uses the new workingDB
    formed after rounds and repeats the steps mentioned in Fig. 1. However, after
    round 3, the new workingDB model learns a new behavior A2, and now the system
    can detect it when it occurs in any fog node. Therefore, the system joins the
    initial workingDB with the subsequents samplesDB because it can generate models
    from data that appeared during execution time. The system receives each fog''s
    local centroids on the cloud side (Fig. 3). It computes the Euclidean distance
    between every local centroid to verify if it is lower than a threshold value and,
    in turn, marks the centroids that obey this condition. After that, the cloud merges
    the marked centroids by calculating these centroids’ arithmetic mean, and then
    we obtain new centroids values, which refer to combining similar fog node clusters
    centroids. Then, FL-Mean obtains the global centroids being: all the centroids
    of the fog node clusters that Cloud-FL did not merge and the merged fog node centroids.
    Finally, it sends global centroids to all fog nodes. In Fig. 3, the word pass
    means that there is no action for the algorithm execute. 5. Methodology We explore
    three Scenarios: (1) FL-Means against a baseline approach (without global centroids),
    (2) system scalability with thousand local centroids, and (3) FL-Means heterogeneity,
    using different fog node hardware configurations. In the experiments, we use CrateDB
    [23] to support workingDB and samplesDB and run the SenSE simulator [24] to generate
    a dataflow of thousands of packets (which contains the timestamp of the packet
    creation time). We also employ a naïve Linux stress-ng tool to overload the fog
    node CPU and RAM. For Fog-FL (Fig. 1), we configure T = 5 s and i = 48, and for
    Cloud-FL (Fig. 3), we set the threshold value = 0.2. In the experiments, we also
    use the dataset collected by Fog-FL in reference [25]. In the experimental environment
    (Fig. 4), we include the four IoT stages (Section 2.1): SenSE represents the thing
    and mist stages, while Fog-FL and Cloud-FL play the role of the fog and cloud
    stages, respectively. For every scenario, we assess all the distinct time metrics
    with 30 replications, from which we calculate the arithmetic mean, the standard
    deviation, and the 95 % asymptotic confidence intervals. Download : Download high-res
    image (270KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Experimental environment
    (for scenario 3, the fog runs SQLite3 [27] instead of CrateDB). Our simulated
    environment data flow (Fig. 4) is based on the real scenario developed for the
    SWAMP project [29,30], which developed an IoT smart water management system focused
    in high-precision smart irrigation. The project had four pilots: (i) MATOPIBA
    Pilot, in Luís Eduardo Magalhães - Brazil, (ii) Guaspari Pilot, in Espírito Santo
    do Pinhal - Brazil, (iii) Intercrop Pilot, Cartagena - Spain, and (iv) CBEC Pilot,
    San Michele/Fosdondo - Italy. In our experiment, we use time-driven sensors because
    we considered the environment for smart irrigation, as shown in [11]. Zyrianoff
    et al. [11] presented and evaluated a 5-layer IoT architecture with different
    configurations for smart agriculture and smart cities applications. In the investigation,
    the authors explained that real smart cities applications can use more event-driven
    sensors, in contrast to real smart agriculture applications that focus on time-driven
    sensors. 5.1. Scenario 1: accuracy and prediction time We use the Mosquitto MQTT
    Broker [26] to intercommunicate all IoT stages, and every stage runs on the Linux
    Ubuntu 18.04 operating system with an Intel Xeon E5620 processor with 2.4 GHz
    and 4 GB RAM. In Scenario 1, we compare our FL-Means system against a baseline
    approach, which is a system that only relies on the fog side. Therefore, the baseline
    does not include steps 2 and 3, mentioned in Fig. 1, without any federation learning
    technique. It also predicts samples (see step 4 of Fig. 1) using the naïve prediction
    method of the K-Means algorithm. 5.1.1. Performance behaviors for fog A We first
    simulate behavior A0 for 10 min and A1 for 20 min, and in subsequent rounds, execute
    behaviors A2 and A3 [25]. • A0: Null packet load (no network traffic). • A1: 1000
    packets per minute and CPU load by 70 %. • A2: 1500 packets per minute, CPU load
    by 100 %, and RAM by 50 %. • A3: 200 packets per minute and CPU load by 40 %.
    5.1.2. Performance behaviors for fog B We initially run behavior B0 for 10 min,
    B1 for 20 min, and B2 for 10 min. In subsequent rounds, execute behaviors B3,
    B4, and B5 [25]. • B0: similar to behavior A0. • B1: 500 packets per minute. •
    B2: 500 packets per minute and CPU load by 80 %. • B3: similar to behavior A1.
    • B4: similar to behavior A2. • B5: similar to behavior A3. 5.1.3. Timeline of
    behavior simulation We execute the experiments in 7 rounds (4 min each), using
    two fog nodes, Fog A and Fog B. As mentioned in Sections 5.1.1 and 5.1.2, before
    starting the experiments, the workingDB of Fog A has data records of behaviors
    A0 and A1, and the workingDB of Fog B has samples of behaviors B0, B1, and B2.
    Fig. 5 shows the occurrence of behaviors during the seven rounds and highlights
    the behaviors B3, B4, and B5 with a red outline when they appear for the first
    time in Fog B. Note that we run B3, B4, and B5 in Fog B after executing them in
    Fog A (as A1, A2, and A3). Download : Download high-res image (231KB) Download

    2: scalability We explore Cloud-FL scalability considering Fog A and Fog B with
    the local centroids of rounds 1 and 7 (see Sections 5.1.1, 5.1.2, and Fig. 4).
    We also evaluate both fog nodes with 12 local centroids. Our experiments simulate
    fog nodes sending 2, 10, 100, 500, 1000, 5000, 10,000, 20,000, 30,000, and 40,000
    local centroids to the cloud (half Fog A and half Fog B). The cloud runs on Linux
    Ubuntu 18.04 operating system with an Intel Xeon E5620 processor with 2.4 GHz
    and 4 GB RAM. We consider three configurations: • Conf.1: Fog A uses two local
    centroids from round 1 (Sections 5.1.1 and 5.1.3), and Fog B uses three centroids
    from round 7 (Sections 5.1.2 and 5.1.3). • Conf.2: Fog A uses five local centroids,
    and Fog B uses six centroids from round 7. • Conf.3: Fog A uses 12 distinct clusters,
    and Fog B uses the same 12 centroids. 5.3. Scenario 3: heterogeneity We explore
    the FL-Means heterogeneity executing the Fog-FL component using different hardware
    devices. We assess Fog-FL in a Raspberry Pi 4, a Jetson Nano developer kit, and
    a personal computer (PC) with an Intel Core i7 processor. The cloud runs on the
    Linux Ubuntu 18.04 operating system with an Intel Xeon E5620 processor with 2.4
    GHz and 4 GB RAM. We consider three configurations for the fog node hardware:
    • Raspberry: Raspberry Pi 4 Computer Model B running Linux 20.04 operating system
    with Quad-core ARM A72, 1.5 GHz, and 4GB memory. • Jetson: Jetson Nano Developer
    Kit running Linux 20.04 operating system with a Quad-core ARM A57, 1.43 GHz, and
    4 GB memory. • PC: A physical personal computer using an Intel Core i7-5500U processor
    with 2.4 GHz, 8GB RAM, and running Linux 20.04 operating system. 5.4. Metrics
    In scenario 1, we analyze the following metrics: (i) the Calinski–Harabasz index
    for every round; (ii) the number of clusters (it suggests the number of groups
    that fit better according to the Calinski–Harabasz validation index); (iii) the
    confusion matrix (assesses the K-Means data model accuracy); (iv) Accuracy of
    predictions (we evaluate the FL-Means system against baseline); (v) Euclidean
    distance between centroids of Fog A and B behaviors to identify which behaviors
    are similar; (vi) Time BDF, as the time that a fog node needs to correctly predict
    behaviors already learned by other fog nodes (FL-Means against baseline); (vii)
    Time to predict a known behavior in a single sample, where we assess FL-Means
    against a baseline. In scenario 2, we analyze the following metrics: (i) time
    to compute the global centroids and (ii) CPU usage of the Cloud-FL component.
    In scenario 3, we evaluate the (i) Time-Local as the time to compute the local
    centroids, (ii) Time-Global as the time to compute local centers and receive the
    global centroids, considering that a fog node is the first of 100 fog nodes to
    send the local centroids and the last to receive, (iii) Time-Pred-Fog as the time
    to K-Means sample prediction in a fog node (without federated learning) and (iv)
    Time-Pred-FL as the time of sample prediction using the global centroids. 6. Results
    In this section, we reveal our experiment results. 6.1. Results of scenario 1
    Scenario 1 presents the results for individual fog nodes (A and B), and we report
    the results for the FL-Means system against the baseline approach (see Section
    5.1). 6.1.1. Results for each fog node individual behaviors Before each round,
    the Fog-FL component (Fig. 1) runs the Calinski–Harabasz validation to select
    the best clustering model, varying the number of clusters by two up to 10, where
    we obtained the results shown in Fig. 6, Fig. 7. After Fog-FL decides the number
    of clusters, we observe that it corresponds to the number of simulated behaviors
    for Fog A and B (as shown in Table 1 and Fig. 5), except for rounds 6 and 7 of
    Fog A. Download : Download high-res image (295KB) Download : Download full-size

    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 A 2 2 2 3 3 5 5 B 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 In Table 1, we verify that the system
    finds the exact number of simulated behaviors for all rounds of Fog B. For rounds
    6 and 7 of Fog A, the Calinski–Harabasz validation suggests four clusters (Section
    5.1.1) but also identifies one more behavior (A4). After analyzing the A4 data
    points, we perceive that the system correctly identifies this new behavior because
    the delay of its samples is twice the value of behavior A1 records. Therefore,
    considering 5 clusters for the models in the last two rounds of Fog A is valid.
    Then, in these rounds, Fog A correctly perceives behaviors A0, A1, A2, A3, and
    A4. We generate a confusion matrix for the last selected models of Fog A and Fog
    B (Fig. 8). The confusion matrix presents the main diagonal tending to approximately
    98 % accuracy for Fog A and 100 % accuracy for Fog B (on a scale of 0.0–1.0),
    where rows and columns symbolize the simulated behaviors and the found clusters.
    Therefore, we perceive that the models are appropriate when comparing the clusters
    with the simulated behaviors (including found behavior A4). Download : Download

    the baseline We observe that during single sample predictions in Fog A (Fig. 9),
    the FL-Means system and the baseline approach present an accuracy lower than 80
    % for round 3 and equal to 0 % for round 5. The system generates these results
    because it does not immediately recognize the new behaviors A2 during round 3
    and A3 during round 5 (see timeline in Fig. 5). Download : Download high-res image
    (261KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 9. Accuracy of predictions for
    fog A. We can observe that behavior A3 never happened before round 5, for Fog
    A or Fog B (see Fig. 5). Therefore, the both systems (federated and non-federated)
    cannot perceive A3 until round 5 finishes, when will be generated a model created
    by a new workingDB with characteristics of behavior A3 (as mentioned in explanation
    of Fig. 2). In Fog A, the correct prediction of these new behaviors will only
    happen when the next round starts; in other words when Fog A generates a new k-means
    model that includes these behaviors as new clusters (see Table 1). During round
    3, for example, Fog A only knows the behaviors A0 and A1 (and behaviors B0, B1,
    B2, and B3 of Fog B if using the FL-Means system). However, no fog node has identified
    A2 yet (see Fig. 5), and it needs to wait until the next round to recognize this
    behavior because A2 is unprecedented for the entire system. In round 5, for example,
    the accuracy is 0 % (Fig. 9) because A3 is the only simulated in this round (see
    Fig. 5). However, the system can identify this behavior in the subsequent round
    6 because, after round 5, Fog A generates new models containing the most recent
    samples and identifies new clusters. In rounds 1, 2, 6, and 7, we observe an accuracy
    of 100 % for both approaches. In round 4, the FL-Means system presented an accuracy
    of 93.8 % against 100 % for baseline. In Fog B, we observe that the baseline does
    not correctly predict the behaviors B4 during round 4 and B5 during round 6 but
    that the FL-Means system detects these behaviors correctly and reveals the most
    accurate prediction values for all assessed rounds (Fig. 10). Therefore, the FL-Means
    system is most advantageous than the baseline because, in rounds 4 and 6, it detects
    the behaviors B4 (identical to A2) and B5 (like A3) without the Fog B needing
    to wait for the next round (to generate a new data model). Therefore, the FL-Means
    system identified B4 and B5 correctly in Fog B because the system previously learned
    them as Fog A behaviors (see timeline in Fig. 5 and Table 1). Download : Download

    predictions for fog B. During round 4, the Fog B individually only knows 4 clusters:
    B0, B1, B2, and B3 (see Table 1), but using the FL-Means system, it also knows
    that the behavior B4 is similar to A2 because Fog A model already knows the three
    clusters: A0, A1, and A2 (see Table 1 and Fig. 5). Analyzing Table 2, we also
    observe that the FL-Means system merged the behaviors B4 and A2 because the Euclidean
    distance between their centroids is lower than 0.2 (our threshold value). Table

    value = 0.2). FCa Rounds 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 A0 and B0 0.068 0.054 0.068 0.022 0.023

    0.163 0.111 A3 and B5 0.048 0.051 a FC = fog clusters. In Fog B, we perceive that
    the non-federated baseline approach presents a 0 % accuracy prediction during
    round 6 (Fig. 10) because we only simulate behavior B5 during this round. During
    round 2, even when Fog B uses FL-Means, it cannot identify the behavior B3 (identical
    to A1) because the Euclidean distance between B3 and A1 is higher than 0.2 (see
    Table 2). Therefore, in this case, FL-Means has an accuracy near the baseline
    approach (Fig. 10). The FL-Means system computes the Euclidean distances between
    similar behaviors above the threshold value for A1 and B3 until round 3 (Table
    2). However, in the following rounds, the distances of A1 and B3 decrease, and
    the system recognizes these behaviors as similar (Table 2). We also verify that
    FL-Means correctly recognizes and merges all other identical behaviors A0 and
    B0, A2 and B4, and A3 and B5 since their first occurrences because the distances
    between their centroids are lower than the threshold value (Table 2). The FL-Means
    system reveals an enormous gain considering the time BDF metric (Fig. 11) because
    it was 1710 times faster in round 4 and 8043 times faster in round 6 than the
    baseline approach, which needs to wait for the next round to identify the new
    behavior correctly. However, FL-Means and baseline are statistically tied in round
    2 because the distance between the behaviors A1 and B3 is not lower than 0.2 at
    this moment (see Table 2), and it needs to wait for the next round to detect the
    behavior B3 individually (see Table 1). In typical situations, we verify that
    both approaches present similar time costs to predict a known behavior in a single
    sample, around 30 ± 2 ms. Download : Download high-res image (175KB) Download

    of scenario 2 In Scenario 2, we analyze the system scalability, where we send
    two up to 40,000 local centroids to the Cloud-FL component. In our experiment,
    each local centroid refer to the number of fog nodes that send cluster centroids
    to Cloud-FL to generate global centroids (see Section 5.2). Fig. 12 shows that
    the time to compute global centroids for 100 fog nodes is, on average, 0.19 ±
    0.01, 0.35 ± 0.03, and 1.02 ± 0.01 s for Conf.1, Conf.2, and Conf.3, respectively.
    We also note that Conf.3 takes 6.82 ± 0.02 s for 1000 fog nodes, and Conf.3 takes
    31.08 ± 0.02 s with 5000 fog nodes to compute global centroids. Besides, these
    times present a correlation coefficient of 0.99996, 0.99991, and 0.99989 for Conf.1,
    Conf.2, and Conf.3, respectively. Download : Download high-res image (219KB) Download

    proportional to the number of clusters and fog nodes sending local cluster centers
    to the cloud. We also observe that cloud CPU usage increases when the number of
    fog nodes expands (Fig. 13), with a correlation coefficient of 0.92724. Download

    explores the heterogeneity of fog nodes by using three different hardware configurations:
    Jetson, Raspberry, and PC (see Section 5.3). In this scenario, the fog node generates
    and selects one data model to extract the local centroids (Fig. 1.). For the Time-Local
    metric, we observe that the PC configuration takes 5.85 times lower than Jetson
    and 2.28 times lower than Raspberry (Fig. 14). Download : Download high-res image

    generate local centroids (Time-Local) and for the fog node to obtain global centroids
    with 100 fog nodes (Time-Global). We also measure the Time-Global metric, which
    consists of a fog node calculating local centroids, sending them to the cloud,
    and receiving the cloud centroids (after the cloud sends the same global centroids
    to another 99 fog nodes). Therefore, the time to obtain the global centroids (Time-Global)
    is formed by the time to compute local fog node centroids, the time for the cloud
    to calculate the global centroids, and the time to receive the centroids from
    the cloud. For the Time-Global, we perceive that PC presents the lowest values
    and that Raspberry takes 1.81 times lower than Jetson for this metric (Fig. 14).
    In Fig. 14, we also discovered that Raspberry demands less time to process local
    centroids than Jetson because the FL-Means code runs on a CPU of 1.43 GHz against
    1.5 GHz of Raspberry Pi 4. In Fig. 15, we note that Time-Pred-FL elapses faster
    for every hardware configuration than Time-Pred-Fog. For Time-Pred-Fog, we observe
    that the PC configuration demands, on average, 7.27 less time to predict a sample
    against the Jetson and 3.76 times less than the Raspberry. We also perceive that
    even using the Jetson configuration, the Time-Pred-FL takes less than 47 ms to
    decide a sample cluster. Download : Download high-res image (157KB) Download :

    7. Discussion Based on the results, we observed that FL-Means presents accuracy
    and time gains for predicting unknown fog node behaviors. In an IoT scenario where
    at least one fog node has already learned a new behavior, the FL-Means system
    saves other fog nodes time to predict the same behavior when it appears to them
    for the first time. We also highlight that our system can detect new fog node
    behaviors by continuously training local models with the appropriate number of
    behaviors because it uses Calinski–Harabasz validation every round. Scenario 1
    shows that FL-Means does not merge the behaviors A1 and B3 when B3 appears in
    round 2 because the distance between them is higher than 0.2. In round 3, Fog
    B already learns B3 but does not recognize B3 as the same as A1. The distances
    between B3 and A1 only reduce when the behavior B4 appears at the end of round
    4 because B4 has data samples with the highest RAM and CPU usage, changing the
    cluster centroid of B3. We observe that the threshold for behaviors A1 and B3
    is higher than 0.2 in rounds 1 and 2, delaying the system to perceive that behaviors
    A1 and B3 are similar. Also, supposing we set the threshold to 0.1, the FL-Means
    will not detect that behaviors A2 and B4 are similar. Therefore, it is essential
    to report that the threshold value impacts the prediction time and accuracy results.
    Scenario 2 evidences that the cloud side demands more CPU usage and time to compute
    global centroids when the number of fog nodes increases. Scenario 3 shows that
    FL-Means executed correctly for the three different fog node hardware tested.
    We advise using a cloud component to compute the global centroids for fog nodes
    with the same hardware. For example, one Cloud-FL should calculate data from Raspberry
    fog nodes, and the other should receive data from Jetson fog nodes. The FL-Means
    system enhances IoT trustworthiness by enabling every fog node to learn all other
    fog node behaviors faster without sending any local raw data, only transmitting
    the centroids of the clusters, preserving privacy. Also, the FL-Means system supports
    the cloud in monitoring all expected and anomalous fog node behaviors because
    the cloud always receives the behaviors'' centroids from fog nodes. 8. Conclusion
    This paper presents an unsupervised federated learning system (FL-Means). The
    FL-Means system enables a fog-based IoT application to recognize fog node behaviors
    faster when they have already occurred in different fog nodes. It can also detect
    new behaviors by grouping them in clusters using the K-Means algorithm. We assess
    the FL-Means in three Scenarios: (1) when it identifies each fog node behavior
    individually and against a baseline approach (without the federated learning technique),
    (2) testing scalability, and (3) exploring heterogeneity. In Scenario 1, we execute
    the experiments in seven rounds of four minutes each, using a cloud server and
    two fog nodes that we call A and B. The FL-Means system correctly clustered all
    simulated behaviors for both fog nodes individually. In Scenario 1, we evidence
    that using FL-Means, Fog B adequately predicts the unknown behaviors only Fog
    A previously knew. FL-Means reveal 95.8 % accuracy against 79.2 % of the baseline
    in round 4 and 100 % against 0 % of the baseline in round 6. In the same situation,
    the FL-Means system predicts the behaviors in Fog B faster in rounds 4 and 6 than
    in the baseline approach. Examining Scenarios 2 and 3, with 100 fog nodes, we
    observe that the fog node needs to generate the local model and that our federated
    system only requires milliseconds or at least one second more to calculate a global
    model. We also have evidence that predicting a sample behavior using federated
    learning is faster than not using it. Therefore, our approach shows promising
    results for time-critical IoT applications. A complete system to detect anomalies
    and network attacks can be built on top of FL-Means, but we focused on detecting
    performance anomalies related to context. In future work, we intend to reduce
    FL-Means time response and explore fog nodes with distinct kinds of datasets,
    including network attacks. CRediT authorship contribution statement Franklin Magalhães

    when behaviors are new and previously unknown to the system. FL-Means enables
    fog nodes to learn from each other's experiences, reducing the time needed to
    detect and respond to performance anomalies. By leveraging edge computing devices
    like Raspberry Pi, FL-Means enables localized decision-making and reduces reliance
    on cloud connectivity, improving response times and system resilience.

    IEEE Conference Location: Vancouver, BC, Canada SECTION I. Motivation Australia
    has an uneven distribution of water resources across the continent. There is a
    relative abundance in the north where few people resides whereas in the densely
    populated southern regions water scarcity has been a long-lasting issue for the
    past decades, especially in the agricultural sector where irrigation is the lifeline
    of the industry. This paper proposes and investigates a novel approach of using
    data-driven machine learning based interactive architecture to overcome the drawbacks
    of conventional water balance modelling approaches due to the fact that the spatial
    and temporal resolution are limited as well as relying highly on condition-specified
    field experiments as a control group. Machine learning based approaches always
    require ground truthing to achieve a desirable predictive model and prediction
    accuracy, bringing significant limitations in industry scale adaptation. It requires
    continuous human intervention and interaction. Convention of Industry 4.0 Workgroups,
    namely, WG2, WG3, and WG4, tell us the principal expectation and motivation behind
    an adaptation of Industry 4.0 in The Real Environment, The Economic Environment
    and Human Beings and Work; whereas cyber-physical systems, the Internet of things,
    cloud computing, predictive analytics and cognitive computing are at core. We
    aim to expand the adaptation of Industry 4.0 standards from the world of manufacturing
    to a broad range of complex predictive decision making problems, by introducing
    an architecture that allows users to interact directly with ground truthing of
    predictive models to improve accuracy in a standardized manner [1]–[4]. SECTION
    II. Interactive Platform: I-EKbase Intelligent Environmental Knowledgebase (i-ekbase)
    is an autonomous Big Data Analytics Engine running a CLOUD system. i-ekbase is
    an easy to use fully automated geographic information system (GIS), primarily
    focussing on precision agricultural and biodiversity monitoring applications,
    automatically integrating data from various satellites with local weather data,
    farmers'' knowledge and applying Machine Learning techniques to create a Data
    Driven Future for global Agriculture. i-ekbase is regularising satellite remote
    sensing for all purpose precision agricultural monitoring on a mobile device,
    for greater benefit to global Agri-community and to increase Agri-business profitability.
    i-ekbase services provide weekly/daily large area wise resource management map
    products, including normalised vegetation index (NDVI), soil moisture, biomass,
    surface temperature, vegetation landscape maps for supporting remote digital scouting,
    large area wise farm monitoring and decision support system and rapid intervention
    of a management issue. Fig. 1. Snapshot of the i-EKbase visual interactive system
    based on big data integration over large farming areas. Show All Fig. 2. Snapshot
    of the i-EKbase visual mobile application based interactive system based on industry
    4.0 concepts. Show All Initially heterogeneous data sources, namely, Bureau of
    Meteorology-Long Paddock (SILO), Australian Water Availability Project (AWAP),
    Australian Soil Resource Information System (ASRIS), Australian Cosmic Ray Soil
    Moisture Sensor Network (CosmOz), and Australian Digital Elevation (DED) databases
    were integrated along with NASA''s LANDSAT and European Space Agency''s Sentinel-satellite
    based data, to develop the regularized visual systems (base map products are being
    delivered to Cloud based Web and Mobile applications simultaneously) to start
    with the proposed interaction with the end users to create a truly Industry 4.0
    environment [3]. SECTION III. Interactive Ground Truthing We report the possibility
    of producing most probable high resolution estimation regarding the water balance
    in any region within Australia by implementation of an intelligent system that
    can integrate spatial-temporal data from various independent sensors and models,
    with the ground truth data produced by 250 practitioners from the irrigation industry
    across Australia. During the experimental period, participating farmers used i-ekbase
    mobile app to interact with their farm maps, took real measurement of biomass,
    NDVI, soil moisture and surface temperature, before drawing polygons on touch
    screen and entering values to create ground truth profiles on the cloud system.
    These profiles were used as primary integrated observed knowledge about the farm
    to create the probabilistic hot-spot map. Each pixel on the Google earth represents
    15m-resolution analytical outcome from the big data integration. Soil moisture,
    soil surface temperature, water consumption and NDVI values of each pixel were
    used to train a simple data driven model to train a supervised knowledge predictor.
    The refined threshold of these variables was modeled based on the ground truth
    collected and also by close consultation with farm manager. This predictive system
    was trained based on farm''s historical records and hyperspectral ground truth
    data as training targets. Fig. 3. User defined ground truthing via interactive
    architecture (called fieldnote), transfering the power of data to the users. Show
    All Ground Truth data profile created by the users were then stored and displayed
    instantaneously on all i-ekbase system for future reference, machine learning
    model adaptation and improvement of overall accuracy of the resource management
    maps. There was no other way to interact such a large number of real time users
    and adapt ground truth data, than through a cloud based efficient interactive
    architecture [4]. Fig. 4. System design was focused and justified as an industry
    4.0 adaptation, as this system continuously adapting the four pillars of industry
    4.0, interoperability, information transparency, technical assistance. Show All
    Fig. 5. Illustrates the recommended application flow, which can be simplified
    as a two stage process: Stage 1, Google maps overview of all available stations
    in australia as an overlay layer representation; stage 2, traffic light style
    indication of irrigation water balance status of the user-specified station. On
    the mobile app, the user is able to locate the point of interest on the google
    map and correct the status of environmental resource with actual physical sensor
    based reading and local knowledge, hence updating the predictive classification
    paradigm dynamically and interactively. Show All SECTION IV. Unsupervised Knowledge
    Representation Clustering algorithms based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA),
    Fuzzy-C-Means (FCM) were used to process integrated data. The objective of this
    analysis was to establish a list of least correlated attributes which were contributing
    towards the most data variance. In the PCA method each orthogonal (principal)
    vector accounts for a certain amount of variance in the data, with a decreasing
    degree of importance. FCM clustering provided partitioning results with additional
    information sup-plied by the cluster membership values indicating the degrees
    of belongingness, where ‘C’ was the total number of clusters. FCM was applied
    on the selected least correlated attributes from PCA to estimate the natural grouping
    of the data. Fig. 6. Representation of the knowledge recommendation layer. PCA-FCM-SOM
    based knowledge recommendations stored as RDF along with the existing RDF based
    i-EKbase. Show All World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) introduced a format called
    Resource description framework (RDF) which is now a standard model for machine
    readable data presentation. It decomposes data into the pieces (subject, object
    and predicate) and gives a uniform resource identifier (URI) for each resource
    or object. Through the URIs, it is possible to read the information about the
    particular resource on the web by using the HTTP access. The RDF has features
    that facilitate data integration even if the underlying schema differs, and it
    specially supports the evaluation of schemas over time without requiring the entire
    data consumer to be changed. This dynamic data analysis provided ranked attributes
    (according to their importance) which were effectively a valuable recommendation
    (Fig. 6) about the whole integrated data set for any future application design.
    PCA–FCM Clustering outputs and final membership function outputs were used to
    design and initialize the SOM. The SOM algorithm was developed by Kohonen to transform
    an incoming signal pattern of arbitrary dimension into a one or two-dimensional
    discrete map. Analyses carried out using Kohonen''s Artificial Neural Network
    (ANN) fall into the category of “unsupervised learning”, in which the relevant
    multivariate algorithms seek “clusters” in the data. PCA and FCM analysis were
    used to guide the SOM clustering in terms of initializing the weights. A SOM of
    [36 × 1] network size was created to capture the natural grouping [5]–[10]. SECTION
    V. Predictive Analytics Experiments An comparison study of various supervised
    machine learning methods (including Linear Regression, Bayesian Ridge Regression,
    Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Adaptive neuro-Fuzzy
    Inference System (ANFIS), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Radial basis Function
    network (RBFN)), that exploits the class labels of the samples to identify feature
    projections that potentially maximize class discrimination, was conducted to showcase
    some parametric evaluation of the i-EKbase system (Table 1). Supervised learning
    algorithms were trained and tested against the ground truth provided by the participating
    users, showcasing the possibility of Industry 4.0 Adaptation of Machine Learning.
    Table I. Predictive learners performance A conventional 10-fold cross-validation
    was performed using the 50% randomized holdout to have a better estimation of
    the classifier performance. Best result shows that from this particular data set
    up to 90% prediction accuracy is achievable with 85% specificity and 79% sensitivity.
    This was a combination of unsupervised feature selection and supervised classification
    to test the generalisation capability of the selected features from the actual
    environmental data set increasing dynamically every day on the cloud system [1]–[10].
    SECTION VI. Adaptation in Industry 4.0 Pivot Irrigation Sustainable pivot irrigation
    based cropping and water resource management in a catchment with very limited
    water, are heavily dependent on catchments water balance model. I-EKbase was applied
    for an expert agricultural decision support system related to the catchment water
    balance model. The purpose of applying SOM on the database was to provide visual
    recommendations about the soil moisture variability on paddock, by combining user
    provided ground truth data with environmental data, applying machine learning
    techniques for predictive solution on a large area with full interoperability
    and information transparency. In this was power, control and quality of the modelling
    and associated services were passed on to the end user in a very much decentralized
    manner, respecting the four pillars of Industry 4.0 [5]–[14]. Fig 7(a). A typical
    example of pivot irrigation with robotic water spraying pivot. Show All Fig. 7(b).

    machine learning techniques were applied on the industry 4.0 compliant i-EKbase
    platform. Show All Fig. 7(c). Final outcome of a preditive irrigation map of the
    pivot based on provided point based ground truth. This spatial variation provides
    optimized assistance to guide and control the water spraying to imporve efficiency
    of water management. Show All SECTION VII. Future Adaptation in Material Industry
    In future we aim to expand theme of Industry 4.0 adaptation of machine learning
    and the newly developed architectural framework in our other projects and completely
    different industries, especially in modern manufacturing and material optimization
    for soft-robotics. Newly discovered and experimented Shape memory polymers (SMPs)
    are increasingly being used for application solutions in automotive, aerospace,
    construction and commercial field. But being a nascent field there is little knowledge
    on the shape recovery behaviour of laminates with a SMP film and there are only
    methods reported in literature for quantifying the material behaviour. Through
    various experimental data gathering and analysis, influences of different variables
    that affect the recovery behaviour of thermoplastic shape memory polyurethanes
    based laminates including ambient temperature (45 °C and 65 °C), material modulus,
    and adhesive strength have been investigated to develop a physical model to formulate
    the recovery behaviour of the material. It has been identified that a fundamental
    optimization problem that needs to be solved is to maximize the final angle recovery
    ratios and recovery rates of a material to increase the overall efficiency of
    a targeted SMP material [15]–[18]. In this future study we aim to develop a state-of-the-art
    test rig facility to conduct various experiments on a targeted SMP and capture
    useful behavioural changes by collecting contributing variables. On the other
    hand we will employ digital imaging technology to capture visual recovery related
    footprint of the material''s recovery phenomenon as a ground truth of the desired
    behavioural aspect with full interoperability and information transparency to
    make it compliant with Industry 4.0 standards. In the modelling phase, various
    machine learning techniques will be tried and tested based on the experimental
    datasets to develop an optimized and predictive data driven model to emulate the
    SMP recovery behaviour. The novel model could be adapted for various SMPs and
    accurate predictability could help to discover a new class of decorative films
    capable of improved formability and shape recovery in polymer laminates. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

    world, produces plenty of indispensable resources like food, fiber and energy
    for living.1 In the last few decades, agriculture is faced with some problems
    including deficient water provision, attacks by pests, severe weather, and so
    on, which leads to the drop in the crop production.2 Confronted with the unpredictable
    environmental changes, farmers are required to make corresponding measures to
    increase the irrigation, sprinkle pesticide, adjust the humidity or change the
    illumination for guaranteeing crops yields. Benefiting from the reasonable adjustments
    by farmers, the aforementioned problems are handled to some extent. However, the
    constant manual detecting of crops to gain the agricultural information is barely
    realized, since the absence of farmers is likely to take place.3 With the intention
    of liberating farmers and monitoring crops accurately, smart farming is emerging
    to provision monitor and control capabilities in the farming procedure.4 Consequently,
    multiple smart devices and sensors are deployed in the rural areas to collect
    the agricultural information for further analysis.5 With the import of Internet
    of Things (IoT), the sensors in the farm are connected with each other to monitor
    the environmental situations and instruct the smart devices deployed around the
    crops through wireline and wireless communication.6, 7 However, along with the
    ever-increasing sensor scales, a huge amount of accumulated sensoring data are
    generated which urgently demand massive computing resources for processing, while
    it is approximately impossible to undergo such computation-intensive data analysis
    on the local resource-constrained sensors. To eliminate the computation and storage
    pressure for the sensors, cloud computing paradigm is introduced in smart farming.
    The gathered data are transmitted to the cloud platform for its powerful and elastic
    storage and computing capabilities.8 By achieving on-demand resource provisioning
    for the sensors located at the crop side, the collected data are stored on the
    centralized data center. Benefiting from analysis and mining of such data, a collection
    of the instructions to prompt the health growth of the crops are devised for long-range
    control of the intelligent devices. Nevertheless, for the relative long-transmission
    distance between the crop side and the cloud, the performance of controlling smart
    devices around the crops is severely affected.9 Currently, a wide range of sensors
    in IoT choose to dispatch their data to the cloud platform, which accordingly
    brings about the worse transmission performance between the cloud platforms and
    the smart devices. To mitigate the transmission pressure, edge computing emerges
    as a significant paradigm of great concern to accomplish real-time controls.10,
    11 Technically, edge computing extends the computing and storage capabilities
    to edge servers (ESs) which are deployed together with some sensors for evaluating
    the status of crops by handling the gathered data on the edge.12 Besides, to cope
    with the environmental changes, the control modules are embedded in ESs. Thus,
    ESs possess the ability to control the smart devices timely.13 In reality, considering
    the exorbitant expenditure of purchasing ESs, farmers prefer to leverage a small
    quantity of ESs, which results in the difficulty of guaranteeing the performance
    of the real-time controls and the overall edge services. Most sensors have no
    ES close by on account of a small quantity of ESs placement, which causes unavoidable
    transmission delay between ESs and sensors. Besides, the computing resources in
    ESs are limited, so ESs are incapable of responding to superabundant data-processing
    demands from sensors, which brings about the delay of a few computing applications
    waiting in ESs for processing. On the other hand, for insuring the performance
    and the stability of the edge service system, the load balance for all ESs is
    urgent to be realized. With the above observations, it is indeed a challenge to
    realize the rational placement of ES to enhance the performance of the real-time
    controls and the overall edge services with the aim of reducing the delay and
    achieving the load balance. In this article, a service offloading-oriented ES
    placement method for supporting edge computing in smart farming called SOP is
    devised to address the above challenge. In summary, the main contributions are
    presented as follows. The corresponding service range of a certain ES is ascertained
    according to the specific analysis of the farming service requirements. The layout
    policies for the trade-offs of the ES performance and service efficiency are acquired
    by the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). The most balanced
    layout policy is identified as the final ES layout strategy through utility value
    analysis. A large number of experimental evaluations are conducted to evaluate
    the performance of the whole ES system and the service execution efficiency with
    SOP. The remaining of this article is organized as four sections. In Section 2,
    the system model is shown. In Section 8, a service offloading-oriented ES placement
    method in smart farming is designed. In Section 17, the simulation experiments
    are underwent. In Section 25, related works are summarized. In Section 26, conclusions
    and future work are outlined. 2 SYSTEM MODEL In this section, a system model for
    placing ESs in rural areas is proposed to evaluate the data transmission delay
    from sensors to ESs and the load balance among ESs in smart farming. Key terms

    section, the service offloading oriented edge computing architecture for smart
    farming is discussed in Figure 1. Two layers, including the sensor layer and the
    service layer, compose the architecture. FIGURE 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    An service offloading oriented edge computing architecture for smart farming [Color
    figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com] In the sensor layer, sensors are
    placed nearby the crops to collect the data of temperature, irrigation, illumination,
    precipitation, and so on, which are denoted as . However, sensors are unable to
    process the massive collected data. Therefore, edge computing extends the computing
    and storage capacity to ESs for helping sensor process the data. In the service
    layer, ESs are placed close to sensors for helping process the data, which are
    denoted as . The computing resources for ESs are measured by virtual machines
    (VMs). VMs are denoted as which mean that the mth sensor has W VMs. In addition,
    the number of sensors which is certain is defaulted as N, while the number of
    ESs is uncertain. In our framework, the sensors and ESs are connected by a low
    power wireless personal area network (LoWPAN) for it is capable of low computation
    processing and low power consuming.14 Besides, if all the VMs in the ESs are occupied,
    data which are not dealt yet enter the queue in ES and wait for processing. In
    case of ESs handling all data from sensors, they are capable of commanding sensors
    to strengthen irrigation, illumination, fertilization, and so on. Besides, the
    monitor also has the ability to acknowledge the situation in rural areas. After
    this, the farmers can make a choice for demanding enhancing the temperature, irrigation,
    illumination, precipitation, and so on. In addition, the remote cloud offers the
    advice and make the forecast by consulting the results. 2.2 Delay model When an
    ES deals with data from a sensor, the delay consists of the offloading time from
    the sensor to the ES, the executing time for ES processing the data, the waiting
    time in the queue and the transmitting time during the process of sending the
    results to the sensor. Considering each sensor is only able to detect the environmental
    information within a certain range, so we denote the ranges of sensors are denoted
    as , respectively, for convenient calculation. Suppose that ES is not always placed
    in the range of sensors. A binary variable is leveraged to judge whether the mth
    (1≤m≤M) ES em is in the range of the nth (1≤n≤N) sensor sn, denoted as (1) The
    time for offloading the data from the sensor sn to the ES em is calculated by
    (2) where dsn is the data size of the data from the sensor sn, λl is the data
    transmission rate by using LoWPAN and θn represents the number of the ESs which
    data are transmitted through. The executing time for the ESs to process the data
    from the sensor sn is calculated by (3) where run represents the resource units
    demanded by the data from the sensor sn and p represents the processing power
    of each resource unit. Before calculating the waiting time, the waiting rounds
    are described as (4) where wtm represents the wait rounds in the mth ES em. The
    waiting time of data from the sensor sn in the queue is calculated by (5) where
    ETz represents the respective executing time for all data processed in this ES
    at zth round. The transmitting time during the process of sending the results
    to the sensor from the ES em is calculated by (6) where is the result size from
    em. The total delay for implementing the data from the sensor sn is calculated
    by (7) Then, the average delay for implementing the data from all sensors is calculated
    by (8) 2.3 Load balance model In the load balance model, the capacity of ESs and
    the computing resource requirement of data are measured by the VMs'' number. A
    binary variable is used to judge whether the mth ES em has been occupied, which
    is deduced by (9) There is also a binary variable to judge whether the nth sensor
    sn offloads the data to the mth ES em, that are defined by (10) In case of that
    the number of the occupied ES is certain, it is feasible to count the computing
    resource usage of ESs. Hence, the number of ESs that are occupied is calculated
    by (11) The usage of the computing resources in the mth ES em is measured by the
    usage of VMs instances. (12) where represents the number of the employed VM instances
    in the ES em at the zth round. Thus, the average usage of the computing resources
    in ESs is determined by (13) With the previous paving, the load variance of the
    ES computing resource usage is calculated by (14) Eventually, the overall load
    variance for the whole ESs is deduced by (15) 2.4 Energy emission model First,
    we put forward two binary variables: one is utilized for judging whether the mth
    ES em disposes the data from the sensor sn and the other is utilized for judging
    the round, described as follows. (16) and (17) The time of the mth ES em providing
    services, which determines the total energy consumption, is calculated by (18)
    Let ρ be the power rate of the ES. The baseline energy cost for keeping the ESs
    running is calculated by (19) Let σ be the energy emission rate of the engaged
    resource units, and the relevant energy cost is determined by (20) where ruz is
    the number of the used resource units in the round z. Let ψ be the energy emission
    rate of the unoccupied units, and their corresponding energy cost is calculated
    by (21) Thus, the overall energy consumption of the ESs is givens as (22) 2.5
    Problem definition The goal is to realize multiple optimizations for minimum latency
    in (8), load balance variance in (15), and energy consumption minimization in
    (22) when placing ESs in the farm. The multiobjective problem is denoted as (23)
    (24) (25) The formulation (24) makes sure that the ES amount is less than the
    sensor amount. In addition, the formulation (25) means that the total required
    computational resource for all the data from sensors is less than the capacity
    of all ESs. 3 A SERVICE OFFLOADING-ORIENTED ES PLACEMENT METHOD 3.1 Service range
    and routing confirmation of ESs In this section, an algorithm for service range
    and routing confirmation of ESs when the number of ESs is determined is discussed.
    We first introduce an instance, and then the universal algorithm is introduced
    according to the instance. The instance is that nine sensors are placed in rural
    areas, denoted as . In view of that the situation where there is only one ES in
    the farm is too simple (every sensor offloads its data to the only ES), the situation
    where two ESs are placed in the farm is used as an example: two ESs, denoted as
    e1 and e2, are placed in the range of s3 and s5, respectively. The confirmation
    of ESs'' service range and routing for this example is: s3 and s5 offload data
    to e1 and e2, respectively. Then the other sensors count the distance to e1 and
    e2. The data from the sensor which has the minimal distance are considered to
    be offloaded: s2, s4, s6, and s8. The key is the allocation of data from s2 and
    s6 in case of that the distances from s2 and s6 to e1 and e2, respectively are
    the same. We consider using a decision tree to store the data transmission routes
    across the sensors. The data in s4 and s8 are offloaded to d2 directly. At this
    time, if the data in s2 and s6 are offloaded to e2, the values of the delay and
    the load balance variance can''t be the most ideal. And then those data in s2
    and s6 are offloaded to e1. After that, there are still several tasks needed to
    be offloaded. The rule is that the distance is the priority. However, the distances
    from s1, s7, and s9 to e2 are all the same, while the distance from s7 to e1 is
    longer than those from s1 and s9 to e1. For minimizing the delay, the data from
    s7 is offloaded to e2. Then for minimizing the load balance variance in ESs and
    balancing the balanced binary tree, data from s1 and s7 is offloaded to e1. Even
    though, when the number of sensors becomes larger, the situation of all VMs in
    an ES being occupied has the possibility to occur. Then the data enter the queue
    and wait for being processed. On account of the sensor placemen in the farm being
    regular, we decide to see the rural areas as a 3×3 square grid and a 3×3 matrix,
    employed to calculate the distance between the sensor and the ES easily. Furthermore,
    the data transmission routes across the sensors are shown in Figure 2A and the
    constructed decision tree is shown in Figure 2B. FIGURE 2 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint The instance for service range and routing of ES confirmation with
    nine sensors (ie, s1 to s9) and 2 ESs (ie, e1 and e2). ES, edge server [Color
    figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com] The universal algorithm is shown
    in Algorithm 1. In the algorithm, each sensor uses a flag to indicate whether
    it has offloaded the data to an ES. First, the flags for sensors are initialized.
    Then, ESs are placed close to sensors randomly. In addition, sensors offload the
    data to the corresponding ES. Finally, sensors that has not offloaded data choose
    the ES to offload according to the decision tree. Algorithm 1. Service Range and
    Routing Confirmation of Edge Servers 3.2 ES layout policy acquisition To acquire
    the ES layout policies, improving the ES performance (ie, the load balance and
    energy conservation) and the service implementation time are key criteria. To
    collaboratively promoting these criteria, the evolutional algorithm NSGA-II is
    imported, since it is efficient in multiobjective optimization. In this phase,
    ESs in are encoded. In the genetic algorithm (GA), each ES placement is represented
    by a gene. Because the number of ESs is M, M genes compose a chromosome, which
    compose a chromosome specified through integer representation with the range [1,
    N]. The encoding operation is presented in Algorithm 2. Algorithm 2. Encoding
    for ESs In addition, the fitness functions are used to search for the optimal
    solution for the multiobjective optimization. Here, delay, load balance variance
    and energy cost are the three considered aspects which are presented in (8), (15),
    and (22), respectively. We aim at chasing down the hybrid ES placement strategies
    with the minimum delay, the minimum load variance and the minimum energy cost.
    Under the constraints given by (24) and (25), the trade-offs between the three
    objectives are looking forward to be realized. Before carrying out NSGA-II, the
    parameters of GA are set in advance in this phase. The size of the population
    is denoted as P, and the maximum iteration is denoted as I. In addition, the crossover
    and mutation probability are pc and pm, respectively. The gene which is denoted
    as gp,n represents the nth ES placement strategy in the pth chromosome. So let
    represent the pth chromosome. The populations Ap and Bp, whose sizes are both
    P, are randomly generated. Then, the population Cp with size 2P is formed. Next,
    the crossover and mutation operations are executed to prepare for the selection
    operation. The goal of the crossover operation is to obtain the better offspring
    by combing the two parent chromosomes. First, selecting the crossover point in
    the chromosome is necessary. Then, swapping two parent genes which are on the
    point''s two sides is conducted. Finally, completing the crossover operation is
    realized. Then, for avoiding the early convergence, the mutation operation is
    used to modify some genes slightly. After the mutation operation, each gene is
    modified with the same possibility. Finally, the selection operation is utilized
    for finding out the balanced ES placement strategies. In the selection operation,
    some chromosomes are selected to accomplish recombining for generating the next
    population. The next population realizes the crossover operation and mutation
    operation. After this, a new population whose population size is 2P with better
    fitness is generated. The fast nondominated sorting approach is employed to help
    this population generate the multiple nondominated layers. Besides, in each layer,
    all individuals have a crowding distance which is computed, respectively. The
    NSGA-II selection method is based on the comparison of the crowded distance operator.
    After the calculation of the crowding distance, more appropriate individuals are
    appropriate are employed to generate the elite population by (26) where ig represents
    the crowding distance with the ES placement strategy gp,n. While , , and represent
    the objective functions, that is, the delay, the load balance variance, and the
    energy consumption, respectively. Besides, Di+1, Li+1, and Ei+1 represent the
    values of the delay, load balance variance and energy consumption objective functions
    with (i+1)th offloading strategy, respectively, and Di−1, Li−1, and Ei−1 is the
    delay, load balance and energy emission by the (i−1)th placement strategy, respectively.
    In our article, we aim at minimizing of the delay, the load variance and the energy
    cost of ESs when ESs placements are determined. NSGA-II is fully leveraged in
    case of its function for addressing the multiobjective optimization problem. The
    overview of ES layout strategies acquisition based on NSGA-II is illustrated in
    Algorithm 3. Algorithm 3. ES Layout Policy Acquisition Using NSGA-II 3.3 Optimal
    ES placement strategy confirmation Our method aims to find the most optimal ES
    placement strategy which achieves the trade-offs among the delay, the load variance
    and the energy cost. SAW and MCDM are utilized to obtain the most balanced ES
    layout policy generated by NSGA-II. The normalized delay and load balance are
    calculated by (27) and (28) and (29) where ADmax, ADmin, ALmax, ALmin, AEmax and
    AEmin are the maximum and minimum delay, load variance, and energy cost, respectively,
    in the population after the selection operation. Then, the utility value is used
    to judge whether the placement strategy is optimal by considering the delay, the
    energy cost and the load variance. The utility value is calculated by (30) where
    wd, wl, and we represent the weights of the delay, the load variance, and the
    energy cost, respectively. Thus, the placement strategy having the most utility
    value is selected as the most optimal ES placement in our method. 3.4 Method overview
    In this article, to minimize the delay, the energy consumption, and the load balance
    variance, we propose a service offloading-oriented ES placement method, called
    SOP. First, a decision tree is erected for deciding the range service of the ESs.
    Then, NSGA-II is employed to produce the ES layout policies. Finally, SAW and
    MCDM techniques are employed to search for the ideal layout policy. The whole
    procedure of our method is presented in Algorithm 4. The inputs of Algorithm 4
    are sensors, ESs, VMs, the initialized population P and the iteration times I.
    The output is the most optimal placement strategy. Algorithm 4. Selection for
    the Optimal ES Placement Strategy 4 EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION In this section, experiments
    are implemented to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of SOP. 4.1 Simulation
    setup Our experiments examine the performances of the SOP method and comparative
    methods (ie, Greedy-D and Greedy-L) when the ES scale is different. The parameter
    settings in this experiment are shown in Table 2. And two comparative methods
    based on greedy algorithm are presented as follows: Greedy-D: A sensor offloads
    the data to the nearest ES. When the closest ES has no spare computing resources
    for processing the data. The sensor chooses a neighbor ES which has sufficient
    computing resources for the data. This process is repeated until all sensors have
    offloaded the data. Greedy-L: A Sensors offloads the data to the ES whose occupancy
    of VMs is the minimum. When all ESs has the similar occupancy of VMs. The sensor
    chooses a nearest ES to offload the data. This process is repeated until all sensor
    have offloaded the data. TABLE 2. Parameter settings Parameter description Value

    in each ES 40 The number of VMs demanded by each sensor [1, 7] The scale of ES

    are carried out under the simulation tools based on Cloudsim framework on a PC
    which has Intel Core i7-4720HQ 3.60 GHz processors and 8 GB RAM. The corresponding
    evaluation results are presented in the following phases. 4.2 Performance evaluation
    The goal of SOP is to achieve the trades-offs between minimizing the delay, the
    load balance variance, and the energy consumption. The comparison of the utility
    value for different solutions generated by SOP at different ES scales is shown
    by the six subfigures in Figure 3. From Figure 3, it is intuitive that SOP generates
    three solutions for each ES scale, and we choose the optimal edge sensor location
    with the highest utility value as the decisive ES placement destination, for example,
    in Figure 3A, the solution 2 achieves the highest utility value, so 5 ESs will
    be placed in the obtained sensor locations according to the solution 2. FIGURE

    4.3 Comparison analysis In this section, comparisons between SOP and comparative
    methods (ie, Greedy-D and Greedy-L) for different ES scales under the same experimental
    environment are evaluated particularly. The delay, load variance, and energy cost
    are seen as the priority assessment conditions for evaluating the performance
    of methods. The corresponding results are shown in Figures 4-8, and 9. FIGURE

    4.3.1 Comparison of delay In our experimental environment, the processing power
    of each ES is defaulted as equal. When the range service and routing of ESs have
    been confirmed, the executing time for ES among SOP, Greedy-D and Greedy-L are
    obviously the same. Besides, the amount of data in the up time is GB, the amount
    of data in the down time is KB. Their magnitude difference is too large. Therefore,
    the figure of the executing time and the down time has not been presented alone.
    With the number of ESs increasing, the delay decreases because of data having
    more ESs close by to offload without being offloaded to a long-distant ES. However,
    for Greedy-L, the condition, where data in sensors are sent to a relatively remote
    ES because of the employed VMs in this ES is the minimum, has the ability to happen,
    and this condition causes the high time delay which makes the total delay high.
    In Figures 4, 5, and 6, the up time, the queue time, and the total delay are shown,
    respectively. Intuitively, the ability of SOP optimizing the delay is weaker than
    Greedy-D, and stronger than Greedy-L. 4.3.2 Comparison of ES load In our experiment,
    the load variance is calculated according to the occupied VM amount and the usage
    of the computing resource. The occupancy of VMs for different ESs scales is shown
    in Figure 7. When the ES scale is small, the data wait in the queue for the limited
    computing resources in ESs, so the total rounds for ESs processing data are 7.
    However, with the increasing number of ESs, the total rounds decrease for data
    having more ESs to offload. Besides, the comparison of the resource usage for
    different ES scales between SOP and comparative methods is shown in Figure 8.
    When the ES scale increases, more and more computing resources are vacated. In
    addition, in Figure 9, the load variance with different ES amount by SOP, Greedy-L
    and Greedy-D is presented. Contrary to Greedy-L, Greedy-D aims to optimize the
    delay. This give rise to the condition where data in sensors are transmitted to
    a close ES that is fully occupied, just for low delay, which makes several ESs
    over-used. Intuitively, the ability of SOP optimizing the load balance is weaker
    than Greedy-L, but stronger than Greedy-D. 4.3.3 Comparison of ES energy cost
    There are three sources of energy costs: the baseline energy cost, the energy
    cost of the engaged resource units, and the energy cost of the unoccupied resource
    units. Considering that the ES is scarce and kept in operation mode for consistently,
    the baseline energy consumption of the ES is not considered in the experiment.
    The energy cost of the engaged resources is shown in Figure 10, the energy cost
    of the unengaged resources is shown in Figure 11, and the total energy consumption
    is shown in Figure 12. From these figures, it is visible that SOP is capable of
    reducing the energy consumption to some extent. FIGURE 10 Open in figure viewer

    4.3.4 Experiments results for optimal ES placement strategy The experiment results
    for the optimal ES placement strategy in different ES scales are shown in Figure
    13, respectively. Theoretically, the ES placement should be symmetry and regular.
    However, in view of that the size of data in different sensor is not always the
    same, the ES placement is asymmetric and irregular. FIGURE 13 Open in figure viewer

    with the increasing population, the decreasing farmlands, and the villainous climate
    change, feeding billions of people in modern agriculture becomes difficult. Smart
    farming, as a brand-new technology which emphasizes using some information technologies
    such as IoT, is believed to address this challenge.15-17 In smart farming, IoT
    plays a significant role because of its scalability, interoperability and low
    cost.18 IoT extends precision agriculture to smart farming through distributed
    and collaborative sensors, which collect data for processing, sorting and analyzing
    in smart farming to save resources.19 Prathibha et al20 aimed to monitor temperature
    and humidity in rural areas through sensors by using IoT technology. A method,
    which combined IoT technologies and Web Services, was proposed to handle the enormous
    data in smart farming.21 Patil et al22 proposed a remote monitoring system by
    combing internet and wireless communications. Given these facts, adapting IoT
    technologies to smart farming is more and more mature. Meanwhile, other information
    technologies also make a difference in smart farming. Cloud computing, as an important
    technology, is implemented to provide storage and analytics in smart farming due
    to its powerful storage and computing capabilities.23-26 Roy et al27 proposed
    an innovative hybrid system called AgroTick for smart farming. This system utilizes
    technologies like cloud computing and big data analytics based on IoT. AgroTick
    is believed to improve the efficiency of agriculture. Channe et al28 proposed
    a multidisciplinary model based on cloud computing for smart farming. This model
    has the ability to analyze fertilizer requirements, total production prediction
    and market commands. Social sensor cloud was discussed, sensor was proved to be
    a significant element in smart farming.29 However, with the development of smart
    farming, the increasing number of sensors in rural area leads to the generation
    of large amounts of data.30 This makes the applications on the IoT devices have
    large delay and affects the performance of IoT and cloud computing. Furthermore,
    due to the existence of network failures, cloud computing is unable to always
    make timely decisions based on environmental changes in smart farming.31 Edge
    computing, which is able to take advantage of the computing resources in the edge
    of network, is proposed to address the challenges.32-35 In edge computing, cloud
    services, partial analysis, and control functions are extended to the edge nodes
    from the cloud data center.36, 37 Due to this, the latency is reduced obviously
    and the reliability for data transmission is improved, and edge nodes can monitor
    sensors in smart farming timely.38 In view of that, it is urgent to apply edge
    computing to smart farming. Miguel et al proposed a three-tier open source software
    platform and the platform introduced edge computing and fog computing to enhance
    precision agriculture. At the edge level, an NFV-based approach is employed to
    perform local operational decisions, and it mitigate the impact of network failures
    when using cloud data centers.39, 40 A platform, which enables a low-cost sensor/actuator
    network based on IoT, uses edge computing to develop control processed for smart
    farming.41, 42 Currently, few researches guarantee the performance of the real-time
    controls and the overall edge services through ES placement, while it is important
    to consider this, for it may affect the real-time control for making timely decisions
    to the environmental changes in smart farming. Optimizing the delay, energy consumption
    and the load balance through ES placement for enhancing the performance of the
    real-time control is remained as a challenge in smart farming. Therefore, we need
    to make efforts to deal with this challenge. 6 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK Nowadays,
    agriculture is in great crisis for it is facing much problems including water
    scarcity, plague of insects, serve weather, and so on, which rapidly increases
    the crop production. For solving this challenge, edge computing is introduced
    as a considerable technology in smart farming. Edge computing confers the computing
    and storage capacity to ESs, which is capable of real-timely controlling the sensors
    to cope with the situation in the farm. To realize the rational ES placement which
    aims to reduce the delay from sensors to ESs, the load balance and the energy
    consumption among ESs, SOP is proposed in this article. Specifically, a decision
    tree is utilized to determine the data transmission routes of the data in sensors.
    Then, for achieving the multiobjective optimization, NSGA-II is employed. Finally,
    the performance of SOP is evaluated by the experimental analysis. In future work,
    we will try our best to acquire real smart farming datasets and adjust SOP to
    fit the personized real-world smart farming. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work is supported

    1. Introduction Agriculture is the largest sectoral user of water globally, and
    thus at the heart of debates about how to efficiently and sustainably manage use
    of limited freshwater resources (Molden, 2013). Satisfying growing demands for
    irrigation water as a result of population growth and climate change, while simultaneously
    ensuring sufficient water remains available to support other human and environmental
    needs, will require significant improvements in the water use efficiency of food
    production over the coming decades (Adeyemi et al., 2017, Evans and Sadler, 2008,
    Morison et al., 2008). Crop-water models are powerful tools, which can be used
    to help design and identify strategies to enhance the productivity of water use
    in crop production and address increasing competition over scarce freshwater resources.
    Applications include the prediction of climate change impacts on agricultural
    yields and crop-water demands (Lehmann et al., 2013, Rosenzweig et al., 2014,
    Semenov, 2009), evaluating the potential effects of irrigation management strategies
    such as deficit irrigation on production risks (Attia et al., 2016, Geerts et
    al., 2010), as well as the optimization of irrigation strategies in order to maximize
    yields or profit while minimizing demands on water supplies from surface and groundwater
    sources (Foster et al., 2019, Jamal et al., 2019, Li et al., 2019, Linker et al.,
    2018, Wisser et al., 2008). While applications of crop-water models in the agricultural
    water management and planning research are now widespread, the ability of practitioners
    in government, policy or business to leverage these approaches for real-world
    irrigation planning and management is limited by a number of factors. For example,
    implementing more advanced applications of crop-water models, such as optimization
    of irrigation scheduling rules or heuristics, often requires a high level of programming
    and data analytics expertize that may not be readily available in end user organizations.
    This issue is compounded by the tendency of many novel research applications of
    crop-water models to not provide transparent access to source code necessary to
    reproduce the specific applications of these models (Kloss et al., 2014, Linker
    et al., 2018), which themselves are commonly released only as closed-source software
    packages (Jones et al., 2003, Steduto et al., 2009), further limiting bespoke
    applications to real-world challenges around panning and management of irrigation
    water use. Many of the intended users (e.g., irrigation planners, agronomists,
    farmers, etc.) of crop models such as AquaCrop cannot be expected to be expert
    programmers or computer scientists which would be required to reproduce complex
    coding routines integrating GUI’s and optimization algorithms in languages they
    are unfamiliar with. In this paper, we present AquaCrop-OSPy (ACOSP), a fully
    open source Python implementation of the U.N Food and Agriculture Organization’s
    (FAO) widely utilized crop-water productivity model known as AquaCrop (Raes et
    al., 2009). ACOSP builds on existing implementations of AquaCrop in Matlab/Octave
    (Foster et al., 2017) and R (Rodriguez, 2019). ACOSP includes several novel features
    that address key end user application challenges outlined above, and is up to
    date with the most recent version of AquaCrop (v6.1) released by FAO (one example
    comparison is shown in Appendix A, with others available on the ACOSP documentation).
    Specifically, ACOSP provides an environment to enable a user with even basic Python
    programming experience to rapidly conduct advanced crop-water management and policy
    analyses. The growing popularity of Python – fueled by its flexibility, interoperability,
    extensive ecosystem and learning resources – has led to Python becoming one of
    the most popular programming languages globally for environmental simulation,
    including modeling of agro-hydrological systems. The model is fully self-contained,
    with a modular design and interactive environment that enables users to flexibly
    adjust model inputs and integrate with other Python modules (e.g., optimization
    algorithms). ACOSP source code is accompanied by a series of Jupyter Notebooks
    (Kluyver et al., 2016) to enable users to learn and develop new applications of
    the model for different aspects of agricultural water management and planning.
    The source code – developed using the nbdev framework (https://nbdev.fast.ai)
    – and notebook tutorials leverage the cloud computing platform Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com)
    to enable users to run the model in a web browser without the need to locally
    install, including via mobile devices that are increasingly being used to support
    agricultural and irrigation decision-making in both developed and developing countries
    (Adeyemi et al., 2017, Bartlett et al., 2015, Vaishali et al., 2018). In doing
    so, ACOSP greatly expands the potential user base and applications of the already
    widely adopted AquaCrop model, enabling users to flexibly test, adapt and extend
    the model to address diverse agricultural water management problems globally while
    still maintaining an interactive learning and application environment through
    use of Jupyter notebooks. Users can also freely implement AquaCrop source code
    and packages outside of the notebook environment in any Python IDE should that
    be preferred. In the following sections, we demonstrate a series of key use cases
    of ACOSP in the context of agricultural water planning and management. First,
    we summarize how a user can run a model simulation for a selected crop-soil-climate
    system. Next, we demonstrate a number of important applications of the model,
    including how a user can apply the model interactively to: (i) evaluate crop-water
    requirements for a number of irrigation management strategies, (ii) identify optimal
    (yield maximizing) irrigation strategies given different water use constraints
    through linkage to Python optimization libraries, and (iii) assessing impacts
    of climate change scenarios on irrigation water demands and crop yields. Use cases
    are accompanied by a series of Jupyter Notebooks (available at https://github.com/thomasdkelly/aquacrop),
    containing more explicit tutorials on how to use the model to reproduce the analysis
    presented in this article. The reader is encouraged to run these notebooks in
    combination with this article to better understand the application of ACOSP as
    a tool for irrigation management and policy. These notebooks can also be used
    as a basis for development of further customized applications of the code to address
    local, regional and global agricultural challenges. 2. Getting started: running
    your first simulation with AquaCrop-OSPy (Notebook 1) In order to setup and run
    a simulation using ACOSP, the user must first define a range of parameters and
    inputs to characterize the cropping system being simulated. These include daily
    weather time-series, along with parameters specifying the crop, soil, management
    practices and initial conditions for the simulation. For the vast majority of
    crop simulation models, these inputs and parameters are defined either interactively
    through graphical user interfaces (GUIs) or through externally modified input
    files (Foster et al., 2017, Jones et al., 2003, Raes et al., 2009, Ragab, 2002,
    Rodriguez, 2019). However, this approach makes it difficult for models to be integrated
    into larger code bases or optimization packages. This approach also limits flexibility
    to conduct large batch simulations of field-scale crop models where many different
    combinations of input files must be considered (e.g., to reflect spatial heterogeneity
    in cropping practices across an agricultural landscape or changes in climate variability
    over time). The approach for setting up and running simulations in ACOSP has been
    designed to overcome these issues, and make it easier to simply and flexibly execute
    simulations for complex and heterogeneous agricultural production systems. After
    importing ACOSP into a python editor or notebook, the user is able to interactively
    define each of the main input types of the model (climate, soil, crop, management
    practices, and initial soil water and groundwater conditions). In each case, defaults
    have been predefined such that the number of required user inputs are minimized,
    but at the same time allowing any of them to be edited by the user as needed.
    All of these component defaults are specified in the class definitions and can
    be inspected in the source code. For notebook environments, functions exist that
    enable the user to directly inspect the source code from the notebook, further
    streamlining the experience for the user and enabling them to quickly customize
    simulations without the need for a GUI interface that constrains wider model uses.
    Modifying each of these default components is done when creating the component
    object and full details are shown in Notebook 1. As an example the user could
    create the default Maize crop by running maize=CropClass(‘Maize’, PlantingDate=’05/01′),
    or create a Maize crop with an adjusted Canopy Growth Coefficient by running maize2=CropClass(‘Maize’,
    PlantingDate=’05/01′, CGC=0.001). Similarly for the other model components, users
    are able to modify the default input classes and develop new customized classes.
    Fig. 1 shows an example of the initial setup of crop and soil classes along with
    initial soil moisture conditions in Notebook 1. The user is able to specify climate
    input data – the other key requirement by AquaCrop – by either selecting one of
    the predefined inbuilt climate time series, or by importing external data files
    using custom helper functions such as prepare_weather (Fig. 1). Download : Download
    high-res image (847KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. The creation
    of a SoilClass, CropClass and InitWCClass object using built-in soil and crop
    types, and the initial water content in layer 1 set to Field Capacity. These components
    are then passed into an AquaCropModel which is initialized and run till the end
    of the simulation, after which, model outputs can then be inspected. Once the
    user has defined all input classes and data, these components along with user
    specified start date and end date for the simulation, are passed into the AquaCropModel
    object (Fig. 1). The model is then initialized using model.initialize(), following
    which the user can choose to execute the model to run forwards N days using model.step(N),
    or until the end of the specified simulation period using model.step(till_termination=True).
    These two options provide flexibility to users, allowing planting, harvesting
    or irrigation decisions to be made dynamically based on either internal model
    variables or external data. As an example, irrigation decisions can be made on
    each day from a separate code base which could include groundwater information,
    weather forecasts, or machine learning models (Adeyemi et al., 2018, Linker and
    Sylaios, 2016, Sun et al., 2017). This feature enables users to define their own
    custom irrigation strategies (incorporating any external code or data or management
    rules), which is either extremely difficult or impossible in other crop-water
    models that incorporate only a fixed set of pre-defined irrigation management
    heuristics. Once the simulation has finished, four different output files will
    be produced comparable with outputs provided by the original AquaCrop model. The
    Flux output shows daily water flux variables simulated by or inputted to the model,
    such as total water storage in the crop root zone and precipitation. The WaterContent
    output file provides more granular information about the water storage in each
    compartment on each day of the simulation period. The Growth output reports daily
    simulated crop growth state variables such as canopy cover and rooting depth.
    The Final output lists the final yield and total irrigation applied for each simulated
    season. Full details on the output files can be found in Notebook 1, which can
    also be further customized by users if additional outputs from the model are required.
    3. Irrigation planning and management use cases 3.1. Estimating irrigation water
    demands under different irrigation strategies (Notebook 2) A common use case for
    crop-water models such as ACOSP is estimating irrigation water demands in order
    to support on-farm and regional scale planning and allocation of limited freshwater
    resources (Araya et al., 2017, Jiang et al., 2016). One of the main strengths
    of ACOSP is the ability to rapidly evaluate and compare both simple and complex
    irrigation strategies, which the user can run as batch simulations specified interactively
    via the IrrMngtClass during model setup. ACOSP can be used to simulate a range
    of irrigation strategies such as soil-moisture thresholds, set time intervals,
    pre-defined calendars and net irrigation that are common to many other crop-water
    models. ACOSP also contains two features that enables arbitrarily complex irrigation
    strategies to be defined. First, the model can be run on a daily timestep, and
    second, any model variables can be extracted or edited before the next day is
    run. This means that irrigation application decisions can be determined outside
    the model, using information from weather forecasts, water availability (e.g.,
    hydrological model), or other external databases or models. The chosen depth can
    then be passed back into the model and applied on the next day. This ability to
    represent the complex rules, heuristics and behavioral norms that are used by
    farmers in a given region is not typically available in other crop-water models,
    and is essential to the accurate estimation of plot-level and regional irrigation
    water demands to support sustainable and efficient agricultural water management.
    An example of this feature is shown in Appendix A of Notebook 2 which also showcases
    examples of more traditional irrigation strategies such as set time intervals
    and pre-defined irrigation calendars. To demonstrate the use of ACOSP in this
    context, we apply the model to evaluate crop yields and irrigation water use over
    multiple irrigation scheduling strategies. This analysis is done for a case study
    setup of Maize production in western Nebraska in the United States for the period
    1982–2018 summarized in Foster et al. (2015). The strategies contrasted include
    seasonal soil-moisture thresholds which determine the proportion of total soil
    water holding capacity at which irrigation is triggered, ranging from 0% to 100%.
    Constant thresholds such as these are commonly used in modeling studies of irrigation
    management, as part of irrigation advisories provided by soil-moisture sensor
    manufacturers, and by farmers themselves (Blonquist et al., 2006, Gutierrez et
    al., 2014). This test therefore provides a realistic example of the capabilities
    of ACOSP to support evaluation of crop yield responses to variable irrigation
    management decisions. The results show that in the absence of irrigation, yields
    are highly variable and often fail completely (Fig. 2). This dramatic impact of
    added irrigation illustrates why Nebraska has the largest number of irrigated
    acres in the United States (USDA-NASS, 2018), reflecting the significant drought
    risks experienced by many farmers within the state (Hoerling et al., 2014, Wilhelmi
    and Wilhite, 2002). However, the relationship between soil moisture target strategy,
    irrigation and crop yields is non-linear, demonstrating a typical pattern of diminishing
    returns to water beyond approximately a soil moisture target of 40%. These results
    – and those in Appendix A of Notebook 2 – also show the significant differences
    in yield and total irrigation between strategies, meaning that correctly specifying
    how farmers make irrigation decisions is essential for accurately estimating irrigation
    water demands – a challenge given the lack of baseline data on water use in many
    farming regions worldwide (Closas and Molle, 2018, Foster et al., 2020, Foster
    et al., 2019, Montginoul et al., 2016). Download : Download high-res image (321KB)

    (expressed as a percentage of total soil water holding capacity) over 37 seasons
    for a maize crop grown in SW Nebraska, United States. 3.2. Developing and optimizing
    irrigation strategies (Notebook 3) In the previous section, we demonstrated how
    ACOSP could be used to compare yields and water use for different pre-specified
    irrigation thresholds. However, it is often the case that farmers and water managers
    lack information apriori about which irrigation strategy will produce the maximum
    yield for a given level of water use (Adeyemi et al., 2017). Determining these
    optimal strategies in practice would require considerable time and investment
    and so crop-water models are often used in their place. Often this determination
    is done via brute force search over possible strategies or leveraging optimization
    algorithms which can be either time consuming or difficult when using a GUI or
    input file based crop-water models (Araya et al., 2017, Foster and Brozović, 2018,
    García-Vila and Fereres, 2012, Jamal et al., 2019, Linker et al., 2018). In this
    example use case, we show how optimal irrigation schedules can be identified by
    linking ACOSP with one of the many optimization modules available in the Python
    ecosystem. Specifically, using the implementation of the model described in Section
    3.1, we show how ACOSP can be linked to the optimization library scipy.optimize
    (Virtanen et al., 2020) to identify optimal yield-maximizing soil moisture target
    thresholds over three seasons (2016–2018) for different seasonal water supply
    constraints (i.e. the maximum amount of water that can be applied in a given season).
    The results highlight again the non-linear relationships between crop yields and
    irrigation water use, along with changes in the distribution of water use within
    seasons characterized by variations in the optimized soil moisture thresholds
    (Fig. 3). In response to increasing water availability the optimal thresholds
    generally increase (i.e. it becomes optimal to irrigate at lower levels of soil
    moisture depletion), with water prioritized to mid- and late-season growth stages
    when overall supply is scarce, as these are the most sensitive periods of crop
    development for Maize (the example crop used in this Notebook). It should be noted
    that these optimal thresholds have been found with a local optimizer and so re-running
    the analysis in Notebook 3 may produce slightly different results than those presented
    in Fig. 3. Download : Download high-res image (269KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 3. Crop water production function showing total maize yield as a function
    of irrigation water use for an example application in SW Nebraska, United States.
    The optimization process found irrigation thresholds that maximize yield given
    a maximum seasonal irrigation limits of [0, 50,…,400, 450 mm]. Optimal irrigation
    thresholds (expressed as a percentage of total soil water holding capacity) for
    each water use constraint are also displayed, where each point has four soil moisture
    target values corresponding each of the main crop growth stages in ACOSP. This
    example analysis shows how ACOSP can be used to support optimization of irrigation
    scheduling and water allocation in the context of rising constraints over freshwater
    availability facing farmers in many regions worldwide (Mekonnen and Hoekstra,
    2016). For example, outputs from this type of analysis can be used to provide
    advice to farmers about how to effectively optimize water use in the context of
    hydrologic, technical or regulatory supply constraints, including selection of
    efficient and profitable intraseasonal irrigation management rules and heuristics.
    Data can also be used to automate and simplify the development of crop-water production
    functions such as shown in Fig. 3, which can be used by policymakers to evaluate
    expected crop yield responses to different levels of irrigation water supply and
    make decisions about efficient allocation of water within the agricultural sector
    and between agriculture and other water users (Foster and Brozović, 2018, Igbadun
    et al., 2007, Martínez-Romero et al., 2019). Users could expand this analysis
    in a number of ways. Our example of ACOSP’s optimization integration capabilities
    was performed for the simple case of a single cropped field with a uniform soil
    type and uniform weather, however this does not reflect the reality for a farmer
    irrigating larger and more diverse farms and plots. The example code provided
    in Notebook 3 could be easily adapted by users to consider more complex optimization
    problems such as this, treating each individual plot (or sub-plot if considering
    sub-field level decision making) as an individual instance of ACOSP and optimizing
    over all plot instances simultaneously. Moreover, as the season unfolds there
    may be a desire to re-optimize the irrigation thresholds for a given plot or location
    to better reflect the current climate condition. This again can be implemented
    in ACOSP simply by saving the current state of the model at day D, and optimizing
    yield starting from that point using historical data or forecasts. This ability
    to customize irrigation scheduling rules to accurately reflect real-world decisions,
    as well as expand the space of potential optimal irrigation strategies, is a key
    benefit of ACOSP compared to previous crop-water models. 3.3. Irrigation demands
    under different climate change scenarios (Notebook 4) Irrigation is used by farmers
    to buffer crops against drought and rainfall variability. Climate change is therefore
    likely to affect irrigation water demands in many regions, and the ability to
    predict these changes is essential to support sustainable management of agricultural
    water use and crop production risks (Molden, 2013). Climate change impact assessments
    are a common use case for crop-water models as they allow researchers and policy
    makers to estimate the potential vulnerabilities or future problems for a producing
    region (Dale et al., 2017, Lehmann et al., 2013, Rosenzweig et al., 2014, Semenov,
    2009). These can focus more directly on how climate changes will impact rainfed
    production, as well as secondary effects such as water use changes for irrigated
    production. These secondary factors will also impact wider issues such as groundwater
    depletion (McGuire, 2017) and so it is essential that policy makers and researchers
    can easily conduct climate change impact assessments using crop-water models like
    ACOSP. Building on this need, Notebook 4 guides users through the process of applying
    ACOSP for a simple analysis of irrigation water demands and crop yields under
    a range of future climate change scenarios. ACOSP includes inbuilt functionality
    to directly read and format weather time series for future climate scenarios generated
    externally using the LARS-WG stochastic weather generator (https://sites.google.com/view/lars-wg)
    – a widely applied weather generator for agricultural climate impact assessments
    (Qian et al., 2005, Semenov, 2009, Sha et al., 2019). Conversion of weather data
    is achieved using the prepare_lars_weather function, which includes functionality
    to calculate reference evapotranspiration inputs required by AquaCrop. Important
    to note is that as long as the final weather DataFrame passed into the AquaCropModel
    object is in the correct format, the source of the generated data, or the equations
    used to calculate reference evapotranspiration are arbitrary. This flexibility
    allows users to generate weather time series offline using alternative weather
    generators to LARS-WG or other climate datasets/models. To demonstrate this model
    application, we use ACOSP to simulate crop yields and irrigation water demands
    for the same case study of Maize production in western Nebraska considered in
    the previous notebooks. Our analysis uses weather time series generated by LARS-WG
    for different future climate time periods (2030, 2050, 2070) and emissions scenario
    (RCP4.5, RCP8.5) from the EC-Earth climate model (Hazeleger et al., 2012). This
    analysis assumes that farmers maintain to the same planting calendar and the same
    Maize variety, as well as a constant irrigation threshold of 70% total available
    water throughout all years. These simplifications are made for illustrative purposes
    of batch climate runs with the model, but could be easily relaxed to consider
    additional variations in management practices, crop characteristics, etc. to support
    comprehensive analyses of climate impacts and adaptations on crop yields and irrigation
    water demands. The results show that yields increase under these future climate
    scenarios as a result of higher CO2 concentrations, which translate into higher
    water productivity within ACOSP (Fig. 4). Irrigation water use decreases slightly
    in the climate change scenarios compared to the baseline years, a result that
    can be explained by the predicted increase in seasonal (i.e. summer) precipitation
    in Nebraska and the central United States under most future climate change scenarios
    (Notebook 4). Download : Download high-res image (478KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 4. Comparison of (a) yields and (b) total irrigation for maize crop
    in SW Nebraska, United States for baseline climate conditions (1982–2018) and
    a range of future climate scenarios. Analysis assumes farmers follow a fixed soil
    moisture target strategy (irrigate once soil water depletion exceeds 30% of soil
    water holding capacity) in all years and climate scenarios. Users could extend
    this analysis in many ways, for example by performing a batch analysis over a
    wide range of climate scenarios, or running ACOSP over a gridded domain to capture
    spatial heterogeneities or uncertainties (Dale et al., 2017). By linking these
    gridded model outputs directly to one of Python’s many geospatial visualization
    libraries (e.g. cartopy, geopandas), regional to global climate change impacts
    on agricultural production and water use can now be easily performed inside a
    single Jupyter Notebook. Computation efficiency of such analysis can be further
    improved by parallelizing over multiple processers, with users able to install
    and run ACOSP on any cloud computing service (e.g. Google Colab). An example of
    how ACOSP simulations can be run in parallel is shown in Notebook 3. 4. Outlook
    AquaCrop-OSPy (ACOSP) is a free and fully open-source tool that allows researchers,
    industry and policy makers to rapidly leverage crop-water simulation to support
    irrigation planning and management at farm to regional scales. The model features
    a user friendly interactive code design, and provides an interface to platforms
    such as Google Colab to enable a user to quickly conduct simulations via their
    web browser and leverage cloud computing resources. The extensive Python ecosystem
    means ACOSP can be easily integrated with the latest machine learning, web development,
    statistical and data analysis libraries, as well as any other python code base.
    ACOSP also enables users to bypass the licensing and operating system constrains
    associated with previous widely used versions of AquaCrop. Uptake of the model
    by users conducting applied research and teaching on agricultural water management
    and policy is supported through development of extensive documentation, including
    a series of Jupyter Notebooks (https://github.com/thomasdkelly/aquacrop) containing
    tutorials for a range of common use cases of the model related to irrigation planning,
    management and climate adaptation. These notebooks are also accompanied by an
    online forum for users (https://forum.aquacroposforum.com), which will provide
    a space for the user community to discuss bugs, share example applications and
    contribute to future development of AquaCrop. For example, opportunity exists
    for users to contribute to refinement of internal model routines (e.g. more advanced
    soil moisture flow or nutrient cycle algorithms) or novel applications of the
    model (e.g. satellite data assimilation and automated parameter calibration) that
    would be impossible to implement in a scalable or efficient manner with closed-source
    software. Through these innovations, we expect that ACOSP will help address a
    number of the issues that have constrained the use of crop-water models in both
    policy, practise and applied research surrounding agricultural water management
    at field, catchment and global scales. Future work will support the maintenance
    of core model source code in line with future AquaCrop developments, while spurring
    and enabling new innovations and adaptations to help address global challenges
    of food and water security facing the agricultural sector. Declaration of Competing

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Singapore SECTION I. Introduction Sustaining
    agricultural productivity, guaranteeing food-security, and enhancing economic
    growth in the face of climate variability, diminishing labour force, and changing
    soil conditions requires innovation in agriculture. In India, agriculture contributes
    18% of the country''s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and employs more than 50% of
    the population [1]. Notwithstanding these contributions, the sector is under stress
    and the recent economic survey of the Indian government has pointed out the need
    to extract “more crop per drop” which indicates exploiting technology and good
    practices to enhance productivity per drop of water. While this is largely dependent
    on the irrigation system, recent developments in technology are being touted as
    solutions [2]. The real-time environmental parameters such as temperature, soil
    moisture, humidity, evapotranspiration, cropping cycles, and others influence
    the crop lifecycle. Resource utilization can be optimized by real-time monitoring
    of these parameters and taking corrective actions based on sensed information.
    In this backdrop, the Internet of Things (IoT) with has emerged as an enabler
    of agriculture automation [3]–[5]. The IoT uses recent advances in sensing, networking,
    and computing technologies to enable novel applications and services. The use
    of IoT for crop monitoring has been studied in [6]–[9]. Fusing crop statistical
    information and agricultural environmental information was studied in [10]. However,
    control functionalities were not studied in these investigation. The investigations
    in [11] and [12] proposed a framework with limited control functions. The role
    of IoT for controlling the water consumption in irrigation has been studied by
    many scientists as well. A simple irrigation system was studied in [13]. An advanced
    system was proposed in [14] that aims to transform traditional farming to modern
    one. The investigation in [15] proposed using wireless sensor networks for managing
    irrigation in agricultural farms. The framework proposed allowed user to interact
    with the data and consult in a comfortable way. An IoT based smart farm irrigation
    system was proposed in [16] wherein Zigbee was used for communication between
    sensor nodes and base station. While data was collected and processed in these
    investigation, combining cloud computing with IoT was not fully explored. This
    provides additional opportunities due to the service delivery models of the cloud.
    Recently significant efforts have been devoted to combine IoT and cloud computing
    [17], [19], [20] showed that the IoT benefits can be enhanced by combining it
    with cloud computing. The role of cloud-based IoT scheme for precision agriculture
    was studied in [18]. However, the final control aspect has not been considered.
    Similarly, optimization models for irrigation have been studied in [21] without
    discussions on monitoring and control. A review of the literature reveals that
    existing approaches on using IoT are restricted to monitoring and data-aggregation.
    Final control including optimization of resources has not been studied in the
    literature to our best knowledge. In this paper, we combine the IoT sensing and
    networking capability with cloud interfaces, use the data to study the optimal
    irrigation rates, and finally implement the computed flow rates by commanding
    a solenoid valve. Consequently, a comprehensive solution including sensing, networking,
    control, and optimization is proposed. Such a methodology has not been proposed
    for agricultural irrigation purposes to our best knowledge. The main contributions
    of the paper are: A smart irrigation system that uses IoT and cloud-connectivity
    to aggregate and store information, an optimization model to compute the optimal
    irrigation parameters, and final control implemented using solenoid valves. Design
    aspects of IoT hardware, software, and their integration along with networking
    as well as cloud connectivity are discussed. Demonstrate the control methodology
    and hardware using experiments/simulations. The rest of the paper is organized
    as follows. Section II presents the system architecture and design which describes
    the various components of the system. The optimization model for irrigation control
    is presented in Section III. Results and observations are presented in Section
    IV. Conclusions are drawn from the obtained results and analysis in Section V.
    SECTION II. System Architecture and Design Fig. 1: IoT architecture of the smart
    irrigation system Show All The IoT architecture used for implementing the precision
    irrigation system is shown in Fig. 1. The components of the architecture are listed
    in Tab. I. The components are selected based on cost-reliability analysis. While
    the low-cost sensors lead to reliability issues, they perform reasonably well
    for the application considered. In this work low cost soil moisture and flow sensors
    are used. The sensors send the data to the WEMOS D1 controller and the controller
    controls the flow using sensed information. The controller controls the solenoid
    valve through which the field is irrigated. The controller also controls the DC
    motor on/off state since the motor has to be on only when any one of the valve
    is in open state. The controller is connected to the internet through the GSM
    GPRS module. The internet connectivity is provided through GSM as broadband is
    not feasible in many rural agricultural areas, whereas more than 70% of the land
    in India is feasible with GSM based cellular network. The information retrieved
    from the field is used to control the irrigation system, and it is also stored
    in the cloud (Thingspeak) for further analysis. Remote monitoring of the field
    was provided through web interface and mobile interface. The farm is split into
    several sectors as depicted in Fig. 2, the water flows through different valves
    for each sector which are deployed with a set of sensors for monitoring and a
    solenoid valve as an actuator. The sectors are sort of control regimes for which
    the water can be irrigated. This helps organizing the irrigation and monitoring
    to meet the needs of the individual sectors, thereby better management can be
    achieved. Having described the architecture, we provide a succinct description
    of the different components used in the hardware. Fig. 2: Organization of agriculture
    land as sectors Show All Table I: Components of the architecture 1) WEMOS D1 Controller
    The D1 is an ESP8266 (Wi-Fi) based controller which is compatible with the Arduino
    IDE. The functions are same as the Arduino Uno controller, whereas the WEMOS has
    the ESP8266 module by default on the board hence reducing the complexity of interfacing
    an ESP8266 with Arduino Uno. ADCs(Analog to Digital convertors) were used to interface
    multiple analog sensors to the controller. 2) Solenoid Valve The traditional valves
    are replaced with solenoid valves to control the flow. The valve is operated either
    in ON/OFF mode and a pulse-width modulation approach is used to control the flow,
    i.e., the amount of flow is proportional to the time-period for which the valve
    remains in ON state over a given time period. A 24 V relay is used to turn ON/OFF
    the solenoid valve. 3) Soil Moisture Sensor In our design, YL69 series soil moisture
    sensor or probe measures the volumetric water content in the soil. Determining
    soil moisture is considered as an important task in agriculture to assist farmers
    manage the irrigation systems more effectively. Compared to other low cost sensor
    such as gypsum block sensors, these probes tender a rapid response time. Due to
    this reason the sensor is chosen and used in the proposed design. Placing the
    soil moisture sensor in the right place is very important, since a sector''s irrigation
    is controlled by the value of the soil moisture sensor deployed for that sector.
    The soil moisture sensor works between 3.3V and 5V power supply. The output value
    of the sensor is between 0 ohms to 1000 ohms. Based on the sensor reading the
    soil can be classified into Dry, Humid and wet. The soil moisture sensor used
    is connected to the analog pin of the controller through wire. The sensor range
    for determining the soil type is shown in Tab. II. Table II: Resistance range
    of soil moisture sensor 4) Flow Sensor In this system flow sensor (YF-201) is
    used to measure the amount of water utilized in the process of irrigation. The
    amount of water utilized has to be measured in the experimental setup for the
    traditional and automated irrigation methods so that comparison can be easily
    carried out. The water flow sensor is aligned in parallel with the water line,
    and a pinwheel inside the sensor is used for measuring the water irrigated through
    it. The water flow is measured in litres/second. 5) Data Transmission Transferring
    the collected information from the farm to the Internet is a major issue as internet
    connectivity through broadband to agricultural area is still an infeasible solution
    in more than 50% of the agricultural lands across India. In this work the data
    is transmitted using the GPRS internet connectivity available through the cellular
    network providers. The cellular network covers majority of the agricultural lands
    in India and with the emergence of 3G and 4G technology it is possible to transmit
    data quickly. Instead of using a GPRS module along with the controller, we have
    used a Wi-Fi hotspot device for data transmission from the controller to the internet
    as the transmission speed is high when using hot spot as compared with a GSM GPRS
    module of the controller. The use of WEMOS controller has reduced the complexity
    in interfacing an ESP8266 when compared to Arduino. The GSM module is used to
    send messages from the controller regarding the status of the field. Fig. 3: ThingSpeak
    web interface Show All Table III: Sample data stored in thingspeak A. Cloud-Based
    Remote Monitoring The Irrigation system is initiated based on the soil moisture
    sensor value. The field is irrigated automatically using the solenoid valve or
    sprinkler. The solenoid valve and the sprinkler were connected to the controller
    using relay switch. The data from the controller is transmitted to the Thingspeak
    cloud, and the data can be viewed using Thingspeak website. The user interface
    is a simple monitoring interface which shows the readings from the sensor, the
    solenoid valve status and the amount of water used. The screen shot of the ThingSpeak
    web interface is shown in Fig. 4 and the snippet of the data displayed is shown
    in Table III. Similarly the PH value of the soil, Humidity and temperature were
    also stored in cloud. Thingspeak cloud service is an easy to access service and
    has inbuilt lab view functions. Fig. 4 shows the Thingspeak Cloud Service Interface
    for a smart phone wherein the data are represented in charts. The data feeds can
    be stored in the Thingspeak along with the timestamp for further analysis and
    for providing real-time data visualization. Fig. 4: ThingSpeak interface for smart
    phone Show All SECTION III. Optimization Model Computing the minimum irrigation
    rates based on sensed information is a decision making problem requiring help
    of optimization tools. Therefore, we model the optimal irrigation problem as an
    optimization problem. We define the following: Definition 1 The difference between
    the planting and harvesting time is denoted as the irrigation period. Definition
    2 Maximal rainfall over the irrigation period denoted by R max is the upper bound
    on the rainfall during the period. Our objective is to minimize the irrigation
    of the water over a 24 hour horizon which is given by I= ∑ t =QΔt where Q denotes
    the flow and Δ unit time step used in the analysis. In addition, we aim to exploit
    the use of rain water, and soil moisture content. the objective is modelled as:
    J= w 1 (t) S t + w 2 r t + w 3 (t)Q(t)Δ ∀t∈{t+Δ,t+2Δ,…,t+TΔ} (1) View Source by:
    where w 1 , w 2 and w 3 are weighing factors, S t soil moisture content at time

    by Q(t)≥ ( e t − r t − S t + d t ) Δ Q(t)≤ W R max (t)− r t − S t + d t Δ (4)
    View Source where e t is the threshold on water use, d t water drained, and W
    R max maximum water reserve, respectively. In addition, the evapotranspiration
    rate is constrained by EP(t)≤ r t + S t +Q(t)Δ− d t ∀t (5) View Source In addition,
    the rainfall, soil moisture, flow-rate, and drain are all positive real-values

    problem and can be solved with open source solvers such as Gnu Linear Programming
    Kit on single-board computers such as BeagleBone Black. However, in our analysis,
    the problem was solved in a computer using MATLAB''s linprog routine. SECTION
    IV. Results A. Real-Time Experiments In our experiments, a pilot having four land
    sectors each 2×2 square feet were taken to test the method. One sector was irrigated
    using traditional method in which the water flow was controlled manually, and
    the other three (Automated Irrigation, Drip Irrigation, Sprinkler Irrigation)
    were irrigated with the automated method using sensors and actuators (solenoid
    valve, sprinkler, and Drip). The spinach named Amaranthus tricolor seeds was sown
    in even quantity and grown in the entire four land sector. Water flow sensor,
    soil moisture sensor, soil PH sensor, was installed in all the sectors. Weather
    sensors like humidity, temperature Sensor and rain sensor were deployed in common
    for all the four sectors. The actuators were connected to the controller using
    wired connection. The input to the sprinkler was given using a low pressure water
    pipe as the land sector taken for irrigation is small. The irrigation was done
    based on the moisture sensor value. Different moisture values are set for different
    crops, in the experimental set up the value was set to less than 300 ohms to 950
    ohms, if the value drops below 300 ohms then the solenoid valves were opened and
    the field is irrigated and if the value was greater than 950 ohms then the solenoid
    valves were closed. For drip irrigation automation, the solenoid valves were used
    to supply water to the drip irrigation tube. In the sprinkler irrigation system
    sprinkler is supplied with a low pressure water input as the experimental prototype
    is for demonstration purpose. The soil moisture metric used to automate the irrigation
    makes sure that the land is not dry at any point of time. The data is uploaded
    to the things speak cloud using write API key. The experiments were conducted
    for a period of 3 weeks. To test the effectiveness of the optimization approach,
    we first propose a moisture based control as shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5: Moisture-based
    control Show All The following two scenarios were compared: Flow control based
    on moisture level with valve control, sprinkler control, and drip irrigation;
    Flow control using optimization approach with valve irrigation, sprinkler control,
    and drip irrigation; In the optimization model, the change in irrigation conditions
    correlate to change in the limits of the flow-rates Q(t) . B. Results with Heuristic
    Control The flows for a period of 3 weeks were used to study the effectiveness
    of the flow-based control. The results of all three automated irrigation methods
    were compared with conventional method. In Drip irrigation method the system is
    highly efficient saving around 24%, compared to 20% in sprinkler and 16% in Solenoid
    valve based automated irrigation. In this experimental prototype, deficient watering
    condition was eliminated as the water resources were sufficient throughout the
    experiment. Water deficit might occur when the system is implemented in the real
    agricultural field due to water scarcity. The data is stored in cloud with ease
    using the API funtions in thingspeak. The flow control over for a period of six
    days with flow-based control is shown in Fig. 6 shows that the drip irrigation
    the flow is relatively lower than other irrigation systems. C. Simulation Results
    with Optimization Based Control The flows for a period of 1 week with optimization
    based control was used to study the effectiveness of optimization based control
    for the three irrigation schemes. In drip irrigation method the method provided
    31.2% over conventional method and an increase in 7% savings over flow-based control.
    Similarly, in sprinkler irrigation, the savings were 26% and 22% in solenoid valve
    based control. Our simulations shows that optimization based control outperforms
    the flow-based control in terms of water savings. Fig. 6: Automated versus manual
    control with sprinkler system for flow-based control Show All Fig. 7: Automated
    versus manual control with sprinkler system for optimization-based control Show
    All D. Observations It was observed that the pH value of the soil decreases with
    an increase in moisture levels. The IoT and cloud-connectivity enhanced the data-aggregation
    and visualization capability significantly. Combining IoT, cloud-connectivity,
    and optimization models will help enhance water efficiency of the agriculture
    systems. The irrigation system was automated by connecting solenoid values which
    helped increase the agility of the control. SECTION V. Conclusions This investigation
    presented an automated irrigation system to reduce water utilization in agriculture
    by combining Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, and optimization. The
    automated irrigation system is realized by deploying low-cost sensors to sense
    variables of interest such as pH, temperature, humidity, soil type and weather
    conditions. The data is stored in Thingspeak cloud service for monitoring and
    storage. Then an optimization model for reducing the water usage was proposed
    and constraints modelling the physical conditions were included. The optimal flow
    rate was determined solving the optimization model and it was shown that the flow
    rate can be automated using solenoid valves. The optimization-based control was
    compared with flow-based control and our results demonstrated that optimization
    models help in reducing the water consumption. Improving the optimization models
    and enhancing the IoT prototype are future course of this investigation. Authors

  explanation: In the proposed automated water irrigation management system, an AI-powered
    algorithm is integrated with edge computing on Internet of Things (IoT) devices
    to analyze water consumption data. This allows for real-time decision-making and
    control of irrigation systems. The algorithm is trained on data collected from
    sensors deployed in the field, and it can identify water misuse events, such as
    leaks or excessive usage. When a misuse event is detected, the system sends an
    alert to the user, who can then take appropriate action. This system has the potential
    to significantly reduce water waste and improve the efficiency of irrigation systems.
  extract_1: '"This work presented a pilot implementation targeted at intercepting
    water usage events and characterizing them properly, with the emphasis to be put
    on misuse cases, such as leakages or wastes. The rapid growth of electronics and
    of the pairing software allowed for very cost-effective but efficient solutions,
    with cutting-edge features. Indeed, the adoption of machine learning techniques
    at the edge points (i.e., where the water sensors are) was drastically reducing
    the amount of information that needed to travel from the peripheral nodes to the
    central node and the cloud. This fact resulted in reduced communication load and
    energy consumption, while it increased autonomy and privacy."'
  extract_2: '"The water usage episodes the experimental system was trained to intercept
    were of comparatively short duration, but the software and hardware methods being
    used, and the accuracy being achieved, make the proposed arrangements, only with
    minor configuration modifications, to be applicable for supporting a wide variety
    of water preservation/misuse detection scenarios. Apparently, several issues are
    still open, requiring more elaboration for the delivery of an out-of-the-box solution.
    The time interval between the fixed, in number (e.g., 200), consecutive flow data
    required for a characterization decision, was set to 1 s during the training.
    The same trained model, can still be valid considering intervals of much longer
    value (e.g., of 30 s instead of 1 s), provided that the proper normalization in
    flow values will be made and that the activity will be classified in following
    the same pattern. Nevertheless, gathering richer data sets, reflecting further
    realistic use cases, can train the model more accurately, and is an apparent priority
    for wider applicability. This training can follow the same generic principles
    and methods described herein."'

    The digital transformation of agriculture is a promising necessity for tackling
    the increasing nutritional needs of the population on Earth and the degradation
    of natural resources. Focusing on the “hot” area of natural resource preservation,
    the recent appearance of more efficient and cheaper microcontrollers, the advances
    in low-power and long-range radios, and the availability of accompanying software
    tools are exploited in order to monitor water consumption and to detect and report

    large quantities of water are wasted for a variety of reasons; from broken irrigation
    pipes to people’s negligence. To tackle this problem, the necessary design and
    implementation details are highlighted for an experimental water usage reporting
    system that exhibits Edge Artificial Intelligence (Edge AI) functionality. By
    combining modern technologies, such as Internet of Things (IoT), Edge Computing

    Impulse 1. Introduction The degradation of natural resources in quality and quantity
    has a direct impact on the global food production numbers. According to FAO [1],
    the agricultural sector should increase its productivity by 60 per cent to counterbalance
    the depletion of natural resources and the population growth on Earth. The utilization
    of innovative technologies seems to be a key factor for addressing these issues.
    In this regard, toward a successful digital transformation of agriculture, it
    is promising that the rapid development of the electronics industry has managed
    to increase the production numbers and the quality of several components, such
    as microcontroller units (MCUs), single board computers, sensors, and radio transceivers,
    at very affordable cost levels. More specifically, the recently appeared new generation
    of microcontrollers, apart from orchestrating typical sensing and acting tasks,
    can support composite operations at reduced execution times, as they have faster
    and more efficient processors and larger memory. In parallel, the advances in
    radio technology deliver low-power modules capable of long-range communication
    at reduced energy levels. These high-end components are not only widely available
    but are also accompanied by very fluent documentation and software tools that
    facilitate their programming, leading to improved implementations. These characteristics
    can lead to a more efficient approach regarding serious problems, such as the
    preservation of natural resources. Nevertheless, any fusion of software and hardware
    elements has first to address potential implementation bottlenecks, prior to the
    delivery of any effective solution. Indeed, as the world will be populated by
    billions of connected devices [2] of limited resources, interacting with the surrounding
    environment and users, the bottleneck will be the increased amount of data traffic
    that could congest the network and generate several latency, reliability and privacy
    problems [3,4]. The deployment of enhanced processing features on Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices, for example Machine Learning (ML), reduces the network congestion
    by allowing computations to be performed close to the data sources, and thus it
    preserves privacy in uploading data, and reduces power consumption for wireless
    transmission to gateways or cloud servers [4]. In this regard, one of the options
    is to run the intelligent algorithms locally on the end devices (e.g., on the
    sensor nodes hardware). If the tasks are performed by smaller devices, less power
    will be required to keep them running and more flexible energy management will
    be applied, compared with the typical central system case. Small devices can operate
    on batteries for months or even for years, while a diverse set of energy harvesting
    options is offered for elongated operation duration. Thankfully, the recent technological
    advances delivered end devices with improved hardware characteristics (i.e., processing
    capabilities and memory size), thus making it possible for these devices to execute
    machine learning algorithms in an efficient and cost-effective manner. Not only
    do the microcontrollers become better performing, but the application of machine
    learning techniques on them, such as the artificial neural networks (ANNs), have
    also become more efficient, due to the improvement of the corresponding software
    platforms and tools. In greater detail, the execution/utilization phase of an
    ANN requires less computational power than its training phase. In fact, during
    the training, a large amount of data is used to calculate the weights and biases
    of the network, and thus a quite powerful machine is needed. Once the learning
    has been completed and the network has been trained, the model can be used for
    inference actions with lower computational requirements [4]. Consequently, the
    AI algorithms can more likely be run on devices with less resources, as microcontrollers,
    allowing local data processing. Nevertheless, as the trained models may still
    remain comparatively heavy for the in situ MCUs, tools such as TensorFlow Lite
    [5], in the context of TinyML [6], make possible the creation of trimmed-down
    versions that can be fit safely in the improved generation of MCUs, but still
    of limited computational and memory capacity. Finally, the improved transmission
    range characteristics of the low power wide area network (LPWAN) technologies,
    such as LoRa, perfectly fit to the reduced network traffic profiles [7]. The balanced
    utilization of the discussed technological innovations can deliver applications
    that can be very helpful for solving real-world problems, e.g., the preservation
    of water resources. Water is one of the most critical resources on the Earth as,
    apart from humans, both plants and animals depend on it, while many processes
    from irrigation to washing or food preparation, cannot be accomplished without
    it. Despite its necessity, large amounts of water are being wasted due to a variety
    of reasons, from water pipe or valve failures to human inattention. It is noteworthy
    that according to the World Bank [8], the non-revenue water (NRW) level in developing
    countries ranges from 40% to 50% of the water pumped into the distribution systems.
    Furthermore, 80 per cent of wastewater in the world flows back into the ecosystem
    without being treated or reused, and 70 per cent of the world’s natural wetland
    extent has been lost [9]. Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) [9] on water
    and sanitation, adopted by United Nations (UN) Member States as part of the 2030
    Agenda for Sustainable Development [10], highlights in practice the importance
    of the proper water resource management, from both quantitative and qualitative
    perspective. As agriculture remains the largest consumer of water globally, the
    significance of water for keeping the food produce to satisfactory levels is crucial.
    Targeted at the preservation of water resources with emphasis on their impact
    on agriculture, in this work, the pilot implementation of a smart water usage
    alerting system is presented. The whole approach exploits the findings of the
    approach described in [11] toward the delivery of a more compact and efficient
    solution with artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities. The latter task is addressed
    by utilizing recently-appeared, cost effective but powerful microcontroller boards
    and software, for supporting the in situ machine learning operations, and a low-power
    and long-range radio network technology based on the LoRa protocol. The combination
    of these elements results in reduced power consumption and in less network traffic
    and processing load for the central entities of the network, as the water usage
    classification decisions are taken locally, at the edges of the network, and only
    notification messages have to travel toward the end user. Response times are also
    reduced, while privacy is better preserved. The water usage episodes that the
    smart system had been trained to intercept were of comparatively short duration,
    but the methods being used and the accuracy being achieved make the proposed arrangements,
    only with minor modifications, to be applicable for supporting a wide variety
    of water preservation/misuse detection scenarios. Apart from this introductory
    section, in order to better highlight the main objectives of this research, the
    rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 highlights the motives and
    the challenges behind this work and the design directions being necessary. Section
    3 provides interesting implementation details. Section 4 is dedicated to evaluation
    results and discussion. Finally, Section 5 contains important concluding remarks.
    2. Background and Design Overview 2.1. Motives and Challenges for Agriculture
    Internet of things (IoT) is an emerging technology that includes devices connected
    to the Internet equipped with sensors, transducers, radio transceivers, and actuators
    comprising a functioning of the whole that gathers, interchanges and responds
    to information [12]. In this regard, the IoT makes agricultural automation more
    efficient, and thus fosters production [13]. Recent works emphasize the contribution
    of the IoT technologies in critical agricultural operations [14,15], including
    precision farming, livestock, and greenhouses, with the irrigation and water management
    activities to be of among the open issues of growing interest [16]. Machine Learning
    (ML) is a very welcome companion for any IoT solution and provides multiple solutions
    to problems that were among the most difficult to be tacked without, some years
    ago. The exploitation of the ML potential by agriculture is a necessity that follows
    several directions [17], even beyond Agriculture 4.0 [18]. The most significant
    advantage of machine learning techniques is that they can provide generally applicable
    solutions, with minor human intervention and in a way that does not require meticulous
    a priori knowledge of the idiosyncracies of the system the solution is being tailored
    for. This makes satisfactorily-working solutions to be generated easily and quickly
    by people with less expertise in a specific area. Apparently, the role of the
    “experts” of the sector cannot be overlooked, but their involvement into the whole
    process remains consulting and supervising, as they do not have to inject “magic”
    threshold values into conventional and difficult to maintain blocks of code. The
    Edge Computing (EC) is a newcomer to the equation of tackling modern problems
    more efficiently using IoT and ML. Indeed, a traditional IoT solution (a few years
    ago) typically required a large amount of real-time sensor data to be destined
    to a central computer entity in the cloud which in its turn had to process this
    increased amount of data, to take the necessary decisions and probably had to
    deliver the corresponding responses back to the appropriate nodes. This organization
    had to tackle high communication and processing loads, while any potential failure
    of the central entity would result in total system collapse. Furthermore, data
    privacy concerns were also very reasonable, as third-party communication, storage
    and/or decision entities had to get involved in the whole process. On the contrary,
    by increasing the intelligence at the edges of the network (i.e., on or nearby
    the sensor nodes), decisions and any potential action are addressed locally, in
    a faster, cheaper and more private way, thus leaving considerably less (or none
    at all) work for the central entity [4,19]. Typically, only sporadic metadata
    information updates are necessary toward the central entity, mainly for supervision
    purposes. The enrichment of IoT with Edge Computing and Machine Learning functionality
    is often referred as Edge Artificial Intelligence (Edge AI) and tries to exploit
    the advantages of these technologies, for serving a wide set of applications in
    a better manner, with the agricultural sector not to be an exception [20]. In
    this regard, the approach being presented is trying to highlight how these elements
    of innovation can be combined to ease the intense problem of water resource waste.
    Demographics continue changing and unsustainable economic practices are affecting
    the quantity and quality of the water being available, thus making it an increasingly
    scarce and expensive resource [9]. Inevitably, water is at the core of sustainable
    development and is closely linked to poverty reduction and climate change. As
    agriculture remains the largest consumer of water globally and irrigation is responsible
    for 70% of its use worldwide, water is the most valuable resource for keeping
    the quality and the quantity of plant and animal production to satisfactory levels.
    The way water is utilized for both urban and rural use directly impacts its future
    availability and thus, emphasis must be placed on water management and irrigation
    efficiency and make sure clean water can be provided for all people. Apart from
    the more conventional bare IoT solutions for water resource management and utilization,
    mainly with focus on agriculture, there is a growing interest for the exploitation
    of ML in order to achieve better results [21,22,23,24]. The fusion with Edge AI
    functionality has yet a lot to offer. The potential exploitation of modern microcontrollers
    for water usage related applications with embedded ML functionality has already
    started delivering interesting outcomes [25], in neighboring scientific areas,
    with the selection of devices and functions for communication between sensor appliances
    to remain a key challenge [26] for success. On the other hand, recent studies
    show that farmers are still facing concerns for adopting the IoT technologies
    in their everyday activities. This skepticism is attributed to a variety of reasons,
    from privacy concerns due the cloud-based nature of many solutions to fears for
    job cuts and for high purchase and maintenance costs [27,28], while it is really
    hard to find experts having the necessary set of talents at a satisfactory degree
    and being available for fluent cooperation, at the same time. Furthermore, while
    the machine learning methods seem to provide accurate and less expensive solutions
    [23] for water misuse detection events such as leaks, there is enough room for
    further improvements. Indeed, due to the very recent character of the innovative
    hardware and software components supporting in situ (i.e., on-device node) machine
    learning techniques, in the agricultural sector for water utilization report/classification
    purposes, few works combine these assets toward the delivery of a cost effective
    and efficient solution with Edge AI characteristics. There are research contributions
    that exploit IoT infrastructures for water monitoring purposes, but without incorporating
    AI functionality [29] or there are contributions that exploit machine learning
    methods that either require central processing of the data being collected [30,31]
    or that they are not optimized to be executed by the new low-cost and high-efficiency
    microcontrollers [32]. These remarks are in line with recent review findings in
    agriculture [24] and reflect a problem already specified in the wider IoT area
    [4,33]. Trying to bridge this gap, the proposed solution indicates that, for water
    usage characterization/report delivery, a quite accurate model can now be trained,
    using flexible tools, be executed on the end device and communicate its classification
    reports using almost negligible power and bandwidth resources. Combining decentralized
    intelligence and low-cost design, provision is made for reduced to null amount
    of information to travel toward the cloud. These arrangements are addressing data
    privacy and reliability issues as well. 2.2. Functionality Overview and Component
    Selection This section reports briefly on the components being selected as well
    as on their role, in order to develop a system capable of intercepting and characterizing
    water usage events. This system includes sensor nodes, placed in situ, at the
    edge points where the water is actually being used, as well as the suitable sink/gateway
    node(s) able to collect the reports delivered by the aforementioned peripheral
    nodes. The “key” point of the approach being presented is that the edge (sensor)
    nodes, apart from collecting time series corresponding to events containing the
    instantaneous water consumption data, are “smart” enough to classify these events
    into categories of proper or improper use of water, without assistance from external
    entities. Thus, via this “filtering”, only the classification reports have to
    travel toward the gateway and the cloud (if the latter is necessary). The analytical
    (low quality and high volume) information of the instantaneous water consumption
    might flood the network infrastructures and exhaust the batteries of the edge
    nodes. The user can easily monitor the operation of the whole system via their
    portable equipment (e.g., their tablet, smart phone, or laptop) using conventional
    connectivity options (e.g., Wi-Fi or 3G/4G), either locally or remotely (e.g.,
    via a virtual private networking (VPN) service). The proposed architecture is
    depicted in Figure 1. Figure 1. Functionality overview of the proposed water usage
    event characterization solution. The proposed implementation exploited the experience
    gained during the activities described in [11] with the excellent Arduino Nano
    33 BLE Sense [34] microcontroller that offers plenty of sensors and connectivity
    options, but utilized an even newer generation of cheaper microcontroller modules
    that were able to host and to execute composite machine learning algorithms, at
    the same price levels with the “traditional” units. For this reason, the Raspberry
    Pi Pico [35] microcontroller board (that costs about 6€) was selected, which,
    apart from its very attractive price, has fluent processing power and memory (due
    to its new RP2040 chip). More specifically, the Raspberry Pi Pico unit, grace
    at its new RP2040 chip, has fluent processing power and memory, that allows for
    larger and faster program execution compared to the typical Arduino Uno [36] standard,
    as it exhibits 64 times more flash memory (i.e., program memory), 128 times more
    random access memory (RAM) and a much faster dual-core processor. Consequently,
    the Raspberry Pi Pico board was able to support, apart from the basic water consumption
    metering process, the necessary machine learning functionality to invoke the corresponding
    water usage alert message generation. For the final deployment, the absence of
    a radio interface on the Raspberry Pi Pico unit was counterbalanced by the adoption
    of a cost effective microcontroller board, running at 8 MHz and equipped with
    a LoRa radio, namely a LoRa32u4 unit [37]. For programming both systems, the preferred
    option was the well-supported Arduino IDE [38] environment. During the implementation
    and testing stages, an ESP8266 based module [39], namely an ESP-01 unit, offering
    Wi-Fi connectivity, was utilized. The water flow meter device is a Hall-effect
    counter sensor (YF-S201 [40] model), which can detect the flow changes as the
    water passes through it and the rotor rolls. Furthermore, the MIT App Inventor
    cloud-based programming environment [41] was selected for the easy creation of
    a mobile application for inspecting the water usage activity, via the smart phone/tablet
    device of the user. To add machine learning functionality, it was necessary to
    prepare and incorporate a trained artificial neural network (ANN) model into the
    software running on the Raspberry Pi Pico. An artificial neural network is based
    on the operation of neurons in the human brain. This structure has one input layer,
    one or more hidden layers, being interconnected, and an output layer for delivering
    the results. A very simple and efficient manner to prepare (i.e., to train and
    to extract/compile) a suitable ANN model was the Edge Impulse [42] cloud environment.
    The latter processing environment incorporates the functionality of the TensorFlow
    Lite engine for training neural networks. More specifically, it is equipped with
    fluent graphical interface and network connectivity options for importing sensor
    data, designing the ANN model, applying assistive processing blocks, for creating,
    testing and deploying the final version of it. Finally, the coefficients describing
    the ANN are stored in the memory of the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller, and
    thus the AI algorithm can be executed on a device with comparatively low but enough
    capacity, in terms of processing power and RAM. The Edge Impulse platform, from
    February of 2022, provides full support from the Raspberry Pi Pico board. The
    gateway node, gathers the classification decision information from the peripheral
    (edge) sensor nodes, stores and makes it available for the end device (e.g., smart
    phone, tablet or laptop) of the user, via common network services installed on
    it, or posts the information to the cloud, for better visualization and post-processing.
    Details referred to the latter choice are beyond the scope of this research work.
    3. Implementation Details In accordance with the design and functionality directions
    provided in Section 2.2, Section 3 is dedicated in presenting characteristic details
    of the implementation process. The analytic steps being followed for the training
    are illustrated in Figure 2. Figure 2. The analytic steps being necessary for
    the training of the proposed water usage event characterization solution. More
    specifically, the basic water flow sensing unit connection and programming arrangements
    are highlighted, in order to gather efficient data for training the ANN model
    (step 1), and thus, to add machine learning capabilities to the whole system.
    The details for this training are also explained (steps 2 and 3), as well as the
    incorporation of the trained ANN model into the microcontroller of the flow-metering
    system (step 4) for enhancing its functionality. In parallel, the corresponding
    network node(s) arrangements are discussed, as well as the characteristics of
    a pairing end-user mobile application, for the delivery of a fluently working
    solution. 3.1. Initial Sensor Node Preparation The Raspberry Pi Pico is a 3.3
    V level unit, for this reason, the flow sensor was connected to its 3.3 V supply
    pin, in order to generate 3.3 V logic compatible pulse signals to its output.
    The 3.3 V level was adequate for the operation of the specific flow metering device
    being selected. Furthermore, the output of the latter sensor was connected with
    an interrupt (input) digital pin of the microcontroller, and the ground pins of
    both components were also wired together. The sensor was connected to a testing
    tap via a pipe, and thus, it could be exposed to a variety of water consumption
    scenarios potentially being invoked by human, according to empirical assumptions.
    The Arduino IDE environment was customized properly by downloading and installing
    the necessary libraries corresponding to the Raspberry Pi Pico, according to the
    instructions of the its official page, for facilitating the programming process
    of the microcontroller, via a computer through a USB port connection. The pulses
    that the flow sensor was generating correspond to the rotations of its blades
    and thus to the water flow passing through it. More specifically, according to
    the basic algorithm, as the flow sensor signal generated a pulse signal any time
    2.22 mL water quantity, approximately, passed through it, the Raspberry Pi Pico
    intercepted these pulses as interrupt triggers to be counted and, in turn, calculated
    an one-second average value corresponding to the water flow (in mL). The sequence
    of these flow values was output to the serial port of the microcontroller. After
    compiling the program (sketch) and uploading it to the Raspberry Pi Pico board,
    the sequence of the flow measurements was acquired via the USB cable. The latter
    measurements were fed into the machine learning platform, in order to train the
    suitable ANN model, as the Edge Impulse environment offers options for automated
    uploading of the values being measured. 3.2. Training the Neural Network The corresponding
    ANN model to be generated had to be simple and lightweight enough for the microcontroller’s
    potential but still precise enough. In this regard, the system was trained to
    recognize three characteristic kinds of water utilization profiles: the Normal
    Use or NU, Water Leak or WL and Water Waste or WW. The proper training of an ANN
    requires data series corresponding to each of these categories to be collected
    and to be uploaded to the Edge Impulse engine. The total data length was 5 h 55
    min 47 s (148 files) for all three cases. According to Edge Impulse platform requirements,
    the duration of the data length had to be approximately the same for all categories,
    in order for the final model to be more accurate. Nevertheless, the number of
    profiles for each case may differ (NU: 69, WL: 44, WW: 44 profiles). During the
    profile collection process, the lowest flow value that the flow sensor could record
    was about 10–15 mL/s, while the maximum flow being recorded was in the range between
    250 and 280 mL/s. The network was trained using empirical data based on human
    observations for classifying samples (water usage episodes) into categories. In
    general, NU profiles were created so as to contain low to moderate flow values
    and having duration below 180 s, making the training pattern hypothesis that a
    non-WL water usage scenario would last for 3 min at maximum. Similarly, it was
    assumed that WL profiles exhibited continuous flow duration of more than 180 s
    and that most WW profiles had flow consumption over 160 mL/s and duration of more
    than 160 s, as it would be more likable for the classification experiment, during
    the episodes to use water for shorter time and at lower flow rate. Some typical
    profiles for each category are given in Figure 3, where the water flow was measured
    in ml/s and the time was measured in seconds (s). For each category, there is
    a diversification among the profiles being recorded and fed to the training system.
    This diversification results in increased accuracy under real-world conditions.
    Figure 3. (a,b) Normal Use profiles; (c,d) Water Leak profiles; (e,f) Water Waste
    profiles. In the next stage, the water flow data (raw data) were uploaded to the
    Edge Impulse cloud platform, via the Data Acquisition menu category, and were
    split into training and testing data, automatically, while the data labelling
    was performed manually. For training of the ANN model, the window size was set
    at 200,000 ms (i.e., 200 s), according to the profiles that were fed into the
    training system and by taking into consideration the maximum time that a person
    might use the tap. Similarly, the window increase was set at 1000 ms (i.e., at
    1 s) and the frequency at 1 Hz (i.e., for 1 sps sampling rate). Furthermore, “Raw
    Data” was selected as the preferred processing block and “Classification (Keras)”
    as the ANN learning block. The option “Raw Data” means that no additional prepossessing
    was made (e.g., a spectral characteristics extraction) before using the original
    data for the training process. This option does not reduce the number of features
    to be fed to the input layer of the network, but also preserves as many characteristics
    of the initial data as possible and, as it is explained right below, it fits easily
    in the microcontroller being selected. Furthermore, the number of training cycles
    was set to the moderate value of 50, to avoid overfitting, and the learning rate
    at 0.0005, via the NN Classifier configuration section, as the Edge Impulse suggests.
    The final neural network structure has an input layer with 200 features (window
    size), two hidden layers, with the first one to have 20 neurons and the second
    one 10 neurons, and an output layer with 3 classes (NU, WL, WW). This architecture
    for the NN provided an optimal combination between performance and computer resource
    allocation (i.e., model accuracy versus time needed for a decision to be made
    and memory size needed for hosting the program in the flash and for executing
    it in RAM). For the specific model, in the quantized version, the RAM usage was
    1.9 KB and the flash memory usage was 22.5 KB, values that are far below the capacity
    limit of the Raspberry Pi Pico unit. It must be noted though that during the actual
    operation of the microcontroller, more memory will be needed as along with the
    NN model coexist several variables and code parts dedicated to other tasks. The
    Edge Impulse platform allows for easy experimentation with various candidate settings
    and for saving the model with the best performance after the end of the training
    process. Finally, there is the option to download the model from the Edge Impulse
    cloud platform, via the “Deployment” section of Edge Impulse menu category, as
    code that includes library and sketches to be compiled and uploaded to the microcontroller
    via the Arduino IDE environment. 3.3. Sensor Node Software Enhancement As explained
    in Section 3.2, the code generated by the Edge Impulse platform, in the form of
    a generic Arduino library, provides customizable examples (sketches) for the Arduino
    environment, with the Raspberry Pi Pico board to be among the models being supported,
    and thus, being compatible with the generated model parameters. The selection
    of the “Arduino library” option (instead of the tailored firmware output one)
    provides freedom to combine the machine learning engine with further algorithmic
    behaviors being necessary to be executed by the hosting microcontroller. In this
    regard, the final software running on the microcontroller had to be updated so
    as to be able to perform (almost simultaneously) some simple but sharp calculations/tasks
    of different time granularity: Intercept the interrupt signals corresponding to
    the rotor roll pulses of the water flow sensor module; Calculate the instantaneous
    water consumption, at a fixed and specific rate, typically 1 or 2 times per second,
    update the aggregate metrics, and trigger the classification process every time
    the predefined number of samples (i.e., 200) was gathered; Deliver system status
    data and water usage reports via USB to the hosting computer, or wirelessly to
    a gateway node or to the operator’s smart phone/tablet; As expected, the above
    tasks had to be performed without blocking or delaying each other, constraints
    that required meticulous programming (e.g., using timer events) to achieve fluent
    operation. Optimally, the delivery of information toward the gateway had to take
    place once, after the end of each classification process utilizing the 200 consecutive
    samples. Nevertheless, for debugging or training purposes, all 200 values had
    to be transmitted toward the gateway node. Communication with the LoRa32u4 radio
    module was achieved through the serial TTL level port of the microcontroller.
    3.4. Gateway Node and User-End Software For the reception (and the inspection)
    of the remote alerts through Wi-Fi, an android smart phone or a tablet device,
    which most modern people are familiar with, was a satisfactory solution. The MIT
    App Inventor environment was utilized in order to deploy a simple monitoring application.
    The necessary programming was completed using visual blocks, based on the information
    provided in [43,44]. The initial deployment involved direct connection between
    the smart water sensor node and the end user equipment (e.g., a tablet device),
    typically through a Wi-Fi connection link. This solution is not optimal if multiple
    sensors units exist and deliver water usage reports in parallel. Furthermore,
    the latter sensors may be placed at comparatively long distances from the user.
    These facts made necessary the development of a gateway/sink node to gather the
    corresponding data and the migration to LoRa radio links. For implementing the
    latter gateway node, a Raspberry Pi 3 Model A+ had been selected [45], due to
    its reduced size and energy footprint and its fluent programming and interfacing
    options. The Raspberry Pi Model 3 A+ unit allows for fast implementation of code
    that intercepts the data reports from the peripheral smart sensor nodes, storing
    them into files or a simple database, and making them available via the proper
    TCP/IP based service. This request could be either asynchronous or periodic (i.e.,
    generated by a proper application running on the user’s mobile phone). These tasks
    are served using python and Linux shell scripts, inter process communication (IPC)
    techniques exploiting IP sockets, and the activation of preexisting applications
    such as the Apache web server, the SSH server and/or a Virtual Private Networking
    (VPN) service. Furthermore, the gateway node, properly combined with VPN networking
    techniques, assured monitoring functions from distant locations, based on the
    availability of Wide Area Network (WAN) wired or wireless technologies (i.e.,
    3G/4G, DSL, etc.). 3.5. Summary of IoT Deployment Steps The Edge AI tasks had
    to be performed fluently, while deployment in open-field environments using long-range
    radios, such as LoRa, was an important priority. The final functionality being
    implemented can be summarized in the following steps/cases: Use a Wi-Fi radio
    transceiver (e.g., an ESP-01 module), attached to the sensor node, to provide
    communication between the sensor node and the user’s smart phone/tablet, for testing
    purposes, during the initial deployment; Use a Raspberry Pi Model 3 A+ and a LoRa
    radio module as a LoRa gateway/web server, in conjunction with the LoRa radio
    transceiver modules being attached to the (preferably more than one) smart sensor
    nodes; Increase user-friendliness by adding services using the Raspberry Pi Model
    3 A+ unit of the gateway node and well-known web-based applications. Case 1 was
    suitable for verifying the basic wireless connectivity potential of the sensor
    node via the tablet/smart phone device of the user, being nearby the sensor. This
    arrangement made easy for the user to inspect the status of the water activity
    characterization system for one smart sensor and from short distances. The need
    to have a more complete on-demand view of the status of more than one water use
    points, at increased distance, was favoring the adoption of a local gateway node
    facilitating the whole monitoring process, as explained in case 2. The sensor
    nodes were sending water usage notifications toward this local gateway, over LoRa.
    It must be noted though that the TCP/IP technology, as a solution for the delivery
    of data (i.e., the sporadic metadata) from the sensors to the gateway, is not
    optimal, in terms of energy consumption, complexity and range coverage. Indeed,
    in a typical application scenario, the distance between the sensor nodes and the
    gateway node is limited to a hundred meters, approximately. If willing to extend
    this distance to the kilometer range or beyond, without special and expensive
    equipment, transceivers utilizing technologies such as LoRa are more suitable.
    In case of the LoRa solution, the LoRa32u4 board, as a transceiver, was the optimal
    selection for both the sensor and gateway nodes, due to its low cost and its easy
    programming. The RadioHead software package [46] is a very efficient library that
    supports several critical LoRa protocol functions, and thus, it was adopted for
    adjusting the LoRa32u4 modules. These modules were programmed easily via the Arduino
    IDE environment. Consequently, the microcontroller of each sensor node was connected
    (typically via its hardware serial TTL interface) with a LoRa32u4 board in order
    to relay the water usage information from the machine learning engine toward the
    gateway node. A Lora32u4 board was also connected via USB with the Raspberry Pi
    3 Model A+ unit implementing the gateway functions. The necessary code was written
    in python to bridge the serial port of the LoRa32u4 board with an IP socket service
    running on the gateway node. Characteristic deployment arrangements are depicted
    in Figure 4a,b. More specifically, Figure 4a depicts the smart water sensor node
    implementation using a Raspberry Pi Pico unit and a LoRa radio, while in Figure
    4b the gateway/sink node implementation is depicted using a Raspberry Pi 3 Model
    A+ and a LoRa radio. The information exchanged between the LoRa radios was packetized
    and encrypted using the RadioHead library and the Arduino Cryptography Library
    [47], in order to hide the sensitive data from non-authorized users. Figure 4.

    Initial experiments were performed using USB powering via the hosting computer
    and/or power banks. Later updates included LiPo or Li-ion batteries, mainly of
    18650 type which are cheap and robust, as well as small photovoltaic panels (e.g.,
    2 W units). It must be noted though that the absence of a permanent power supply
    source nearby is not always the rule, and thus the operation of the alerting system
    was facilitated. 4. Results and Evaluation This work is putting emphasis on intercepting
    water usage events and on characterizing them properly. Via fluently-working machine
    learning techniques, applied at the edges of the network, the amount of information
    that needs to travel from the peripheral nodes to the central node and the cloud
    is minimized. This fact signifies reduced communication load and energy consumption,
    and better autonomy and privacy. The adoption of simple, long-range and low-energy
    radios facilitates the whole process. Relevant details are given into the following
    Section 4.1, Section 4.2, Section 4.3 and Section 4.4. 4.1. Testing the Acuracy
    of the Model For classification evaluation algorithms, accuracy is the most frequently
    used indicator, and it is defined as the proportion of the correctly classified
    samples to the total number of samples. After the training process, based on the
    testing data, the system generated the right outcome for the NU category with
    77.8% accuracy. Similarly, for the WW and WL categories, 100% success was achieved,
    according to Edge Impulse cloud environment. These performance results made the
    final model to have a 98.5% expected accuracy, using the testing data set, in
    the Quantized (int8) version. At next stage, actual water consumption episodes
    of known type (i.e., NU, WW or WL) had to be invoked, by rotating the tap head
    properly, thus letting the proposed machine learning engine to perform classification
    according to the flow data being collected (i.e., in chunks of 200 consecutive
    values). The corresponding results were recorded. Figure 5 depicts the proposed
    sensor node connected in-line with a water tap. This process was matching the
    steps being followed during the training stage of the system. Figure 5. The proposed
    sensor node connected in-line with a water tap. It must be noted that the in-parallel
    visual inspection of the ongoing process was drastically facilitating the experiments.
    More specifically, further arrangements were made in order for the whole sequence
    of the analytical flow readings to arrive to the smart phone/tablet device, using
    a modified version of the application created for the end user (as presented in
    Section 3.4). This application variant provided detailed real-time graphs (into
    the form of histograms) reflecting the instantaneous water consumption during
    each episode, for direct comparison and adjustments. Figure 6a–f illustrate indicative
    smart phone screenshots reflecting typical water usage characterization decisions
    during the actual testing process, corresponding to the NU, WL and WW categories,
    respectively. Figure 6. (a–f) Indicative smart phone screenshots during the in
    situ testing process, reflecting typical water usage characterization decisions
    for the categories NU, WL and WW, respectively. The combination of the trained
    ANN model implementation with simple more conventional programming techniques
    was improving the accuracy and the response times of the system being presented.
    For instance, the in situ module logic was modified so as to ignore the zero-flow
    events, as an episode (i.e., event) started being recorded only after the arrival
    of the first non-zero flow value. Table 1 contains the confusion matrix that corresponds
    to the testing of the real system, after classifying 100 water consumption episodes.
    The processing of the data being collected revealed that the actual accuracy was
    91% (i.e., 91 over 100 samples were classified correctly), after testing the model
    with user-generated water consumption profiles, using the proposed smart flow
    metering system. It is important to mention that the model could clearly recognise
    the undesirable WL profiles, achieving accuracy values reaching 100%. On the other
    hand, there were some incorrect predictions, where the neural model was classifying
    an actual WW scenario as NU or WL (with percentages 5.1% and 7.7%, respectively).
    In fewer cases, the model was classifying an NU as WW or WL (with percentages
    equal to 2.8%). These failures can be attributed to the fact that there was a
    small area where the borders of those categories were overlapped, thus confusing
    the neural network classifier. An additional 0.4 certainty threshold was programmed
    on the microcontroller for more reliable characterizations. This performance is
    close to the one expected according to the testing of the model. The overall performance
    is lower than the one achieved by other machine learning approaches [23] using
    more composite systems, but remains high and can be easily achieved by the proposed
    low-cost equipment. The accuracy can be further improved by using more extensive
    training and samples. Table 1. The confusion matrix corresponding to the trained
    neural network model, created by classifying 100 water consumption episodes, of
    specific (and known) type each. 4.2. Networking and Power Consumption Issues According
    to the specifications of the experimental system being presented, although 200
    consecutive samples had to be recorded before a classification decision to be
    make, this decision was taken locally, and thus only the (final) characterization
    message had to travel toward the gateway (and to the end user) instead of 200
    messages containing the corresponding analytical flow values. The packet payload
    information needed to travel from the peripheral sensor nodes toward the gateway
    node did not exceed 10 bytes in binary format, thus resulting in a bellow 50-byte
    description per episode in textual format, in the final log files on the Raspberry
    Pi Model 3 A+ unit of the gateway. The size requirements of the analytical data
    would be roughly 200 times higher. In addition to that, the cost for performing
    the classification at the central node was not necessary any more. Figure 7 provides
    indicative details of the water flow episode/event specific information as stored
    into the log files on the Raspberry Pi Model 3 A+ unit implementing the gateway
    node functionality. These files were directly available through the Apache web
    server and typically contained an arrival timestamp, node address, episode type
    (i.e., NU/WW/WL), flow value per each sample into a specific episode (in debug
    mode only), total water consumption per episode, as well as sensor battery voltage
    and RSSI indicator. Figure 7. Characteristic details of the water flow episode/event
    specific information as stored into the log files on the Raspberry Pi Model 3
    A+ unit implementing the gateway node. Some stability problems were experienced
    when using the highest baud rate (i.e., the 115,200 bps value) between the Raspberry
    Pi Pico and the LoRa32u4 module. For this reason the data rate was set to the
    “safe” 38,400 bps value. The techniques being followed for testing the effective
    communication range of the proposed system were utilizing the methods presented
    in [7,48]. The gateway node, apart from the water flow specific information, for
    each node, was collecting assistive data, such as sensor battery status and received
    signal strength indicator (RSSI). The latter information was collected for sensor
    nodes being at various distances from the gateway node, for both Wi-Fi and LoRa
    radio cases. The left part of Figure 8 depicts a LoRa radio transceiver during
    the in situ radio coverage experiments. According to results being gathered, by
    using ESP-01 Wi-Fi transceivers, the maximum range coverage was at about 100 m,
    while by using LoRa modules with custom wire antennas the communication distance
    was extended to 300 m in free space. By using standard but still cheap antennas,
    the LoRa link scenario was easily achieving communication coverage of above 1
    km. These results are justified by the fact that the receiver sensitivity limit
    for nodes equipped with Wi-Fi radios was around −90 dBm, while for the LoRa, the
    sensitivity being achieved was reaching the −130 dBm level. Figure 8. Experiments
    for testing the range coverage (left) and the energy consumption (right) of the
    prototype sensor nodes. In order to better capture and study the short-scale dynamics
    of the smart sensor modes, a measuring circuit was built, according to the directions
    provided in [49]. More specifically, an Arduino Uno board was utilized to calculate
    the voltage drops over a resistor of known value, connected in series with the
    load of interest (i.e., the smart water sensor node); the right part of Figure
    8 depicts the corresponding experimental setup. The actual measuring process was
    performed via a separate ADC module (namely an ADS1015 unit) capable of true differential
    measurements, of satisfactory resolution (i.e., of 12 bits) and of adjustable
    gain. The communication of this module with the hosting Arduino board was completed
    using an I2C interface. The presence of the Arduino Uno unit allowed for the additional
    processing of data and quick graphical inspection. Consequently, for the system
    under testing, amperage consumption traces could be easily captured, at a typical
    time resolution of 100 sps and at an approximate amperage resolution of 1 mA,
    via the Serial Monitor or the Serial Plotter component of the Arduino IDE environment.
    By using the specific measuring setup, several results were collected. The behavior
    of the sensor nodes was on the focus of this study, as, typically, the gateway
    node was considered of having fixed power supply and its consumption was around
    250 mA. More specifically, the consumption of a bare node, equipped only with
    a Raspberry Pi Pico unit was 27 mA, approximately, with the water flow metering
    unit to absorb 3–4 mA of this quantity. When activating the radio modules on the
    system and letting them transmit information, further data were collected. For
    debugging purposes, apart from the standard settings where only the water usage
    decision was reported, the analytical flow data could also be transmitted toward
    the gateway, limited only by the maximum data rate being supported by the selected
    radio modules. Referring to the Wi-Fi communication case, Figure 9 provides characteristic
    details of the short time dynamics of the scanning and connection establishment
    stages that were mandatory before the utilization of the radio modules. The inspection
    of the results revealed that the scanning process was extremely energy-consuming,
    reaching the level of 90 mA (in total) with additional and non-negligible sporadic
    spikes exceeding that level. The whole scanning process lasted for 2 to 3 s, and
    after that, the overall consumption was stabilized to the 40 mA level, with peaks
    of additional 50 mA corresponding to the water flow event reports toward the gateway.
    The high cost for the Wi-Fi initialization link (especially in optimized radio
    sleep/wakeup scenarios), along with its limited range coverage were favoring the
    assessment of other communication alternatives, such as LoRa. Figure 9. Short
    time dynamics of the mandatory scanning and connection establishment stages, following
    the activation of the Wi-Fi radio module that smart sensors were equipped with.
    Similarly, Figure 10 depicts characteristic short-time dynamics for the LoRa communication
    alternative. Namely, from the LoRa module activation (left) to the energy peaks
    reflecting the water usage notification packet transmission events (top right)
    and to the corresponding textual information content as intercepted by the gateway
    (bottom right). The LoRa32u4 LoRa board consumed 12–13 mA, approximately, at idling,
    with the radio enabled, while the transmission events at the standard radio parameter
    settings (i.e., having Coding Rate—CR set to 4/5, Bandwidth—BW to 128 kHz, Spreading
    Factor—SF set to 7) and with the transmit power at 15 dBm, resulted in spikes
    of 70 mA (at 3.3 V), having an approximate duration of 50 ms, thus requiring around
    12 mJ each. It must be noted that the whole process lacked the high connection
    establishment cost (in both time and energy) characterizing the Wi-Fi case. The
    tradeoff of LoRa was the far lower communication rate, which was not an issue
    for the specific application case that only a few bytes had to be transmitted
    per sensor unit, every 2 to 3 min, at the fastest utilization activity scenario.
    Figure 10. Characteristic short-time dynamics for the LoRa communication alternative:
    From the LoRa module activation (left) to the energy peaks reflecting the packet
    transmission events (top right) and to the corresponding textual information content
    as intercepted by the gateway (bottom right). According to the overall performance
    description presented herein, it can be inferred that typically, the benefits
    of the pilot implementation being discussed were maximized in application cases
    where many water consumption check points were needed, spread into an area of
    a few kilometres. 4.3. Node Cost Issues The total cost of each of the discussed
    nodes, after adding the 6€ for the Raspberry Pi Pico unit, the 15€ for the LoRa
    equipped module, the 8€ for the YF-S201 flow sensor, the 8€ for LiPo batteries
    and the 5€ needed for a good-quality plastic enclosure box, was around 42€. The
    utilization of a LoRa transceiver instead of a typical Wi-Fi radio saved energy
    and offered improved distance coverage. The decision of using the LoRa32u4 board
    added some extra cost (of about 5€, compared with a bare LoRa chip) but provided
    further GPIO pins and connectivity options, as well as fast programming and testing
    of the diverse communication and arithmetic processing variants, thus counterbalancing
    the almost 15 min of time required for the compilation of the code containing
    the trained neural network model destined for the Raspberry Pi Pico unit. The
    gateway node needed 30€ for a Raspberry Pi Model 3 A+, 15€ for the LoRa32u4 board,
    5€ for a plastic enclosure box, and 5€ for a power supply, resulting in cost below
    60€. 4.4. Further Discussion This work presented a pilot implementation targeted
    at intercepting water usage events and characterizing them properly, with the
    emphasis to be put on misuse cases, such as leakages or wastes. The rapid growth
    of electronics and of the pairing software allowed for very cost-effective but
    efficient solutions, with cutting-edge features. Indeed, the adoption of machine
    learning techniques at the edge points (i.e., where the water sensors are) was
    drastically reducing the amount of information that needed to travel from the
    peripheral nodes to the central node and the cloud. This fact resulted in reduced
    communication load and energy consumption, while it increased autonomy and privacy.
    The focus was put on the in situ processing and the pairing with simple, long-range
    and low-energy radios, e.g., the LoRa technology ones. The water usage episodes
    the experimental system was trained to intercept were of comparatively short duration,
    but the software and hardware methods being used, and the accuracy being achieved,
    make the proposed arrangements, only with minor configuration modifications, to
    be applicable for supporting a wide variety of water preservation/misuse detection
    scenarios. Apparently, several issues are still open, requiring more elaboration
    for the delivery of an out-of-the-box solution. The time interval between the
    fixed, in number (e.g., 200), consecutive flow data required for a characterization
    decision, was set to 1 s during the training. The same trained model, can still
    be valid considering intervals of much longer value (e.g., of 30 s instead of
    1 s), provided that the proper normalization in flow values will be made and that
    the activity will be classified in following the same pattern. Nevertheless, gathering
    richer data sets, reflecting further realistic use cases, can train the model
    more accurately, and is an apparent priority for wider applicability. This training
    can follow the same generic principles and methods described herein. The option
    of using a bare LoRa chip with the Raspberry Pi Pico unit is amongst the future
    priorities toward a more commercially-friendly version of the prototype presented
    herein. While the adoption of the LoRa protocol allows for better flexibility,
    the LoRaWAN solution is also feasible, either via implementing the necessary protocol
    stack, via software on the 32u4 LoRa board, or by utilizing native LoRaWAN chips.
    Furthermore, these processes can become more efficient by introducing a sleep/wakeup
    energy management schema which will allow the Raspberry Pi Pico to wake up (via
    interrupts) whenever water flow activity is intercepted by the flow sensor. The
    task of the efficient powering the system at the absence of permanent power supply
    nearby is also quite challenging. Indeed, more than one alternative can be adopted,
    from using solar panels or a tiny wind generator, to pairing the rotating blades
    of the flow sensor unit with a tiny electric generator [50]. Finally, as the adoption
    of a Raspberry Pi Model 3 A+ as a central/gateway node was providing an adequate
    but poor level of functionality, via elementary web and archiving or database
    services, linking with well-known and more user-friendly cloud services is also
    a case worth investigating in the future. 5. Conclusions In this paper, the synergy
    between several innovative and low-cost electronic components and software was
    exploited, in order to monitor and remotely report characteristic water consumption/misuse
    events. The whole approach introduces modern Edge AI techniques (i.e., combining
    IoT, ML and Edge Computing principles) that up until recently was not possible
    to be executed with traditional low-cost microcontrollers. The challenges for
    the delivery of a generally applicable and inexpensive alerting system for either
    urban or rural water resource usage were further highlighted. The system being
    presented can work in a decentralized manner as the amount of information that
    has to travel from the edges to the cloud is drastically reduced, or becomes practically
    unnecessary, thus resulting in energy requirement minimization and increased privacy.
    Only the final decision (water usage characterization) information has to be transmitted
    to the final user (e.g., the farmer), and the cloud is necessary only in case
    that the latter user is not nearby or asks for sophisticated information post
    processing. As for the future, more optimized variants of the proposed system
    will be assessed, in terms of hardware selection (e.g., of flow sensor units),
    neural network model accuracy, networking options and energy autonomy. Great companies,
    such as Arduino, Raspberry, ESP or Adafruit, during their noble competition, will
    continue to produce excellent parts with leveraged application support potential.
    Finally, an out-of-the box version of the functionality being presented, of commercial
    standards, exploiting additional well-known services, and thus exhibiting increased
    user-friendliness, will be a significant future priority. Author Contributions

    1. Introduction Agriculture, the primary source of the majority of the globe’s
    food, is one of civilisation’s most challenging issues. To match the growing population’s
    demand for food, advancements in agricultural production need to be sustainable;
    with increasing environmental variability due to climate change and the unsustainable
    dependency on agrochemicals, this is an increasingly difficult task. Technology
    advancement and increasing availability of low-cost sensors have led to a rise
    in the popularity of precision agriculture and smart farming to address the food
    production concerns [1]. Precision agriculture and innovative farming technologies
    enable farmers to be better informed and more adaptive in their response to changing
    weather conditions. Furthermore, the increased data help farmers to move away
    from traditional approaches of broadcasting agrochemicals towards target applications,
    which has both financial and environmental benefits. The latest technologies,
    including sensors, computing edge devices, monitoring devices, smart agricultural
    equipment, and cloud services, are essential for enabling smart agriculture [2],
    precision agriculture, and Agriculture 4.0/5.0 [3,4]. These technologies have
    enabled the rapid adoption of advanced techniques in agriculture, such as cloud–fog–edge
    computing [2], digital twin [5], the Internet of Things (IoT) [6], big data analytics
    [7], machine learning [8], augmented reality [9], and robotics [10]. By utilising
    these technologies, farmers can improve sustainability, enhance productivity,
    and optimise resource utilisation. As these technologies continue to develop and
    become more accessible, we can expect to see more significant advancements in
    smart agriculture in the future. Digital twin is an evolving technology that is
    gaining more attention in all domains. DT can be defined as a digital equivalent
    of a real-life object that mirrors its behaviour and states over its lifetime
    in a virtual space [11]. Although there are a number of studies available in other
    domains using the concept of a DT, it is still in the early stages in agriculture
    [5]. In recent years, agriculture has also received a lot of interest; development
    and implementation are still in progress as stakeholders and researchers work
    to find sustainable and efficient methods to produce food while also reducing
    the impact on the environment. Farming can be generally categorised into two types:
    Open Environment Agriculture (OEA) and Closed Environment Agriculture (CEA). The
    implementation of DT in CEA is relatively easier because of the controlled nature
    of environmental factors. However, implementing DT in OEA is challenging because
    it involves unpredictable natural weather conditions and various other external
    factors. While a significant amount of research focuses on CEA, with studies exploring
    its application in greenhouse [12], aquaponics [13], vertical farming [14], hydroponics
    [15], studies on OEA are comparatively fewer. DT in agriculture is an emerging
    topic that has the potential to bring about significant change. Since a few studies
    are available for OEA, it is clear that there is a need for customised DT frameworks
    specifically for OEA. This gap has motivated us to propose architecture and application
    scenarios for open-environment crop farming. The detailed related work on DT for
    agriculture is discussed in Section 3. This research introduces a novel architecture
    for a DT by integrating multi-agent systems and cloud–fog–edge computing. This
    is designed to rapidly provide necessary decision-making information to farmers
    for “what-ifs” scenarios. It also directs farmers in critical areas and offers
    a dynamic list of prioritised actions that adapt to evolving environmental conditions.
    Moreover, the proposed architecture has the capability to automate certain farm
    tasks based on farmer inputs. Therefore, it enhances overall farm productivity
    and effectively manages various tasks. Additionally, the paper explores a few
    detailed use cases, demonstrating the practical application of DT technology through
    integrated architecture in agricultural environments. The remainder of this work
    is structured as follows: In Section 2 we describe smart crop farming (Section
    2.1), digital twin technology (Section 2.2), and cloud–fog–edge computing (Section
    2.3) as the background of this work. Section 3 discusses related works on Digital
    Twins in the agricultural domain. A high-level architecture for the proposed DT
    agricultural use cases is presented in Section 4. Section 5 explores possible
    application scenarios with digital twins, consisting of the overall scenario for
    agriculture (Section 5.1) and then describing specific scenarios, such as irrigation
    systems in Section 5.2 early alerts on fields in Section 5.3, nutrient management
    recommendations in Section 5.4, and nutrient deficiency risk identification in
    Section 5.5. Finally, Section 6 concludes the discussion and discusses future
    work. 2. Background 2.1. Smart Crop Farming Agriculture plays a crucial role in
    today’s world, as it is essential for feeding the global population. With a growing
    global population and limited resources [16], it is crucial to find innovative
    solutions to maximise crop yield and ensure food security. One such solution is
    the application of smart agriculture techniques, which utilise advanced technologies
    such as satellite imaging and remote sensing, drones and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
    (UAVs), artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things (IoT), and robotics. Smart
    agriculture, often referred to as precision farming, digital farming, or agriculture
    5.0 [4], aims to optimise agricultural practices by utilising the power of data
    and technology. Smart agriculture, also known as precision farming or digital
    farming [17] or agriculture 5.0 [4], aims to optimise the farming process by increasing
    accuracy and customisation for specific fields or crops. Using these technologies,
    farmers can collect real-time data on soil moisture, temperature, nutrient levels,
    and pest infestations. These data can then be analysed and used to make data-driven
    decisions about irrigation, fertiliser application, pest control, and crop management.
    By integrating smart technologies into agriculture, farmers can not only increase
    crop yields but also reduce resource wastage. Crop farming is generally complex
    and relies heavily on various factors such as weather conditions, soil quality,
    irrigation management, fertiliser and nutrient availability, and pest control.
    In the past, farmers had to rely on traditional methods and intuition to make
    informed decisions [18]. However, with the introduction of smart agriculture or
    smart farming, farmers now have access to real-time data and accurate weather
    forecasts compared to the past. This helps them make timely decisions regarding
    when to plant, irrigate, or harvest their crops to optimise yield. To address
    this challenge, farming now demands a decision support system and monitoring system
    [19]. This is where the IoT plays a crucial role. The IoT refers to the connection
    of physical objects, devices, and sensors through the internet to gather data
    for decision-making [20]. By implementing IoT technology in agriculture, farmers
    can collect data from various sensors and devices placed throughout their fields.
    This data can then be analysed using artificial intelligence algorithms to provide
    insights and recommendations for improving crop production. Other technologies,
    such as machine learning, blockchain, and robotics, can also be integrated into
    smart agriculture systems to automate tasks, reduce labour costs, and improve
    efficiency. Digital twin technology in agriculture is another emerging concept
    that holds great potential in smart agriculture. Overall, smart crop farming is
    transforming traditional methods of farming, bringing about a new era of efficiency
    and productivity in the agricultural sector. 2.2. Digital Twin In recent years,
    the DT concept has garnered global attention. It involves creating a virtual or
    digital replica of a physical object, such as machinery, buildings, farms, fields,
    plants or even human beings, using real-time data from these physical entities.
    This approach allows for comprehensive analysis, simulation, and optimisation.
    The term digital twin, introduced by Grieves in a 2003 presentation and later
    elaborated in a white paper [21], has provided the foundation for its development
    across various domains. Digital models are created by collecting real-time data
    from IoT solutions, such as sensors and other sources. DT systems are different
    from other systems as they not only simulate predicted futures but also provide
    real-time insights. Unlike simulations [22], DTs use real-time data and can provide
    quick and valuable information by incorporating the latest available data. Although
    DT technology originated in manufacturing [23], its application has broadened
    to sectors such as healthcare [24], energy [25], urban planning [26], and recently
    in agriculture [27]. In agriculture, digital twins have revolutionised practices
    by simulating farming cycles such as soil conditions, weather patterns, crop growth,
    and pest infestations and utilising real-time data for decision-making. This approach
    allows for customised recommendations, optimising crop yields, efficient resource
    use, and minimising environmental impacts. Digital twins improve precision farming
    by creating accurate digital replicas of farms, enabling remote monitoring and
    management. Farmers can customise irrigation and fertilisation plans and accurately
    predict harvesting times. As advanced predictive tools, these models help manage
    risks like crop diseases and pest infestations effectively. Integrating artificial
    intelligence and machine learning [28] further provides advanced analytics and
    predictive insights essential for sustainable food production and climate change
    adaptation. Even though introducing DTs in agriculture offers many benefits, adopting
    this technology faces challenges [29], including the need for significant initial
    investment, a robust technological infrastructure, and concerns regarding data
    privacy. Despite these limitations, the future of DTs in agriculture and beyond
    looks promising, with potential advancements such as enhanced integration with
    advanced technologies. 2.3. Cloud–Fog–Edge Computing Cloud–fog–edge computing
    is a paradigm that combines the power of cloud computing, fog computing, and edge
    computing to create a distributed and collaborative computing platform. At its
    core, cloud–fog–edge aims to optimise the processing and storage of data by leveraging
    the strengths of each computing model. Utilising cloud computing, this architecture
    can benefit from its vast resources and scalability for handling large-scale data
    processing and storage [30]. Fog computing, on the other hand, brings the computational
    power closer to the data source, reducing latency and improving real-time processing
    capabilities [31]. Edge computing enables processing and storage to be performed
    at or near the edge devices themselves, reducing the need for data transmission
    and thus improving efficiency. This combination of cloud, fog, and edge computing
    addresses the limitations and challenges of traditional centralised computing
    models. As the agriculture domain evolves with the integration of cloud, fog,
    and edge computing, a powerful architecture emerges that significantly impacts
    farming practices. Edge computing, situated closer to on-field devices, ensures
    fast data processing and minimal latency, which is essential for real-time decision-making
    [32]. However, fog computing plays a pivotal role in this integration, not only
    seamlessly connecting with edge devices but also conducting intelligent analysis
    [33,34]. The unique capability of fog computing to extend its reach to both the
    edge and the cloud makes it an indispensable component of agricultural systems.
    The introduction of mobile fog zones, actively gathering data from the fields,
    and static fog zones, providing localised storage and computing capabilities for
    immediate data analysis, marks a crucial transformation [35]. This cloud–fog–edge
    combination architecture not only optimises data processing and decision support
    at the field level but also leverages cloud resources for comprehensive analysis.
    The importance of fog computing in agriculture is underscored by its role in bridging
    the gap between on-field operations and broader cloud-based insights, thereby
    enhancing the efficiency, scalability, and adaptability of agricultural practices.
    3. Related Work Recent reviews show that interest in DTs in agriculture has notably
    increased in the last few years. For instance, the authors of [27] presented an
    extensive literature survey on DTs in agriculture, establishing a foundational
    understanding of the topic. The authors of [36] examined the application of the
    DT paradigm in assessing soil quality, highlighting the technology’s potential
    to revolutionise traditional practices. Further, Ref. [13] introduced a pioneering
    case study on urban farming technology. This study explored how a cyber-physical
    aquaponics system, augmented with a DT and machine learning, could gain adaptive
    capabilities, showcasing the practical implementation and benefits of DTs in enhancing
    agricultural systems. Verdouw et al. [11] analysed how DTs could advance smart
    farming. The authors defined the concept of a DT, developed a typology of different
    types of DTs, and proposed a conceptual framework for their design and implementation.
    The authors mentioned that DTs in agriculture include six distinct types: imaginary,
    monitoring, predictive, autonomous, and recollection DTs, each serving different
    control purposes. The authors also proposed a framework and applied and validated
    it in five smart farming use cases in the European IoF2020 project, covering arable
    farming, dairy farming, greenhouse horticulture, organic vegetable farming, and
    livestock farming. The case studies have offered valuable insights into how DTs
    can improve and optimise smart farming systems. In 2021, Pylianidis et al. [27]
    published a literature review on digital twins in agriculture from 2017 to 2020.
    The authors identified 28 use cases and compared them with other domains’ use
    cases. The authors compared reported benefits, service categories, and technology
    readiness levels to assess the level of digital twin adoption in agriculture.
    The authors also proposed a roadmap inspired by other domains of DT applications.
    This paper concluded by identifying distinctive characteristics of agricultural
    DTs. However, this paper did not provide specific examples of implemented DT applications
    in agriculture or the latest advancements in this field. It also did not cover
    potential benefits in detail or the latest advancements in DT applications in
    agriculture. Nasirahmadi et al. [5] presented a general framework of DTs in soil
    irrigation, robotics, farm machinery, and food post-harvest processing in the
    agricultural field. The authors emphasised the need to develop DT systems further
    in the agricultural context. These systems should be able to monitor, record,
    and analyse data to predict and prescribe the best decision for digital farming
    management. Also, the authors identified the need for further research and development
    in applying DT concepts in agriculture, particularly in addressing practical challenges,
    integrating advanced technologies, and developing robust DT models for different
    aspects of agricultural operations. Few other studies are available that apply
    the concepts of DTs to smart agriculture. For example, Ref. [37] proposed a DTs-based
    smart agriculture framework utilising LoRaWAN for sensor networks in farm fields
    and the intelligent processing of aerial imagery to detect plant diseases and
    nutrient deficiencies. The authors of [13] have proposed a framework for a decision
    support system to coordinate decentralised urban agricultural production units.
    The authors of [38] discussed the principles of developing a multi-agent DT of
    plants using broccoli as an example. The results of the reviews clearly show that
    the concept of DTs in agriculture is still in its early stages and has not been
    fully explored in research. Although the agricultural sector presents numerous
    opportunities for the application of DT technology, its development and implementation
    are still in progress. Therefore, this paper proposes a set of DT use cases designed
    for the agricultural domain. The aim is to bridge the current research gap and
    contribute to sustainable agriculture and enhanced production goals. This paper
    focuses on applying the innovative DT concept to real-world scenarios in smart
    agriculture. Our goal is to tackle key challenges in this field, with the promise
    of revolutionising efficiency and yield through this approach. 4. High Level Architecture
    for Proposed Digital Twin Use Cases in Agriculture Figure 1 illustrates the proposed
    architecture of a DT system for smart agriculture that integrates cloud, fog,
    and edge computing layers and multi-agent systems. Farmers or users can access
    a DT system through a farm management GUI (Graphical User Interface). The overall
    architecture consists of three layers: Cloud, Fog, and Edge. Figure 1. Proposed
    Architecture for Digital Twins in Smart Agriculture. The Cloud layer plays multiple
    roles, including accessing external services like growth stage estimators, weather
    services, routing services, and disease identification tools. It also offers data
    storage and anonymisation services for farm data and supports machine learning
    and data analysis. Additionally, data collected from satellites that help with
    growth stage estimation, weather prediction, and disease identification are stored
    in this layer. This layer is also responsible for handling complex processing
    tasks that are not time-sensitive and can utilise the vast resources of cloud
    computing. The Fog layer consists of two sub-zones: the Static Fog Zone and the
    Mobile Fog Zone. In a smart or precision farming setup, an array of sensors and
    actuators are employed, along with machinery like harvesters, tractors, and innovative
    devices such as drones and agricultural robots. These devices function as mobile
    fog nodes, gathering data directly from the fields. Located at the field level,
    the Static Fog Zone hosts agents, microservices, and digital twins, providing
    localised data storage and computing capabilities for immediate analysis of farm
    data. The mobile fog nodes serve to extend the reach of the Fog network, ensuring
    data collection and processing capabilities in parts of the farm that may have
    intermittent or no internet access. Furthermore, the Fog layer incorporates a
    collection of microservices, which facilitate access to both internal APIs for
    farm data retrieval and third-party APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)
    for extended functionality. It also houses various agents, such as the Farm Manager
    and Field Agents, who are tasked with resource scheduling, task management, and
    the execution of field plans. These components function seamlessly within both
    the static and mobile zones of the Fog layer. The Edge layer comprises various
    devices with embedded sensors and actuators utilised in agricultural environments.
    These devices can include soil moisture sensors located directly in the field
    or NDVI sensors mounted on farm machinery such as tractors. These Edge devices
    connect to the static Fog layer to transmit data when internet connectivity is
    present. In the absence of connectivity, mobile Fog nodes provide data collection
    services, gathering information from the Edge devices either opportunistically
    or upon request. This allows for continuous data acquisition and integration into
    the farm’s DT system, ensuring that the farm management has access to the most
    updated information for decision-making. Additionally, the overall architecture
    incorporates MAMS (Multi-agent Micro-services) [39] as illustrated in Figure 2.
    In this setup, microservices are tasked with ongoing activities like weather monitoring
    and are engaged in the continuous processing of data. The system’s flexibility
    allows seamless transitions between different data sources, like switching from
    one weather station to another, by simply re-configuring the appropriate microservice.
    This adaptability level is a fundamental feature of DT technology and is further
    enhanced by the integrated multi-agent system. In this interconnected environment,
    actions in one field can influence outcomes in another. The DT plays a crucial
    role in fine-tuning these decisions, utilising data-centric simulations. At the
    core of this architecture is the utilisation of established agricultural guidelines,
    such as the RB209 recommendations, providing a solid foundation. These guidelines
    are not just followed; they are dynamically adapted to suit the real-time conditions
    of the farm, ensuring the advice provided is both reliable and contextually relevant.
    Figure 2. Cloud–Fog–Edge and MAMS Overview. On the other hand, agents play a crucial
    role in the DT framework, particularly in decision-making, task allocation, and
    resource management. These intelligent agents utilise the data gathered by microservices
    to make not only decisions but also recommendations. A comprehensive knowledge
    graph is built by a variety of microservices, such as those collecting weather
    data, nutrient recommendations, and decision-making services. This interconnected
    data representation enables agents to coordinate system activities effectively.
    This ensures the maintenance of the most accurate model of the field’s state.
    The agents are focused on developing an efficient plan for the field. Although
    this plan is not a built-in feature of the DT, it is significantly influenced
    by the data collected and analysis from the DT. This field plan directly impacts
    nutrient levels, which in turn affects the growth stages of the crops. Efficient
    management of the DT, coupled with the use of intelligent agents for decision
    support, enables us to recommend strategies that maintain optimal field conditions,
    enhancing both the productivity and efficiency of agricultural practices. The
    agents can also analyse patterns, predict outcomes, and allocate tasks efficiently
    across the farming operation. Their capabilities include assessing the best planting
    strategies, optimising irrigation schedules, and managing resource allocation
    to maximise yield and efficiency. Overall, the proposed architecture depicted
    in Figure 2 enables farmers to utilise a DT that integrates cloud computing, fog
    computing, and edge computing, thereby simplifying and improving farm management.
    This approach significantly enhances farm management and decision-making through
    a comprehensive, multi-layered computational framework. The incorporation of agents
    in this architecture allows for autonomous data collection and processing, ensuring
    timely and accurate information. Microservices, meanwhile, offer modular and scalable
    solutions, facilitating the flexible integration of various farm data sources
    and services. The combined use of cloud, fog, and edge computing layers ensures
    efficient data processing: cloud computing handles complex, non-time-sensitive
    tasks; fog computing provides localised data analysis; and edge computing enables
    real-time data capture directly from farm devices. Collectively, these technologies
    form a digital replica of the farm that includes all important factors, thereby
    streamlining decision-making. In this way, the proposed architecture offers numerous
    advantages in overall farming processes compared to the existing agricultural
    systems. 5. Possible Application Scenarios with Digital Twin In the labour-intensive
    field of agriculture, many interrelated and variable factors play a role in daily
    farming decisions. Despite being well-planned with expertise, unforeseen circumstances
    often cause plans to be changed or abandoned in cases such as unexpected rainfalls
    or the emergence of crop diseases. In these circumstances, an adaptive approach,
    a fast decision, and good organisation are essential to maintain efficiency and
    prevent yield losses (subsequently financial losses) and environmental damage.
    This section discusses example use cases using DTs. 5.1. Overall Scenario of Digital
    Twin in Agriculture The proposed DT model of agriculture includes a digital representation
    of farms, fields and other related factors. This complex model dynamically integrates
    various data sources to replicate the current state of the farm. This model is
    also continuously updated with real-time data, allowing it to reflect current
    conditions and predict future states accurately. For instance, if we consider
    a farm with n fields, the DT model would have the exact representation with details
    such as: Farm: Farm ID, Farm Name, Number of Fields, Field IDs. Field: Field ID,
    Farm ID, Field Name, Crop Info, Soil Info, Historical Information such as Last
    Cropping Date. Zone: Zone ID, Zone Name, Field ID, Farm ID, Weather Data. As illustrated
    in Figure 3, digital twins assist in decision-making and predictions based on
    historical and real-time data analysis and provide recommendations and suggestions
    to farmers and other stakeholders. Figure 3. Digital Twin for Agriculture. Digital
    twins can be applied to various aspects of agriculture in order to help farmers,
    including: Real-time Monitoring and Prediction [5]: DTs can monitor crop health
    and growth in real-time and predict future outcomes based on data such as weather
    patterns, soil moisture, and nutrient levels. This information can help farmers
    make informed decisions about irrigation, fertilisation, and other factors that
    impact crop growth. Enhanced Productivity and Efficiency: By simulating various
    scenarios, farmers can identify the most efficient use of resources, such as water
    and fertilisers, and optimise crop yields [5,12]. As new data are collected and
    analysed continuously, farmers can continuously refine their practices, adapting
    to changing conditions and incorporating the latest insights for ongoing improvements
    in productivity and efficiency. Resource optimisation and management: DTs can
    optimise farmers’ use of resources like water, fertilisers, and pesticides by
    providing real-time data on their application and effectiveness. It also helps
    in task scheduling and management of farm equipment, including tractors, harvesters,
    and other agricultural machinery. This can help farmers reduce waste and improve
    efficiency. Quality control: It can monitor crop quality and identify potential
    issues, such as pests or diseases, before they become significant problems. This
    can help farmers take proactive measures to protect their crops and maintain high-quality
    yields. Collaboration: DTs can facilitate collaboration among farmers, researchers,
    agronomists, and other stakeholders, allowing them to share real-time data and
    insights. This can accelerate the development of new techniques and technologies
    in smart crop farming. Data-Driven Decision-Making: DTs offer farmers a comprehensive
    perspective of their agricultural operations. This enables data-driven decision-making,
    as farmers can analyse soil conditions, weather patterns, and crop health data
    to make informed choices toward improving yields. Continuous data collection and
    analysis enable better management of agricultural processes, leading to more informed
    decisions [5]. The implementation of a DT in agriculture is a powerful step towards
    more efficient and sustainable practices. This approach offers a holistic overview
    of the farm, enabling farmers to optimise processes throughout the entire agricultural
    cycle, from planting to harvesting. The DT also has features for predicting the
    future and a comprehensive understanding of farm processes. Farmers can more efficiently
    use resources like water, fertilisers, and pesticides. As a result, this reduces
    waste and operational costs and addresses the specific needs of crops at different
    growth stage levels at the right time. These all help in maximise yields. Integrating
    data from diverse sources and analysing them are significant features of DT. This
    integration includes real-time data from IoT devices distributed across the farm,
    which monitor key factors such as soil moisture and nutrient levels. Weather patterns
    are important in making decisions about farming activities. The data coming from
    local weather stations can offer valuable insights in terms of how the weather
    patterns could change. Additionally, the DT utilises high-resolution satellite
    imagery to monitor larger-scale changes in crop health and environmental conditions.
    The DT improves its predictive accuracy by accessing agricultural databases to
    collect data on crop varieties, pest/disease patterns, and historical data. This
    can result in guiding farmers towards more informed decision-making in modern
    agriculture. The DT not only simulates and predicts the outcomes of different
    farming strategies under varying environmental conditions but also continuously
    updates its model to reflect real-time changes on the farm. This dynamic model
    ensures that the virtual farm environment is always in sync with the actual farm,
    allowing farmers to visualise the consequences of their actions before implementing
    them. By acting as a decision-support tool, the DT enables farmers to efficiently
    manage risks, such as pest infestations or disease outbreaks, and test different
    scenarios, including best and worst-case situations. Ultimately, this approach
    supports sustainable and environmentally friendly farming practices, empowering
    farmers with the tools needed for success in the ever-evolving world of agriculture.
    In the following section, we will explore a few use cases that demonstrate the
    potential of DTs in agriculture: irrigation systems and early disease detection.
    Specifically, we will compare the processes for these use cases with and without
    DT technology. Figure 4 and Figure 5 illustrate these processes and highlight
    the benefits of using a DT. Figure 4. Irrigation Systems. Figure 5. Early Alters
    on Fields. It is worth noting that with DTs, it is necessary to consider all related
    factors before making a decision instead of only considering a single factor.
    This feature enables farmers to make more accurate decisions that consider the
    potential future effects of the decision rather than simply deciding whether to
    irrigate or manually identify diseases. This is one of the key advantages of DTs
    compared to other modern digital systems. 5.2. Scenario 1: Irrigation Systems
    Agricultural irrigation systems are frequently closed systems, which require the
    farmer to turn the irrigation system on or off. More advanced systems are available
    on the market, which utilise either soil moisture sensors [40] or rainfall sensors
    [41] to automate irrigation and reduce water usage. The sensors for automated
    irrigation systems are typically expensive. As technology advances, progressively
    more straightforward, low-cost sensors capable of sensing soil moisture and rainfall
    are entering the market. Connecting these simple sensors to nodes would create
    an affordable irrigation management system. This would lower the cost barrier
    and allow greater access to precision technologies, particularly for smaller farms
    [40]. A DT for an irrigation system in agriculture is a digital replica of the
    physical irrigation system used in the field. It is created by collecting data
    from sensors and other sources such as weather forecasts, soil moisture sensors,
    and crop growth models. Using this data, the DT replicates the functioning of
    the irrigation setup and the behaviour of the crops under irrigation. This enables
    farmers and other stakeholders to monitor system performance, optimise irrigation
    schedules, and make better decisions to maximise crop yield while minimising water
    usage. For example, the DT can help farmers decide when and how much water to
    apply to their crops based on weather conditions, soil moisture levels, and other
    factors (harvest date, fertiliser plans). It can also help farmers identify potential
    issues with the irrigation system, such as leaks or malfunctions, and take required
    action before they impact crop yield. Farmers who do not have access to DT technology
    must rely on traditional methods such as visual inspection and manual measurement
    to make irrigation decisions. These methods are often based on intuition and experience
    rather than hard data, which could lead to inefficient and suboptimal irrigation
    practices. While there are modern irrigation systems that use technologies such
    as soil moisture sensors and temperature gauges to inform decision-making [42],
    these systems may not take into account other important factors such as crop growth
    stage, nutrient levels, and fertiliser use. Digital twin technology, on the other
    hand, can integrate and analyse a wide range of data points, making it a more
    advanced tool for decision-making in agriculture. A DT for an irrigation system
    of crop fields can provide farmers with a valuable tool to improve their irrigation
    practices and ultimately achieve more sustainable and efficient crop production.
    Additionally, the fog processing feature outlined in this paper’s architecture,
    as illustrated in Figure 1, allows for the utilisation of weather forecasts in
    conjunction with simple sensor data. This integration helps to reduce water usage
    further. Reducing water consumption is crucial for countries experiencing water
    scarcity. Due to climate change-induced water shortages, agricultural security
    concerns are increasing [43]. Therefore, utilising DT in irrigation systems presents
    an effective solution for this issue. 5.3. Scenario 2: Early Alerts on Fields
    Vegetation indexes used in earth observations are related to crop stress, such
    as drought or disease [44,45]. The field management system in the outlined architecture
    would prioritise an inspection made in a specific area in response to earth observations
    processed through the cloud. This guidance-based approach would rapidly reduce
    the time spent inspecting the field for stress symptoms, increasing efficiency
    and helping maintain crop health. This is illustrated in Figure 6, where the traditional
    approach of crop inspection requires walking through each field as highlighted
    on the left image with red lines; the guidance-based system reduces this need
    and can direct a farmer straight to the areas of risk. Whilst in the field, any
    map-based information could be updated through the static fog, and the farmer
    could record a diagnostic for the stress (e.g., the presence of a disease). In
    addition, whilst in areas of poor connectivity, sensors would benefit from the
    presence of a passing smartphone to create an ad-hoc connection to upload data.
    At the point of updating the system to diagnose a crop disease, the architecture
    will be able to respond to this new information, check the weather forecast, and,
    if weather conditions are favourable could prioritise new actions of fungicide
    applications (part of the recommendation system of the architecture). Figure 6.
    Crop Inspection Traditional Approach (left) vs. Modern Approach (right). Additionally,
    the system could automate the shutoff of irrigation of the field/neighbouring
    fields of the same crop. This automation will (1) help reduce the spread of disease
    from water droplets and (2) provide the most time for the area to dry, which is
    necessary for fungicide applications. The dynamic nature of the architecture will
    provide the best outcome for a rapid response. In this scenario, the system minimises
    the time spent by the farmer inspecting fields, collecting relevant information
    (i.e., weather forecast), deciding on the best course of action and allowing more
    time for the farmer to respond to the crop disease threat, preventing potential
    yield reduction from crop disease spread. Without the system, most of the day
    could have been spent inspecting each field for symptoms of stress. When there
    is a deviation from the farm management plan, the DT field feature will be able
    to simulate the impacts of the change and provide advice on future management
    decisions. If an event occurs in a field or management deviates from the management
    plan, the digital twin field will be able to simulate the impacts of the changes
    and advise alternative management decisions. For example, if the drilling of a
    field is delayed due to adverse weather events, the DT will recommend increasing
    the seed rate, helping to negate any reduced tillering. Furthermore, the DT model
    will be able to apply these variations, along with growth modelling and external
    data such as weather forecasting, to adapt the expected timing of future management
    actions, e.g., nitrogen applications. The DT will be able to suggest amendments
    to agrochemical applications in response to events occurring in the field/farm
    while also helping to automate certain processes. In addition to this, if yield
    reduction is predicted for a field in the DT, the system may suggest reducing
    future nitrogen applications in that field, which will help improve nitrogen use
    efficiency, reduce environmental damage, and maximise profits. 5.4. Scenario 3:
    Nutrient Management Recommendations Nutrient management is crucial in crop farming
    for several reasons. It ensures the optimal growth of crops by providing them
    with the right balance of nutrients [46]. Effective nutrient management not only
    boosts crop yield [47] and quality but also minimises the environmental impact
    by reducing fertiliser overuse and runoff, which can lead to soil degradation
    and water pollution [46]. Various factors are considered in nutrient management
    for crops, including soil conditions, crop nutrient requirements, deficiency symptoms,
    previous crop information, and environmental conditions [48]. Conventional smart
    agriculture [49] employs technologies such as IoT sensors, drones, and satellite
    imagery to gather data for informed fertiliser application, improving crop growth,
    and minimising waste. However, these systems face challenges in terms of connectivity
    and internet access in remote agricultural areas, impacting the real-time monitoring
    capabilities of these technologies. Another problem is scalability when new services
    need to be introduced to the systems. Generally, the conventional smart agriculture
    method of nutrient application involves uniform practices across fields. In contrast,
    the proposed architecture customises nutrient guidance based on the unique needs
    of each field or zone level, as identified through real-time data processing.
    This is because the DT supports farm level, field level, and zone level granularity.
    The adaptability of the DT is evident in its responsiveness to dynamic environmental
    factors. In instances of adverse weather conditions or changes in soil composition,
    the system can promptly adjust nutrient recommendations to accommodate the evolving
    needs of the crops. This agility ensures that nutrient applications are modified
    with the current state of the field, maximising the effectiveness of the entire
    nutrient management process. Additionally, the system facilitates seamless communication
    between various stakeholders involved in nutrient management. Farmers receive
    clear and actionable recommendations through user-friendly interfaces, improving
    their ability to implement precise nutrient applications. The recommendation system
    also integrates with other components of the agricultural architecture, such as
    weather forecasting, to provide comprehensive insights for decision-making. Another
    key feature of the nutrient management recommendation system using DT architecture
    is its continuous learning capability. Over time, the system refines its recommendations
    based on historical data, crop responses, and evolving soil conditions. This iterative
    process ensures that nutrient management strategies are continually optimised,
    leading to improved crop health and overall agricultural productivity. Furthermore,
    integrating cloud, fog, edge computing, agents, and microservices transforms nutrient
    management to the next level. The fog layer instantly analyses real-time data
    collected by edge devices, overcoming connectivity limitations. Microservices
    provide flexible and scalable solutions, while the cloud layer enhances computational
    capabilities with machine learning. Autonomous agents streamline decision-making,
    making nutrient management more efficient and reducing the need for continuous
    human intervention. The whole approach of the DT architecture ensures a seamless
    and optimised nutrient management process in agriculture. 5.5. Scenario 4: Nutrient
    Deficiency Risk Identification Nutrient deficiency risk identification is a traditionally
    onerous task in which farmers may heavily rely on experience and generational
    knowledge [4]. Identifying a nutrient deficiency is often done through visual
    inspection of crops, as nutrient deficiencies result in symptoms appearing on
    the plant [4]. If visual symptoms are missed, a farmer may only realise the potential
    for nutrient deficiencies when observing a reduced yield and/or poor plant quality.
    Problematic crops may prompt a soil test, which serves as the most accurate representation
    of soil pH and key nutrient levels. However, when a deficiency has manifested,
    it is often too late to treat it effectively. Therefore, due to the variable nutrient
    requirements of different crops, farmers often utilise strategies such as crop
    rotation and intercropping to maintain a balanced soil nutrient profile. Conventional
    smart agriculture techniques have been developed to identify nutrient deficiencies
    in soils and crops. This is primarily achieved through satellite imagery [50],
    machine learning [51], and IoT sensors [52]. Some techniques relying on imagery
    may prove insufficient in some scenarios, as treating nutrient deficiencies can
    be ineffective by the time it is visually present. IoT sensor solutions facilitate
    rapid data collection, thereby enhancing decision-making efficiency [52]. The
    adoption of IoT sensors has proven to improve the quantity and quality of yield
    [52]. An implemented DT architecture offers a basis to integrate heterogeneous,
    dynamic, and disparate data sources into a homogenous system. This uniform system
    can underpin mechanisms that proactively monitor for coinciding and compounding
    risk factors for key nutrients, such as a field of a particular soil being waterlogged
    during the winter months. The result of this could be a notification to a farmer
    that a field is exposed to a greater risk of certain nutrient deficiencies. The
    use of edge services, as in the proposed DT, ensures the integration of real-time
    data into risk identification processes. The DT transforms the approach to nutrient
    deficiency, as the seamless integration of interoperable data enables holistic
    techniques for risk identification in real-time. Furthermore, this strategy is
    enhanced by being employed by a multi-agent system. The distributed nature of
    agents allows for simultaneous monitoring of multiple fields in parallel. The
    autonomous aspect of agents ensures a proactive risk identification process. This
    transitions a farm’s nutrient deficiency management strategy from being reactive
    to preventative, as actions can be taken to mitigate risk as the dynamic data
    is updated in the DT. 6. Discussion and Future Work In conclusion, the DT concept
    is a powerful innovation with promising applications in agriculture, particularly
    when integrated with other cutting-edge technologies such as multi-agent systems
    (MAS), cloud–fog–edge computing, and microservices. The rapid advancement in sensing,
    communication, and computing technologies has sped up the development of DT models.
    These models replicate real-world conditions with real-time data, improving farm
    operations and allowing for better planning by offering suggestions for different
    ’what-if’ scenarios. This paper introduces a DT architecture and explains its
    components. While this architecture holds potential for numerous applications
    in agriculture, our current focus is on practical implementations, such as developing
    irrigation systems for crops, early disease detection, nutrient management recommendations,
    and identifying nutrient deficiency risks. The proposed structure uses agents
    and microservices to create and develop a cloud–fog–edge infrastructure, establishing
    the foundation for promising research in sustainable smart crop farming. The possible
    expected challenge would be accessing all the required data in the field. This
    data can be collected from sensors and third-party APIs for weather and other
    data. Implementing DT in agriculture demands solid technological infrastructure,
    including sensors, IoT devices, and cloud–fog–edge infrastructure. In addition,
    to apply this in the real world, the initial cost to install the required devices
    and technologies must be higher if it is not a smart farm. However, the proposed
    architecture is most suitable for smart agriculture. Thus, most smart farms already
    use smart agricultural devices such as drones, sprayers, sensors, etc. Regarding
    this architecture, cloud hosting and accessing accurate data from third-party
    APIs such as satellite data may also be expensive. Agriculture is generally a
    highly complex domain influenced by various unpredictable variables such as weather
    conditions and patterns, soil conditions, and other environmental factors. Although
    we get these predicted data from sensors and weather stations, it might still
    be unreliable. Nowadays, most farms are already using some level of technology
    and devices. Therefore, integrating with the existing systems in DT may be challenging.
    Implementing DTs involves collecting and analysing vast amounts of data, raising
    concerns about data privacy, ownership, and security. In addition to this, well-written
    documents and manuals should be prepared for use by agricultural stakeholders.
    From our perspective, the proposed architecture can be validated in several ways.
    For instance, it can be simulated with historical data, applied to a small-scale
    farm, and seen in the field without applying a digital twin. Additionally, it
    is possible to do qualitative testing based on farmers’ feedback based on the
    user experience. Another possible way would be to check how the DT reacts to the
    real-time data. However, further research is needed to analyse the real challenges
    and benefits of the proposed architecture. We are in the process of implementing
    the proposed use cases. For our future work, we plan to concentrate on several
    areas, investigating the design constraints involved in implementing DTs with
    cloud–fog–edge computing and identifying the challenges and potential solutions
    in the domain of agricultural DTs. In addition to this, we are also planning to
    propose a framework to implement a DT for agriculture domain. The future work
    will be also focusing on how these DT can be evaluated in the real world. Author

  description: 'Precision Agriculture (PA) promises to meet the future demands for
    food, feed, fiber, and fuel while keeping their production sustainable and environmentally
    friendly. PA relies heavily on sensing technologies to inform site-specific decision
    supports for planting, irrigation, fertilization, spraying, and harvesting. Traditional
    point-based sensors enjoy small data sizes but are limited in their capacity to
    measure plant and canopy parameters. On the other hand, imaging sensors can be
    powerful in measuring a wide range of these parameters, especially when coupled
    with Artificial Intelligence. The challenge, however, is the lack of computing,
    electric power, and connectivity infrastructure in agricultural fields, preventing
    the full utilization of imaging sensors. This paper reported AICropCAM, a field-deployable
    imaging framework that integrated edge image processing, Internet of Things (IoT),
    and LoRaWAN for low-power, long-range communication. The core component of AICropCAM
    is a stack of four Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) models running sequentially:
    CropClassiNet for crop type classification, CanopySegNet for canopy cover quantification,
    PlantCountNet for plant and weed counting, and InsectNet for insect identification.
    These DCNN models were trained and tested with >43,000 field crop images collected
    offline. AICropCAM was embodied on a distributed wireless sensor network with
    its sensor node consisting of an RGB camera for image acquisition, a Raspberry
    Pi 4B single-board computer for edge image processing, and an Arduino MKR1310
    for LoRa communication and power management. Our testing showed that the time
    to run the DCNN models ranged from 0.20 s for InsectNet to 20.20 s for CanopySegNet,
    and power consumption ranged from 3.68 W for InsectNet to 5.83 W for CanopySegNet.
    The classification model CropClassiNet reported 94.5 % accuracy, and the segmentation
    model CanopySegNet reported 92.83 % accuracy. The two object detection models
    PlantCountNet and InsectNet reported mean average precision of 0.69 and 0.02 for
    the test images. Predictions from the DCNN models were transmitted to the ThingSpeak
    IoT platform for visualization and analytics. We concluded that AICropCAM successfully
    implemented image processing on the edge, drastically reduced the amount of data
    being transmitted, and could satisfy the real-time need for decision-making in
    PA. AICropCAM can be deployed on moving platforms such as center pivots or drones
    to increase its spatial coverage and resolution to support crop monitoring and
    field operations.'

  explanation: This study explores the relevance of edge computing to the successful
    data collection and transmission from imaging systems deployed in agricultural
    settings. By introducing AICropCAM, a field-deployable imaging system, researchers
    have combined edge image processing, IoT, and LoRaWAN to address the challenges
    of low power consumption, long-range communication, and autonomous image processing
    in real-time. AICropCAM demonstrates the capability to monitor crop parameters,
    including crop classification, canopy coverage, plant count, weed count, and insect
    count, using stacked DCNN models. By extracting meaningful information from captured
    images on the edge device, AICropCAM significantly reduces the amount of data
    transmitted while meeting the real-time decision-making needs of precision agriculture.
    The study highlights the advantages of edge computing in enabling precision agriculture
    and provides essential guidelines for edge device design and system optimization.

    The demands for food, feed, fiber, and fuel increase rapidly due to the fast expansion
    of the global population, income growth, technological advancement, and transport
    and logistics improvements (van Dijk et al., 2021). Precision agriculture (PA),
    which seeks to apply the right amount of inputs (fertilizers, irrigation water,
    pesticides, and other chemicals) in the right location at the right time, is essential
    to meet the requirements of future global food production, as well as environmental
    sustainability and climate resilience. PA is predicated on accurate sensor measurements,
    timely and sound decision-making, and automated actuators. The backbone of PA
    is the Internet of Things (IoT) technology that automates data collection, data
    analytics, data presentation, control, and efficient data communication (Chamara
    et al., 2022). Imaging sensors or digital cameras are essential for PA as they
    can capture more information than traditional scalar or vector sensors. Images
    can capture crop phenology for precise decision-making (Taylor and Browning, 2022,
    Tian et al., 2020). Cyclic events such as vegetative growth, flowering, leaf count
    and color change, maturation, and senescence are studied in crop phenology, which
    is essential to PA as it determines the management inputs required by crops. Moreover,
    images have rich information on the scene that allows for pest pressure evaluation.
    At present, a limited number of sensors are available for pest identification
    and pest pressure estimation. Among them, imaging sensors provide the most promising
    solution. Conventional (handcrafted feature extraction) and Artificial Intelligence
    (AI)-based image processing are the two branches of image processing. Traditional
    approaches extract image features defined by shape, texture, and color (Anubha
    et al., 2019, Yuan et al., 2019). The AI-based methods use Convolutional Neural
    Networks (CNN) to extract features from images (Luis et al., 2020). CNN models
    with multiple hidden layers for feature extraction and learning are considered
    Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) (LeCun et al., 1998). Conventional imaging
    platforms in PA store images locally using onboard storage memories. Post processing
    refers to the processing of images stored at the central data storage in batches
    at a later time to extract useful information (Aasen et al., 2020). Imaging platforms
    that can access the internet through a stable connection with high bandwidth can
    automatically upload images to Cloud data storage. The vast majority of farmlands
    worldwide are in rural and remote areas with poor access to electric power and
    internet connectivity. This represents a big challenge for camera systems deployed
    in rural farmlands for high-speed image processing, data transmission, and low-latency
    decision-making (Richardson, 2019). Post-processing of crop images has been used
    for the estimation of leaf area index (Aasen et al., 2020), growth rate (Sakamoto
    et al., 2012), leaf chlorophyll and nitrogen content (Wang et al., 2014), fruit
    counts (Wang et al., 2014), and plant height (Sritarapipat et al., 2014). Further
    post-image processing allows for the assessment of biotic stress, such as pest
    density (Barbedo, 2014; Park et al., 2007) and weed pressure (Wang et al., 2019),
    as well as abiotic stress, such as nutrient deficiency (Ghorai et al., 2021).
    Richardson (2019) suggested that deep learning-based methods have the potential
    to facilitate the extraction of more sophisticated phenological data from both
    new and previously archived camera imagery compared to conventional image processing.
    Semantic segmentation-based canopy coverage (CC) estimation (Chamara et al., 2021;
    Liang et al., 2023), image classification-based crop identification (Anubha et
    al., 2019), disease identification (Sharma et al., 2020), growth stage prediction
    (Yasrab et al., 2021) and object detection-based plant feature identification
    (A. Wang et al., 2019) are examples of DCNN applications in agriculture. Conventional
    image processing requires less computational power and less energy, but they are
    limited in adaption to new scenarios, while deep learning requires high computational
    power and consumes more energy. DCNN models require large memory due to the large
    number of parameters these models hold. Therefore, it is not easy to implement
    these models practically in embedded systems that have less memory and computation
    power. These models also require a large amount of data to train to predict with
    high accuracy. Therefore, it is resource intensive. Edge image processing is the
    image processing done on image-capturing devices. The main advantage of edge image
    computing is that it lowers the high throughput data transmission requirement
    over a wireless IoT-enabled imaging network (Cao et al., 2020). Wang et al. (2022a)
    demonstrated the capability of identifying potted flowers with precision above
    89 % in real-time in a Jetson TX 2 computing module based on a DCNN algorithm.
    These authors suggested that a cloud-edge collaborative framework could achieve
    real-time and automatic learning for the DCNN model they have developed. Wang
    et al. (2022b) proposed a real-time weed detection model run on Jetson AGX Xavier
    for field robots. The authors proved it was possible to do real-time weed detection
    with a precision above 90 % yet required expensive hardware. Wang et al. (2022a)
    reviewed Raspberry Pi single-board computer-based real-time image processing applications.
    They concluded that Raspberry Pi (Datasheet Raspberry Pi Model B, 2019) is a cost-effective
    edge computing unit that could potentially be used as an edge image processing
    unit, and the capability of integrating it with IoT was also discussed. Zualkernan
    et al. (2022) demonstrated an edge image processing platform for the classification
    of animals and transmitting the identified animal and time of identification via
    LoRa for a camera trap. Past literature on IoT and image processing applications
    in agriculture has highlighted a research gap in edge image processing with IoT-enabled
    crop monitoring cameras. In-field crop cameras are expected to make real-time
    crop management decisions based on real-time image processing; however, poor internet
    connectivity in agricultural fields severely limits their capability. To address
    this gap, we have developed a novel imaging platform named AICropCAM that extracts
    plant and crop canopy level parameters through DCNN and uploads them to the Cloud
    via low-power, low-throughput communication protocols. We also demonstrated AICropCAM
    on an IoT-enable wireless sensor network in corn and soybean fields. A technology
    that addresses image processing at the lowest level (edge) and transmits only
    useful information can revolutionize real-time decision-making in PA. Therefore,
    the main objective of this paper is to demonstrate AICropCAM to perform edge image
    processing and low-throughput, low-power, and long-range data transmission through
    IoT technology. In this novel AICropCAM platform, multiple DCNN image processing
    algorithms run in series to extract plant-level and canopy-level features in an
    embedded system. Image classification, object detection with classification, and
    image segmentation are the three major applications of DCNN image processing,
    and all three are included in AICropCAM to demonstrate the capabilities of DCNN
    for image processing in PA. AICropCAM has trained models for canopy segmentation,
    crop classification, plant growth stage identification, plant counting, weed counting,
    and plant type identification. All the protocols that transmit data from AICropCAM
    to the Cloud were custom designed. AICropCAM sends the generated data to a cloud
    platform for logging, visualization, and analysis. Furthermore, this paper explains
    the DCNN model training process, model performance, and test results. We reported
    the model training comprehensively because it was essential for AICropCAM development.
    2. Materials and methods Essential activities in this research were data/image
    collection and preprocessing, hardware design for AICropCAM, software design for
    data transmission between the edge and the Cloud, deep learning model design,
    and model training and optimization (Fig. 1). AICropCAM was implemented in a corn
    and soybean field at the field phenotyping facility in Mead, Nebraska, USA (Bai
    et al., 2019). We demonstrated the training of the following DCNNs: CropClassiNet
    for classifying images based on image quality and crop type, CanopySegNet for
    segmenting crop canopy from the background, PlantCountNet for classifying and
    counting soybean and weed plants, and InsectNet for identifying insects and counting
    them. Download : Download high-res image (412KB) Download : Download full-size

    system (edge devices). 2.1. Image collection, annotation, preprocessing, and augmentation
    Image collection for DCNN model training occurred in four growing seasons using
    three different types of cameras: (i) commercially available Meidas SL122 trail
    cameras in 2019 (Meidas Trail Cameras, 2022), (ii) OV5642 imaging sensors with
    ArduCAM camera shields in 2020, and (iii) Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2 with Raspberry
    Pi Zero in 2021 and 2022 (Chamara, 2021). All the cameras were mounted on the
    bars horizontally extended and fixed on stationary poles erected vertically in
    the fields, as shown in Fig. 2A. The distance between the crop canopy and the
    cameras was maintained between 0.5 and 1.5 m throughout the growing seasons. Images
    used for training the InsectNet were also captured with smartphones as we could
    not collect enough images with insects from the three types of cameras mentioned
    above. Download : Download high-res image (338KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Left: An Illustration of how AICropCAM was set up in the field for
    image collection. In addition to the camera, other components such as the solar
    panel and data logger were also shown. Right: A close-up view of AICropCAM and
    its hardware components. All three standard image annotation techniques in deep
    learning model training were utilized: (1) folder labeling for the image classification
    models, (2) pixel-level annotation for the semantic segmentation model, and (3)
    bounding boxes for object detection models. Images belonging to the same class
    were grouped into a single folder, and five distinct classes (or folders) were
    created: rejected, corn, soybean, grass, and night. Separating the crop canopy
    from the soil was done with pixel-level annotation and semantic segmentation.
    Bounding boxes, the smallest rectangle around an object, were drawn for corn plants,
    soybean plants, weed plants, and insects. Table 1 explains each type of annotation
    used in the model training. Table 1. Annotation criteria used to generate labels
    from the images to train and test the four deep convolutional neural network models
    in AICropCAM. Labeling Type Class Description Image classification (CropClassiNet)
    Rejected Images were labeled as rejected due to multiple reasons: blurred images
    caused by water droplets on the lens; the cameras turned away from the targeted
    crop; crops growing up to the camera blocking the view or capturing only a few
    leaves; people present in the images; lens covered with different stuff; and the
    camera was not installed in the field. Corn Images entirely covered by corn plants
    at different growth stages. Soybean Images entirely covered by soybean plants
    at different growth stages. Grass/Weed Images only comprise grass/weed plants
    at different growth stages. Night Images captured under low lighting conditions.
    Most of the cameras were not programmed to stop collecting images under low light.
    Crop canopy and background (CanopySegNet) Canopy Pixel labeling was done on the
    crop canopy. We used assisted freehand tool and the superpixel option in the MATLAB
    image labeler. Background Pixel labeling was done on the crop canopy. We used
    assisted freehand tool and the superpixel option in the MATLAB image labeler.
    Plant-type (PlantCountNet) Weed Weed present in the image was labeled using bounding
    boxes. It was challenging to locate the weed after the corn or soybean canopy
    was closed. Soybean Soybean plants present in the image were labeled using bounding
    boxes. Insects (InsectNet) Insects During the labeling process, without distinguishing
    insects based on their type, all the insects present in the images were labeled
    using bounding boxes. Image preprocessing is necessary for DCNN model training
    and real-time edge image processing. Differences in the input layer size in different
    DCNN models demand that images be resized before passing through the model for
    training or prediction purposes. High-resolution images improve accuracy but require
    more computational power. For specific applications, labeled datasets were only
    limitedly available. Therefore, image augmentation techniques were used to increase
    the number of image data sets, including scaling, flipping, cropping, rotation,
    color transformation, PCA color augmentation, and noise rejection (Paymode and
    Malode, 2022). Multiple augmentation techniques were used for each model, as detailed
    in Table 2. Additionally, Table 2 provides the numbers of images in training,
    validation, and testing for the four DCNN models. Table 2. DCNN model image allocation
    and image augmentation. Model Number of images Data Augmentation Techniques Total

    (same as CanopySegNet) Our main objective was not to make the most accurate prediction
    for the DCNN models but to demonstrate the concept of implementing edge image
    processing and transmitting the results to the Cloud for decision-making. Therefore,
    we selected a limited number of images for CanopySegNet, PlantCountNet, and InsectNet,
    which were sufficient to train models with a reasonable degree of accuracy. 2.2.
    DCNN model architecture selection, training, evaluation, and deployment on the
    edge device The steps to select model architecture/model backbone weights and
    image input sizes to train the best model for CropClassiNet, CanopySegNet, PlantCountNet,
    and InsectNet are summarized in Fig. 3. Unlike many DCNN applications that prioritize
    higher accuracy, our application focused on finding the balance between accuracy
    and model deployability on the edge device. Download : Download high-res image

    during the training and testing by attempting different model architectures, model
    backdone weights, and input image sizes. For example, in the development of CropSegNet
    (Segmentation), we selected DeepLabv3+ (Firdaus-Nawi et al., 2018) with weights
    initialized from pre-trained networks of ResNet18 (He et al., 2016), ResNet50,
    Xception, InceptionresnetV2, and MobileNetV2. The input image sizes tested were
    512 × 512 × 3 and 256 × 256 × 3, and training options were kept constant to find
    the best-performing networks, which should also be deployable to Raspberry Pi
    4B. This process identified DeepLabv3 + with ResNet50 as the most suitable model
    for CropSegNet, with an input image size of 512 × 512 × 3. Table 3 summarizes
    the hyperparameter values and training options for the final DCNN models deployed
    to the edge device. (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) Table 3. Hyperparameter values

    used for the classification models CropClassiNet and CropSegNet, whereas IoU and
    mAP (Mean Average Precision) were used for PlantCountNet and InsectNet. Jaccard
    index gives the proportion of correctly predicted labels to the total number of
    labels. Model training was performed on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 Ti Mobile processor,
    a dedicated mid-range graphics card with 4 GB GDDR6 memory on a Dell XPS 15 9500
    Laptop. The laptop had an Intel Core i7-10750H 10th Gen processor,16 GB DDR4 RAM,
    and 1 TB SSD hard disk. 2.3. Hardware and software of AICropCAM The IoT data transmission
    and edge image processing hardware comprised the following major components: a
    Raspberry Pi 4B single-board computer, an Arduino MKR1310 development board, an
    Arduino MKR Relay Proto Shield, and a Dragino OLG02 outdoor dual channels LoRa
    Gateway (Fig. 4). The 12 V 8Ah battery powered the Raspberry Pi 4B, controlled
    through the relay shield managed by the Arduino MKR1310. A 3.7 V lithium polymer
    battery powered the Arduino MKR1310 board. There are two advantages of having
    a separate Arduino board. First, the Arduino board consumes less power than the
    Raspberry Pi 4B module. It can be switched on and off according to user requirements.
    Second, it allows uninterrupted communication between the edge node and the Cloud
    with low power. Download : Download high-res image (303KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. Hardware overview of AICropCAM and data flow. AICropCAM
    required programming on two hardware platforms. Arduino was programmed using C++
    in Arduino’s Integrated Development Environment. Raspberry Pi imaging and image
    processing program was developed in MATLAB and deployed onto the Raspberry Pi
    4B using the MATLAB Coder and MATLAB Compiler. A python program was designed to
    read the saved data in the Raspberry Pi 4B and serially communicate to the Arduino
    MKR1310. The primary functions of the MRK1310 program were to (1) turn on the
    Raspberry Pi 4B module based on the user-defined time intervals, (2) get the processed
    data, including the results of DCNN model predictions, through serial communication
    from the Raspberry Pi 4B, and (3) transmit the data to the ThingSpeak Cloud channel
    through the LoRa gateway. All the DCNN models were trained using the MATLAB deep
    learning toolbox. In the edge deployment, a MATLAB program runs multiple models
    logically depending on the prediction result of the previous model estimation,
    as shown in Fig. 5. MATLAB coder generated the C and C++ code derived from the
    program we developed to run on the Raspberry Pi. MATLAB Compiler generated the
    standalone application on the Raspberry Pi (The MathWorks, 2022). Download : Download

    image processing and data generation flow chart. Table 4 lists the parameters
    generated by the models in AICropCAM. The abbreviations in Table 4 are fields
    holding data in the program to reduce the complexity of system development and
    maintain a common standard among different platforms. Fig. 6 shows the data generation
    from images. According to Fig. 6, the size of the images were around 2 MB before
    being fed into the image processing pipeline. The output message contains the
    crop type (CT), plant count (PC), weed count (WC), canopy coverage (CC), and pest
    count (PstC). The resulting message is typically less than 100 bytes. This represents
    a substantial reduction of memory size with the output being 0.00005 times the
    size of the original image. Consequently, this message can be transmitted in a
    single message via LoRa as the maximum LoRa packet size is around 256 bytes. Table

    full-size image Fig. 6. Examples of message generation and data size reduction
    for LoRa transmission. 2.4. Data transmission, visualization, and storage The
    data generated after image processing were saved on the Raspberry Pi 4B SD card,
    allowing access to the data remotely or through manual retrieval during field
    visits. Two options for transmitting the collected data to the ThingSpeak IoT
    platform are available. Firstly, the data can be uploaded directly from the Raspberry
    Pi 4B if internet connectivity is available for growers with Wi-Fi access. Secondly,
    the Raspberry Pi 4B transmits the recently acquired data to the Arduino MKR1310.
    The Arduino MKR1310 decodes the data received from the Raspberry Pi 4B and forwards
    it to the ThingSpeak. The second method is for low-rate, long-range communication
    beyond the limit of Wi-Fi. A single message receivable to the ThingSpeak server
    includes data for eight fields. In our demonstration, a single message was enough
    to transmit the data generated. Fields 1 and 2 are reserved for geographic coordinates
    (namely, latitude and longitude) to represent the device''s location. The third
    field was for camera orientation. Image quality/crop type, plant count, weed count,
    insect count, and crop canopy coverage were allocated from fields four to eight.
    ThingSpeak supports eight channels per gateway. If additional data is generated
    in the future, we have to create new channels to accommodate them. However, only
    data in a single channel can be passed through a single message. The Arduino-LoRa
    library was used to prepare the LoRa messages forwarded to the gateway (Mistry,
    2016). The message generated from the Arduino MKR1310 includes the device identification
    number and the data with the field number. Once the gateway receives this message,
    it adds the target client ID (generated by ThingSpeak when defining a device),
    host address (mqtt://mqtt3.thingspeak.com), server port number, username and password,
    channel ID, and the data in each field according to the Message Queuing Telemetry
    Transport (MQTT) protocol. Username and password ensure that only authorized devices
    can transmit data to the ThingSpeak platform. ThingSpeak provides two ways to
    interact with its platform, REST (Representative State Transfer) and MQTT protocols.
    The advantages of using MQTT over REST protocol are that it supports ThingSpeak
    data publishing, including immediate and minimum power consumption and data transmission
    over limited bandwidth, which encouraged us to select the MQTT protocol in our
    demonstration. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. DCNN model performance CropClassiNet
    had a test accuracy of 91.26 %, a Jaccard Index of 0.77, and an F1-score of 0.91;
    the confusion matrix is given in Fig. 7. The highest precision is for the “grass”
    class (100 %), and the lowest is for “soybean” (92.0 %). The highest recall is
    for the “corn” class (99.9 %), and the lowest is for “grass” (67.1 %). The primary
    goal of CropClassiNet is to determine the quality of new images and direct them
    for subsequent processing (Fig. 5). This step has never been executed in an image-based
    crop monitoring platform before. Further, CropClassiNet can eliminate erroneous
    images when humans are present in the camera’s field of view or when the camera
    is misaligned due to external factors. AICropCAM can send maintenance requests
    through IoT analytics if rejected images are continuously generated. Download

    achieved a global accuracy of 0.93, a weighted IoU of 0.87, and a mean BF score
    of 0.73. Fig. 8 shows an example of an original soybean image and the corresponding
    segmentation result by CanopySegNet, which estimated CC to be 18.72 %. Season-long,
    time-series images can be fed into CanopySegNet to generate diurnal and seasonal

    and seasonal variations of canopy coverage as computed by CropSegNet. According
    to Fig. 9, canopy coverage percentage variation is low during the daytime and
    reaches zero at night. This verifies the need to eliminate low-light images before
    segmenting. As shown in Fig. 5, it is possible to eliminate the generation of
    false values when the camera captures images under low light conditions by halting
    the process of running CanopySegNet. There are three diurnal variation series
    on 6/8/2021, 6/26/2021, and 7/12/2021 in Fig. 9. The CC increased from 8 % to
    95 % between 6/8/2021 to 7/12/2021. The seasonal trend showed that the CC reached
    a maximum around 7/8/2021. These results suggest that the proposed stacked models
    can track the daily and seasonal CC variation and eliminate the effect of lighting
    conditions on false value generation. Table 5. Performance of PlantCountNet and
    InsectNet on the test image set (Root mean square error (RMSE)/Final validation

    of the PlantCountNet and InsectNet is given in Table 5. Fig. 10(A) and 10(B) show
    the result obtained by PlantCountNet for a soybean image at an early vegetative
    stage (V3). Meanwhile Fig. 10(C) and 10(D) shows the result at a reproductive
    stage (R1). It can be seen that, at V3 stage, the model outputs matched the labels
    of soybean and weed plants well, indicating a level of high accuracy. Download

    result of PlantCountNet for soybean and weed counting: Manually annotated vs.
    model-predicted bounding boxes at V3 growth stage (A and B); manually annotated
    vs. model-predicted bounding boxes at R1 growth stage (C and D). The size of insects
    is very small compared to the size of images (Fig. 11), which is the main reason
    for the low mAP for InsectNet (Table 5). Increasing input image resolution beyond
    480 × 480 × 3 is impractical as it exceeds the memory limitation to load models
    into Raspberry Pi 4B. A potential solution could be to increase the resolution
    of the region of interest by splitting the original image while keeping the resolution
    the same. Also, we suggest using the approach recommended by Tetila et al., 2020a,
    Tetila et al., 2020b in the future on Raspberry Pi model 4B. As technology advances,
    we expect the memory capacities will increase for edge computing units. At the
    same time, the state-of-the-art object detection algorithms will improve the accuracy
    for small object detection. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download

    labels. 3.2. Power consumption for Raspberry Pi 4B Since edge cameras in farmlands
    have limited access to electric power, information on their power consumption
    is essential for designing IoT devices and systems. AICropCAM is designed to be
    energized by solar power. It runs on a rechargeable battery when there is no solar
    power. We monitored the maximum energy consumption of each task performed by AICropCAM,
    and the result is presented in Table 6. Four main strategies are available for
    the power management of IoT edge devices: Selecting power-efficient hardware,
    maintaining low power modes, dynamic power management, and cloud-based management.
    Raspberry Pi 4B is an affordable power-efficient single-board computer suitable
    for our application, but it does not naturally support low-power modes. Therefore,
    we introduced the Arduino MKR1310 LoRa module for the Raspberry Pi 4B dynamic
    power management. Furthermore, this Arduino module allows us to perform cloud-based
    central management independently. Table 6. Electrical power consumption of the
    Raspberry Pi 4B and the Arduino MKR1310 during edge image processing. Device Activity

    <0.01A LoRa transmission <0.01A For our measurements, we used a Raspberry Pi 4B
    with 8 GB of RAM, connected to an HDMI monitor, a USB keyboard, and a USB mouse,
    and ran a MathWorks® Raspbian image (file used to boot the Raspberry Pi 4B). The
    Raspberry Pi 4B was operated at room temperature and connected to a wireless LAN
    access point and a laptop via an Ethernet cable. The electric current consumption
    for running each DCNN model was recorded during the test. CropClassiNet had the
    highest current consumption, while the PlantCountNet and InsectNet models had
    the lowest. As for LoRa transmission, we could not measure its current consumption
    because the lowest value our instrument could measure was 0.01A. Based on the
    manufacturer''s specifications, the Arduino MKR1310 consumes 104 uA at 5 V. The
    average time to run the DCNN models is essential to estimate the energy consumed
    for each prediction. These parameters listed in Table 7 provide essential guidelines
    for designing IoT sensor nodes with suitable batteries and power sources. We also
    noticed that typically the first prediction of a model took the longest time,
    but the rest take a considerably shorter time to predict. Table 7. Time duration

    320 × 320 × 3 0.20 3.68 Semantic segmentation was the most power-demanding activity,
    while insect detection was the least. Changing the order of the image processing
    models and adding new models or dropping existing models is possible during regular
    operation. It enables dynamic power management within the Raspberry Pi module.
    The main advantage of AICropCAM is that it implements a stack of four DCNN-based
    image processing models with multiple objectives. To the best of our knowledge,
    this is the first time such a system has been developed for a field crop monitoring
    camera. AICropCAM has applications such as setting up smart in-field or greenhouse
    IoT camera networks with edge computing capability, monitoring crops by attaching
    them to sprinkler irrigation systems (pivots and linear moves), or collecting
    crop information through ground or aerial mobile robots. The relatively short
    time to run each DCNN model makes the system suitable for real-time applications,
    including variable rate irrigation, fertilization, and spraying. For example,
    a pivot irrigated multi-cropping system with AICropCAM can automate irrigation
    or fertigation transition between different crops or crops at different growth
    stages by automatically providing the crop type or growth stage information to
    the irrigation controller. Additionally, existing herbicide or pesticide sprayers
    can get the feedback of the PlantCountNet and InsectNet in the AICropCAM for precision
    spraying. 4. Conclusion and future perspectives This paper outlines the essential
    components of constructing a functional edge image processing framework for real-time
    crop monitoring. From a software standpoint, CropClassiNet can categorize captured
    images according to image quality and detect the presence of specific crop types
    for further processing. CanopySegNet can further quantify the degree of canopy
    coverage; PlantCountNet can count the number of plants and weeds in the image;
    and finally, InsectNet can count the number of insects in the image. These four
    DCNN models, when implemented on edge devices, can extract an array of important
    crop and canopy parameters from field images and enable real-time, low-latency
    decision making and applications. Deep learning-based image processing on the
    edge has excellent potential in PA. Applications of AICropCAM are not limited
    to image classification, segmentation, plant counting, or weed counting. Potential
    future applications include insect classification and crop damage estimation,
    weed classification and pressure estimation, fruit identification and yield estimation,
    decision on replanting (Whigham et al., 2000), and disease identification and
    disease damage estimation in real time using actual field images collected by
    AICropCAM. AICropCAM shows excellent potential in enhancing crop management through
    crop monitoring. However, the current demonstration requires significant improvements
    on both hardware and software fronts. Customized circuitry and modular design
    are required to put AICropCAM in commercial farm applications. The full potential
    of the AICropCAM can be achieved by putting this camera on a moving platform like
    a center pivot with a GPS receiver to generate spatiotemporal data. Crop classification
    must include more crop types, and segmentation models need training data from
    other crop types. The DCNN models for weed and insect identification require the
    capability to identify different weed types, their growth stage, different insect
    types, and their growth stages to generate effective pest control decisions. Additionally,
    improving the models’ accuracy in image classification, segmentation, and object
    detection is crucial. It can be achieved by increasing the number of training
    image data sets. We also planned to expand the research for multiple edge architecture
    evaluation. Architectures such as a high-performance edge computer that accepts
    images from multiple edge devices through short-range, high-speed communication
    (e.g., Wi-Fi) and can run more accurate deep learning models with higher numbers
    of parameters, might be a better solution for the primary objectives addressed
    in this paper. We aim to expand the AICropCAM applications to other crops beyond
    corn and soybean. By making these improvements, AICropCAM will become a more effective
    tool for crop management, potentially revolutionizing how we grow and manage crops.

    Croatia SECTION I. Introduction Precision irrigation is an important strategy
    for water saving based on measuring the variability in space of soil properties
    and crop responses. Due to the increasing risk of drought in the Mediterranean
    area, the adoption of precision irrigation technologies is likely to increase.
    This paper presents a smart platform for precision irrigation that was developed
    within the ALADIN project funded by the research and innovation program of the
    region Emilia-Romagna, Italy. The main technical novelty is that the proposed
    solution is a complete platform that operates linear irrigation machines thanks
    to a decision support system(Irriframe [1]), which exploits vegetation maps obtained
    from an aerial survey. The platform has a distributed architecture, including
    a server node, embedded IoT devices to operate the irrigation machines and a mobile
    application for user interaction. Irriframe is a free decision support system
    for irrigation scheduling. The conventional use of Irriframe is to provide information
    about when to irrigate as well as the water quantity to be uniformly supplied
    across the field. Irriframe is based on a water balance model that usually considers
    geographic, meteorological and soil data. One of the contributions of this work
    is to query the decision support system by sending a vegetation map, obtained
    from an aerial survey, that is used to improve the water balance model as it provides
    a high resolution measurement of the actual crop vigor. To this purpose an unmanned
    aerial vehicle(UAV) was equipped with a vision sensor to perform an aerial survey,
    and software tools were developed for processing the resulting vegetation map.
    Therefore, the output of an Irriframe query to the server of the precision irrigation
    platform is an irrigation map that provides the amount of water to be supplied
    in each cell of the field rather than a uniform water quantity for the whole field.
    The detailed irrigation map is then converted to an irrigation plan, i.e., a sequence
    of machine commands for the irrigation machine deployed on the field. The irrigation
    process can be controlled and monitored in real-time by the farmer by using the
    mobile application that receives the irrigation plan from the server. In the implemented
    prototype of the smart irrigation platform, the adopted machine is a linear moving
    system that consists of a hose-fed irrigation boom. Variable rate irrigation is
    achieved by changing the hose rewind speed. Preliminary experiments are reported
    that were performed in tomato fields to test the main components of the platform.
    The paper is organized as follows. Section II reviews the state of the art. Section
    III describes the architecture of the smart irrigation platform. Section IV presents
    the experimental results with the implemented prototype, while Section V concludes
    the work. SECTION II. Related Work Most works on variable rate irrigation for
    precision agriculture investigated the use of fixed sprinklers, while in this
    paper a fully integrated platform is presented for a linear irrigation system.
    Moreover, while sensors networks on the ground are usually exploited to compute
    a water balance and to provide an irrigation schedule [2]–[7], in this work a
    decision support system is adopted that includes aerial measurements. In [3] a
    wireless network of moisture and conductivity sensors was developed and tested
    in several farms. Chikankar et al. [4] presented an automatic irrigation system
    using ZigBee for power efficiency. In [7] a prototype of a complete context aware
    wireless irrigation system was developed and evaluated using a single fixed, remotely
    controllable rotating sprinkler. The communication between the decision support
    system and the farmer is a key topic in precision farming. Early works in precision
    farming adopted the short message service(SMS) [8]–[10], while in this work a
    mobile application was developed to provide user-friendly interaction. Fig. 1.
    Architecture of the Smart Irrigation Platform. Show All To increase the amount
    of saved water few authors investigated the use of continuous move irrigation
    systems that support control of individual sprinklers [11]–[13]. While promising,
    such technologies are still not available in commercial products. In [11] an electronically
    controllable linear irrigation system was presented with individual control of
    sprinklers based on a distributed sensor network. In [12] a remote monitoring
    and control system was developed for a lateral move irrigation system. Camp et.
    al [13] proposed a modified center pivot system for variable-rate application
    of water and nutrients. The use of aerial vehicles for precision agriculture has
    become widespread [14]–[17]. However, as stated before, integration of UAV data
    in decision support systems for automated precision farming has not been considered
    in previous works. A standard technique in UAV surveys is to generate an accurate
    terrain mosaic from a sequence of multispectral images, and then to compute a
    vegetation index [15]. Murugan et al. [17] proposed an approach that fuses UAV
    and satellite images. Thermal sensors can also be adopted in conjunction with
    multispectral cameras [14]. SECTION III. Smart Irrigation Platform The smart irrigation
    platform described in this paper is composed by several interacting subsystems,
    as shown in Figure 1. A UAV is programmed to fly over the field to be irrigated.
    The aerial vehicle is equipped with a vision sensor. Geolocalized images taken
    during the flight are used to produce vegetation maps. The Ortophoto Processing
    Module provides a semiautomatic software tool to rotate and to downsample a vegetation
    map by defining a customized grid. The result is then saved as a GeoJSON file
    and sent to the Irrigation Platform Server. The Irrigation Platform Server is
    the core subsystem, exposing RESTful services to the Ortophoto Processing Module
    and to the Mobile App. The Irrigation Platform Server also interacts with Irriframe,
    which accepts GeoJSON files as input and computes an irrigation map that contains
    the amount of water to be supplied in each cell of the field. The Mobile App allows
    end users to request irrigation plans for their machines from the Irrigation Platform
    Server. Each irrigation plan is a list of commands for an irrigation machine,
    which is computed by the Irrigation Platform Server from an irrigation map provided
    by Irriframe. Further details on the subsystems and functional processes of the
    smart irrigation platform are provided in the following subsections, which also
    illustrate the prototype that has been implemented. A. Irrigation Platform Server
    The Irrigation Platform Server enables three main processes, namely End User Fields/Machines
    Mapping, Vegetation Map Upload, Irrigation Plan Computation. End users authenticate
    to the platform by means of their Irriframe account. Irriframe may provide the
    server with the list of fields owned by the end user, but it is not aware of her/his
    irrigation machines. By means of the Mobile App, the end user inputs a list of
    irrigation machines, which is stored within the database of the Irrigation Platform
    Server. At any time, an irrigation machine can be added/removed and associated
    to a specific field, by means of the mobile app. The Irrigation Platform Server
    exposes a RESTful service for uploading a vegetation map exported in GeoJSON file
    format by the software tool described in Subsection III -C. The software tool
    itself is provided with client features for invoking the uploading service. Finally,
    the farmer is enabled to request the Irrigation Platform Server to compute the
    irrigation plan, by providing field and irrigation machine details by means of
    the Mobile App(detailed in Subsection III -B). The Irrigation Platform Server
    generates the irrigation plan for the specified machine and field, according to
    the latest irrigation map provided by Irriframe. The irrigation plan is returned
    to the Mobile App, which forwards it to the embedded IoT device that controls
    the irrigation machine. An Irrigation Platform Server prototype was implemented
    using Node.js [18], a JavaScript runtime based on Google Chrome''s engine for
    easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven,
    non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, suitable for data-intensive
    real-time(DIRT) applications that run across distributed devices. Node.js allows
    a server to hold a number of connections open while handling many requests and
    keeping a small memory footprint. It is designed to be responsive, like the browser.
    Node.js is also highly modular. Modules can be easily developed, packaged and
    used. The npm repository is an online collection of ready-to-use Node.js modules.
    For example, the https module was used to provide Node.js with the capabilities
    of an HTTPS(HTTP protocol over TLS/SSL) server. The Irrigation Platform Server
    prototype exposes RESTful services developed by means of the express module for
    Node.js. With respect to competing modules restify and loopback, express is more
    efficient [19]. The REST API exposed by the irrigation platform server is available
    at the following URL: https://aladinirrigation.ddns.net/ Moreover, the Irrigation
    Platform Server prototype maintains a non-relational database, implemented within
    the MongoDB [20] document-oriented database management system. In this approach,
    every document collects all the data associated to an entity, in such a way that
    any application can treat the entity as a self-contained object and skip the computational
    burden of aggregating data to extract information related to the same entity,
    which is typical of relational databases. Such an enormous efficiency advantage
    is partially reduced by the need to preserve the consistence across partially
    duplicated documents. Collections in the aforementioned database have been designed
    for being as much as possible decoupled, in order to prevent inconsistency issues.
    Users may be either Farmers or Uploaders. Farmers have non-empty lists of fields
    and machines. Uploaders do not have fields or machines, but are enabled to upload
    NDVI Maps to the Irrigation Platform Server. RasterImgs contains references to
    vegetation map files which are stored in the file system and accessed by means
    of the fs Node.js module. Several images may be associated to the same field.
    They have meaningful name, extension and date(with ms precision). Irrigations
    contains the list of performed irrigations, detailing the farmer, field, tools(irrigation
    machine and terminals) and date. Machines contains irrigation machine descriptions,
    with parameters such as flow rate, and the list of all acceptable commands(described
    in Subsection III -D). Terminals contains technical information about the terminals
    that can be associated to the irrigation machines, such as hose-fed irrigation
    booms. B. Mobile App For the farmer, the Mobile App plays the role of single virtual
    access point to the smart platform. More precisely, the Mobile App allows the
    farmer to register user data on the decision support system, to request an irrigation
    plan from the server, and to control the irrigation process with real-time monitoring.
    The Mobile App prototype is based on Apache Cordova [21] and Framework 7 [22].
    Apache Cordova is a framework for developing mobile apps with HTML, CSS and JavaScript,
    targeting multiple platforms with one code base. It is free and open source. Framework
    7 is an HTML5 framework simplifying the development of hybrid applications with
    native look and feel, and an effective prototyping tool. Fig. 2. Mobile App: login

    4. Mobile App: configuration of the smart irrigation process. Show All The implemented
    Mobile App has a Single View layout, with Tab-bar, Nav-bar and side panels for
    navigation purposes. The main advantage of this approach is that content is fully
    loaded when the application is started, for enhanced responsiveness and improved
    user experience. Fig. 5. Unmanned aerial vehicle used for surveying and mapping
    crop fields. Show All Fig. 6. Raw NDVI vegetation map(left) in a tomato field.
    Rotated image(right) with superimposed grid(red lines). Show All Since part of
    the visualized information comes from Irriframe, to start the Mobile App the Farmer
    is required to perform a login process using Irriframe credentials(Figure 2).
    After login, it is possible to enter the panels for managing the farmer''s fields
    and irrigation machines. The Fields panel lists the fields owned by the farmer.
    For each field, it is possible to visualize the coordinates of the centroid of
    the field, the farmer''s company name(if any), the type of crop and the adopted
    irrigation approach(Figure 3). On the map, the borders of the selected field are
    also displayed. The Machines panel lists the irrigation machines owned by the
    farmer. For each machine, it is possible to know the current location. Moreover,
    it is possible to start the smart irrigation process, upon specifying some mandatory
    input parameters, such as pressure, nozzle cut height, gear(Figure 4). Finally,
    it is possible to monitor the elapsed time and the percentage of completion of
    all ongoing processes. C. Integration Of Vegetation Map From Aerial Imagery After
    each flight of the UAV, all collected images are processed(by the Ortophoto Processing
    Module) to create orthophotos of the RGB bands of the camera. Using a single camera,
    instead of more advanced multispectral sensors, still enables the computation
    of a vegetation index although it slightly degrades its sensitivity. Indeed, a
    red band cut-off filter is used in place of the standard NIR filter of the camera.
    Therefore, the red channel contains the NIR(Near-infrared) radiation. A vegetation
    map(in GeoTIFF format) of the field is then computed that contains for each pixel
    the NDVI(Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) index, defined as NDVI= NIR−BLUE
    NIR+BLUE (1) View Source Fig. 7. The irrigation machine that was used to test
    the smart irrigation platform. The total width of the wings is 40 m. Show All
    Fig. 8. Embedded IoT device and irrigation machine electronic control unit(ECU).
    Show All Figure 6(left) shows an example of an NDVI vegetation map obtained in
    a tomato field in gray scale. A semi-automatic software tool was developed to
    rotate the raw NDVI vegetation map so that the crop rows are aligned with the
    vertical y-axis of the image. The algorithm extracts the principal direction of
    the crop rows by computing the Hough transform of the image. If the algorithms
    fails to detect the correct rotation angle a manual correction can be inserted
    by the user. Figure 6(right) shows the NDVI vegetation map of the example tomato
    field obtained after automatic rotation. The software tool also allows to perform
    average downsampling of the NDVI vegetation map by defining a grid of cells(red
    grid in Figure 6, right) at a lower-resolution. The resolution of the grid can
    be selected according to the actual performance of the irrigation machine(about
    10 m resolution in the current setup). The result is exported to GeoJSON file
    format. D. Automatic Programming Of Irrigation Machine The linear irrigation machine
    considered in this work is a hose-fed irrigation boom. The one that was actually
    used to test the smart irrigation platform prototypes is shown in Figure 7. Since
    the water pressure at each sprinkler is constant, variable rate irrigation is
    achieved by changing the hose rewind speed of each horizontal section of the field
    as explained next. The irrigation machine is automatically programmed by an embedded
    IoT device designed to execute and to monitor the irrigation plan. The irrigation
    machine used for testing purposes is controlled at low level by a Rain 260 electronic
    control unit(ECU), by RM Irrigation Equipment S.p.A. The ECU accepts commands
    to start and to stop the irrigation, to set the rewind speed, to read the length
    of the unrolled hose, and to pause irrigation in case of damage. The embedded
    IoT device consists of a Raspberry Pi3 with a GPS receiver, and runs a software
    based on Redis [23], an open-source inmemory key-value framework. The embedded
    IoT device is connected to the ECU through a RS-232 cable, and it also communicates
    with the Mobile App and the Irrigation Platform Server through a 4G network connection.
    The embedded IoT device and the irrigation machine electronic control unit are
    shown in Figure 8. All commands contained in an irrigation plan are stored in
    a Redis queue and executed sequentially. Each command specifies how to irrigate
    a section of the field. In particular, a command consists of a pair ( v i , l
    i ) , where v i is the desired rewind speed set-point, and l i is the length of
    the i− th section of the field. The speed value v i is set as inversely proportional
    to the average water quantity to be supplied to the i− th section, i.e. v i =
    k 1 N i ∑ N i j=1 w ij (2) View Source where w ij is the amount of water in the
    irrigation map to be supplied to cell (i,j), N i is the total number of cells
    in section i and k is a constant value that depends on internal machine parameters(water
    pressure, boom length, nozzle cut height and gear). A control loop in the embedded
    IoT device monitors in real-time the position of the boom in the field by polling
    the current length of the unrolled hose from the ECU. If the field width is greater
    than the length of the boom, irrigation must be stopped at the end of the current
    lane and restarted, after repositioning the boom at the beginning of the next
    lane. The GPS signal is used before starting the irrigation of each lane of the
    field to check whether the initial position of the boom is correct. SECTION IV.
    Experimental Evaluation We report preliminary experiments that were carried out
    to test the main components of the system separately. A first experiment was conducted
    for the aerial system. The adopted aerial vehicle is shown in Figure 5. The UAV
    is a VirtualRobotix SPARK quadcopter (340 × 340 mm size, 190 mm height) with a
    payload of about 300 g. The estimated autonomy is up to 22 minutes. The UAV is
    powered by a VR Brain 5.2 board and it features a composite endoskeleton with
    power distribution features. The UAV is equipped with a Raspberry Pi3 computer
    and a Raspberry Pi NoIR camera(V2). The camera has a Sony IMX219 CMOS sensor(8
    megapixel) and it features a maximal resolution of 3280×2464 pixels(30 fps). Radiometric
    calibration is performed by using a reference target. Fig. 9. NDVI image generated
    after a test flight in a tomato field. Show All Fig. 10. Irrigation plan for a
    test field 60×40m( Marzolara, Bologna). The scheduled amount of water w and the
    rewind speed v are reported for each section of the field. Irrigation direction
    is from bottom to top. Show All Fig. 11. Image from the irrigation test described
    in Figure 10. Show All The UAV was programmed to perform a flight mission over
    a tomato field (100 × 150 m) in Vigheffio(Parma). A total of 73 images were acquired
    and the obtained NDVI orthophoto is shown in Figure 9. The NDVI values range from
    0.25 (red) in non-crop regions, like in a nearby road, to 0.39 (green) for vegetation.
    The experiment indicates that the aerial system is capable of generating plausible
    NDVI images, even though with limited sensitivity. Moreover, being the test field
    well vegetated the resulting NDVI image exhibits a low-variance on the crop region.
    The result was not unexpected as the specific test field available for the project
    experimentation had a limited spatial heterogeneity of soil. Fig. 12. Actual vs
    expected amount of water supplied to the field in the test described in Figure
    10, from 60 m(start) to 0 m(end). Show All Evaluation of the automated irrigation
    process was performed in a tomato field (60 m× 40 m) in Marzolara(Bologna) using
    a custom-built irrigation map. The irrigation map was automatically converted
    by the platform server to an irrigation plan that consists of five sections of
    different length, as shown in Figure 10. Then, the irrigation was started by using
    the mobile application. The top speed was about 115 m/h. Figure 11 shows a picture
    taken during the irrigation test. The graph in Figure 12 illustrates a comparison
    between the actual amount of water that was supplied to the field, measured by
    rain gauges, and the expected one. Although an induced delay can be observed due
    to the hydraulic system, it can be noticed that the supplied amount of water follows
    the expected value. SECTION V. Conclusion In this work a distributed smart precision
    agriculture platform was presented for a linear irrigation system. The platform
    exploits a decision support system that generates an irrigation map by integrating
    geographic, meteorological and soil data as well as a vegetation map computed
    from an aerial survey. The irrigation map is converted to an irrigation plan,
    i.e., a list of machine commands. The irrigation process can be started and monitored
    by the farmer thanks to a mobile application. Preliminary experiments have been
    reported in tomato fields. Additional experiments are planned to evaluate more
    thoroughly the proposed platform. Future work will address the online optimization
    of the irrigation process based on water supply monitoring performed on the irrigation
    machine. ACKNOWLEDGMENT This research was supported by the ALADIN collaborative

    around the world to fill the need of crop watering. This method of irrigation
    has a low efficiency compared to other methods of irrigation such as drip systems
    and generally they use water without consider the real need of plants. In this

    Location: Marrakech, Morocco SECTION I. Introduction The demand of food production
    and fiber increase with de world population. The irrigation management is important
    particularly in context where the fresh water resources are limited. The aim of
    the irrigation is to give to plants the adequate amount of water to ensure their
    water requirements. The use of Water Production Function (WPF) allows to estimate
    the production in terms of dry matter or marketable yield, evapotranspiration
    ore the amount of applied water during irrigation (IW). According to the different
    production functions of IW may also include different components in addition to
    Crop Water Requirement (CWR), such as pre-planting irrigation to prepare the seeding,
    leaching requirement to decrease the salinity, rise of water table by capillarity
    and rainfall. The estimation of water requirement is a stone corner which you
    can calculate the correct irrigation doses. Indeed, the water available for the
    crop is an indicator of the texture of soil, precipitations, previous irrigations,
    state of development of crop and the amount of water already present in the soil.
    Center-Pivot of irrigation are usually reserved to irrigate large areas from 3.5
    to 65 ha because of the costs; but, the nutrients, fertilizer, herbicide, insecticide
    and pesticide can be directly applied on the canopy of crop [1]. Center-Pivot
    irrigation systems require up to 40% less water application than traditional and
    conventional gravity (furrow) or surface irrigation methods, where a part of water
    is lost by percolation or runoff. But Center-pivot irrigation stays less effective
    than the drip systems that are the most economical in term of water. The main
    challenge is related to the exact estimation of both the evapotranspiration of
    the crop and how to bring the water (frequency and quantity). Traditional hand-feel
    soil measurement methods do not provide quantitative soil water and real-time
    data. The use of sensors in precision agriculture is becoming widespread, especially
    in irrigation and open the field of irrigation management in order to establish
    an optimal timing and amount of irrigation water for greatest effectiveness. Indeed,
    an optimal irrigation management avoid water deficiency and use too much water
    that reduces the potential for profitability of the crop. The supply of an optimal
    amount of water allows also to maximize the yield response to other management
    practices, optimize yield per unit of water applied, reduce the potential runoff,
    reduce soil erosion and pesticide movement into the surface and ground water [1].
    To optimize the yield and soil water in the crop, plants should not pass the wilting
    point. This means the minimum soil moisture required by a plant not to wilt. At
    this point, any decrease in soil moisture will result in wilting. When a plant
    wilts, its leaves dry out, droop, and wither. The coupling of the irrigation system
    with a soil moisture monitoring and an accurate evapotranspiration calculation
    has a significant advantage in term of water consumption. Precision agriculture
    (PA) uses the Internet of Things and allows real-time control measure and automation
    of pivot-center irrigation systems. Furthermore, Wireless Sensors Network (WSN)
    is affordable and the wide availability of Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) protocol
    such as LoRa, SigFox and Ingenu coupling with cloud IoT platforms pave the way
    of high precision and realtime irrigation management systems. In this paper, we
    combine agronomic and computer science expertise to propose a cloud IoT architecture
    and a network of sensors using LPWA to control, monitor and optimize the crop
    production at quasi real-time. The low-cost sensor network measure on one hand
    the weather data required to calculate potential evapotranspiration of the crop,
    and on other hand the soil moisture at different depths. The proposed architecture
    calculates water requirements of plants and actuate solenoids to open and close
    water individually each sprinkler. SECTION II. Literature Review The main challenges
    in the elaboration of an automated irrigation system for irrigation pivot-center
    are vital; on one hand to choose an adapted evaluation method of water requirements,
    and on other hand to identify a correct cloud IoT platform essential for data
    storage and treatment. The following paragraph focuses on these aspects and on
    reviewing existing works. A. Related Works Classical Water Production Functions
    (WPF) are useful tools for irrigation management and economic analysis of yield
    reduction due to deficit irrigation which is usually based on linear regression
    and don''t give a representation of nonlinear behaviors of complex ecological
    systems. To fix this issue recent research are investigated. We list the use of
    more robust and nonlinear techniques such as machine learning, Artificial Neural
    Network (ANN) and data-mining tools (e.g. Fortin et al in 2010 [2], Dai et al.
    in 2011 [3], Haghverdi et al. in 2014 [4] and Elnesr et al., in 2016 [5]). In
    this study we follow two different controls. The first model consists to control
    the speed of travelling of the central-pivot for a constant flow rate. The second
    uses an electronic control to adapt flow rate in the nozzles. The speed of travelling
    of the central-pivot is maintained constant. The variable rate irrigation (VRI)
    allows to save 9-19% of irrigation water and to address field-level spatio-temporal
    heterogeneity in terms of soil water holding capacity and depth of soil [6]. According
    to Pan et al in 2013 [7] VRI allows also to enhance water-use efficiency, improve
    productivity, reduce fuel consummation and reduce nutrient leaching. The choice
    of sprinkler package, the pressure of working, meteorological conditions and tower
    dynamics affect the irrigation water distribution pattern [8]. Moreover, variations
    in micro-meteorological and technical conditions can modify the water application
    depth and irrigation uniformity at different lateral positions with flow control
    nozzles or pressure regulators at each head [8]. Wind speed and direction don''t
    significantly modify the uniformity of water applicatIon but impact the absolute
    application depth of zones under VRI management [9]. To adapt flow of irrigation
    soils moisture measure must be done. Traditional soil moisture sensors need to
    be installed early in the growing season and must be removed before the harvesting.
    Dong et al in 2013 [1] has proposed a cyber-physical system based on underground
    sensors to monitor soil moisture but this approach do not monitor soil on only
    one depth [1]. The interest of the coupling of Geographic Information System (GIS)
    and Remote Sensing (RS) with Internet of Things (IoT) has been demonstrated by
    different authors such as Li et al. in 2012 [10] Ye et al. in 2013 [11] Wang et
    al., 2013 [12]. B. Estimations of Water Requirements The estimation of water requirements
    of crop (ETc) can be estimated from a simple soil water balance (SSWB) model.
    A general form of the soil water balance is done by the following equation: ETc=I+P+F+R+ΔS
    (1) View Source Where I is the irrigation dose [mm], P is the precipitation [mm],
    F is the net subsurface flow into the control volume [mm], R is net runoff or
    runon to the control volume surface [mm] and ΔS is the net change in soil water
    stored in the control volume [mm]. The potential evapotranspiration (PET) can
    be calculated by using different methods. A common one requires several weather
    data that are not all the time available. Among these methods, we mention Penman-Monteith
    [13] FAO56 PM) which ranked as the best method for estimating daily and monthly
    ET for all climates. Penman [14] (FAO24), Penman [15] (FAO-ppp-17), Kimberly-Penman
    [16], Hamon [17], Hargreaves [18], Haude [19], Penman [20], Penman-Monteith [21],
    Priestley-Taylor [22], Makkink [23], McCl [24], De Bruin-Keijman [25] (DK), Jensen-Haise
    [16], Blaney-Criddle [26] (BC), Blaney-Criddle [14] (FAO 24 BC), FAO 24 Radiation
    [14], Turc [27], Wendling [28], Valiantzas [29]. Nevertheless, modern technologies
    such as the use of Wireless Infrared Thermometers (IRT) appear to measure surface
    temperature and determine the ETc [30]. A comparison of 16 among the models mentioned
    above has been carried out by Liu et al. in 2017 [31] and have shown that FAO-ppp-17,
    Pen-63 and FAO-24 BC are the better results in semi-arid climate. Therefore, we
    notice that a poor calibration between all the aforementioned researchers lead
    to inconsistent results of existing studies on weighting lysimeter. Indeed, Jensen
    et al. report that FA024BC is better [32]. While Yoder et al. in 2005 [33] and
    Lépez-Urrea et al. in 2006 [34] find that FA056 PM is the better formula. Otherwise
    some authors such as Berengena et al. in 2005 [35], Howell et al. in 1998 [36]
    have proven that the adjustment of the Penman formula coefficients at local scale
    shows significantly performing results. To conclude, we assume that FA056 PM or
    FA024 BC can be tested as a first approach in the evaluation of the evapotranspiration
    and a precise evaluation can be obtained locally by adjusting the parameters of
    the original Penman equation. The local adjustment of coefficient of the Penman
    formula need the use of lysimeters and a long experimentation which is not always
    achievable out of research centres. The Maximal Evapotranspiration (MET) of a
    crop can be calculated at different vegetative stage when amount of water is sufficiently
    available and agronomic condition are optimal. The MET can be calculated by model
    but in real conditions, and the Real Evapotranspiration (RE) is inferior in amount
    calculated by model. By consequence, it''s important to measure accurately real
    evapotranspiration by mean of sensors to provide the necessary quantities of water
    and to avoid percolation losses related to excessive intake linked in particular
    to an overestimation of the actual evapotranspiration. C. Choice of Sensors Both
    approaches can be followed. The first one uses commercial sensing solutions which
    natively provide a wide range of features directly and allows researchers to focus
    on the developments of algorithms and meta-processing, etc. The second one uses
    open hardware solutions which are programmable and flexible allowing to developers
    to have the full control of the behaviors of the nodes [37] The first approach
    is particularly interesting to develop proof of concept but makes researchers
    dependent of one provider and the availability of sensors used for development.
    Moreover, the rapid turnover of product of high technology renders this science
    stream especially risked for long term developments. The second way although requiring
    further development is more sustainable and is generally supported by a large
    community of developers. The choice of sensors is crucial because nodes can move
    over time that causes considerable interferences in the communication between
    nodes. Moreover, the influence of temperature, humidity, rainfall, sandstorm and
    high solar radiation greatly affect the links and communication quality among
    the nodes, particularly in harsh environmental conditions. The high temperature
    encountered in semiarid environments affects significantly the received signal
    strength (RSS). The humidity linked to the irrigation system and the heavy rainfall
    intensely affects the propagation of radio waves. The choice of the wireless transceiver
    and the transmission protocol must take into account the number of nodes, the
    distances between them, the height of antenna and the operating frequency based
    on the desired size of payload [37]. D. Cloud IoT Platform The correct choice
    of the IoT Platform to build a solution can affect the overall success of the
    project [37]. Both explorable approaches acquire and manage the underlying hardware
    and software layers or use a commercial offering which provides all needed services
    to propose an integrative solution. A review proposed by Ray PP in 2016 compare
    the 26 most popular IoT cloud platforms based on the following parameters: deployment
    service, device management, system management, heterogeneity management, data
    management, tools for analysis, deployment, monitoring, visualization and research.
    According to Ray in 2016 [38], they should have at least 49 IoT cloud platforms
    present in the actual global market. Nowadays, any commercial or open source cloud
    platform allows to deploy, and hosts applications or models elaborated on different
    framework on the same cloud architecture. SECTION III. Calculation of Water Requirements
    The soil characterization has been achieved on basis of samples taken in situ
    by BNEDER (National Technical Studies Office for Rural Development) located at
    Alger (Algeria). 96 samples were taken following a systematic grid of 30 × 30
    m over the area covered by the pivot (one by layer of soil). The parameters evaluated
    were bulk density, texture and the soil water holding capacity. Then, parameters
    measured on each of the 32 sampling points for three layers of soil has been interpolated
    to obtain a high-resolution map. The software ArcMap 10.5.1 was used to interpolate
    data measured in order to generate a grid by layer of 5m × 5m (25m2 area per cell)
    for each kind of measure. Moreover, each layer of soil has also been interpolate
    using 3D spline method to obtain a 3D model of soil layer. This 3D model and the
    spatial interpolation of soil water holding capacity allows to calculate the plant
    available in function of the depth of rooting. As shown on Fig. 1. The first layer
    is a mix of one or more existing layers which have been homogenized from a textural
    point of view and the salt content by successive plowing on a height of 25 to
    30 cm. The water available for plant is also function of roots development which
    offers the possibility to explore a more and more large part of soil. The available
    water is obtained by a weighted mean of the depth of all layers explored by the
    root system at each stage of development. A day by day amount of water irrigation
    can be calculated from (1). Fig. 1 Different stages of crop development Show All
    The FAO Penman-Monteith method (2) is used to estimate the potential evapotranspiration
    (PET) and the evapo-transpiration of the crop (ETc), also named MET which takes
    into account the stage of vegetative growth of the crop by weighting the potential
    evapotranspiration by the coefficient Kc [13]. The Kc coefficient allows to modulate
    the PET in function of the crop envisaged and the stage of its stage of development.

    the saturation vapor pressure [kPa], Δ is the slope of the vapor pressure curve
    [kPa.°C-1], γ is the psychrometric constant [kPa.°C-1]. The evapotranspiration
    of the crop is calculated with (3). ETc= PET ∗ Kc (3) View Source Where ETc is
    the crop evapotranspiration [mm.day''], PET is the reference evapotranspiration
    [mm.day−1] and Kc is a ponderation coefficient variating between 0.3 to 1.2 depending
    of the crop stage of development [8], see Fig 1. SECTION IV. Material The application
    is tested on a pivot-center irrigation and a crop of soft wheat implanted in Ain
    Salah located in the heart of the Sahara Desert region in the center of Algeria.
    This region is characterized by a hot desert climate where the temperature in
    the summer reach 47 to 50°C. The irrigation pivot-center is composed of 6 spans
    with a total length of 308m. The revolution time of the pivot is 24h, it means
    that every hour an angle of 15° is traveled. As shown in the Fig. 2, the cover
    area is increasing from the center to the outside. The sensors must stay functional
    with important temperature variation from 20 to 65 degrees and remained functional
    also in presence of rate of humidity close to 80%. Fig. 3 The proposed system
    and architecture Show All SECTION V. Proposed System and Archttecture We have
    chosen to follow the open hardware way as part of our developments. The proposed
    system is composed locally of a weather station. Several multi-depth moisture
    sensors distributed on the irrigate area at the middle on each span measure the
    amount of water at different depths and solenoid placed on sprinkler. Data are
    transmitted by LoRa modulation to a gateway which relay data to The Things Network
    using a 4G connection. A cloud architecture collects, treats and stores data received
    from the weather station and soil moisture sensor, and calculates in real-time
    needs in irrigation water. A. Weather Station The weather data are acquired by
    a micro weather station which uses a LoRa transmission system. This low-cost protocol
    has been chosen for its easiness of deployment, its ability to resist interference
    with the spread spectrum technology and the area that can be covered by a single
    gateway. The micro weather station is based on a Weather Sensor (Argent Data Systems)
    which contains an anemometer, a vane direction and a pluviometer. The weather
    station contains a temperature / humidity sensor AM2315 (Aosong) with an error
    of 0.1°C for the temperature and 2% for the relative humidity. The net solar radiation
    is measured by a digital net radiometer SN-500, Apogee Instruments. All sensors
    are connected on a LoPy which collect data and send them on LoRa / 4G gateway
    (see Fig. 3). B. Sensors and Actuators Soil moisture nodes based on LoPy using
    soil moisture underground sensors measure the rate of humidity at different soil
    depths. The humidity is measured at different depth (20, 30 and 50 cm) with Watermark
    Soil Moisture Irrometer sensor model 200SS. The measure of humidity at different
    depth allow to control if amount of water calculate are correct or if they must
    be adjusted. As show on Fig. 2, the 24 sensors are implanted in the middle of
    each ring, the water requirements are controlled 8 times per day (one just before
    the irrigation and one hour just after the irrigation) on each of the four control
    lines of sensors. Solenoid valves are implanted on the sprinkler feed pipes and
    allows them to be operated individually and thus finely control the water supply.
    The fine control of the sprinklers allows to have a same amount of water per unit
    area at each of the 6 zones traveled at the level of each of the different segments
    each hour. C. Cloud Architecture We use our own architecture based on a Cloud
    IoT platform and a share/hosting application platform. This architecture has already
    been tested with cattle behavior [39], digital phenotyping [40] and monitoring
    of bee health [41]. Time-related Data are transmitted to the Cloud IoT platform
    by LPWA network while images, videos and sound are transmitted by Wi-Fi network,
    see Fig. 3. 1) The Cloud IoT Platform The platform is composed of two parts. The
    first one is based on one hand on Apache Kafka, Apache Samza, Druid, to treat
    stream and time-related data. The second one uses an Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark
    are associate to store and treat images, sound and video. a) Time Related-Data
    Data are received by Apache Kafka which transfer them to Apache Samza to be processed
    before the ingesting by Druid. Druid is a distributed column -oriented fault-tolerant
    data store presenting real-time analytical capabilities. The data processing allows
    to increase the speed of ingestion 10 times by elimination of bad formed package,
    inconsistent and incomplete data. Redis Caching accelerate the speed of recurrent
    queries. The data are stored in units of few millions of lines named ‘segments’
    composed of 5 to 10 million of times-stamped events compressed by LZ4. Old segments
    are locally stored on HDFS. Both external dependencies are used: PostgreSQL and
    ZooKeeper to respectively store meta data and monitor the four kinds of nodes
    present in the cluster. These four types of nodes coordinate, broke, store in
    real-time or archive data in the distributed data store. b) Sound, Images and
    Video These kinds of data are independently treated and stored by a second structure
    based on Hadoop and Apache Spark. These kinds of data are also locally stored
    on HDFS. This structure offers better performance than an Hadoop, MapReduce, HiPi.
    Camera placed on the pivot center can make 3D-pictures of same plant every day
    in order to model their development and compare the impact of agricultural practices
    and weather conditions on the growth of the crop. The analysis of sound allows
    to detect any dysfunction may occur of critical parts of pivot-center and program
    a preventive maintenance (PM) to avoid the immobilization of the pivot over a
    long period. But both features are not yet implemented. 2) The Application Sharing
    and Hosting Platform Druid powers high performances application with low query
    latencies. To better exploit this performance and don''t be dependent of one SDK,
    we propose a cloud architecture able to host application developed on principal
    framework. This cloud platform authorizes elaboration of the model by researchers
    and also host endpoint applications of third party adapted to different kinds
    of material allowing to monitor and automate the pivot-center irrigation while
    optimizing crop yields. SECTION VI. Results We compare water requirements calculated
    by the cloud architecture with the one calculated by CropWat [42] decision support
    tool. This tool is developed by the Land and Water Development Division for the
    calculation of crop water requirements and irrigation requirements based on soil,
    climate and crop data. The calculation procedure is described in [8], the response
    of different yield is explained in [43] and the coupling between CropWat and climatic
    data of ClimWat is explicated step by step in [44]. Remarkably values calculated
    by CropWat assume that only water can change and other factors such as agricultural
    practices, fertilization, etc. are at optimal level. Table 1 gives results obtained
    with CropWat 8.0 for a wheat with a planting date of 25 November at In Salah,
    Algeria and total development in 180 days. Water requirements are calculated on
    basis of real daily weather data. Table I. Water requirements calculated with
    cropwat The Fig. 4 shows the comparison between measured and calculated with CropWat
    Potential Evapotranspiration (ETP). Both approach gives similar results. SECTION
    VII. Conclusion and Future Works We have outlined an architecture based on soil
    characteristics interpolate by mean of GIS, soil moisture measured, and weather
    data transmitted by LoRaWan to calculate in quasi real-time the water requirements
    of the crop. The LoRaWan is particularly adapted to transmit data in harsh conditions.
    In the end, the comparison of first approach performed with CropWat has allowed
    to calculate maximal evapotranspiration and verify that these are never exceeded.
    Fig. 4 Comparison between CropWat and measured average daily ETP Show All In order
    to validate the water requirements calculated using the CropWat model, we compared
    them with a precise model called AquaCrop [45]. This model considers more parameters
    affecting the vegetative and reproductive growth of crop. The implementation of
    3D Camera in specific areas places on the pivot, will open a new research path
    in the field of digital phenotyping. In addition to this, the continuous analysis
    of sound from microphones implemented in chosen places will quickly detect signs
    of failure and prevent downtime that can be expensive in term of crop profitability.
    As future work, we plan to exploit GPU Tegra Mobile Processors 1 that offers high
    computation power thanks to the exploitation of GPU processors in parallel [46]
    [47]. In addition to the high performance, these cards provide the possibility
    to exploit artificial intelligence algorithms for a better training and prediction
    of collected data. ACKNOWLEDGMENT We would like to thank our colleagues from Biosystems

  description: As the Hass avocado crop expands exponentially in Colombia, concern
    about its increasing water use is on the rise. This research aimed to develop
    IS-SAR, a free-access web application to schedule irrigation for Valle del Cauca’s
    Hass growers. We calibrated the water cloud (WCM) and artificial neural network
    (ANN) models using field data measurements from Hass avocado orchard plots in
    Valle del Cauca (Colombia) and Sentinel 1 (S1) satellite imagery measurements
    and evaluated their performance computing the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and
    Pearson correlation coefficient (r). IS-SAR estimates the surface soil water content
    from the most recent S1 image, becomes it in water depth, and recommends to users
    apply irrigation according to allowable depletion limits, computed from a spatially
    distributed θ at field capacity and permanent wilting point obtained from a soil
    database of the study area. Our results indicate that the surface soil water content
    was retrieved with a better performance by the ANN (RMSE = 0.05 m3 m−3, r= 0.74),
    compared with the WCM (RMSE = 0.06 m3 m−3, r= 0.47). IS-SAR simulations in validation
    orchard plots result in irrigation events of up to 107 L tree−1 for 3.4 h. The
    IS-SAR web application provides near-real-time irrigation information to assist
    Hass avocado growers in designing better irrigation routines and improving the
    regional understanding of water crop consumption.

  explanation: The study by Edwin Erazo-Mesa and colleagues (2023) presents the development
    of an irrigation scheduling web application, called IS-SAR, for Hass avocado orchards
    in Colombia, utilizing Sentinel-1 (S1) satellite images. The web application leverages
    a calibrated Water Cloud Model (WCM) and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to
    estimate surface soil water content and assist farmers in optimizing irrigation
    schedules.
  extract_1: The IS-SAR web application combines a calibrated Water Cloud Model (WCM)
    and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to estimate surface soil water content
    and assist farmers in optimizing irrigation schedules. The application uses Sentinel-1
    (S1) satellite images, acquired with a revisiting time of 7 days, to monitor soil
    water content in avocado orchards.
  extract_2: The authors evaluated the performance of the WCM and ANN models using
    field data collected from monitoring trees in the study area. The results showed
    that the ANN model outperformed the WCM, with a lower Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
    and higher correlation coefficient. The IS-SAR web application was further evaluated
    by simulating irrigation events in three avocado plots over a 5-month period.
    The results demonstrated that the application provided accurate irrigation recommendations,
    in line with the observed soil water dynamics and applied irrigation.

    Systems in Libya Using Soil Salinity Data Predicted by GIS, Remote Sensing and
    Artificial Neural Networks Chapter © 2022 Introduction In a world demanding immediate
    actions for solving the water crisis (Naddaf 2023), implementing irrigation scheduling
    (IS) technologies could significantly contribute to efficient water use in agriculture
    (Zinkernagel et al. 2020). When farmers schedule irrigation, they are unaware
    that the water volume used to produce a kilogram of food would meet household
    water consumption per capita for several months (Mekonnen and Hoekstra 2020; Bo
    et al. 2021). This situation indicates a clear disparity between the level of
    water used by agriculture and that used by others (Flörke et al. 2018; Wang et
    al. 2023). The core of the most commonly used IS methods has remained invariable
    over time; using these methods requires acquiring specialized equipment, handling
    large volumes of climate data, measuring soil properties, or managing software
    (Gu et al. 2020). Innumerable farmers worldwide lack technical knowledge, economic,
    or access-to-data capabilities to perform any of these IS methods for their crops
    (Yohannes et al. 2019; Berthold et al. 2021). All these limitations are also evident
    for Hass avocado growers in Colombia. Beyond the economic benefits propelled by
    the rising global demand for Hass avocados, the volume of water required for their
    production in Colombia has grown exponentially. In 2018, Colombian Hass avocado
    production represented an estimated total water footprint of approximately 300
    Mm3 (Sommaruga and Eldridge 2020); and in 2016, exported virtual water trade was
    31 Mm3 (Caro et al. 2021). Although rainfall is the main source of water for the
    crop (Erazo-Mesa et al. 2021), supplementary water from irrigation is needed to
    reach optimal fruit development (Grajales 2017). Moreover, Diaz et al. (2021)
    identified a gap between incipient avocado growers'' water management knowledge
    and the newest irrigation technologies. (Díaz et al. 2021), and regional environmental
    agencies have reported an increase in requests for crop irrigation water concessions
    (CVC 2021). One way to track IS parameters, bypassing some limitations of traditional
    IS methods, is through remote-sensing (RS) technologies (Tolomio and Casa 2020).
    RS technologies, scaled down to easy-to-use, cheap or free-access, and wide-coverage
    tools, have been demonstrated to be powerful tools for irrigators (Erazo-Mesa
    et al. 2022a). Synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) images have shown promising results
    for estimating the surface soil water content (SSWC), the water content in the
    first 5–10 cm of the soil depth (Li et al. 2021), at local and regional scales
    (Peng et al. 2021). SAR images have been used to estimate the occurrence of irrigation
    events, detect and map irrigated areas, and quantify applied volumes of water
    at a regional scale by employing SAR satellite projects for soil moisture and
    ocean salinity (SMOS), soil moisture active passive (SMAP), and advanced microwave
    scanning radiometer 2 (AMSR2) (Jalilvand et al. 2019; Dari et al. 2021) and at
    a plot scale using the Sentinel-1 (S1) project (Bousbih et al. 2018; Le Page et
    al. 2020; Ouaadi et al. 2020). Bousbih et al. (2018) and Han et al. (2020) estimated
    the SSWC using the water cloud model (WCM) for nonorchard crops, obtaining root-mean-square
    error (RMSE) values lower than 6.4 and 3.16% (Vol), respectively. Among the current
    challenges of using SAR images to schedule irrigation are the satellite revisit
    time, which is on average 4 days in countries at the equator, and the lack of
    correspondence between the effective root depth of some crops (for Hass avocados
    is 60 cm) and the superficial estimation of SSWC (Peng et al. 2021). To counterbalance
    the first limitation, some RS-based IS applications forecast irrigation parameters
    (Montgomery et al. 2015; Brinkhoff et al. 2019). Regarding the second limitation,
    some studies have modeled the soil water content at the root zone from SSWC for
    wheat (Babaeian et al. 2021) and Hass avocados (Erazo-Mesa et al. 2022b). Hass
    avocado growers could take advantage of SAR images, because SSWC dynamics are
    directly related to the superficial distribution of tree roots (Lahav and Whiley
    2002), a thin layer of litter on the soil surface near the trunk in some cultures
    which retains moisture (Bernal-Estrada et al. 2020), coarse soils and irrigation
    systems (Salgado and Cautín 2008), and dense canopy during the productivity period
    (Bernal and Díaz 2020). This research aims to develop an irrigation scheduling
    web application for Hass avocado orchards located in Valle del Cauca (Colombia)
    based on S1 images. Theoretical background The development and successful implementation
    of IS-SAR required a robust theoretical foundation associated with the SSWC, WCM,
    Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), and irrigation scheduling concepts. A comprehensive
    theoretical background is essential for multiple reasons. First, it underpins
    our understanding of the underlying principles and mechanisms governing soil water
    dynamics, which is fundamental to precise irrigation management. Second, a solid
    theoretical foundation allows for the informed selection and integration of the
    Water Cloud and ANN models, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of our approach.
    Third, it enables the development of effective irrigation scheduling strategies
    that optimize water resource utilization while minimizing environmental impacts.
    Soil surface water content (SSWC) Precise measurements of available water in the
    root zone are required for irrigation scheduling of crops. However, accounting
    for accurate estimations of soil water content in space and time at plot, farm,
    and regional scales is challenging. Microwave measurements from SAR satellites
    have demonstrated being sensitive to backscattering properties of the soil surface
    by which these can detect soil water content changes from topsoil (Karthikeyan
    et al. 2017). The radar sensor''s soil cover type and wavelength mainly determine
    the depth at which the soil water content can be estimated (Babaeian et al. 2019).
    According to Babaeian et al. (2019), the theoretical penetration of the C-band
    signal, used here through the Sentinel-1 project, reaches 1.5 cm for agricultural
    soils. However, some studies have compared soil water content measurements in
    a range of 0–12 cm of soil depth with a backscattering coefficient from Sentinel-1
    obtaining reasonable correlations (Bousbih et al. 2018; Han et al. 2020; Ouaadi
    et al. 2020). We define SSWC as the water content in the first 10 cm of the soil
    depth (Li et al. 2021). Erazo-Mesa et al. (2022b) studied the influence of soil
    water content ( ) at several depth ranges on the soil water balance at depths
    of 0–60 cm ( ) for three Hass avocado orchard plots in Valle del Cauca (Colombia)
    and determined that the 5–10 cm range depth correlated better with the soil water
    balance, which is named here as . Water cloud model (WCM) WCM describes how the
    microwave signal backscatters on vegetation–soil–water systems, representing the
    vegetation canopy as a cloud with identical droplets randomly distributed within
    the canopy. Initially introduced by Attema and Ulaby (1978) and with some variants
    from the original (Ouaadi et al. 2020), this semiempirical model splits the total
    backscattering coefficient from SAR images to a determined polarization ( ) (for
    this study VV and VH) and radar signal incidence angle into the microwave signal
    backscattered by vegetation , soil , and the soil-vegetation interphase (usually
    neglected) (Eq. 1) (1) Canopy structure, leaf size and distribution, and vegetation
    water content influence the strength, and their effects are indiscriminately introduced
    in the WCM by parameters and (Eq. 2 and 4) (Prévot et al. 1993). Parameter is
    usually computed from the leaf area index (LAI) using the function , where is
    a parameter to find in the model calibration, and is LAI (Han et al. 2020). Due
    to the heterogeneity of vegetation–soil–water systems, the impact of the surface
    soil backscattered signal is adjusted by a two-way vegetation attenuation effect
    and added to the WCM through the value. depends on surface roughness (inferred
    from parameters and in Eq. 3) and surface soil water content, called originally
    in the WCM but customized for this study as (Eq. 3). The contribution of in the
    signal backscattered by soil can be linearly (Han et al. 2020) or exponentially
    (Bousbih et al. 2018) expressed (Eq. 3) (2) and, (3) and, (4) Artificial neural
    network (ANN) An ANN is a bioinspired algorithm that operates by emulating how
    the neural system in the human brain builds reasoned decisions from previous knowledge
    and new information perceived by senses (Samek et al. 2019). From Widrow''s Adaline
    to deep or convolutional neural networks, ANN fundamentals are nearly the same:
    a structured net of processing units (neurons) is sorted in layers, where connections
    among neurons are strengthened through training (Montesinos et al. 2022). ANNs
    have been used as an alternative to retrieve SSWC from SAR images with better
    agreement than semiempirical backscattering models (Bousbih et al. 2018; Mirsoleimani
    et al. 2019). A perceptron multilayer consists of a supervised ANN with m layers,
    n neurons by layer, and an algorithm that back-propagates the error. Irrigation
    scheduling Irrigation scheduling consists of apply the right amount of water in
    the proper moment to avoid that crop plants suffer water stress. Using the premise
    of maintaining the soil water in a crop within the desired limits (Eisenhauer
    et al. 2021), in this case the allowable depletion limit and field capacity, when
    the IS-SAR user computed the irrigation requirement can act in three ways (Fig.
    1): (1) When is between field capacity and the irrigation triggering limit (i.e.,
    available water was not depleted), supplemental irrigation can be performed; (2)
    when is situated left , exceeding the irrigation triggering limit, imminent irrigation
    must be applied; and 3) when is right of , soil accounts with excess water and
    irrigation are not needed (Fig. 1). The amount of water (water depth in millimeters)
    to be applied in actions 1 and 2 will be quantified by , where and are expressed
    in fractional units and 600 corresponds to the crop root effective maximum depth
    (in millimeters) (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 Irrigation actions according to the water content
    of a cultivated soil found by users in IS-SAR Full size image Materials and methods
    Influence area of IS-SAR and plots’ characteristics IS-SAR was implemented for
    Hass avocado growers located in the current and potential production area (PPA)
    in the department of Valle del Cauca (Colombia) (Fig. 2a). PPA has an extension
    in Valle del Cauca of 330,279 ha and is characterized by a mountain landscape
    in a range of altitudes from 1500 to 2500 m.a.s.l and slopes that exceed 25%.
    The mean temperature and annual rainfall range from 18 to 24 °C and 1000–2000
    mm in PPA, respectively, and soils were formed from volcanic ashes of igneous
    and metamorphic rocks at altitudes above 1800 m.a.s.l. and sedimentary, igneous,
    and metamorphic rocks below 1800 m.a.s.l. (CVC and IGAC 2017). Approximately 400
    growers distributed in 5216 ha in the north and center of Valle del Cauca manage
    Hass avocado orchards from 1 to 430 ha, predominating small farms (Díaz et al.
    2021; MADR 2021). Fig. 2 Location of Colombia in South America (a), location of
    Valle del Cauca in Colombia (b), and location of the influence area of IS-SAR
    in Valle del Cauca (a) Full size image Our study is focused on a detailed pixel-level
    analysis of the S1 imagery (spatial resolution 100 m2). It is expected that the
    retrieved spectral response of S1 images results of a mixture of the avocado canopy,
    sparse pastures, and bare soil in 100 m2, in which are 2 to 4 avocado trees (49
    m2 to 24.5 m2, respectively) given a tree density in the study plots. The low
    tree density is an advantage for modeling the surface soil water content for Hass
    avocado crops, compared with high-density crops where the contribution of soil
    to the backscattering coefficient close to harvest significantly decreases. Sentinel
    2 imagery was also evaluated to calculate NDVI time-series data to be used as
    a proxy to derive LAI as input parameter for (Eq. 2). In the influence area of
    IS-SAR (Fig. 2a), the commercial 2-ha plots in Laurentina, Poncena, and Olival
    orchards were selected, which were cropped with Hass avocado at densities of 408,
    238, and 204 trees ha−1, respectively (Fig. 2c, d, e). The canopy area and trunk
    diameter varied according to the age of trees. The average values measured for
    canopy area were 6.28 ± 3.30, 9.70 ± 3.35, and 1.43 ± 0.69 m2 for Laurentina (3.5
    years), Poncena (5 years), and Olival plots (2.5 years), respectively, and average
    trunk diameters measured for Laurentina, Poncena, and Olival plots were 0.47 ± 0.08,
    0.34 ± 0.11, and 0.52 ± 0.12 m, respectively. The soil properties measured in
    the laboratory for the three plots determined that these mostly have a sandy loam
    texture, with a sand content higher than 57% and a content clay content varying
    from 9 to 23%, and an average total available water of 0.08 cm3 cm−3. Three monitoring
    trees were selected for each plot, where soil matric potential at 15, 45, and
    75 cm of depth was measured from 15 August 2020 to 15 August 2021 (Fig. 2c, d,
    and e) using granular matrix sensors. Moreover, climate data were recorded in
    this period using portable weather stations installed in the center of each plot.
    Regarding irrigation, a drip system was implemented for the Laurentina plot; Olival
    plot accounted for micro-sprinklers; and Poncena’s grower irrigated the trees
    one at a time with a hose. Approximately one fertigation events a week were implemented
    in Laurentina, totaling 44 in the study period (1245 mm). Conversely, irrigation
    was scheduled based on a visual manifestation of water deficit in trees in the
    Olival and Poncena plots. In Olival, no irrigation was needed during the study
    period, because rainfall met the water requirements of the crop, while in Poncena,
    the crops were irrigated five times (153 mm). The amount, date, and time of each
    irrigation event for Laurentina and Poncena were recorded. Annual precipitation
    of 1372, 1782, and 1275 mm for Laurentina, Olival, and Poncena plot were recorded,
    respectively. Methodological framework This study can be described in four major
    steps (Fig. 3). First, , , and were merged by date to calibrate the WCM and ANN
    models. Second, the best model that retrieved using S1 images was selected, and
    the best-adjusted linear regression parameters to predict soil water content at
    0–60 cm ( ) from were found. Third, at field capacity ( ) and permanent wilting
    point ( ) were spatially modeled, and finally, IS-SAR was designed, evaluated,
    and uploaded online to Hass growers (Fig. 3). Each of these steps comprises other
    steps, which are shown in Fig. 3’s flowchart and described in detail later. All
    these procedures described in the following sections and the graphical outputs
    (package ggplot2) were coded in R scripts. Fig. 3 The four steps outlined in the
    methodological framework used in this study Full size image Step 1: Calibrating
    the WCM and ANN models Soil volumetric water content time-series and irrigation
    practice description And time-series were obtained from the Erazo-Mesa’s et al.
    (2022b) study who modeled the vertical water dynamics in the soil profile up to
    90 cm at nine Hass avocado trees in the Laurentina, Olival, and Poncena plots
    (Fig. 2). Soil matric potential, climate, soil properties, and crop parameter
    data were monitored, the first two hourly, at the trees from 15 August 2020 to
    15 August 2021 as inputs to calibrate the Richards equation, van Genuchten, and
    Mualem pore distribution models (Mualem 1976; van Genuchten 1980; Hillel 2014)
    through Hydrus-1D software (Simunek et al. 2012). Further details for the field
    equipment, Hydrus-1D modeling, and procedures to select the surface depth range
    for can be found in Erazo-Mesa et al. (2022b). Processing of Sentinel-1 images
    A collection of 152 Sentinel-1 C-band images at the Level-1 GRD was processed
    on Google Earth Engine (GEE) using the framework routine developed by Mullissa
    et al. (2021). With a spatial resolution of 10 m, VV and VH polarizations, and
    ascending–descending orbits, this collection was delimited by the geographic quadrant
    76.869–75.990 W and 3.295–4.478 N and filtered from 15 August 2020 to 15 August
    2021. The 152 S1 images were composed of 48 Sentinel 1A (S1A) and 106 Sentinel
    1B (S1B) images from orbits 142 and 48 and acquired at 15:51 UTC and 04:21 UTC,
    respectively. The revisiting time was 12 and 7 days between S1A and S1B images,
    respectively, and averaged 4 days among consecutive S1 images. The procedures
    executed by Mullissa’s et al. (2021) framework routine included additional border
    noise correction, a multitemporal speckle filter, and radiometric terrain normalization
    using the NASA SRTM 30-m DEM, according to the incidence angle. Then, the in VV
    and VH polarizations (in dB units), (in degrees units), and acquisition date (in
    decimal format) were extracted from the images'' pixels intersected with tree
    monitoring coordinates. S1 images and θ integration The time-series product of
    merging by date , , and was split into calibration (15 August 2020–15 February
    2021) and validation (16 February 2021–15 August 2021) datasets. The calibration
    dataset, with 384 records, was used to calibrate the WCM and train the ANN, and
    the validation dataset, with 306 records, was used to select the best model. Inversion,
    NSGA-II implementation, and parameter optimization of WMC WCM calibration consists
    of finding the values of parameters , , , , and that minimize the difference between
    and . Although the normalized vegetation index (NDVI) at the tree monitoring coordinates
    was computed from Sentinel-2 images to calculate the LAI, the scarce free-cloud
    images in the study area impeded consolidating an NDVI time-series similar to
    that obtained from S1 images. Thus, parameter was optimized as the other WCM parameters.
    In this study, the WCM was calibrated using the optimization genetic algorithm
    NSGA-II (Deb et al. 2002), according to Kumar et al.’s (2012) suggestions. First,
    was computed using and from the calibration dataset and synthetic parameters ,
    , , , and , provided by NSGA-II. The computed was compared iteratively (100 generations
    and a population size of 500) with through a three-objective optimization function
    (Eq. 5–7). In Eq. 5–7, is the RMSE function, is one minus the coefficient of determination
    ), is a function that computes the number of undefined/infinite outputted values
    (ideally zero), represents the paired values ( for a time , and is the number
    of calibration dataset pairs (5) (6) (7) Since no restriction in the sign and
    magnitude of , , , , and were reported in the forecited studies, they were set
    to vary between − 100 and + 100 in NSGA-II. The best combination of , , , , and
    was selected based on the crowding distance. NSGA-II implementation and validation
    were coded in an R script, wrapping the R function nsga2R (Tsou 2013) into a set
    of R functions to achieve the procedure previously described. ANN architecture
    and training To train the ANNs, 25 multilayer perceptron networks were configured,
    building two hidden layers and adding 1 to 5 neurons for each layer. These architectures
    were trained 200 times, for a total of 5000. The input variables for each architecture
    corresponded to , , and tree monitoring coordinates, and the output variable corresponded
    to . All these variables were scaled between 0 and 1. The calibration dataset
    was split into 60, 70, and 75% of the data for training and the remaining percentage
    was used to select the best architecture, which accounted for the lowest RMSE
    (Eq. 5) and the highest (right side of Eq. 6). ANN implementation was conducted
    using the function neuralnet from the neuralnet R package (Fritsch et al. 2019).
    Step 2: Selecting the best model Was computed using the validation dataset and
    the calibrated the WCM and trained ANN models and was added to the validation
    dataset. Then, RMSE (Eq. 5) and (right side of Eq. 6) were computed. Two selection
    criteria were considered to select the best model: the lowest RMSE and highest
    and the simplicity by either coding its mathematical formulation or importing
    its dependent libraries to the IS-SAR project. Step 3: Interpolating soil water
    content at field capacity and permanent wilting point And permanent wilting point
    at a depth of 30 cm, and geographic coordinates were extracted from a soil survey
    study that described 300 georeferenced soil profiles in the study area (Fig. 1)
    (CVC and IGAC 2017). A geostatistical analysis was implemented to obtain the and
    maps. This analysis consisted of exploring these data to identify outliers, selecting
    the theoretical semivariogram, interpolating using ordinary kriging, and validating
    the interpolation (Oliver and Webster 2015). In addition to RMSE and , mean error
    (ME), mean absolute error (MAE), and the comparison between the average of the
    observed ( ) and predicted-by-interpolation values ( ) were used to validate the
    and interpolations. The resulting maps were computed with a pixel size of 500 × 500
    m. Step 4: Implementing IS-SAR Web application design IS-SAR is an interactive
    web map application based on Sentinel-1 images that contains navigating, locating,
    zooming in–out, and plotting controls. This application has a module displaying
    one of the three irrigation actions described in the section \"Irrigation scheduling\",
    according to the current soil water content in the target plotted by the user.
    IS-SAR was designed using Django (Python) and JavaScript web frameworks and GEE
    API repositories (back-end). HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used to design the
    front end. IS-SAR is hosted on the GitHub contribute project https://github.com/Viinky-Kevs/IS-SAR-APP.
    Once users draw the target plot in IS-SAR, the application functions call the
    framework routine developed by Mullissa et al. (2021) to obtain and from the most
    recent S1 image and compute for the target plot area using the best model selected.
    Then, is retrieved from using the calibrated linear model. IS-SAR obtains the
    and values from the closest and map pixels to the user plot centroid and compares
    them with the average in the user-drawn plot to select the irrigation action and
    compute the amount of water required to apply the irrigation. Based on the 27
    available S1 images from 14 August to 9 December 2021, the consistency of IS-SAR
    for irrigation scheduling in the study area was evaluated simulating the IS-SAR
    user executions for Laurentina, Olival, and Poncena plots. For each plot, simulations
    consisted of creating an account, loading to IS-SAR its boundary in shapefile
    format (done once), calculating the irrigation actions and the irrigation water
    depth (to actions 1 and 2), and recording these data into a database. Results
    WCM and ANN calibration and the best model selection The WCM and ANN were successfully
    calibrated using the entire monitoring tree dataset and split by tree to retrieve
    from , , and the tree coordinates (for ANN). In WCM calibration, the best solutions
    accounted for an NSGA-II convergence, , and infinitive crowding distance. After
    calibrating the WCM using the backscattering coefficient at VV and VH polarizations,
    was selected to retrieve , because the RMSE was lowest and was highest for the
    nine monitoring trees. The resulting values for the WCM parameters , , , , and
    varied from − 99.99 to 98.90. When comparing these among trees and plots, no recognizable
    pattern in the magnitude and sign of these parameters was found. Regarding ANN
    training, the error threshold and the maximum number of cycles were set to 0.02
    (in 0–1 scaled units) and 1000, respectively. Therefore, the ANN training finished
    in a reasonable time (1 h), with an acceptable prediction error, and converged
    a high percentage of the tested ANN. The ANN architecture with the lowest RMSE
    and highest in the training stage for was 5:5 (5 neurons for the two hidden layers).
    The evaluated Hass avocado plots'' soil water content at depths of 5–10 cm changed
    considerably over time (Fig. 4). varied from 0.11 m3 m−3, a value close to for
    monitoring tree O3 (Fig. 4f), to 0.49 m3 m−3, a value close to saturation for
    monitoring tree P2 (Fig. 4h). These changes were mainly produced by fallen rain
    and applied irrigation (Fig. 4c, f, and i), evapotranspiration, and sandy soils,
    which poorly retained moisture. averaged 56%, 97%, and 73% of the time above for
    Laurentina, Olival, and Poncena trees, respectively. These percentages suggest
    that fallen rain was frequent and abundant for the Olival plot and that irrigation
    was not needed, while irrigation was needed for the Laurentina and Poncena plots.
    Fig. 4 Surface soil water content retrieved from the Water Cloud Model (WCM),
    Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and their comparison with that simulated by
    Hydrus-1D for the calibration and validation periods at monitoring trees of Laurentina
    (a–c), Olival (d–f), and Poncena (g–i) Full size image varied in the monitoring
    trees at a rate from 0.02 to 0.04 m3 m−3 between consecutive estimations (Fig.
    4). Due to the low frequency of the data, the time-series presented a nonnatural
    behavior in its changes, hindering the identification of sudden increases and
    later decreases in moisture after inputs of water, as observed in the time-series
    (Fig. 4). The WCM and ANN models were consistent with the estimation in the calibration
    and validation periods, with an average absolute difference between models of
    0.02, 0.03, and 0.03 m3 m−3 for the Laurentina, Olival, and Poncena monitoring
    trees, respectively (Fig. 4), and a maximum difference of 0.05 m3 m−3 for the
    monitoring tree O3 (Fig. 4f). An increasing error in the time-series was observed
    in the monitoring trees P2 and P3 for the validation period (Fig. 4h, i, respectively),
    coinciding with a high , a consequence of the frequent rainfalls in this period.
    The error and agreement between and , calculated for the WCM and ANN models in
    the calibration and validation periods, are shown in Table 1. The WCM estimated
    with a maximum RMSE of 0.04 m3 m−3 and 0.05 m3 m−3 per-tree calibration and validation,
    respectively, representing 17% (tree O1) and 15% (tree P2) of the average . The
    value broadly varied for the WCM among trees with a maximum of 0.33 for calibration
    and reported a value of 0.01 for five trees for validation. The ANN model slightly
    improved the WCM performance, obtaining maximum RMSEs of 0.03 m3 m−3 and 0.07
    m3 m−3 for calibration and validation per tree, respectively, which represent
    18% (tree O3) and 30% (tree O1) of the average . The for ANN was consistently
    higher than that for WCM for per-tree calibration with a value higher than 0.40,
    but this decreased for validation, obtaining a maximum value of 0.44. Regarding
    the performance per plot, the RMSE average for the two models was lower in Laurentina
    for calibration and validation, compared with the RMSE average of the other plots
    (Table 1). Table 1 Root-mean-square error (RMSE) and Pearson correlation coefficient
    ( ) for the calibration and validation of the water cloud model (WCM) and artificial
    neural network (ANN) for the nine monitoring trees in the study area Full size
    table Differences of 0.02 and 0.01 were calculated by comparing the RMSE of ANN
    and the WCM for calibration and validation, respectively, suggesting a better
    performance of ANN when all-trees data were used. Moreover, the value for the
    ANN exceeded 0.37 and 0.27, which were obtained by the WCM for validation and
    calibration, respectively. Although the trained ANN model performed consistently
    better than the WCM, the WCM was selected to retrieve from S1 images due to its
    simplicity in tracking the surface soil water content for the IS-SAR web application.
    The calibration and validation of the WCM and ANN models for all trees resulted
    in a higher RMSE and higher values than those obtained per tree. However, all-tree
    optimized WCM parameters integrally represent the dynamics in the study area.
    From surface soil water content to soil water content at depths of 0–60 cm The
    linear regression model implemented to obtain from resulted in Eq. 8, with an
    RMSE of 0.05 m3 m−3, value of 0.51, and (8) Soil water content at field capacity
    and permanent wilting point maps And maps were obtained with a spatial resolution
    of 500 × 500 m by applying the geostatistical steps described in Sect.  2.5 (Fig.
    5). In the exploratory analysis, 45 outliers were removed for both variables,
    and after testing several transformation functions without improving the interpolation
    performance, and data were processed without transformation. The semivariogram
    analysis resulted in selecting the Spherical and Mattern models for and , respectively,
    with the parameters shown in Table 2. The found nugget values indicate a high
    variability among samples separated at very short distances. The and semivariogram
    ranges of 22 and 6 km imply that spatially distributed points of are autocorrelated
    at a greater distance than . The difference between the averaged observed ( )
    and interpolated ( ) values for and was 0.01 and 0.01, respectively (Table 2).

    an average value of 0.28 m3 m−3, varied from 0.10 to 0.29 m3 m−3 with an average
    value of 0.17 m3 m−3, and the total available water (i.e., ) varied from 0.03
    to 0.24 m3 m−3 (Fig. 5). The lowest values were in the northwest and southwest
    of the study area, where Laurentina and Olival''s monitoring trees were located
    (Fig. 5a). The location of the highest and lowest values coincided with that of
    . The zone with a low total available water is delimited by the range 0.030–0.094
    and is distributed in 20.2% of the study area, where the monitoring trees are
    located (Fig. 5). IS-SAR web application IS-SAR is a web application for Hass
    avocado growers in the Valle del Cauca (Colombia) that need scheduled irrigation
    in their orchards. This application, accessible from http://www.is-sar.com, accounts
    for the calibrated WCM, two layers of and at a spatial resolution of 500 × 500
    m, and a linear regression model to transform into to retrieve the soil water
    content in the target plot at the crop effective root depth of 0–60 cm using the
    most recent S1 image. To access the main IS-SAR page (Fig. 6b), users must create
    an account and log in (Fig. 6a). Then, users must locate their plot and draw it
    using the drawing polygon tool. IS-SAR computes , determine the irrigation action
    according to the position in the total available water and recommend the user
    the action to take and the water depth to apply (Fig. 6c). Fig. 6 Login page (a)

    the amount of water to be applied for the selected irrigation action (d) Full
    size image To evaluate IS-SAR, 27 simulations were conducted in the Laurentina,
    Olival, and Poncena plots on dates coinciding with the S1 revisit time (Fig. 7).
    In the simulation period, in the Laurentina plot, 397 mm of irrigation was applied,
    plus 553 mm of rainfall kept the soil water close to field capacity and below
    the irrigation triggering limit. IS-SAR recommended applying supplementary irrigation
    (action 1) of 12 mm on average for the Laurentina plot, which is equivalent to
    applying, on average, one drip irrigation of 39 L tree−1 for 1.2 h (dripper flow
    of 4 L h−1) (Fig. 7a). Fig. 7 Irrigation water depth to be applied in IS-SAR simulation
    actions on dates coinciding with the S1 revisiting time for the Laurentina (a),
    Olival (b), and Poncena (c) plots Full size image Although no irrigation was applied
    in the Olival plot and the rainfall of 464 mm was smaller than that in Laurentina,
    this plot did not reach the irrigation triggering limit (Fig. 7b). In the case
    of applying irrigation when IS-SAR indicated the need for it, each Olival plot''s
    tree should have received 91 L for 2.8 h. A water shortage at the supply source
    meant that irrigation was not applied in the Poncena plot for the simulation period.
    Then, the rainfall of 504 mm was not enough to keep the soil water content at
    field capacity, increasing to 107 L tree−1 over 3.4 h for each simulated irrigation
    event (Fig. 7c). Discussion Sentinel-1 and its implications in irrigation scheduling
    Considering the irrigation frequency in the Laurentina plot in the maximum crop
    water demand (approximately one fertigation event per week) and other Hass avocado
    orchards with similar irrigation system, climate and soil conditions (Grajales
    2017), the S1 revisiting time of 7 days (Fig. 4) is suitable to track the soil
    water content and schedule and irrigate Hass avocado crops in Colombia, avoiding
    water stress. Similar IS-SAR satellite-based applications also account for week-based
    irrigation scheduling (Montgomery et al. 2015). Access to IS-SAR on the same days
    as the S1 revisit time, i.e., based on the S1 revisiting time calendar, could
    benefit avocado growers (Hill and Allen 1996; Fessehazion et al. 2014). Water
    cloud model and artificial neural networks LAI is an essential parameter for calibrating
    the WCM, because it relates to the backscattered signal from vegetation (Prévot
    et al. 1993). In the absence of LAI field data, the ten images resulting from
    filtering by cloudy percentage (< 60%) of the Sentinel 2 (S2) GEE collection for
    the study period were insufficient to build a robust NDVI time-series and compute
    the LAI of the monitoring trees. Therefore, our model is limited, because only
    S1 images were used to calibrate the water cloud and artificial neural network
    models. This variant for the WCM calibration differs from recent studies that
    used S1 and S2 images for calibrating the WCM (Bousbih et al. 2018; Ouaadi et
    al. 2020). In addition, the RMSE of 6% (vol) found for the WCM calibration and
    validation for sandy soils in this study, which have a reduced range of total
    available water, could increase the uncertainty of water depth computed in IS-SAR.
    Despite not having LAI data in the WCM calibration, the RMSE and values found
    after comparing the WCM and ANN model with the surface soil water content modeled
    by Hydrus-1D for sandy soils were similar to those reported by Bousbih et al.
    (2018) and Ouaadi et al. (2020). However, when a robust LAI model is integrated
    into the WCM, as Han et al. (2020) reported, the RMSE and values decrease and
    increase, respectively. Thus, LAI field data are required to improve the WCM calibration,
    reduce the error, and increase the agreement with the field SSWC data. In the
    same line with that found here, similar studies in sparce density tree crops have
    shown how the vegetation influences the soil moisture retrieved by SAR images.
    Chiraz et al. (2022) and Courault et al. (2022) found that the correlation of
    soil moisture with S1 measures under the canopy are lower compared with this when
    is measured on the row space among trees and Shashikant et al. (2021) found a
    strong correlation of vegetation descriptors with the WCM. In WCM calibration,
    the accuracy of SSWC retrieved from the backscattering coefficient with VH and
    VV polarizations depends on specific characteristics of the calibration sites,
    vegetation characteristics, and the inclusion of additional parameters such as
    soil texture and roughness. Although Bousbih et al. (2017) and Hajj et al. (2017)
    reported that was more sensitive to vegetation cover, Baghdadi et al. (2017),
    in the same line as that found here for sandy soils, found that was more precise
    than . Compared with the WCM, the ANN model retrieved SSWC with a lower RMSE and
    a higher value with the calibration and validation datasets. The addition of the
    monitoring tree coordinates (in decimal degree units) as input variables in the
    ANN training phase improved the performance of the model. Similar results were
    found by adding a priori rainfall and soil moisture condition information (El
    Hajj et al. 2017; Bousbih et al. 2018). IS-SAR web application IS-SAR is a novel
    web application to track the water content in soils cropped with Hass avocado
    and schedule irrigation at the plot level. No antecedents were found in irrigation
    scheduling web applications based on SAR images. Similar scheduling irrigation
    web applications use optical images (Montgomery et al. 2015; Calera et al. 2017)
    but cannot be used in Valle del Cauca due to its cloudy conditions throughout
    the year. IS-SAR, available for Hass avocado growers in the Valle del Cauca on
    http://www.is-sar.com, could be extended to be used in other Colombian regions
    using additional calibration points. Once implemented, the potential impacts of
    IS-SAR in Hass avocado orchards include improved irrigation scheduling, reduction
    in the applied irrigation water volumes, and a good match between water supply
    and crop water demand, all of which increase the use of digital agriculture practices
    (Erazo-Mesa et al. 2022a). In 10 of the 12 months in which the WCM was calibrated
    and in the 5 months in which IS-SAR was evaluated, the ENSO climate phenomenon
    La Niña increased rainfalls and decreased the crop irrigation water demand in
    the study area. In the context of scarce rainfall and an increase in Hass avocado
    irrigation demand caused by El Niño, the S1 revisiting time of 7 days would result
    in a long irrigation schedule. Although the WCM was calibrated using field data
    from nine monitoring trees, which provided a proper generalization of the soil
    water content dynamics in the study area, it is recommended to check with a soil
    moisture probe or similar device the correspondence between the in-field soil
    water content and the outputted values by IS-SAR. Notably, the more precise the
    and maps are, the more accurate the IS-SAR irrigation estimation. Moreover, IS-SAR
    depends on the correct and continuous operation of S1 satellites. The results
    of IS-SAR simulations shown in Fig. 7 coincided with the soil water dynamics,
    applied irrigation, and climate recorded and observed in the field from 15 August
    2021 to 9 December 2021 for the Laurentina, Olival, and Poncena plots. Notably,
    the high amount of rainfall caused by La Niña and irrigation (for Laurentina)
    implied that the water irrigation depth did not accumulate, decreasing to critical
    soil water content values. Although the available water content at the three plots
    was similar, averaging 0.10 m3 m−3, the high field capacity and permanent wilting
    points in the Poncena plot soil retrieved from the corresponding maps caused this
    plot to exceed the irrigation triggering limit in all IS-SAR queries. Conclusions
    We developed a near-real-time irrigation information tool—IS-SAR—to assist Hass
    avocado growers in designing better irrigation tasks and understanding water crop
    consumption. The IS-SAR implementation allows us to conclude that the Sentinel-1
    revisiting time of 7 days is appropriate to schedule Hass avocado irrigation in
    the current climate and soils of Valle del Cauca (Colombia). The ANN model performed
    better than the WCM in estimating SSWC due to its flexibility in adding a priori
    information. In permanently cloudy conditions, such as those presented in the
    Andean mountains of Valle del Cauca, LAI field data are required to improve the
    agreement with the field SSWC data. Under extreme wet conditions such as La Niña,
    further testing and evaluation of IS-SAR are needed. We are posing IS-SAR as a
    regional application to farmers who need to schedule irrigation for orchard and
    nonorchard crops. Data availability The data presented in this study are available

    Location: Marrakech, Morocco SECTION I. Introduction The demand of food production
    and fiber increase with de world population. The irrigation management is important
    particularly in context where the fresh water resources are limited. The aim of
    the irrigation is to give to plants the adequate amount of water to ensure their
    water requirements. The use of Water Production Function (WPF) allows to estimate
    the production in terms of dry matter or marketable yield, evapotranspiration
    ore the amount of applied water during irrigation (IW). According to the different
    production functions of IW may also include different components in addition to
    Crop Water Requirement (CWR), such as pre-planting irrigation to prepare the seeding,
    leaching requirement to decrease the salinity, rise of water table by capillarity
    and rainfall. The estimation of water requirement is a stone corner which you
    can calculate the correct irrigation doses. Indeed, the water available for the
    crop is an indicator of the texture of soil, precipitations, previous irrigations,
    state of development of crop and the amount of water already present in the soil.
    Center-Pivot of irrigation are usually reserved to irrigate large areas from 3.5
    to 65 ha because of the costs; but, the nutrients, fertilizer, herbicide, insecticide
    and pesticide can be directly applied on the canopy of crop [1]. Center-Pivot
    irrigation systems require up to 40% less water application than traditional and
    conventional gravity (furrow) or surface irrigation methods, where a part of water
    is lost by percolation or runoff. But Center-pivot irrigation stays less effective
    than the drip systems that are the most economical in term of water. The main
    challenge is related to the exact estimation of both the evapotranspiration of
    the crop and how to bring the water (frequency and quantity). Traditional hand-feel
    soil measurement methods do not provide quantitative soil water and real-time
    data. The use of sensors in precision agriculture is becoming widespread, especially
    in irrigation and open the field of irrigation management in order to establish
    an optimal timing and amount of irrigation water for greatest effectiveness. Indeed,
    an optimal irrigation management avoid water deficiency and use too much water
    that reduces the potential for profitability of the crop. The supply of an optimal
    amount of water allows also to maximize the yield response to other management
    practices, optimize yield per unit of water applied, reduce the potential runoff,
    reduce soil erosion and pesticide movement into the surface and ground water [1].
    To optimize the yield and soil water in the crop, plants should not pass the wilting
    point. This means the minimum soil moisture required by a plant not to wilt. At
    this point, any decrease in soil moisture will result in wilting. When a plant
    wilts, its leaves dry out, droop, and wither. The coupling of the irrigation system
    with a soil moisture monitoring and an accurate evapotranspiration calculation
    has a significant advantage in term of water consumption. Precision agriculture
    (PA) uses the Internet of Things and allows real-time control measure and automation
    of pivot-center irrigation systems. Furthermore, Wireless Sensors Network (WSN)
    is affordable and the wide availability of Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) protocol
    such as LoRa, SigFox and Ingenu coupling with cloud IoT platforms pave the way
    of high precision and realtime irrigation management systems. In this paper, we
    combine agronomic and computer science expertise to propose a cloud IoT architecture
    and a network of sensors using LPWA to control, monitor and optimize the crop
    production at quasi real-time. The low-cost sensor network measure on one hand
    the weather data required to calculate potential evapotranspiration of the crop,
    and on other hand the soil moisture at different depths. The proposed architecture
    calculates water requirements of plants and actuate solenoids to open and close
    water individually each sprinkler. SECTION II. Literature Review The main challenges
    in the elaboration of an automated irrigation system for irrigation pivot-center
    are vital; on one hand to choose an adapted evaluation method of water requirements,
    and on other hand to identify a correct cloud IoT platform essential for data
    storage and treatment. The following paragraph focuses on these aspects and on
    reviewing existing works. A. Related Works Classical Water Production Functions
    (WPF) are useful tools for irrigation management and economic analysis of yield
    reduction due to deficit irrigation which is usually based on linear regression
    and don''t give a representation of nonlinear behaviors of complex ecological
    systems. To fix this issue recent research are investigated. We list the use of
    more robust and nonlinear techniques such as machine learning, Artificial Neural
    Network (ANN) and data-mining tools (e.g. Fortin et al in 2010 [2], Dai et al.
    in 2011 [3], Haghverdi et al. in 2014 [4] and Elnesr et al., in 2016 [5]). In
    this study we follow two different controls. The first model consists to control
    the speed of travelling of the central-pivot for a constant flow rate. The second
    uses an electronic control to adapt flow rate in the nozzles. The speed of travelling
    of the central-pivot is maintained constant. The variable rate irrigation (VRI)
    allows to save 9-19% of irrigation water and to address field-level spatio-temporal
    heterogeneity in terms of soil water holding capacity and depth of soil [6]. According
    to Pan et al in 2013 [7] VRI allows also to enhance water-use efficiency, improve
    productivity, reduce fuel consummation and reduce nutrient leaching. The choice
    of sprinkler package, the pressure of working, meteorological conditions and tower
    dynamics affect the irrigation water distribution pattern [8]. Moreover, variations
    in micro-meteorological and technical conditions can modify the water application
    depth and irrigation uniformity at different lateral positions with flow control
    nozzles or pressure regulators at each head [8]. Wind speed and direction don''t
    significantly modify the uniformity of water applicatIon but impact the absolute
    application depth of zones under VRI management [9]. To adapt flow of irrigation
    soils moisture measure must be done. Traditional soil moisture sensors need to
    be installed early in the growing season and must be removed before the harvesting.
    Dong et al in 2013 [1] has proposed a cyber-physical system based on underground
    sensors to monitor soil moisture but this approach do not monitor soil on only
    one depth [1]. The interest of the coupling of Geographic Information System (GIS)
    and Remote Sensing (RS) with Internet of Things (IoT) has been demonstrated by
    different authors such as Li et al. in 2012 [10] Ye et al. in 2013 [11] Wang et
    al., 2013 [12]. B. Estimations of Water Requirements The estimation of water requirements
    of crop (ETc) can be estimated from a simple soil water balance (SSWB) model.
    A general form of the soil water balance is done by the following equation: ETc=I+P+F+R+ΔS
    (1) View Source Where I is the irrigation dose [mm], P is the precipitation [mm],
    F is the net subsurface flow into the control volume [mm], R is net runoff or
    runon to the control volume surface [mm] and ΔS is the net change in soil water
    stored in the control volume [mm]. The potential evapotranspiration (PET) can
    be calculated by using different methods. A common one requires several weather
    data that are not all the time available. Among these methods, we mention Penman-Monteith
    [13] FAO56 PM) which ranked as the best method for estimating daily and monthly
    ET for all climates. Penman [14] (FAO24), Penman [15] (FAO-ppp-17), Kimberly-Penman
    [16], Hamon [17], Hargreaves [18], Haude [19], Penman [20], Penman-Monteith [21],
    Priestley-Taylor [22], Makkink [23], McCl [24], De Bruin-Keijman [25] (DK), Jensen-Haise
    [16], Blaney-Criddle [26] (BC), Blaney-Criddle [14] (FAO 24 BC), FAO 24 Radiation
    [14], Turc [27], Wendling [28], Valiantzas [29]. Nevertheless, modern technologies
    such as the use of Wireless Infrared Thermometers (IRT) appear to measure surface
    temperature and determine the ETc [30]. A comparison of 16 among the models mentioned
    above has been carried out by Liu et al. in 2017 [31] and have shown that FAO-ppp-17,
    Pen-63 and FAO-24 BC are the better results in semi-arid climate. Therefore, we
    notice that a poor calibration between all the aforementioned researchers lead
    to inconsistent results of existing studies on weighting lysimeter. Indeed, Jensen
    et al. report that FA024BC is better [32]. While Yoder et al. in 2005 [33] and
    Lépez-Urrea et al. in 2006 [34] find that FA056 PM is the better formula. Otherwise
    some authors such as Berengena et al. in 2005 [35], Howell et al. in 1998 [36]
    have proven that the adjustment of the Penman formula coefficients at local scale
    shows significantly performing results. To conclude, we assume that FA056 PM or
    FA024 BC can be tested as a first approach in the evaluation of the evapotranspiration
    and a precise evaluation can be obtained locally by adjusting the parameters of
    the original Penman equation. The local adjustment of coefficient of the Penman
    formula need the use of lysimeters and a long experimentation which is not always
    achievable out of research centres. The Maximal Evapotranspiration (MET) of a
    crop can be calculated at different vegetative stage when amount of water is sufficiently
    available and agronomic condition are optimal. The MET can be calculated by model
    but in real conditions, and the Real Evapotranspiration (RE) is inferior in amount
    calculated by model. By consequence, it''s important to measure accurately real
    evapotranspiration by mean of sensors to provide the necessary quantities of water
    and to avoid percolation losses related to excessive intake linked in particular
    to an overestimation of the actual evapotranspiration. C. Choice of Sensors Both
    approaches can be followed. The first one uses commercial sensing solutions which
    natively provide a wide range of features directly and allows researchers to focus
    on the developments of algorithms and meta-processing, etc. The second one uses
    open hardware solutions which are programmable and flexible allowing to developers
    to have the full control of the behaviors of the nodes [37] The first approach
    is particularly interesting to develop proof of concept but makes researchers
    dependent of one provider and the availability of sensors used for development.
    Moreover, the rapid turnover of product of high technology renders this science
    stream especially risked for long term developments. The second way although requiring
    further development is more sustainable and is generally supported by a large
    community of developers. The choice of sensors is crucial because nodes can move
    over time that causes considerable interferences in the communication between
    nodes. Moreover, the influence of temperature, humidity, rainfall, sandstorm and
    high solar radiation greatly affect the links and communication quality among
    the nodes, particularly in harsh environmental conditions. The high temperature
    encountered in semiarid environments affects significantly the received signal
    strength (RSS). The humidity linked to the irrigation system and the heavy rainfall
    intensely affects the propagation of radio waves. The choice of the wireless transceiver
    and the transmission protocol must take into account the number of nodes, the
    distances between them, the height of antenna and the operating frequency based
    on the desired size of payload [37]. D. Cloud IoT Platform The correct choice
    of the IoT Platform to build a solution can affect the overall success of the
    project [37]. Both explorable approaches acquire and manage the underlying hardware
    and software layers or use a commercial offering which provides all needed services
    to propose an integrative solution. A review proposed by Ray PP in 2016 compare
    the 26 most popular IoT cloud platforms based on the following parameters: deployment
    service, device management, system management, heterogeneity management, data
    management, tools for analysis, deployment, monitoring, visualization and research.
    According to Ray in 2016 [38], they should have at least 49 IoT cloud platforms
    present in the actual global market. Nowadays, any commercial or open source cloud
    platform allows to deploy, and hosts applications or models elaborated on different
    framework on the same cloud architecture. SECTION III. Calculation of Water Requirements
    The soil characterization has been achieved on basis of samples taken in situ
    by BNEDER (National Technical Studies Office for Rural Development) located at
    Alger (Algeria). 96 samples were taken following a systematic grid of 30 × 30
    m over the area covered by the pivot (one by layer of soil). The parameters evaluated
    were bulk density, texture and the soil water holding capacity. Then, parameters
    measured on each of the 32 sampling points for three layers of soil has been interpolated
    to obtain a high-resolution map. The software ArcMap 10.5.1 was used to interpolate
    data measured in order to generate a grid by layer of 5m × 5m (25m2 area per cell)
    for each kind of measure. Moreover, each layer of soil has also been interpolate
    using 3D spline method to obtain a 3D model of soil layer. This 3D model and the
    spatial interpolation of soil water holding capacity allows to calculate the plant
    available in function of the depth of rooting. As shown on Fig. 1. The first layer
    is a mix of one or more existing layers which have been homogenized from a textural
    point of view and the salt content by successive plowing on a height of 25 to
    30 cm. The water available for plant is also function of roots development which
    offers the possibility to explore a more and more large part of soil. The available
    water is obtained by a weighted mean of the depth of all layers explored by the
    root system at each stage of development. A day by day amount of water irrigation
    can be calculated from (1). Fig. 1 Different stages of crop development Show All
    The FAO Penman-Monteith method (2) is used to estimate the potential evapotranspiration
    (PET) and the evapo-transpiration of the crop (ETc), also named MET which takes
    into account the stage of vegetative growth of the crop by weighting the potential
    evapotranspiration by the coefficient Kc [13]. The Kc coefficient allows to modulate
    the PET in function of the crop envisaged and the stage of its stage of development.

    [mm.day−1] and Kc is a ponderation coefficient variating between 0.3 to 1.2 depending
    of the crop stage of development [8], see Fig 1. SECTION IV. Material The application
    is tested on a pivot-center irrigation and a crop of soft wheat implanted in Ain
    Salah located in the heart of the Sahara Desert region in the center of Algeria.
    This region is characterized by a hot desert climate where the temperature in
    the summer reach 47 to 50°C. The irrigation pivot-center is composed of 6 spans
    with a total length of 308m. The revolution time of the pivot is 24h, it means
    that every hour an angle of 15° is traveled. As shown in the Fig. 2, the cover
    area is increasing from the center to the outside. The sensors must stay functional
    with important temperature variation from 20 to 65 degrees and remained functional
    also in presence of rate of humidity close to 80%. Fig. 3 The proposed system
    and architecture Show All SECTION V. Proposed System and Archttecture We have
    chosen to follow the open hardware way as part of our developments. The proposed
    system is composed locally of a weather station. Several multi-depth moisture
    sensors distributed on the irrigate area at the middle on each span measure the
    amount of water at different depths and solenoid placed on sprinkler. Data are
    transmitted by LoRa modulation to a gateway which relay data to The Things Network
    using a 4G connection. A cloud architecture collects, treats and stores data received
    from the weather station and soil moisture sensor, and calculates in real-time
    needs in irrigation water. A. Weather Station The weather data are acquired by
    a micro weather station which uses a LoRa transmission system. This low-cost protocol
    has been chosen for its easiness of deployment, its ability to resist interference
    with the spread spectrum technology and the area that can be covered by a single
    gateway. The micro weather station is based on a Weather Sensor (Argent Data Systems)
    which contains an anemometer, a vane direction and a pluviometer. The weather
    station contains a temperature / humidity sensor AM2315 (Aosong) with an error
    of 0.1°C for the temperature and 2% for the relative humidity. The net solar radiation
    is measured by a digital net radiometer SN-500, Apogee Instruments. All sensors
    are connected on a LoPy which collect data and send them on LoRa / 4G gateway
    (see Fig. 3). B. Sensors and Actuators Soil moisture nodes based on LoPy using
    soil moisture underground sensors measure the rate of humidity at different soil
    depths. The humidity is measured at different depth (20, 30 and 50 cm) with Watermark
    Soil Moisture Irrometer sensor model 200SS. The measure of humidity at different
    depth allow to control if amount of water calculate are correct or if they must
    be adjusted. As show on Fig. 2, the 24 sensors are implanted in the middle of
    each ring, the water requirements are controlled 8 times per day (one just before
    the irrigation and one hour just after the irrigation) on each of the four control
    lines of sensors. Solenoid valves are implanted on the sprinkler feed pipes and
    allows them to be operated individually and thus finely control the water supply.
    The fine control of the sprinklers allows to have a same amount of water per unit
    area at each of the 6 zones traveled at the level of each of the different segments
    each hour. C. Cloud Architecture We use our own architecture based on a Cloud
    IoT platform and a share/hosting application platform. This architecture has already
    been tested with cattle behavior [39], digital phenotyping [40] and monitoring
    of bee health [41]. Time-related Data are transmitted to the Cloud IoT platform
    by LPWA network while images, videos and sound are transmitted by Wi-Fi network,
    see Fig. 3. 1) The Cloud IoT Platform The platform is composed of two parts. The
    first one is based on one hand on Apache Kafka, Apache Samza, Druid, to treat
    stream and time-related data. The second one uses an Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark
    are associate to store and treat images, sound and video. a) Time Related-Data
    Data are received by Apache Kafka which transfer them to Apache Samza to be processed
    before the ingesting by Druid. Druid is a distributed column -oriented fault-tolerant
    data store presenting real-time analytical capabilities. The data processing allows
    to increase the speed of ingestion 10 times by elimination of bad formed package,
    inconsistent and incomplete data. Redis Caching accelerate the speed of recurrent
    queries. The data are stored in units of few millions of lines named ‘segments’
    composed of 5 to 10 million of times-stamped events compressed by LZ4. Old segments
    are locally stored on HDFS. Both external dependencies are used: PostgreSQL and
    ZooKeeper to respectively store meta data and monitor the four kinds of nodes
    present in the cluster. These four types of nodes coordinate, broke, store in
    real-time or archive data in the distributed data store. b) Sound, Images and
    Video These kinds of data are independently treated and stored by a second structure
    based on Hadoop and Apache Spark. These kinds of data are also locally stored
    on HDFS. This structure offers better performance than an Hadoop, MapReduce, HiPi.
    Camera placed on the pivot center can make 3D-pictures of same plant every day
    in order to model their development and compare the impact of agricultural practices
    and weather conditions on the growth of the crop. The analysis of sound allows
    to detect any dysfunction may occur of critical parts of pivot-center and program
    a preventive maintenance (PM) to avoid the immobilization of the pivot over a
    long period. But both features are not yet implemented. 2) The Application Sharing
    and Hosting Platform Druid powers high performances application with low query
    latencies. To better exploit this performance and don''t be dependent of one SDK,
    we propose a cloud architecture able to host application developed on principal
    framework. This cloud platform authorizes elaboration of the model by researchers
    and also host endpoint applications of third party adapted to different kinds
    of material allowing to monitor and automate the pivot-center irrigation while
    optimizing crop yields. SECTION VI. Results We compare water requirements calculated
    by the cloud architecture with the one calculated by CropWat [42] decision support
    tool. This tool is developed by the Land and Water Development Division for the
    calculation of crop water requirements and irrigation requirements based on soil,
    climate and crop data. The calculation procedure is described in [8], the response
    of different yield is explained in [43] and the coupling between CropWat and climatic
    data of ClimWat is explicated step by step in [44]. Remarkably values calculated
    by CropWat assume that only water can change and other factors such as agricultural
    practices, fertilization, etc. are at optimal level. Table 1 gives results obtained
    with CropWat 8.0 for a wheat with a planting date of 25 November at In Salah,
    Algeria and total development in 180 days. Water requirements are calculated on
    basis of real daily weather data. Table I. Water requirements calculated with
    cropwat The Fig. 4 shows the comparison between measured and calculated with CropWat
    Potential Evapotranspiration (ETP). Both approach gives similar results. SECTION
    VII. Conclusion and Future Works We have outlined an architecture based on soil
    characteristics interpolate by mean of GIS, soil moisture measured, and weather
    data transmitted by LoRaWan to calculate in quasi real-time the water requirements
    of the crop. The LoRaWan is particularly adapted to transmit data in harsh conditions.
    In the end, the comparison of first approach performed with CropWat has allowed
    to calculate maximal evapotranspiration and verify that these are never exceeded.
    Fig. 4 Comparison between CropWat and measured average daily ETP Show All In order
    to validate the water requirements calculated using the CropWat model, we compared
    them with a precise model called AquaCrop [45]. This model considers more parameters
    affecting the vegetative and reproductive growth of crop. The implementation of
    3D Camera in specific areas places on the pivot, will open a new research path
    in the field of digital phenotyping. In addition to this, the continuous analysis
    of sound from microphones implemented in chosen places will quickly detect signs
    of failure and prevent downtime that can be expensive in term of crop profitability.
    As future work, we plan to exploit GPU Tegra Mobile Processors 1 that offers high
    computation power thanks to the exploitation of GPU processors in parallel [46]
    [47]. In addition to the high performance, these cards provide the possibility
    to exploit artificial intelligence algorithms for a better training and prediction
    of collected data. ACKNOWLEDGMENT We would like to thank our colleagues from Biosystems

    IEEE Conference Location: Shanghai, China SECTION I. Introduction The fourth industrial
    revolution, known as Industry 4.0, entails a capillary digital ecosystem embracing
    each single component of the factory from the field to the supervision (and beyond)levels
    [1]. The IoT is a key enabling technology for the Industry 4.0, because it can
    inherently provide communication capabilities to any device within a plant of
    interest [2]. Those devices can create a pervasive and networked environment,
    usually referred to as Cyber-Physical System (CPS), that can provide unforeseen
    services in most of the verticals known so far. Smart agriculture is a promising
    field of application of Industry 4.0 concepts [3]. In fact, the integration of
    CPS, IoT, and cloud/edge/fog computing technologies with agricultural machineries
    can foster the set up of precision agriculture systems, automated irrigation planning
    tools, optimization of plant growth process, monitoring of agricultural land,
    and management of production, which bring significant advantages with respect
    to classic crop management [4]. Potential IoT applications in Smart Agriculture
    cover a wide range of scenarios: greenhouse management through sensors, energy
    efficiency enhancement, observation of phenological phases, detection of insects
    or crop diseases, and also production chain traceability [5]. Despite the clear
    advantages that IoT brings to these environments, setting up only Decision Support
    Tools (DST)softwares is a rather limited approach to the perspectives of fully
    automation that these technologies would allow. DSTs aid in decision making by
    offering useful insights into easily consumable bites, but it is still difficult
    to analyze intangible or indefinable data and although these softwares have become
    much simpler over the years, many farmers still find it difficult to use [6].
    In order to bridge this gap, a fully automated fertilization system (namely Solarfertigation)is
    proposed hereby, along-with a thorough description of its architecture, components,
    and real use cases from the field. Solarfertigation is designed to integrate the
    decision-making process and both the fertilization and irrigation automation.
    This system is designed to be energy self-sufficient thanks to the embedded Photovoltaic
    (PV)plant. Solarfertigation unit is designed not only to provide IoT network gateway
    functionalities, but to combine all the hardware and software components needed
    to run electrical actuations, software-services and proper network connections.
    With reference to the IoT network, open standard short-range telecommunications
    technologies for added value IoT services have been implemented. In particular,
    the network is based on low power protocol architecture, able to support also
    critical applications that need deterministic (or almost deterministic)service
    provisioning. These activities are grounded in the 802.15.4 protocol stack. A
    prototype version of Solarfertigation has been also implemented and tested on
    the field: its logical and physical setup will be presented hereby along with
    a comprehensive picture of the proposed system architecture. The remainder of
    this work is organized as follows: section II provides a detailed description
    of the system architecture. Section II proposes a thorough characterization of
    both hardware and software components, with a focus on logical connections and
    real use cases. The main achievements and future work perspectives are highlighted
    in section V. SECTION II. System Overview A. Fertilization Machine Solarfertigation
    system is a combination of a fertilizer machine, PV plant and automation devices
    and software. Fertilization and irrigation subsystem is composed by the components
    used to manage fertilizer solution and the hydraulic parts made up of pipes, pump,
    solenoid valves, manifolds, taps and other accessories, to distribute the solution
    in the field. PV System is made up of several panels positioned on an appropriate
    support structure, batteries, and an inverter. The system can use both solid and
    liquid fertilizers. They are dosed respectively through cochlea and volumetric
    pump into a tank, where the solution is prepared. The machine is capable of changing
    the type and quantity of fertilizers in solution. For each irrigation cycle, the
    system can simultaneously manage multiple crops even with different growth phases
    in the same crop cycle. It also aims to detect the main environmental parameters
    defining the optimal amount of water and fertilizer to be used. Thus, it contributes
    significantly, to increased productivity of the land and electricity, water and
    fertilizers saving. B. IoT Architecture The chosen communication architecture
    (shown in Figure 1)is grounded on a static multihop IoT network that senses the
    environment and reports collected data to the cloud. The IoT network is composed
    by several nodes and a gateway. IoT devices measure soil moisture whereas the
    gateway gather the reading of devices and measures (on its own)ambient temperature
    and humidity. The gateway is a central control unit for the system, communicating
    with cloud platform in order to receive commands, store data and interact with
    User Interface (UI). Raspberry Pi single-board computer has been chosen to integrate
    gateway functionalities and software services. The hardware specification of this
    platform will be provided in following sections. Amazon Web Services (AWS)[7]
    is the cloud platform provider for the system. This technology allows to have
    a virtual computer cluster available on the Internet. In the proposed use case,
    AWS provides an ActiveMQ message-oriented middleware for Message Queue Telemetry
    Transport (MQTT)broker services. System central unit design and hardware foresee
    that it not only acts as an IoT network gateway but integrates all the hardware
    and software components able to run electrical actuations, software micro-services
    for event management, cloud connection, and database integration. We adopted Institute
    of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE)802.15.4, a standard for wireless
    communication issued by the IEEE (Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers).
    This protocol stack provides a low data rate solution with multi-month to multi-year
    battery life and very low complexity, operating in an unlicensed, international
    frequency band [8]. This standard allows for communication in a point-to-point
    or a point-to-multipoint configuration. A typical application involves a central
    coordinator with multiple remote nodes connecting back to this central host. IEEE
    802.15.4 Physical Layer (PHY)manages the signal transmission over the physical
    medium [9]. Offset-Quadrature Phase-Shift Keying (O-QPSK)modulation with a 2 Mbps
    physical data rate [8] is used and works in the 2.4 GHz Industrial, Scientific
    and Medical (ISM)band, in the range between 2.405 and 2.48 GHz. At Medium Access
    Control (MAC)layer, the IEEE 802.15.4 [10] features Time Slotted Channel Hopping
    (TSCH)[11] [12], which is characterized by two peculiarities: (i)time division
    into slots, and (ii)frequency (or channel)hopping. At the Adaptation Layer, two
    solutions are proposed: (i)6tisch Operation Sublayer (6top), also known as IPv6
    over networks of resource-constrained nodes (6lo)[13], and (ii)IPv6 over Low power
    Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN)[14]. 6top provides link states, TSCH
    configuration, control procedures and scheduling policies. 6LoWPAN is the name
    of a working group having as an objective the adaptation of IPv6 on IEEE 802.15.4-based
    networks [15] [17]. At network layer, the IPv6 over the TSCH mode of IEEE 802.15.4e
    (6TiSCH)protocol stack features Routing Protocol for Low-power and Lossy networks
    (RPL)[18] [19] as routing protocol for 6LoWPAN networks, supporting multipoint-to-point,
    point-to-multipoint or point-to-point traffic. MQTT is used as application layer
    protocol. This publish-subscribe protocol is suitable for low-bandwidth and constrained
    devices interconnection. Fig. 1: IoT architecture Show All SECTION III. System
    Components A. Hardware This section provides an overview of the hardware needed
    for both IoT devices and central unit. The Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+1 has been chosen
    as central unit. This small single-board computer (Figure 2(a))is the latest product
    in the Raspberry Pi 3 range, boasting a 64-bit quad core processor running at
    1.4GHz, dual-band 2.4GHz and 5GHz wireless LAN, Bluetooth 4.2/Bluetooth Low Energy
    (BLE), faster Ethernet and dual-band wireless LAN. Raspberry Pi provides a powerful
    feature for CPS interfacing: 40-pin General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO)pins. Any
    of the GPIO pins can be designated (in software)as an input or output pin and
    used for a wide range of purposes. The GPIO pins can be used with a variety of
    alternative functions, some are available on all pins, others on specific pins.
    In order to provide a simple weather station it has been integrated a DHT22 temperature-humidity
    sensor2. Fig. 2: Hardware equipment Show All The gateway also interacts with two
    external components: Analog-to-digital Converter (ADC); relay board. The first
    is the Adafruit MCP30083 used for retrieving data like battery status and water
    level into the main tank, providing thus useful information to manage critical
    events such as low battery level and lack of water in the tank. The relay board
    is a LOW Level 5V 8-channel relay interface board4 directly connected to the GPIO
    interface of raspberry pi, and powers on and off the specific output (water pumps,
    recycling motor and fertilizer mixers)which have separate power supply. The components
    involved for each sensor node of the IoT are: XBee-PRO S2C RF module5 DF Robot
    capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor6 Nickel-Metal Hydride (NiMH)Battery PV panel Leaving
    out of the scope power supply and recharge circuit, the Radio Frequency (RF)modules
    provided in this setup are the Digi International XBee ®S2C 802.15.4 RF Modules
    (Figure 2(b)). It can provide quick, robust communication in point-to-point, peer-to-peer,
    and multipoint/star configurations7. B. Software We based the software development
    on microservice architectural style instead of a monolithic structure. A monolithic
    application is structured with a single large code-base/repository that offer
    tens or hundreds of services using different interfaces such as HTML pages, Web
    services or/and REST services [20]. As can be seen in Figure 3, microservices
    architecture structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services,
    enabling continuous delivery/deployment of large, complex applications. Fig. 3:
    Microservices and monolithic architectures Show All Scripts running on Raspberry
    pi driving CPS compose system backend and are developed using Node.js, an open-source,
    cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code server-side.
    Frontend is deployed under Heroku Platform as a service (PaaS)provider and uses
    as data storage MongoDB, a document oriented database with JSON as data document
    format. This document store, is a computer program designed for storing, retrieving
    and managing document-oriented information, also known as semi-structured data
    [21]. The server side environment of the UI service is developed using Express
    and NodeJS. Adopted programming language for this service is Typescript, an open-source
    programming language defined as a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript (Figure
    4). C. Connections Solarfertigation current release provides the following features:
    field data gathering, storage and visualization; real-time remote activation of
    irrigation and fertilization machines; date-based event scheduling; weather station.
    Fig. 4: Javascript layers Show All Every content is delivered to UI (Figure 6)using
    MQTT protocol [22] and ActiveMQ [23] message broker deployed on AWS as Software
    as a service (SaaS)(Figure 5). Fig. 5: MQTT connections Show All MQTT is a publish/subscribe,
    extremely simple and lightweight messaging protocol, designed for constrained
    devices and low-bandwidth, high-latency or unreliable networks [24]. The design
    principles are to minimize network bandwidth and device resource requirements
    whilst also attempting to ensure reliability and some degree of assurance of delivery.
    Apache ActiveMQ is an open source message broker written in Java together with
    a full Java Message Service (JMS)client. It provides “Enterprise Features” which
    in this case means fostering the communication from more than one client or server.
    Supported clients include Java via JMS 1.1 as well as several other “cross language”
    clients. MQTT with TLS client authentication broker is hosted on AWS cloud, a
    publish/subscribe broker service that enables the sending and receiving of messages
    to and from AWS IoT. Trough MQTT messaging structure it possible to deal with
    several system management aspects: data collection and storage into MongoDB; local
    database for scheduled events; real-time power-on and off commands. Data provided
    by sensors are collected trough the IoT coordinator, processed by IoT gateway,
    sent to MQTT cloud broker and published into MongoDB. With these data, frontend
    side web and mobile graphical interfaces are built (6). On the other hand, local
    gateway listening to proper topics is able to collect messages containing informations
    about scheduled events, generating thus SQLite local database entries. A separate
    script is used to continuously read from local database changes and drive date-based
    events. Also remote actuation commands for real-time irrigation and fertilization
    devices control are sent via MQTT messages. Fig. 6: Web interface for soil moisture
    section Show All Fig. 7: System architecture Show All The system manages its functionality
    with the logical connections shown in Figure 7. (A)Mqtt broker and central unit
    exchange messages for real-time testing of electrovalves activation and events
    scheduling. MQTT message payload contains JSON data providing proper information
    fields. To prevent unpredictable behavior in case of internet connection failures,
    (B)connection represents the local storage of future events into local SQlite
    database. (C)The central unit continuously monitors events entry changes. Data
    gathered from the field sensors are stored into MongoDB Cloud Database (D). Web
    and mobile interfaces create MQTT messages (i)and read data to be displayed into
    graphs and interfaces from MongoDB online database(ii). SECTION IV. Experimental
    Setup A. Field Operation Figure 8 represents the experimental setup installed
    into a small garden. Here central unit and three remote sensor nodes are visible.
    In this setup the sensor nodes are placed at a distance of about 5 meters from
    each other due to spatial limitations. Fig. 8: Experimental setup with three IoT
    nodes Show All As shown in Figure 9(a) the central unit is connected to the irrigation
    system through three outputs for three different field zones as well as the connection
    for water supply. The PV panel continuously charges two 12V batteries that supply
    power both to the irrigation system and to the electronic components. Fig. 9:
    Central unit and IoT network coordinator Show All B. Use Cases Real-time activations
    For real-time testing purpose the systems creates MQTT messages containing information
    about the specific device to activate. The gateway listening to precise topic
    turns these information into electromechanical actuation. Event scheduling and
    management Scheduled events messages provide information about quantity and type
    of fertilizers, irrigation duration and date/time details. Also event deletion,
    modification and logging of completed/aborted events are managed trough MQTT messaging.
    With these informations the electromechanical system is set to first create the
    required fertilizer mixture and then creating the water solution irrigating thus
    the area of interest. Soil and ambient data publishing Data provided by sensors
    are collected by local gateway and published online on MongoDB as JSON objects.
    UI shows graphs and information from MongoDB. In Table I some of the differences
    for use case requirements are listed. Table I: Use cases requirements The Quality
    of Service (QoS)defines the guarantee of delivery for a specific message. There
    are three QoS levels in MQTT: at most once (0), at least once (1), exactly once
    (2). Indeed, for non-critical applications and redundant environmental data collection
    it is not necessary to ensure the highest level of service in MQTT. On one hand,
    building a local database for events storage, ensures the execution of scheduled
    irrigation and fertilization actions with no need of internet connection. On the
    other hand, NoSQL databases are more scalable and provide higher performance,
    and their data model befits the data collection use case of the proposed environment.
    SECTION V. Conclusions and Future Work Solarfertigation system is still under
    development and the work will lead to scaling up the system with particular reference
    to the number of IoT nodes, different data sources interplay, integration of weather
    notifications, agronomic model-based algorithms, and machine learning integration.
    The current architecture has already been designed to support a large number of
    IoT nodes. Indeed, IEEE 802.15.4 supports heterogeneous traffic thanks to multi-hop
    routing and different traffic patterns among the IoT nodes. Soil moisture and
    weather data interplay will be evaluated from the agronomic point of view in order
    to improve farming algorithms and crop quality. Although a weather station is
    already operating, a notification system for event management depending on weather
    forecasts is being integrated. Irrigation and fertilization events will be affected
    by environmental parameters following agronomic models for different crops and
    species in terms of nutrients and water needs, and various phenological stages.
    Some early experiments are in progress comparing well known studies such as Penman-Monteith
    [2] and Hargreaves-Samani [25]. The integration of agronomic models for different
    crops and the creation of a database including agronomic information for different
    species (nutrients, water needs, and phenological stages)is under development.
    Thanks to these first additions'' algorithms for fertilization and irrigation
    management following the proposed models will be deployed. As data collection
    increases, it will be taken into account machine learning integration aiming to
    the full automation of farming processes. We will carry on extensive experimental
    tests to validate sensor node and machineries energy consumption as well as a
    comparison about water and fertilizer demand with a standard machine. Container
    images integration will be adopted to enhance portability and sharability of the
    software. About communication technologies some experimentation and performance
    evaluations will be conducted using Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN). In particular,
    Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT)performance evaluations are already underway and will be
    carried out both in laboratory set-up and on specific test sites. The research
    activity, will then provide a vision of a 5G-IoT technologies application into
    this Smart Agriculture environment (robotics and high bandwidth applications)considering
    a performance evaluation through experimental simulation tests. Then it will investigate
    the integration of the 5G technology within the industrial developed system. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

    IEEE SECTION I. Introduction In the western US, substantial year-to-year variability
    in weather conditions complicates planning for water managers and agricultural
    producers, and makes it difficult to apply standard rule-of-thumb approaches to
    agricultural water management. In California, the recent three year drought, from
    2007–2009, underscored the vulnerability of the state''s agricultural industry
    to variability in water supply, with hundreds of millions in economic losses and
    thousands of agricultural jobs lost [1]. Concurrent with the drought, groundwater
    levels in the Central Valley declined substantially [2] as growers pumped water
    to partially offset reductions in surface water deliveries. Inter-annual variability
    in water supply is common throughout the western U.S., where growing urban populations,
    increases in water allocations for endangered species, and climate change—with
    predicted shifts in precipitation and reductions in winter snowpack in the Sierra
    and Rocky Mountains [3]–[5]— will continue to constrain water supplies for agricultural
    users. Because agriculture is typically the largest user of water in the West,
    maximizing the benefits of available agricultural water supplies is central to
    the implementation of drought mitigation and climate adaptation strategies in
    western states. Low cost adaptation strategies for agricultural water users include
    the use of irrigation scheduling technologies that incorporate information on
    weather conditions and crop growth stage. Satellite measurements of water resources
    and hydrologic fluxes have great potential for supporting agricultural producers
    and water managers working to optimize agricultural water supply and use. When
    combined with biophysical models, satellite observations can be applied to scale
    point observations from surface observation networks across larger geographic
    areas. Evapotranspiration (ET) and soil moisture data are particularly relevant
    to both operational water management and long-term planning. Surface measurements
    of these parameters are often difficult and expensive to collect, and generally
    available only from sparsely distributed observation networks. Recent advances
    in modeling and measurement of ET using satellite observations now enable moderate
    resolution (30–1000m), spatially continuous estimates of ET over large areas in
    near real-time [6]–[9]. Integration of this information into current water management
    practices and operational models, however, requires the development of frameworks
    for synthesizing data from multiple sensor networks to drive models for estimating
    evapotranspiration, soil moisture, and other key hydrologic reservoirs and fluxes.
    New approaches are also required for delivery of satellite-derived data and information
    products to water managers and agricultural producers. Table I Summary of Key
    Terms and Abbreviations One water management challenge where integration of ET
    models and sensor network observations has immediate potential utility is in supporting
    agricultural producers and water managers working to optimize irrigation management
    by accounting for current weather and crop conditions when making irrigation management
    decisions. In scheduling irrigation, growers must account for multiple factors,
    including soil type, salinity and leaching fraction, weather conditions and crop
    growth stage. In water limited regions, it is particularly important for growers
    to maximize on-farm water use efficiency by accounting for weather conditions
    in estimating crop water consumption and associated irrigation demand. A common
    method of irrigation scheduling involves estimation of crop water use by multiplying
    weather-based estimates of reference evapotranspiration ( ET o ) by crop coefficients
    ( K c ) for a particular crop. (A summary of key terms and definitions related
    to agricultural irrigation management is included in Table I.) ET o is defined
    as the evapotranspiration from a reference crop, typically a well-watered, actively
    growing grass or alfalfa of uniform height. In the western U.S., agricultural
    weather networks such as the California Irrigation Management Information System
    (CIMIS), AgriMet, and the Arizona Meteorological Network (AZMET) provide hourly
    information on weather conditions and ET o . Within California, CIMIS [10] currently
    operates 139 stations across the state and provides data to growers and irrigation
    consultants on ET o and weather conditions. Spatial CIMIS daily ET o data derived
    using the methods developed by Hart et al. [11] are available from 2003 to present
    at 2km spatial resolution statewide. The method uses cloud cover estimates derived
    from the GOES weather satellites to estimate the daily solar insolation for each
    pixel, and thus represents an initial integration of satellite and surface observations
    within CIMIS. Guideline crop coefficients have been compiled for several crops
    and are available from sources such as the Food and Agriculture Organization Irrigation
    and Drainage Paper 56, commonly known as FAO-56 [12], the University of California''s
    Basic Irrigation Scheduler, the California Department of Water Resources'' Consumptive
    Use Program, and the Wateright system developed by California State University,
    Fresno. K c is a dimensionless value representing typical crop evapotranspiration
    ( ET c ) for a given crop canopy relative to ET o , and it captures the effect
    of crop growth stage on evaporative demand. K c integrates the effects of both
    crop transpiration and soil evaporation. Many growers use a dual-crop coefficient
    approach, which separates the evaporation and transpiration components of ET.
    The basal crop coefficient ( K cb ) represents conditions for an unstressed crop
    on a dry soil surface, and a separate coefficient is used to calculate soil evaporation
    ( K e ) if required. K cb can be used to calculate basal crop ET ( ET cb ) as
    a measure of plant transpiration for a non-stressed crop plus a small diffusive
    soil evaporation component. As such, ET cb also provides a measure of potential
    crop water use, or biological water demand for well-watered crops. While useful
    for seasonal planning, one limitation of this standard approach to operational
    irrigation management is that it requires growers to derive crop coefficients
    from look-up tables and then correct them for site-specific conditions. In addition,
    many crop coefficients were developed decades ago and may not account for current
    farming practices or local and interannual variability in weather conditions and
    crop development rates. Previous research conducted in California quantified the
    observed benefits of using information on ET in irrigation scheduling. This research
    compared applied irrigation and yields reported by growers on 55 farms before
    and after use of ET o data from CIMIS. Results from the study reported an average
    increase in yields of 8%, and a reduction in total applied irrigation of 13% [13],
    [14]. While it is difficult to fully control for the effect of year-to-year variability
    in weather on crop yields in these types of studies, this result suggests that
    during key phases in crop development, some growers may be irrigating to the point
    that the root zone becomes saturated, reducing oxygen availability in the root
    zone and modestly suppressing crop growth. Across the 13 different crop types
    evaluated, including tree and vine crops, vegetable crops, and field crops, growers
    reported total economic benefits from increased yields and reductions in applied
    water ranging from 110to 1,700 per hectare. Due in part to these benefits, use
    of CIMIS data in California has grown from about 450 primary registered CIMIS
    data users in 1987, to nearly 40,000 today. In the year 2010 alone, for example,
    ∼2million reports were generated from the CIMIS database. However, the most recent
    farm and ranch irrigation survey conducted by the USDA indicated that only 12%
    of growers in California utilize reports on daily crop-water ET in scheduling
    irrigation [15], due in part to the barriers described above. Development of an
    automated system for mapping crop coefficients and delivery of data to users would
    enhance the use of ET data in irrigation management. The California Department
    of Water Resources (CDWR) identified statewide mapping of crop coefficients in
    near-real-time as one of the high priority, short term needs for CIMIS [16]. In
    addition to ET o , observations of other parameters related to agricultural water
    management are increasingly available from surface sensor networks and satellites.
    Soil moisture information is available for a limited number of sites from the
    USDA Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN). As the cost of soil moisture sensors
    has declined, an increasing number of specialty crop producers are also deploying
    soil moisture sensor networks in their operations. Satellite and aircraft remote
    sensing observations of crop canopies over agricultural regions are used by the
    USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) to map crop types and fallowed
    acreage on an annual, post-season basis, and increasingly by individual growers
    to identify and map variations in crop canopy conditions that may be indicative
    of pest infestations, variations in soil texture, or irregularities in irrigation
    systems. Seasonal estimates of evapotranspiration from satellite-driven energy
    balance models such as the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) [17]
    and the Mapping EvapoTRanspiration with Internalized Calibration (METRIC) [18]
    model have also been used by water managers for water rights accounting to resolve
    disputes over water resources [19]. Integration of these data sources into current
    management practices and operational models presents a number of challenges, especially
    for applications that require information in near real-time. In addition to typical
    issues associated with processing large volumes of data from heterogeneous sources,
    data from the Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) sensors
    onboard the Landsat satellites must be atmospherically corrected to minimize artificial
    scene-to-scene variability resulting from the effects of aerosols, ozone, and
    water vapor. A hardware failure on the Landsat 7 ETM+ instrument produces regularly
    spaced data gaps that must be addressed. Differences in the spatial scale of different
    satellite sensors must be considered when fusing data from sensors such as Landsat
    TM and ETM+ (30 m–120 m) and the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
    (MODIS) (250 m–1 km) to reduce data gaps due to clouds and improve data reliability.
    Data from surface sensor networks are valuable for calibrating and scaling satellite-driven
    models, but they must be retrieved and transformed into formats that can be ingested
    by various models. At present, a number of satellite-driven energy balance models
    (including SEBAL and METRIC) for estimation of ET also require manual intervention
    to select “cold” and “hot” anchor pixels that serve to constrain the calculation
    of ET, making it difficult to fully automate operation of these models, though
    work by Kjaersgaard et al. [20] shows progress towards resolving this problem.
    As a result of these issues, the full potential of satellite data for supporting
    water managers and agricultural producers has yet to be fully realized. The NASA
    Terrestrial Observation and Prediction System (TOPS) [21] provides a modeling
    and computing framework for integrating satellite and surface observations in
    near real-time to address many of the challenges described above. In the following
    sections, we describe an application of the TOPS framework to develop a system
    for near real-time mapping of crop canopy conditions and associated crop irrigation
    requirements at the resolution of individual fields. To support continued improvements
    in management of agricultural water supplies, the data processing system is designed
    to provide growers and water managers with frequent, accurate, and easily available
    information that includes key indicators of crop canopy development and crop water
    use requirements. SECTION II. A Framework for Satellite Irrigation Management
    Support Fig. 1. Overview of the TOPS-SIMS architecture with primary data inputs
    and outputs. Show All The TOPS Satellite Irrigation Management Support (TOPS-SIMS)
    framework integrates satellite observations from Landsat and MODIS with meteorological
    observations from CIMIS and ancillary data on crop type and site specific conditions
    (Fig. 1). The system employs a modular architecture to facilitate support for
    a wide range of models and data. The initial implementation provides a capability
    for mapping of fractional cover ( F c ) , associated basal crop coefficients (
    K cb ) , and evapotranspiration ( ET cb ) over 3.7 million ha of farmland in California''s
    Central Valley. F c and K cb are mapped every eight days, and ET cb maps are produced
    on a daily basis at spatial resolutions that are useful for irrigation management
    at the field level (30 m). Automated atmospheric correction and gap-filling algorithms
    are optimized for agricultural areas to provide a robust and reliable data stream.
    Information from TOPS-SIMS is distributed to water managers and agricultural producers
    via a browser-based irrigation management decision support system. Users may combine
    the supplied K cb or ET cb with formal or intuitive estimates of soil evaporation
    to derive total water consumption over the recent period at the field level. By
    accounting for the irrigation application rate, distribution uniformity, and any
    corrections for water replacement targets (e.g., intentional deficit irrigation
    or leaching requirement), users can translate TOPS-SIMS output into an irrigation
    management strategy. To evaluate the utility of the system for commercial farming
    operations, TOPS-SIMS estimates are compared against ET data collected by surface
    renewal stations [22] and information from wireless soil moisture sensor networks
    deployed in operational agricultural fields across California in cooperation with
    growers. The TOPS-SIMS architecture facilitates forecasting of potential consumptive
    use and associated irrigation demand with lead times of up to 1 week through integration
    of forecast data from the NOAA National Weather Service (NWS) Forecasted Reference
    Evapotranspiration system (FRET). This capability is particularly relevant for
    future extension of TOPS-SIMS to support both irrigation scheduling and water
    delivery planning. Finally, the TOPS-SIMS architecture is designed to support
    the future addition of other satellite-driven models for estimation of ET, soil
    moisture, and crop stress, all of which further the goal of improving water management
    and making irrigation scheduling more practical, convenient, and accurate. SECTION
    III. Methods TOPS, a NASA modeling and data assimilation framework developed to
    monitor and forecast environmental conditions, provides a range of capabilities
    for integrating observations from satellites and surface sensor networks via models
    including crop models, biogeochemical and carbon cycle models, ecological models,
    and numerical weather and climate models [21]. The TOPS framework has also been
    adapted to run on high-end computing resources in the NASA Advanced Supercomputing
    (NAS) facility as part of the NASA Earth Exchange (NEX) [23]. NEX combines supercomputing
    resources, Earth system modeling, remote sensing data from NASA and other agencies,
    and a scientific social networking platform to deliver a complete work environment
    in which users can analyze large Earth science data sets, run modeling codes,
    collaborate on new or existing projects, and share results within and among communities.
    NEX provides direct access to the full archive of Landsat and MODIS data for the
    western U.S., as well as on-demand access to thousands of processing cores, facilitating
    rapid processing of both historic data archives and incoming satellite data. Leveraging
    these capabilities, TOPS-SIMS ingests Landsat-5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM+ , and MODIS
    satellite imagery for California''s Central Valley and other agricultural regions.
    Landsat provides the spatial resolution necessary to produce information at the
    scale of individual fields. The daily temporal resolution of MODIS provides a
    gap-filling capability to ensure data availability. Methods employed by the remote
    sensing community for satellite mapping of ET at field scales (30 m) rely primarily
    on energy balance models, e.g., [17], [18], [24], or reflectance-based mapping
    of crop coefficients, e.g., [25]–[28]; see also review by Gowda et al. [29]. Of
    these approaches, strategies for full automation at the scale of individual fields
    have only been developed for mapping of crop coefficients from surface reflectance,
    and thus the initial suite of algorithms implemented in the TOPS-SIMS framework
    relies on this approach. In the future, it may be possible to implement additional
    models, including energy balance models and models for downscaling of soil moisture
    estimates from satellite missions such as the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP)
    mission. Each Landsat scene is atmospherically corrected using software developed
    under the Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) project
    [30]. LEDAPS incorporates the 6S atmospheric radiative transfer modeling approach
    of Vermote et al. [31], as included in the standard MODIS data processing chain.
    Landsat TM and ETM+ data are tiled onto a common grid to form an 8-day composite.
    This facilitates use of overlapping portions of each scene to increase the frequency
    of observations and reduce data gaps due to cloud cover. This compositing approach
    also reduces the effects of the ETM+ scan line correction error, as only the central
    portion of the Landsat 7 scenes are used, where the gaps are narrower. The next
    step is to calculate the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) [32] from
    the composited Landsat scenes. NDVI is an index calculated from the red and near
    infrared wavelengths and provides a measure of photosynthetic capacity. At this
    stage, a suite of gap-filling algorithms are employed to ensure spatially continuous
    data over agricultural regions. Current algorithms include the use of moving window
    averages and linear interpolation to fill small data gaps over agricultural fields.
    Field boundaries available from many of the County Agricultural Commissioners''
    offices in California facilitate identification of MODIS 250 m NDVI pixels that
    are fully contained within agricultural field boundaries, and thus enable use
    of MODIS data to fill the majority of the remaining data gaps with reasonable
    accuracy. Use of the STAR-FM algorithm [33], as implemented within TOPS, can be
    employed to address any remaining gaps through fusion of Landsat and MODIS by
    disaggregating MODIS data to the Landsat scale. Prior to further processing, non-agricultural
    areas are masked out using the USDA NASS Cropland Data Layer (CDL)1 [34] and field
    polygons from local County Agricultural Commissioner offices, when available.
    The CDL is also used to spatially differentiate annual crops from perennial orchards
    and vineyards. Following the compositing and gap-filling procedures, NDVI data
    are transformed to F c via empirical relationships developed by USDA and NASA.
    Johnson and Trout [35] and Trout et al. [36] collected field measurements of F
    c across multiple crop types in the Central Valley. These data were compared with
    satellite observations collected on the same day, and revealed a robust relationship
    between NDVI and F c (Fig. 2(a)). This approach is consistent with previous studies
    showing that various spectral vegetation indices, calculated from visible and
    near-infrared (NIR) reflectance data, are linearly related to canopy light interception
    [37]–[39]. To convert F c to K cb , TOPS-SIMS uses different approaches for retrospective
    versus near real-time mapping of K cb . For retrospective mapping of annual crops
    or for fields where information on the current crop type is available from the
    grower, F c is converted to K cb based on a physical description of the crop canopy
    [40]. A density coefficient ( K d ) , based on F c and estimated plant height,
    is calculated first to link increases in the crop coefficient with increasing
    vegetation amount. K d is then used to interpolate between the minimum and maximum
    K cb for a given crop type, as listed in FAO-56. Using methods described by Fig.
    2. Past studies conducted by USDA in collaboration with NASA [35], [36] provide
    the basis for linking NDVI to fractional cover using relationships that are robust
    across different crop types and canopy architectures ( R 2 =0.97) (a). In (b),
    use of a generalized equation (after methods of Allen and Pereira [40]) for converting
    fractional cover to FAO crop coefficients provides a robust approach for mapping
    K cb values for annual crops ( R 2 =0.90) . When the crop type at a particular
    location is specified or can be identified with confidence, crop specific equations
    may also be applied. Show All Allen and Pereira [40], a crop specific F c − K
    cb conversion can be applied retrospectively to a given field based on the CDL
    crop classification or information provided by the grower or farm manager. The
    CDL is not publicly available until after December 31 of each year, however, presenting
    a challenge for near real-time mapping of K cb using this approach. While the
    crop type for perennial fields (vineyards, orchards) can be reasonably determined
    from prior-year maps, the spatial distribution of annuals, such as lettuce, tomato,
    or cotton, is generally unknown within-season due to the complex and diverse nature
    of the agricultural cropping patterns throughout much of California. A generalized
    F c − K cb relationship representing a best-fit to crop specific relationships
    (Fig. 2(b)) is thus applied for near real-time mapping of fields deemed by CDL
    to contain annual crops. Use of this approach introduces K cb mean estimation
    uncertainty ranging from 3–14% across the major crop categories (vegetables, roots/tubers,
    legumes, fibers, oils, cereals). For perennial crops, results from multi-year
    studies recently performed on large weighing lysimeters at the University of California
    Kearney Agricultural Center are used for F c − K cb conversion [41], [42]. Both
    studies reported a strong relationship between mid-day canopy light interception,
    which is closely related to F c , and the crop coefficient. Finally, ET cb for
    both annuals and perennials is calculated as the product of K cb and ET o . For
    California, ET o is retrieved by TOPS-SIMS via FTP (file transfer protocol) from
    the standard Spatial CIMIS 2 km daily statewide ET o grids. Fig. 3. Examples of
    comparisons between profiles from TOPS-SIMS using generalized (solid blue line)
    and crop-specific (dashed blue line) relationships versus FAO-56 [12] (solid green
    line) for various crops during 2011. The comparisons highlight the ability of
    TOPS-SIMS to modify the idealized FAO-56 for observed crop cover and phenology
    as related to site-specific management practices and local weather conditions.
    Show All TOPS-SIMS simplifies the process of deriving crop coefficients for estimating
    ET cb using an automated data integration and processing system, fully independent
    of contemporaneous crop type classification, and provides a framework for assimilating
    other sensor network observations and models to provide information on crop canopy
    conditions and ET. Crop coefficient values from the fully automated TOPS-SIMS
    compare well with crop coefficients derived from FAO-56 planning guidelines during
    initial growth and at near full cover, but can deviate during vegetative growth
    and maturation. Comparisons for individual fields highlight differences due to
    agronomic practices and crop response to site-specific weather conditions (Fig.
    3). For example, the seasonal profiles for tomatoes and cotton closely match the
    FAO-56 profiles when using a crop-specific formula to convert F c to K cb , while
    lettuce and watermelon were better characterized by the generalized F c − K cb
    conversion. Corn and wheat observations reveal different development rates and
    overall phenological progression than those of FAO. Johnson and Melton [43] also
    compared TOPS-SIMS ET cb estimates against ET c values from SEBAL, which employs
    a more complex energy-balance approach. SEBAL has been widely used to model ET
    over agricultural regions, but requires a highly trained analyst to manually perform
    the required calibrations and operate the model. TOPS-SIMS ET cb values compared
    favorably with SEBAL ET a estimates for unstressed crops for representative San
    Joaquin Valley crop types, with mean differences ranging from 0.4 to 0.85 mm/day
    (Fig. 4). SECTION IV. Integrating Satellite and Surface Sensor Networks With ET
    Models Automated integration of satellite observations of crop canopy development
    with surface observations of ET o is an important first step in developing a fully
    integrated sensor network or “system of systems” capable of providing estimates
    of ET and soil moisture derived from multiple data sources to water managers and
    agricultural producers. Integration of soil moisture observations from soil moisture
    sensor networks installed in agricultural fields is an important additional advance,
    as soil moisture observations can provide operational users with an independent
    check on a water balance derived from satellite ET cb estimates and field-specific
    irrigation and weather records. Integration of soil moisture data also provides
    a mechanism for future automation of model calibration to account for intentional
    deficit irrigation by the grower. It is cost prohibitive to collect soil moisture
    observations across an entire field, but selective use of soil moisture sensors
    can increase confidence in satellite-derived estimates and facilitate use of satellite
    data to scale information derived from soil moisture observations over larger
    areas. Fig. 4. Comparison of daily water use estimates (mm) for unstressed San
    Joaquin Valley fields generated by two satellite-driven models (from Johnson and
    Melton [43]). Actual evapotranspiration ( ET a ) generated using the SEBAL surface
    energy balance approach. Basal evapotranspiration ( ET cb ) generated by TOPS-SIMS.
    Mean absolute error (MAE) in mm/day was calculated as a measure of model agreement,
    as shown. All dates 2009. Show All The cost of soil moisture sensors and wireless
    data loggers has declined substantially over the past decade, and there are now
    a number of commercially available options for growers interested in deploying
    soil moisture sensor networks. In addition, new cost effective techniques have
    been developed for measuring actual ET ( ET a ) in agricultural environments characterized
    by fields on the order of 10–40 hectares. While techniques such as the surface
    renewal approach [22] are still too expensive and complex for use by commercial
    farms growing specialty crops, field instrumentation has now become more cost
    effective, such that multiple sites can be monitored by water management agencies
    or small research teams providing important reference and validation data. To
    assist in understanding relationships between satellite estimates of ET cb and
    surface observations of ET a and soil moisture, we deployed soil moisture sensor
    webs on 12 commercial farms in the Central and Salinas Valleys, in research fields
    located at California State University Fresno in Fresno, CA, and at the University
    of California West Side Research and Extension Center in Five Points, CA. Sensors
    deployed included capacitance probes for volumentric soil water content measurement,
    soil water potential sensors, passive capillary lysimeters for measuring deep
    drainage, in-line flow meters for measuring total applied irrigation, aboveground
    pheno-cams (which record digital images of the field once per day), and meteorological
    stations. In collaboration with CDWR, we also deployed and operated above-ground
    surface renewal stations at seven sites in a range of crops to provide measurements
    of each component of the surface energy balance, facilitating calculation of ET
    a for each site. In surface renewal analysis, ET is calculated as the residual
    of a surface energy balance equation using measured net radiation, ground heat
    flux, and high-frequency measurements of air temperature [22]. These temperature
    traces exhibit low-frequency ramp-like structures which are used to calculate
    sensible heat flux. Surface renewal makes no assumptions regarding atmospheric
    stability, and is here combined with sonic anemometer data to account for unequal
    heating of air parcels across heterogeneous landscapes [44]. Integration of data
    from these sources has clear value for understanding spatial and temporal patterns
    in ET and soil moisture. Integration of satellite derived ET cb data with observations
    of volumetric soil water content and soil water potential has particular value
    for optimization of irrigation scheduling. Fig. 5(a) provides an example for a
    sub-surface drip irrigated cotton field located near Huron, CA. The satellite
    data provides information on the day-to-day crop water use under well-watered
    conditions, while the soil moisture sensors assist in identifying the onset of
    water stress and magnitude of deficit irrigation. The net water balance, or change
    in total estimated soil water content ( SWC e ) , is calculated as: Δ SWC e =P+I−D−
    ET cb View Source Fig. 5. To illustrate the benefits of integrating satellite
    estimates of ET cb with soil moisture measurements from surface sensor networks,
    measures of ET and soil moisture from different sources are plotted for a cotton
    field near Five Points, CA. Cumulative TOPS-SIMS ET cb (green line), combined
    total irrigation and precipitation (light-blue dashed line), net water balance
    (dark-blue dotted line), and observed volumetric soil water content (VWC, brown
    line) are plotted together in (a). On June 8, daily ET cb begins to exceed daily
    precipitation and applied irrigation as indicated by the negative slope of the
    net water balance line. By July 4 the cumulative water balance turns negative
    (indicating potential onset of plant water stress), and deficit irrigation is
    sustained through August. In (b), incorporation of a crop stress coefficient (
    K s ) of 0.85 to account for soil water limitations on plant transpiration from
    July 4 onward (solid green line) substantially improves agreement between ET cb
    estimates from TOPS-SIMS (dashed green line) and ET a measurements from a surface
    renewal station located in the field (solid dark-blue line). Show All where P
    is precipitation in mm measured by the on-site weather station; I is irrigation
    in mm, calculated as the average flow measured in two drip laterals and divided
    by effective irrigated area; D is drainage below the rooting zone measured with
    a Gee capillary lysimeter installed at a depth just below the rooting zone (120
    cm); and ET cb is the basal crop ET in mm. The daily measured volumetric soil
    water content (VWC) is calculated as the average of the volumetric water content
    measured using capacitance probes (Decagon 10 HS) installed at three depths (0–10
    cm, 35–45 cm, and 70–80 cm) at each of eight locations throughout the field. ET
    a is the measured ET from the surface renewal station located in the center of
    the field. As shown in Fig. 5(b), ET a and ET cb agree well during the early stages
    of crop development when the crop is well-watered. After June 8, 2011, daily ET
    cb exceeds total applied irrigation and after July 4, the cumulative water balance
    turns negative. This is reflected in the observed VWC which declines from June
    8 onwards. The sustained negative net water balance also reflects intentional
    deficit irrigation by the grower, and this deficit is captured by the difference
    between the surface renewal ET a measurements and the satellite-based ET cb estimates.
    Plants respond to water stress by reducing transpiration, and under the FAO-56
    approach, a crop water stress coefficient ( K s ) based on soil water content
    is used to account for this reduced transpiration in calculating ET c [12]. The
    addition of a K s coefficient of 0.85 to account for the deficit irrigation results
    in close agreement between the satellite-derived and surface renewal ET a estimates
    (Fig. 5(b)). This example illustrates the potential benefits of using surface
    observations of soil water content or soil water potential measurements in coordination
    with estimates of ET cb that integrate satellite and surface observations. The
    satellite-derived information can assist with tracking the daily irrigation demand,
    while soil moisture sensor networks provide an important check to ensure that
    the timing and magnitude of irrigation deficits are in-line with targets set by
    the grower. SECTION V. Data Distribution via Web Interface and Web Services While
    TOPS-SIMS simplifies the process of integrating satellite and surface observations
    to map K cb and ET cb values, distribution of data and information via intuitive,
    easy to use interfaces is critical to facilitating use of the information by water
    managers and agricultural producers who may not be familiar with the specialized
    data formats used by the remote sensing science community. A web-based user interface
    providing access to visualizations of TOPS-SIMS information eliminates the barriers
    to data access, as only a web browser is needed to view and query the information,
    and no knowledge of specialized data formats is necessary. The TOPS-SIMS web-based
    front-end relies on an open-source software stack that utilizes the Open Layers
    JavaScript library to display maps and execute queries on map data from within
    web browsers (Fig. 6(a)). To facilitate geographic searches by users and provide
    a spatial context for the TOPS-SIMS information products, the interface combines
    TOPS-SIMS overlays with a selection of open-source and commercial base map layers,
    including maps of streets, land use, and aerial imagery. NDVI, F c , and K cb
    overlays are updated on nominal 8-day intervals; ET cb is updated daily. In addition
    to providing views of TOPS-SIMS data at the native 30 m resolution, the web interface
    also allows users to retrieve quantitative information from any variable by specifying
    a point or polygon and requesting the most current values or a time-series summary
    (Fig. 6(b)). Fig. 6. The TOPS-SIMS web interface provides capabilities for visualization
    and data access, including support for geographic queries and selection of data
    for visualization by date. The map in (a) shows ET cb (mm/day) for 3.7 million
    hectares of farmland in the Central and Coastal Valleys on 02-Aug-2011. Retrospective
    time-series for TOPS-SIMS output can be generated, as shown by the K cb graph
    for 2011 for a location near Huron, CA (b). Time-series data can be downloaded
    from the interface in CSV format directly into a spreadsheet for further analysis.
    Show All The TOPS-SIMS web interface relies on data services provided by an open-source
    software stack running a Python-based web server. Tools from the Geographic Data
    Abstraction Library (GDAL) generate the tiles used in the web maps. The server
    responds to map queries by retrieving data resting on an OPeNDAP web service (Open-source
    Project for a Network Data Access Protocol; http://opendap.org) and generates
    time-series charts from the resulting data using the Matplotlib graphics library.
    OPeNDAP is a software framework that facilitates remote access to local data regardless
    of local storage format, and thus simplifies the process of making scientific
    data sets available for other applications via web services. A working beta-version
    of the interface and associated web data services are available at http://ecocast.arc.nasa.gov/sims/,
    and are currently being evaluated by commercial growers, irrigation consultants,
    and water managers in California through a series of ongoing pilot studies. SECTION
    VI. Extending the TOPS-SIMS Framework The current TOPS-SIMS K cb and ET cb mapping
    capabilities demonstrate the potential utility of a modeling framework to integrate
    observations from satellite and surface sensor networks to provide new data and
    information services to the agricultural and water resource management user community.
    However, the TOPS-SIMS modular architecture also allows for a number of extensions
    that can be rapidly implemented to expand the data and information services. Key
    short term objectives include: i)linking TOPS-SIMS to ET o forecasts to provide
    forecasts of irrigation demand at various lead times; ii) use of web services
    and a model web approach [45] to integrate TOPS-SIMS outputs with operational
    and planning models utilized by water managers; iii) incorporation of site specific
    information provided by growers to include generation of customized reports; iv)
    expansion of inputs to include observations from a constellation of moderate resolution
    satellite sensors to increase observation frequency and improve the reliability
    and accuracy of data and information products from TOPS-SIMS; and v) incorporation
    of additional publicly available models for estimation of ET, including satellite-driven
    energy balance models for estimation of ET. At present, managers of agricultural
    water supplies generally rely on historic climate data and static estimates of
    irrigation demand when making decisions about the volume of water to release from
    reservoirs. For agricultural water delivery systems such as the Central Valley
    Project (CVP) and the California State Water Project (SWP), which together provide
    water for 3.75 million acres of California farmland, water managers must rely
    on this historical data to time water releases up to a week or more in advance
    to meet the needs of growers. While water managers must also consider a range
    of other factors, including environmental constraints and hydropower production,
    new sources of data on forecasted irrigation demand could support improvements
    in the ability to anticipate periods of particularly high demand in response to
    high temperatures or sustained winds, while conserving water during cooler periods
    with lower irrigation demand. The recent development of two experimental ET o
    forecasting systems provides the possibility of using forecasts of short-term
    water consumption in place of estimates derived from historic climate data and
    maps of cropping patterns. The NOAA National Weather Service (NWS) Forecasted
    Reference ET (FRET) system2 forecasts ET o with a lead time of up to seven days.
    The FRET forecasts for California are driven by outputs from the Weather Research
    and Forecasting model (WRF) [46], and utilize WRF forecast fields to parameterize
    the Penman-Monteith equation for ET o as adopted by the Environmental Water Resources
    Institute, American Society of Civil Engineers [47]. Experimental 8-day forecasts
    and seasonal ET o outlooks are also being developed by the National Center for
    Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and the Bureau of Reclamation, and employ statistical
    forecasting methods to provide probabilistic ET o outlooks3. Data from the NOAA
    NWS FRET system are already being ingested by TOPS-SIMS via a web service, and
    can be directly integrated with K cb maps to provide estimates of weekly irrigation
    demand over California at the scale of individual fields. Pending the outcome
    of ongoing analyses to identify biases and quantify uncertainty in these forecasts
    relative to observed ET o values from CIMIS, data from these forecast systems
    will be applied to produce and distribute ET cb forecasts to agricultural producers
    and water managers to assist in quantification of local, regional, and statewide
    crop water consumption and irrigation demand. Improved data on current and forecasted
    irrigation demand that incorporates satellite observations of crop conditions
    can also be incorporated into operational models utilized by the CDWR such as
    CALSIM [48], and planning models such as Cal-SIMETAW [49], [50]. Incorporating
    recent historic data into these models has potential utility for evaluating past
    decisions on water releases, identifying opportunities for future improvement
    in delivery of water to growers, and developing strategies for implementation
    of water markets during drought years. In cases where forecasted demand is significantly
    higher or lower than historic demand for a given period, water operations managers
    could adjust management practices and improve their ability to deliver water to
    growers when and where it is most needed. Satellite derived K cb and ET cb maps
    are also potentially valuable as inputs into longer term planning models, and
    the development of a 10+ year record of observed crop canopy conditions and K
    cb values could lead to improvements in models used for long term planning, such
    as Cal-SIMETAW. Because TOPS-SIMS is implemented on NEX and data products are
    already distributed via an OPeNDAP web service, integration with other models
    is straight-forward, as data can be requested via existing web services, and data
    not already available in the NEX archive can be rapidly generated by TOPS-SIMS.
    Incorporation of site-specific information from growers can assist in eliminating
    sources of uncertainty in estimating ET associated with crop type, the timing
    and amount of irrigation applied, and the irrigation system configuration. Research
    is ongoing to extend the TOPS-SIMS framework to allow growers to specify this
    information for individual fields, facilitating use of crop-specific relationships
    for mapping K cb from satellite data, and allowing growers to specify correction
    factors to account for intentional deficit irrigation or a leaching fraction.
    Grower information on precedent irrigation schedule and irrigation system type
    would allow estimation of soil evaporation and conversion of ET cb to ET c . Allowing
    growers to input information on irrigation system type and application rates would
    also allow TOPS-SIMS to translate ET cb into recommended irrigation system run
    times. TOPS-SIMS algorithms for deriving K cb from NDVI currently rely on data
    from the Landsat TM, Landsat ETM+ , and MODIS satellite sensors, but NDVI can
    also be derived from observations from multiple other satellite sensors currently
    collecting data in the red and near-infrared wavelengths at resolutions from 20
    m to 60 m. Data from the SPOT-5 satellite instruments, the Indian Resource Satellite
    Advanced Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS), and the upcoming Landsat Data Continuity Mission
    (LDCM) and Sentinel-2 satellite mission offer the potential for integration of
    observations into a “system of systems” to provide field-scale observations of
    crop canopy development multiple times per week, reducing data latency and data
    gaps resulting from cloud cover. While issues associated with inter-sensor calibrations
    must be fully resolved [51] and open data policies have not yet been finalized
    for all of these missions, TOPS-SIMS provides a framework for ingesting and compositing
    data from a constellation of moderate resolution (30–250 m) sensors to provide
    robust and reliable data and information services to agricultural producers and
    water managers. Finally, TOPS-SIMS is designed to support multiple models for
    estimation of ET from satellite observations, including energy balance models
    that incorporate information from the thermal bands on Earth observation satellites.
    The initial suite of algorithms implemented within TOPS-SIMS relies on the use
    of spectral information in the visible and near-infrared wavelengths to map F
    c and K cb values since this approach can be fully automated. As research progresses
    on automation of the internal calibration procedures for energy balance models
    [20], TOPS-SIMS is designed to support integration of these models, and to facilitate
    use of a suite of publicly-available models to provide a robust capability for
    automated, frequent, field-scale mapping of ET over regions the size of the western
    U.S. SECTION VII. Summary TOPS-SIMS employs a “system of systems” approach and
    applies the TOPS modeling framework to ingest observations from satellite and
    surface sensor networks to provide new data and information products to agricultural
    producers and water managers via easily accessible web interfaces and web services.
    The current framework supports near real-time mapping of indicators of crop canopy
    development and crop water consumption at field scales over 3.7 million ha of
    California farmland. Integration of satellite-derived estimates of basal crop
    evapotranspiration with observations of soil moisture from surface sensor networks
    offers promise for supporting agricultural producers and water managers working
    to optimize management of agricultural water resources. Use of the NEX computing
    architecture enables rapid processing of large volumes of satellite data and facilitates
    implementation of TOPS-SIMS over regions potentially as large as the western U.S.
    TOPS-SIMS is designed to integrate additional models and data services to support
    forecasting of crop irrigation requirements at weekly to seasonal lead times,
    and concurrent modeling of potential and actual crop evapotranspiration. Future
    integration of observations from a constellation of moderate resolution satellites
    would support further improvements in the frequency and long-term operational
    reliability of satellite-derived estimates of evapotranspiration and crop water
    requirements. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT The energy-balance comparison data were generated

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Vienna, Austria SECTION I. Introduction The
    smart grid, as a cyber-physical critical infrastructures boasts higher reliability.
    efficiency and consumer-centricity in an environ-ment of increasing power demand
    through the effective use of information-namely information about the right thing,
    to the right party, at the right time. The Inter-communicating devices such as
    Phasor Measurement Units (PMU s) and smart meters, have opened exciting opportunities
    [1], in which the acquisition transmission and consumption of high-granularity
    real-time power system data is facilitated through the integration of communications
    computing and advanced control technologies. Such dependence on information technology
    naturally raises questions as to the effects of cyber attacks on power system
    operation [2]–[4]. Furthermore the massive amounts of real-time power system data
    have brought transformative potential and transformative challenges for securing
    the smart grid system [5]. [6]. The attacks targeting availability, integrity
    and confidentiality are identified as the major security issues for monitoring
    and control systems for smart grids [7]–[9]. This paper focuses on one typical
    data integrity attack, false data injection attack. Recent work focused on false
    data injection attacks has demonstrated how an opponent can bias power system
    measurements and overcome residual-based bad data detection approaches [10]. Subsequent
    research has focused on identifying such attacks [11]–[16] and has largely taken
    an information perspective. A detection strategy was proposed in [11] by protecting
    a strategically selected set of sensor measurements and by independently verifying
    the values of a strategically selected set of state variables. [12] introduced
    algorithms that obtains efficient protection and partial protection given a limited
    budget. In [13]. the authors presented the least-effort attack model and formulated
    the attacking strategy that selects a set of meters to manipulate so as to cause
    the maximum damage. The authors also proposed a protection-basea defense scheme
    and a detection-based defense scheme. In [14]. the authors formulated the false
    data detection problem as the matrix separation problem and proposed two protection
    methods, the nuclear norm minimization method and low rank matrix factorization
    method. The authors in [15] proposed two distributed detection algorithms based
    on observable islands theory. In [16]. the equivalent measurement transformation
    and the largest weighted residual method were integrated for detecting the false
    data injection attacks. These techniques were developed based on the assumption
    of stable power systems with fixed topology. Therefore. these methods cannot be
    directly used for detecting the attacks in the large-scale emerging energy systems
    with time-varying topologies. The real-time data from PMUs and smart meters facilitate
    the real-time security assessment of large-scale emerging energy systems. However
    the tremendous amount of data demands the appropriate data analysis and control
    techniques. Recently an unsupervised feature learning technique Deep Be-lief Network
    (DBN). was proposed to build and learn the hier-archical representations from
    the real-time data and capture the higher-order statistical structure of the input
    domain [17]. By doing this. DBNs provide a computationally efficient way to remove
    the manual step and automatically learn features during the training process.
    By realizing automatic feature extraction. DBNs are able to achieve higher efficiency
    and accuracy in recognizing complex pattern compared with the conventional Artificial
    Neural Network (ANN) techniques [18]–[23]. While the DBN has shown promise for
    modeling static data in various applications it met challenges in analyzing the
    time-series data and capturing the complex temporal dynamics. In [24]. an extension
    version of DBN. called Conditional DBN (CDBN). was presented to model temporal
    data by treating the previously observed data as additional input and implementing
    autoregressive (AR) data modeling scheme. In this work. we adopt the CDBN-based
    techniques to analyze the sequential PMU data in real time and detect the existence
    of information corruption. In this paper, we study the data integrity issues for
    transient stability of WAMSs and develop a CDBN-based cyber-physical strategy
    with distributed control using real-time data from geographi-cally distributed
    PMU s. The proposed strategy leverages the physical coherence to exploit the hidden
    correlation between the real-time data flows and identify the critical data which
    are vulnerable to malicious attack. Based on the hidden correlation the strategy
    applies the CDBN-based approach to predict the expected features of the critical
    data. which are used to evaluate the trustworthiness of the critical data. In
    the next section we present the problem framework. Section III details the proposed
    attack-mitigation model. Section IV introduces the proposed deep learning-based
    cyber-physical strategy. Simulation results and final remarks are presented in
    Sections V and VI, respectively. SECTION II. Problemsetting The work in this paper
    is built on a two-tier hierarchical cyber-physical multi-agent control framework
    for modeling the transient stability problem of a wide-area power system, which
    was developed in the previous work [25]. The hierarchical framework consists of
    clusters of agents. Each agent consists of: (1) a dynamic node representing a
    power system generator, (2) a PMU that acquires real-time information including
    the rotor angle ( θ i ) and frequency of the associated generator ( ω i ) , (3)
    a local cyber-controller that employs PMU data from select generators to compute
    a control signal that is applied to the local generator of the same agent. In
    the face of a cyber or physical disturbance the agents with the generators exhibit
    high physical coherence form a state-dependent cluster. In [26], a real-time data-driven
    scheme was proposed for identifying the physical coherence between synchronous
    generators. As such, a cluster con-sists of generator agents with high physical
    coherence, a phasor data concentrator (PDC) that represents a PMU communications
    gateway, and a fast-acting energy storage employed by local controllers for system
    stabilization through power injection/absorption at generator buses. The agent
    with the highest inertia generator in a cluster is termed the lead agent while
    the others are referred to as secondary. In the hierarchical framework, the high
    physical coherence between the agents belonging to the same cluster enables to
    only acquire the PMU measurements provided by the lead agents for ensuring transient
    system stabilization in the face of a disturbance. SECTION III. Attack-Mitigation
    Model According to the hierarchical cyber-physical control framework, the real-time
    measurements provided by the PMUs of the lead agents are identified as critical
    data and detection of possible data integrity attacks on lead PMU data and subsequent
    real-time estimation are necessary for transient stability maintenance. In order
    to address this problem, we specify the following threat model for the attackers:
    The attacker has knowledge of the power system topology and initial state of the
    system prior to attack. The attacker is capable of corrupting up to ⌊ 1 2 N k
    ⌋ PMU measurements, where [.] denotes the floor function. The attacker cannot
    compromise the Phaser Data Concentrator (PDC). Assumption 1 credits the attacker
    with power system topology information that maybe gleaned through eavesdropping
    of local communications [27], [28]. Assumption 2 is consistent with the fact that
    the attacker attempts to carry out the attack with the limited cost [27], [29].
    Furthermore, the corruption can be completed through biasing PMU readings or equivalently
    replacing true values with fabricated quantities. Assumption 3 requires the PDC
    has efficient attack detection and defense mechanisms [30]. SECTION IV. Deep Learning-Based
    Cyber-Physical Strategy The high physical coherence between the agents within
    a cluster insinuates the large correlation between the PMU measurements from the
    secondary agents and the one from their associated lead agent. Therefore, it is
    reasonable to estimate the PMU measurement of the ith secondary agent, ( θ i (t),
    ω i (t)) , as a “noisy” version of that of its Lead Agent k , which is formulated
    as follows: { ω ^ i (t)= ω k (t)+ ϵ i , θ i ^ (t)= θ k (t)+△ θ ik +ξi, (1) View
    Source where △ θ ik denotes the phase angle difference between the ith and kth
    agents in the static (pre-fault) state, and ∈i∼N(θ,μ) and ξ i ∼N(θ,σ) are zero-rnean
    Gaussian random variables with μ≪1 and σ≪1 . Based on Eq. (1), the PMU data from
    the lead agents can be vali-.ate. using the PMU data from the secondary agents.
    As illustrated in Fig. 1, the PDC works as an aggregator in the intra-cluster
    LAN to verify the trustworthiness of the lead agent''s PMU data and if needed,
    estimate the true value via communicating with secondary agent''s PMU s. The PDC
    probes the PMU data from all of the N k Secondary agents at a veridcation rate,
    v for learning the features of the PMU data of the cluster of agents and thus
    predicting the behavior pattern of the associated lead agent. The PDC also probes
    the lead agent''s data at the same rate for veridcation. A key step in pattern
    recognition is to select a proper set of features with which the input data will
    be presented. In this work, the features are. defined. as the rotor angles and
    speeds at the current time step and the changes of the speeds between the current
    and previous time step. With the feature selection, at a rate of v Hz, the PDC
    forms unlabeled three-dimensional training data x i t ={ θ i (t), ω i (t), δ i
    (t)} , where δ i (t)= ω i (t)− ω i (t−ri),t≥( t 0 +Mk) t 0 is the time when physical
    disturbances are cleared, ri=1/ν,M is a positive integer, and i=1 is the reordered
    index of the lead agent of the kth cluster and i=2,…,( N k +1) denotes the reordered
    index of the secondary agent in the same cluster. To predict the behavior pattern
    of the lead agent we also consider the sequential data observed at previous time
    window with the length of M, x i <t ={ x i t−κ , x i t−2κ ,…, x i t−Wκ } . The
    sequential data x i ={ x i t , x i <t }from in.ivi.ual Agent i are fed consecutively
    into two Conditional Deep Belief Networks (CDBNs) with identical structure, as
    illuminated in Table I. through a preprocessing procedure. Considering that the
    3-dimensional input data have real values, both of the CDBNs are trained by stacking
    one conditional Gaussian-Bernoulli Restricted Boltzmann Machines (GBRBMs) [31]
    [32] (for the first hidden layer) with three conditional Binary RBMs (BRBMs) (for
    the other three hidden layers) as shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 1. Communication between
    PDC and agents locally within a cluster Show All The conditional G BRBM used for
    training the first hidden layer employs energy function as follows: E( x i t ,

    is the dynamic bias associated with the kth hidden union by considering the effect
    of the past observation x i <t on the hidden layer. a j,t and b k,t can be calculated
    as: { a j,t = a j + ∑ 3M l=1 A lj x i <t (l) b j,t = b j + ∑ 3M l=1 B lj x i <t

    consisting of autoregressive parameters, and B is a matrix composed of the “historical
    observation to hidden” parameters. Based on Eq. (2). the conditional probability
    distributions can be represented as: { p( x i t (j)| h 1 t , x i <t )=N( a j,t
    + σ j ∑ 3 k=1 W jk h 1 t (k), σ 2 j ), p( h 1 t (k)=1| x i )=sigm( b k,t + ∑ 3

    function, and σ j is the standard deviation of the Gaussian noise for the j th

    2≤γ≤4 . applies the following energy function: E( h γ−1 t , h γ t ) = ∑ j=1 3
    ∑ k=1 3 W jk h γ−1 t (j) h γ t (k) − ∑ j=1 3 α j,t h γ−1 t (j)− ∑ k=1 3 b k,t
    h γ t (k), (5) View Source where the dynamic biases α j,t and b k,t can be calculated
    by using Eq. (3). Therefore, the Conditional probability distributions can be
    obtained as follows: { p( h γ−1 t (j)=1| h γ f , h γ−1 <f )⇒sigm( ι j,t + ∑ 3
    k=1 W jk h γ f (k)), p( h γ t (k)=1| h γ−1 t , h γ−1 <t )=sigm( b k,t + ∑ 3 j=1
    W ? k h γ t 1(j)). (6) View Source In order to mitigate the false data injection
    attack, we make a small modification to the learning behavior of the Hidden Layer
    4 in Fig. 2. Instead of using the stochastically chosen binary value as the activation
    value of the single Hidden union, we design this Hidden layer to output both the
    binary value and the expected value. The details of the attack detection and defense
    strategy is described in Table II. Table I Two CDBNs used for detecting false
    data injection attack SECTION V. Simulations In this section, we demonstrate our
    proposed deep learning-based cyber-physical strategy and evaluate its performance
    on the 39-bus New England test system of Fig. 3 employing MATLAB/Simulink. We
    consider that a 3-phase short circuit occurs in the middle of Line 14–15 at t=0s
    and then the fault is cleared at time t=0.1s by removing Line 14–15. Furthermore,
    the PMU sampling rate is assigned as 50 Hz, and the verification rate ν=5 Hz.

    of the input 3-dimensional data x i t observed at the current time, h m t (j)
    is the activation value of the jth unit in the mth hidden layer, which is achieved
    by using x i , and h m <t is the vector consisting of the activation values of
    the mth hidden layer, which is achieved by using X i <t . Show All Table II PROPOSED
    deep learning-based cyber-physical strategy Fig. 3. New england 39-bus power system.
    Show All Fig. 4 shows the normalized rotor frequencies and the phase angles achieved
    over a period of 10 s when no control is applied. Instability is clearly evident.
    The hierarchical multi-agent control scheme proposed in [25] is activated at t=0.15s
    . By using the control scheme, the agents with high coherency are grouped into
    three clusters: C1 = {Agent 1}. C2 = {Agent 2, Agent 3}. and C3 = {Agent 4, Agent
    5, Agent 6, …, Agent 10}. The lead agents, selected as having the highest inertia
    generator for each cluster, are given by: Agents 1, 3 and 10. Figure 5 shows the
    normalized rotor frequencies and phase angles in the presence of “random” false
    data injection attack when no deep learning-based cyber-physical strategy is applied.
    The attack specifically consists of PMU corruption of Agents 4, 9 and 10 at time
    t=0.5s for duration 5 s, 7 s. 8 s with random biases generated using the uniform
    distribution U[− 360 ∘ , 360 ∘ ] , respectively. From Fig. 5. it is clear that,
    although the control strategy is activated. the corrupted PMU data mislead the
    PDC of the 3rd cluster and result in the subsequent failure of the stability maintenance.
    To demonstrate our proposed strategy, we select the previous time window as M=9
    . By implementing the deep learning-based cyber-physical strategy stated in Table
    II, we can identify the feature values of the PMU data of the secondary agents
    belonging to the cluster c 3 as: { f i 2,b , f i 2,r } i=2 ={{0,0.2533},{0,0.2534},{0,0.2534},
    {0,0.2532}}{1,0.2545},{0,0.2537}} View Source We can also identity the teature
    value of PMU data of Agent 4. which is the lead agent of cluster c 3 . as { f
    1,b , f 1,r }={1,0.2549} . As stated in Table II, by grouping the secondary agents
    into two classes based on their PMU data''s feature values we can achieve C 1
    ={5,6,7,8,10} and C 2 ={9} . Since | C 1 |>| C 2 . the expected feature of the
    PMU data of Agent 4 is f 1,e =0 that is not equal to the actual feature value
    f 1,b =1 . Therefore, we conclude that there is attack on the lead agent. By measuring
    the reputation of Secondary Agent i belonging to cluster c 3 . where i∈ C 1 .
    we select Secondary Agent 8 to estimate the true values of the attacked lead agent''s
    PMU readings. Figure 6 shows the normalized rotor frequencies and phase angles
    when our proposed cyber-physical strategy is applied. We would like to mention
    that in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed strategy the same random
    biases are employed for the simulations in Figs. 5 and 6. From Fig. 6. we observe
    the stabilizing performance of our proposed strategy in verifying the validity
    of the readings of the lead agents'' PMUs and estimating their true values. Transient
    stability is still maintained in the presence of the random attack. Fig. 4. Normalized
    rotor frequencies and phase angles versus time without active control and proposed
    deen learning-based cyber-physical strategy. Show All We consider another situation
    when the compromised PMUs of Agents 4, 9 and 10. collude and report the same phase
    angle measurement θ i (t)= θ 1 (t)+ 180 ∘ , where i=4,9,10 , starting at t=0.5s
    for duration 7 s. Figure 7 shows the normalized rotor frequencies and phase angles
    without using the proposed deep learning-based cyber-physical strategy. From Fig.
    7, we can observe that the corrupted PMU data disable the control framework to
    maintain the transient stability of the power system. We implement the deep learning-based
    cyber-physical strategy stated in Table II and select the previous time window

    the secondary agents belonging to the cluster c 3 as: { f i 2 ⟩ b , f i 2,r }

    Source We can also identify the feature value of the PMU data of Agent 4. which
    is the lead agent of cluster c 3 . as { f 1,b , f 1,r }={1,0.2683} . As stated
    in Table II, by grouping the secondary agents into two classes based on their
    PMU data s feature values we can achieve C 1 ={5,6,7,8} and C 2 ={9,10} . Since
    | C 1 |>| C 2 | . the expected feature of the PMU data of Agent 4 is f 1,e =0
    that is not equal to the actual feature value f 1,b =1 . Therefore, we conclude
    that there is attack on the lead agent. By measuring the reputation of Secondary
    Agent i in cluster c 3 , where i∈ c 1 . we use the PMU rneasurernents of Secondary
    Agents 6 and 7 to estimate the true values of the lead agent''s PMU readings.

    our proposed strategy in verifying the validity of the lead agents'' PMU data

    India SECTION I. INTRODUCTION Agriculture plays a vital role in Indian economy.
    Over 70% of the rural households depend on agriculture. Indian agriculture sector
    accounts for 16% of India’s gross domestic product (GDP) and provides employment
    to 50% of the countries workforce. But due to uneven distribution of rainfall
    in our country various challenges come in the farming conditions. During some
    months of the year there is scarcity of rainfall as a result of which proper growth
    of crops gets hampered which results in loss of some plants in its juvenile stage
    itself.And sometimes due to excessive unseasonal rainfall the crops gets rotten
    up which creates an environment for the breeding of various insects. Several manual
    technologies had been implemented to tackle the situation but it requires a lot
    of man power as a result every time investment is high.So,automated system will
    be economical and efficient way for tackling the problems. Due to uneven distribution
    of rainfall, it becomes difficult for a farmer to irrigate the whole field manually
    by making efficient use of water,so some technical irrigation facility is required
    to efficiently distribute the water to the whole farm land for better crop production.
    India is blessed with a large acreage of land for cultivation but due to poor
    irrigation facilities and inadequate water supply its does not provide a sufficient
    output for the country’s GDP[1]. The manual method of watering the crops leaves
    the land uncultivated due to scarcity of water during arid seasons which results
    in decrease of crop retainability. In India,as rice is the staple food of most
    of the coastal regions so maximum area of peninsular part is cultivated with rice
    but due to lack of proper irrigation system there is an inadequate crop yield.
    Also due to retreating monsoon and unseasonable rainfall water logging comes into
    an issue as the result the lands gets logged with rain water which results in
    rotting away of crops[2]. In this proposed model, sensors will play the main role
    in collecting the data of the atmosphere and using the values of sensors it will
    provide an estimated quantity of water required to the crops according to the
    environment. Valves will also play important role providing a pathway for inlet
    and outlet of water into the field.Depending on the appropriate instruction sent
    by the user the valve will follow the action. By implementing this technique a
    huge amount of water can be saved and excessive watering of plants can be avoided[3].
    The humidity, temperature and moisture sensors will deployed near the peripheral
    of the crops and the data collected from it will be sent to the nearest gateway.
    The gateway then transfers the data to the cloud where it will be linked to a
    database system that will store the recorded data sequentially. During the installation
    a predetermined threshold value is set according to the average climatic condition
    of the area. If the sensed value exceeds the threshold value then the Arduino
    will send an alert message or notification to the user to perform the desired
    action depending on the condition to water the land or not. The notification will
    be sent to the user through the web app[4]. As soon as the owner performs the
    desired action it immediately sends response to the database which in turn provides
    request to the Arduino and the valves gets opened up for the inlet or outlet of
    water into the fields until the moisture content receives a threshold value.Thus
    the surplus outlet water can be stored to be used during dry season. Hence,water
    harvesting can be done with efficient usage of water The database can be also
    beneficial in providing precision agriculture data. A detailed study of the sensor
    values can also predict the yield percent. This can also prove beneficial in suggest
    the farmer to put extra manure or fertilizer for meeting its demand. SECTION II.
    MAIN PART A. Challenges of IoT in Agriculture 1. Customers Prospective The final
    information that is collected from the server by detailed study sensors is not
    properly utilized by the rural based farmers due to lack using high end technology
    based application. To provide better reliability on data more emphasis must be
    given to software than hardware so the end user must be capable enough to make
    the information notable. So there is not sufficient institutional capacity to
    deliver farmers specific services[5]. 2. Connectivity and Storage The battery
    life span of the module may be limited to an extent so proper inspection is required
    every time to avoid the connectivity losses.Sometimes due to poor signal connection
    the data may be lost on its way to the database server so every time it must be
    ensured to have a good connectivity signal[6].If there may be any interruption
    in the user end application then also the data may be interrupted resulting in
    poor decisions. The storage capacity of the IoT devices has low memory so it cannot
    hold much of its capacity.The application used may not have much memory space
    to store all the data through out the year thereby creating data losses for analysis[7].
    Fig. 1 Integration of sensor(s) with Arduino UNO. Show All 3. Hardware Specifications
    Standards of the devices are important in order to work on new technologies.If
    any component needs to be replaced and if it posses some different standard then
    the interoperability creates problem as a result the system becomes complicated.
    And the issues with integration as shown in the Fig. 1 arises[5]. B. System Devices
    Arduino Uno : The Arduino Uno shown in the Fig. 2 is a development board with
    ATMega328 micro-controller used in the broad.It has 14 digital pins which allow
    user to interface input / output with the board. Besides that it provide 6 analog
    inputs, 16 MHz ceramic resonator, USB connection for data transfer and power supply
    from laptops or PCs[13]. Also it has power jack , an ICSP header, and a reset
    button to clear the memory. It consists of all the things,required by the user.
    Thus it can be simply connected to the power using AC-to-DC adapter or else using
    battery to start the board. Thus the table:1 shows the board summary. TABLE I
    Arduino board’s Summary Fig. 2 Arduino UNO Show All nRF24L01: It is small integrated
    RF transceiver chip of frequency band of 2.4-2.5 Ghz.The main importance of this
    integrated chip is that it posses ShockBrust technology so that it can also communicate
    with microprocessor at low speed . Without activating also it can access FIFO
    register both in power-down mode and standby mode, MCU can also access FIFO register
    without activation, which also reduces the average power consumption[8].Thus nRF24L01,Fig.
    3 wireless module can transmit data even by consuming less power[9]. Fig. 3 Pin
    Configuration of nRF24L01 Show All Moisture Sensor : The increase in productivity
    of the crops, water is the important source so keeping a track of the amount of
    water in the soil is necessary[10]. Soil moisture Fig. 4 is used to measure the
    water retaining capacity of the soil.The voltage between two probes of the moisture
    sensor will measure dielectric permittivity of the surrounding medium using a
    capacitance.In soil, dielectric permittivity is a function of the water content,
    and therefore the water content of the soil is measured. The sensor predicts the
    water content by calculating the average over the entire length of the sensor[11].
    Fig. 4 Soil Moisture Sensor Show All DHT11-(Humidity and Temperature sensor):
    It is a digital compound temperature & humidity sensor that gives a digital output
    previously calibrated. It uses a acquisition technology in digital mode for temperature
    & humidity sensor technology in order to have long term stability[9]. This single-chip
    micro-controller (Fig. 5) with a a 8-bit connection provides quick response and
    better output quality ,thus makes it cost-effective.A single bus data format acts
    as both input/output transmission or two way communication. One single unit of
    data is 5 Byte (40 Bit). The communication time of transmitting and receiving
    is maximum 3 ms. The format single unit of output contains 40 bits. Output format:
    16 bit of Humidity(8 bit integer data + 8 bit decimal data) and 16 bit of Temperature(8
    bit integer data + 8 bit decimal data) and 8 bit calibration.The calibration is
    the sum of the first four bytes[12]. The power consumption is quite low i.e.,supply
    voltage of about 5V and the maximum current(average) of about 0.5 mA . Fig. 5
    DHT11 sensor to measure humidity and temp. of the area Show All ESP8266: It is
    a system on chip, highly integrated and cost effective module with TCP/IP stack
    which allows microcontroller to connect to WiFi.The ESP8266 in Fig. 6 is efficient
    to host an application.The storage and processing capacity is much higher which
    helps the module integrate via GPIO ports of the sensors with least loading during
    run-time[13].It has an integrated RF that allows it to work on the operating condition
    without any external RF parts. The input voltage being 3.3 V, with 8 pins, consisting
    of 1 Transmitter and 1 Receiver, 2 General purpose input output pins i.e. GPIO
    0 and GPIO 2, Reset , VCC and Ground. ESP has faster transmission and processing
    as it handles the information on both the ways, one as sensor interface unit and
    other as the Wireless Communication Unit[14]. Fig:6 ESP8266 Module Show All SECTION
    III. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE Fig:7 IoT Architecture Diagram Show All In this architecture,
    shown in the Fig. 7 basically three components used are Hardware Module,IoT Gateway
    and Cloud. These basic components forms the architecture of the proposed model.
    The Hardware Module contains sensors i.e. DHT11(for temperature and moisture sensing),
    Soil moisture sensor(measuring the moisture contain of the soil).For transmitting
    the sensor data(s) from micro controller to the gateway using nRF24L01 (a trans-receiver
    module). In the gateway there is a setup of WiFi Module(ESP8266), a nRF24L01 and
    a Micro-controller. These elements forms the core gateway of the system. The gateway
    sets path of communication between the transmitter and receiver end.It is highly
    authenticated and secured pathway where leakage of data is least[15]. Finally,
    the Cloud which plays an decision part in IoT . Cloud serves as an environment
    for storage,user interaction, handling real time database and others analytic
    work for project implementation[16]. Use of cloud in the proposed model will help
    to analyzed the data from the real time database i.e Firebase or AWS. Use of these
    database helps to build end user applications such as Web app or Mobile app. SECTION
    IV. Working Proposal The working proposal as shown in the Fig. 8 is based on the
    automation in the agriculture.It checks for two major conditions i.e overflow
    of water and underflow of water with other required conditions. As discussed above,
    the hardware module (sensors,nRF and MCU) which need to be setup making a chain
    of networks among the other hardware modules in the fields (crop fields). These
    chains of network forms a single transmission end from different parts of the
    field to the IoT gateway. In the field, sensors with data from different parts,
    transmits to their respective MCU(s) and thus MCU(s) transmits the collected data
    from sensors to the nRF. With network protocol nRF from different module forms
    a hub to make a single transmission end and hence the final collected data is
    being transmitted to the Gateway. Fig:8 Working Model Show All In the Gateway,
    transmitted data are being received by the nRF module which works as a receiver.
    Further these data are being passed to the MCU which enables WiFi ESP8266 to connect
    to the provided Cloud (AWS or Firebase). MCU with the help of ESP8266 connects
    to the local router and on successful connection, provides an IP address which
    contain the received data. Further the network connects to the cloud for storing
    the data and analyzing them. In the cloud data get stored in the real time database
    which provides APIs to access the stored data directly. It also provide an admin
    panel for end user interaction with the hardware and store data. As mention these
    module works for certain condition, lets discuss the shortage of water in field.In
    the cloud few analysis and prediction models shown in flowchart Fig. 9 are used
    to set threshold data for different conditions which would state the requirement
    of irrigation or control water logging. Based on the requirements a trigger or
    notification will create in the admin panel mentioning as: \"Please switch ON
    motor for irrigation\" \"Please OPEN the pipelines to remove excess water from
    field.\" This alert or notification from cloud enable user at the end point to
    send command to the hardware to perform certain action i.e to remove water using
    pipeline when overflow of water in the field or to irrigate the field in time
    intervals. Irrigation- The method of supplying of water to the fields at an interval
    of time is called Irrigation. In our model, we have also discussed the process
    of irrigation in our model to show the utilization of pipelines and storage of
    water. Connection of pipes in the fields and storage tanks serve the major advantage
    for irrigation during the hot seasons. In those days when the crops like legumes
    and other crops that grow in the fields require water during the cultivation.
    In the tropic region, the sun rays are stronger, which cause plants to die. To
    overcome this problem we have used the same model to irrigate the field. Since
    the connection of sensors measure the humidity, temperature and moisture of the
    soil, which is send to the server as it did earlier. A notification is send to
    the user through server, which enable the user to send back the command to open
    up the gates and switch on the motor to fetch water from tank to the field through
    pipelines. These enable irrigation process in the field. On reaching the optimum
    level the sensor send back the data to the gateways to stop the motor and closes
    the gate to stop the flow of water to the fields. Fig. 9 Flowchart of proposed
    model Show All SECTION V. Future Works This proposed model can be further extended
    to include pH sensor to know the quality and type of soil. Further to have better
    cloud management system we can use Firebase or Amazon Web Services which will
    provide real time data as well as analysis of the data. We can use machine learning
    approach to predict the amount of water required in further time span which will
    prove beneficial for the user.This will surely prove a new revolution in the field
    of agriculture that will increase the productivity. SECTION VI. Conclusion The
    proposed model may definitely be a new era of technical advancement which would
    prove the increase in productivity of the crops.When the things will be set up
    to the cloud and the internet of things set up will be successful then the whole
    agricultural sector can be digitally able to handle the field on their requirement
    basis. The harvesting of excess run off water helps saving some amount of water
    for for the benefit of the farm lands during summer seasons. The above future
    works will also prove profitable to add further new advancements and innovation
    on agricultural field and hence increase the GDP contribution of the country.

  description: Dearth of fresh water worldwide has given rise to solemn alarms since
    a decade. Economical administration of water resources plays a critical role when
    it is mainly with reference to the agriculture zone. Irrigation is generally functions
    along with canal plan by which water is pumped up into fields once at regular
    period of time according to farmers habitual ways without appropriate measurements
    with none feedback of water level in field. This kind of irrigation method will
    definitely hinder the crop growth and health and produces a poor yield as a result
    of some crops area component too susceptible to water content in soil. The ingenuous
    ICT technique presents an insolent system that uses minimum value soil wetness
    sensing element and temperature sensing element to manage facility in water shortage
    regions. The sensor, those vocations on the standard of moisture reliant resistance
    amendment between two points within the soil, is invented with the help of low
    cost materials and ways. Moisture and temperature knowledge is fetched from a
    sensing element node is distributed through an Arduino to a centralized server
    that controls facility. An automaton application is developed to envision the
    daily wetness and temperature knowledge. Moreover, the planned wetness sensing
    and temperature sensing ways have the power to be incorporated into machine-controlled

    Comments ABSTRACT Dearth of fresh water worldwide has given rise to solemn alarms
    since a decade. Economical administration of water resources plays a critical
    role when it is mainly with reference to the agriculture zone. Irrigation is generally
    functions along with canal plan by which water is pumped up into fields once at
    regular period of time according to farmers habitual ways without appropriate
    measurements with none feedback of water level in field. This kind of irrigation
    method will definitely hinder the crop growth and health and produces a poor yield
    as a result of some crops area component too susceptible to water content in soil.
    The ingenuous ICT technique presents an insolent system that uses minimum value
    soil wetness sensing element and temperature sensing element to manage facility
    in water shortage regions. The sensor, those vocations on the standard of moisture
    reliant resistance amendment between two points within the soil, is invented with
    the help of low cost materials and ways. Moisture and temperature knowledge is
    fetched from a sensing element node is distributed through an Arduino to a centralized
    server that controls facility. An automaton application is developed to envision
    the daily wetness and temperature knowledge. Moreover, the planned wetness sensing
    and temperature sensing ways have the power to be incorporated into machine-controlled
    which is automatic irrigation theme and perform automated, exactness agriculture
    in conjunction with de-centralized water management system. Application results
    illustrate that system through the embedded controlled technology which makes
    it complete intelligent irrigation, enhance the agricultural produce and improve
    soil health by irrigation, the water is used fruitfully and irrigation system
    automation is achieved mostly in all aspects. References Angel C and Asha S, \"A

  description: In today’s digital age, the Internet of Things (IoT) is gaining popularity.
    IoT has made everything smart, for example, smart cities (smart buildings and
    smart homes), smart healthcare (personal monitoring, smart wearables), industrial
    automation (especially manufacturing), commercial (shopping systems, retail),
    and even that agriculture too. IoT is becoming increasingly important in today’s
    digital age, resulting in a rapid rise in the number of devices connected to it.
    Massive amounts of data will be produced by such widely distributed IoT devices
    at the network’s edge. Processing these massive amounts of data in the centralized
    cloud is expected to result in increased 400bandwidth utilization, latency, and
    network congestion. Edge computing has become a popular paradigm in recent years
    for reducing network congestion and serving real-time IoT applications by providing
    services close to enduser devices. Agriculture is the foundation of the economy
    of any nation in the world. By 2050, the world population will need a 70% increase
    in food production to feed an estimated global population of more than 9 billion
    people. Potatoes are consumed all over the world and its production plays an important
    role in agriculture. The two primary diseases that adversely affect the yield
    of potato crop production are early blight and late blight. Therefore, in this
    work, we used containerized microservices to deploy machine learning models to
    resource restricted edge nodes on agricultural land for real-time disease and
    irrigation water requirement prediction in potato crops. Containers are lightweight
    and easy to deploy, making them the ideal choice for running machine learning
    models on resource-constrained edge nodes. We examined AlexNet, MobileNet, and
    VGG16, three deep convolutional neural networks (CNN), to detect these diseases
    automatically. A dataset of 7128 images containing healthy and diseased leaves
    of potato plants was used to train all three CNN models on the cloud. Even if
    training is outsourced, trained models need a lot of RAM; hence, the first aim
    of this study is to find a lightweight CNN model that can easily fit into resource-constrained
    devices. To improve potato crop yield and reduce economic losses, we found and
    deployed lightweight CNN model at the edge node to identify diseases in real time
    using leaf pictures recorded by in-place camera devices. The advantage of the
    developed technique is that by classifying potato leaf pictures in real time on-premises,
    there is no need to transfer images to the cloud for probable disease identification,
    which increases network congestion. The lightweight CNN model achieved 99.87%
    accuracy for both train and test images, according to the results. Precision (P),
    Recall (R), and F1 score (F1) are also displayed, to visualize the model’s efficiency.
    Similarly for real-time prediction of irrigation water requirement in potato crop,
    we trained two machine learning models, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic
    Regression (LR) on 100,000 values of records. Each record has four input parameters
    (soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and how many days the crop was planted
    before). With four input parameters in each record (soil moisture, temperature,
    humidity, and how many days before the crop was planted), the model decides whether
    the water pump should be turned on or off. The SVM model and the LR model attained
    92 and 73% accuracy, respectively, in determining whether the water pump should
    be turned ON or OFF.

  description: The limited availability of high-resolution monitoring systems for
    the drought phenomena and water dynamics affected by weather anomalies hinders
    policy decisions in a multitude of ways. This paper introduces the availability
    of the high-resolution Water Monitoring System (WMS) developed from a mix of sophisticated
    multi-spectral satellite imageries, analytic and data sciences, and cloud computing,
    for monitoring the changes in water levels and vegetation water stress at the
    local scale. The WMS was tested in the Lower Mekong Region (LMR) case basin, Thailand’s
    Chi River Basin, in the period from January 2021 to April 2021, the dry season.
    The overall quality of the VHI, VCI, TCI, and NDVI drought simulation results
    showed a statistically positive Pearson correlation with the reservoir and dam
    water volume data (ranged between 0.399 and 0.575) but demon-strated a strong
    negative correlation with the groundwater level data (between −0.355 and −0.504).
    Further investigation and more detailed analysis of the influence of different
    physical environmental conditions related to change in groundwater level should
    be considered to increase scientific knowledge and understanding about the changing
    nature of the local system from local perspectives with the alternative use of
    drought indices in data-poor areas. Our result suggests that the WMS can provide
    quantitative spatiotemporal variations of localized and contextualized surface
    water changes as a preliminary analysis. The WMS results can offer guidance for
    finding a better smaller unit management that suits the local conditions, such
    as water resource management, disaster risk reduction measures (i.e., drought
    and flood), irrigation practice, land use planning, and crop management. The existing
    WMS is geared toward the early warning of water and agricultural development,
    progress on the SDGs, utilization of digital innovation, and improved abilities
    of de-cision-makers to monitor and foresee extreme weather events earlier and
    with high spatial accuracy.

    management, disaster risk reduction measures (i.e., drought and flood), irrigation
    practice, land use planning, and crop management. The existing WMS is geared toward
    the early warning of water and agricultural development, progress on the SDGs,
    utilization of digital innovation, and improved abilities of decision-makers to
    monitor and foresee extreme weather events earlier and with high spatial accuracy.

    severe droughts seriously threaten food security, socio-economic condition, and
    ecosystems in the Lower Mekong Region (LMR) [1,2,3]. The 2019/20 drought in many
    locations of Thailand [4] and Vietnam’s Mekong delta [5,6] are the recent example,
    where fragmented institutional mandates and varying technical capabilities to
    monitor these extreme events led to a significantly to delayed response [7,8].
    Meanwhile, climate change has magnified drought in both frequency and severity
    [9,10]. It aggravates the insecurity of water resources that causes a serious
    disparity between water supply and demand in the region [2,11,12]. The effects
    of the water imbalances have created inequalities in the distribution, allocation
    across competing users, and extensive use of groundwater, which could be a cause
    of institutional arrangement and political targeting for many countries [13].
    These cascading socioeconomic and ecosystem impacts have disrupted efforts to
    achieve the target sets in at least 4 different Sustainable Development Goals
    (SDGs), particularly relating to SDG 6 Clean water and sanitation, SDG 11 Sustainable
    cities and communities, SDG 13 Climate actions, and SDG 14 Life on land. This
    increased risk of both drought and water security was profoundly notified by six
    riparian countries (China, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam)
    under the Joint Working Group (JWG) on Water Resources of the Lancang Mekong Cooperation
    (LMC) during the 2019 Second Special Meeting in Nong Khai, Thailand [14]. They
    initially agreed to undertake joint research on the 2019 drought to gain a more
    thorough understanding of the physical processes leading to the drought and their
    impacts. Decision-makers and water managers are aware of frequent extreme weather
    events, specifically increasing worse droughts and their intensifying impacts
    [14,15]. They, however, find it difficult to measure drought onsets and endings,
    even in water-rich countries because droughts are not weather or climatic anomalies
    [16]. Recent advances in data innovation and digital technologies are making their
    way into a wide range of applications for water resources management, for instance,
    [17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28]. Specifically, satellite data at varying
    spatial scales are likely being used as an alternative or complementary source
    of information to in situ monitoring networks in data-poor regions [29,30]. In
    many parts of the Lower Mekong Basin (LMB), satellite data is seemingly the only
    feasible source [31,32] that can provide critical information in support of managing
    water resources and monitoring the evolution of droughts, other hazards, and their
    impacts [30,33,34]. In response to the growing attention and need from decision-makers
    in the LMR, several satellite-based operational near-real-time systems for drought
    and water monitoring have been developed to provide static maps at a weekly drought
    condition with single meteorological or a few agricultural drought indicators
    at the national and regional scales. A few examples of such systems are The Thai
    Geo-Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency (https://drought.gistda.or.th/
    accessed on 4 October 2021), SERVIR-Mekong (https://mdcw-servir.adpc.net/; https://rdcyis-servir.adpc.net/map
    accessed on 4 October 2021), and Mekong River Commission (http://droughtforecast.mrcmekong.org/maps
    accessed on 4 October 2021). At the global scale, the Center for Spatial Information
    Science and Systems/George Mason University (http://gis.csiss.gmu.edu/GADMFS/
    accessed on 4 October 2021), the University of California, Irvine (http://drought.eng.uci.edu/
    accessed on 4 October 2021), and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the
    United Nations (https://www.fao.org/giews/earthobservation/asis/index_1.jsp?lang=en#uvhi
    accessed on 4 October 2021) have a near real-time drought assessment products
    at the larger spatial scales (500 m to 11 km). Those existing drought monitoring
    systems are too coarse and have a limited operation period of satellite sensors
    to capture detailed spatial coverage conditions, due to complex topography and
    heterogeneity [35,36,37,38]. They are unfortunately unable to provide essential
    information in decision-making at the sub-national or basin scales [29,36]. As
    drought can be localized and increasingly take place on smaller scales [39,40].
    This highlights the important need for a local understanding of the behavior of
    water movement, the vulnerability of crops under drought, and other climate and
    water problems, rather than global or regional levels. A high-resolution near
    real-time drought monitoring tool with more accurate measures of specific drought
    indices is, thus, required for decision-making and adaptation at the local scale.
    Nevertheless, tackling the challenges of drought needs an integrated approach
    to support water resource management and sustainable development [41]. In addition,
    developing any system usually requires considerable time, effort, and resources
    [28,42]. While observational data are individually collected and managed through
    very sparse agro-hydrometeorological monitoring networks by several agencies,
    a few are publicly available online at Thailand’s Hydro-Informatics Institute
    (https://www.thaiwater.net/v3/ accessed on 7 November 2021), Mekong River Commission
    (https://portal.mrcmekong.org/monitoring/river-monitoring-telemetry accessed on
    7 November 2021), for instance, this identifies a strong need for better coordinated
    multi-source observational data across departments within a country [7]. Thus,
    we believe that an affordable development of an integrated system for drought
    monitoring can provide situational information to gain an improved understanding
    of the behavior of water movement, the vulnerability of crops under drought, and
    other climate and water problems at the local scale. The study, therefore, develops
    a web-based open-source system that will be of great help in reducing task duplication
    and to further enhance the ability of water managers and policymakers to achieve
    better water resource management, support concrete actions in timely responses,
    and catalyzing progress in achieving the listed SDGs and SDG 4 Digital innovation.
    Other users can also benefit from the WMS. Here, we announce the availability
    of the high-resolution Water Monitoring System (WMS) and demonstrate its value
    for water and drought monitoring using the multi-source data and Google Earth
    Engine (GEE). We, therefore, describe and discuss the details of the workflow,
    web-based service, key processes of the proposed system, and testbed for Thailand’s
    river basin case study implementation. We anticipate that this freely available
    web-based monitoring tool will provide evidence of the state and changes in surface
    and groundwater over time and inform water management decision-making and the
    enforcement of extreme event preparedness, mitigation, and emergency measures
    at the local level. 2. Materials and Methods The Water Monitoring System (WMS)
    was developed by the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) cross-center researchers
    (Asia and Latin America) between 2020 and 2021. The WMS entered a digital universe,
    where day-to-day decisions need to be based on empirical data and analytics, rather
    than past practice. By embracing new tools and technologies to better understand
    their complex operations, today’s stakeholders and decision-makers can save time
    and money, reduce water related risks, and become more efficient. To succeed with
    the data-driven approach, we need to start with accurate information that requires
    powerful monitoring tools backed by robust analytic capacities. That is where
    the WMS comes in. We are taking physical monitoring to new levels with our advanced
    data innovation, which provides unparalleled real-time visibility into local drought
    and water resource management. Using a combination of sophisticated multi-spectral
    sensors, which provides high resolution satellite imageries, data science analytics,
    and cloud computing, the WMS delivers unprecedented insights into how lower water
    resources and vegetation are observed. This is achieved by web-scraped multi-source
    data to accurately estimate water deficits or inundation and support timely decisions
    for managing climate-change-related water resource management, with a potential
    reduction of damages and investment costs and benefits for irrigation development,
    adaptation measures, and mitigation. Our proposed system is easily scalable and
    can be used to develop a monitoring system of individual surface and groundwater
    resources or entire local drought areas. The edge computing technology allows
    us to deploy them in situations where observational data are unavailable and unreliable.
    It all adds up to better control over local water resources and a deeper understanding
    of how to manage it, and that means healthier water systems, better management,
    and efficient operation. 2.1. Water Monitoring System (WMS) The schematic of the
    WMS is demonstrated in Figure 1. It comprises: (1a) a near real-time simulation
    framework using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) to monitor the evolution of drought
    and water conditions; (1b) an automated web data scraping and extraction in Python
    that is an archive of the publicly available surface and groundwater observation
    data from government websites; (1c) PostgreSQL, a relational database management
    system to store and process the input data of surface and groundwater as a foundation
    of the WMS database; and (1d) a web-based service that connects all modules and
    hosts the resultant archive of the GEE, a system database and a high-resolution
    spatial maps of drought indices. The WMS allows technical users who are highly
    trained in the fields of physical environment, geosciences, and water sciences
    to interact, communicate, and share our results in a non-scientific language with
    different interest groups, thus reaching a much wider audience. It also aims to
    provide evidence-based scientific support to the policymaking process for sub-national
    and local drought assessments, as well as changes of water conditions. Major modules
    are described in the subsections. Figure 1. Schematic overview of the configuration
    for the Water Monitoring System (WMS). 2.1.1. Near Real-Time Simulation in Google
    Earth Engine (GEE) The WMS is built on top of the GEE cloud-based platform for
    sub-national scale geospatial analysis. The freely available Landsat 8 (L8), with
    a 16-day revisit time [43], provided by the United States Geological Survey (https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/nli/landsat/landsat-8?qt-science_support_page_related_con=0#
    accessed on 28 October 2021) and the Sentinel 2A/B (S2) from the European Space
    Agency (https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-2 accessed on
    28 October 2021) images with a 5-day repeat period [44] are utilized and have
    been routinely downloaded since its inception in January 2021. Although the two
    images are atmospherically corrected and geo-referenced, based on the global position
    system (GPS) tier points [45], cloud contaminations and topographic effects produced
    by the presence of shadow noises remain the issues in the result of earth’s surface
    mapping and change analysis [46,47]. We implemented the cloud masking algorithm
    within GEE, which enables us to resolve the effects by removing pixels having
    cloud presence to meet crucial data use and can yield a higher composite of the
    satellite imagery. Estimates of drought and other environmental events have received
    enhanced attention over the last 30 years [48]. The visible (VIS) and near-infrared
    (NIR) wavebands calculating Vegetation Health Index (VHI) [48,49,50], Vegetation
    Condition Index (VCI) [51,52], Temperature Condition Index (TCI) [48], Normalised
    Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) [53], and Normalised Difference Water Index
    (NDWI) [54,55] have been used in designing local drought monitoring techniques
    in the WMS. Vegetation Health Index (VHI) 𝑉𝐻𝐼= 𝛼∗𝑉𝐶𝐼+(1+𝛼)∗𝑇𝐶𝐼;𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝛼=0.5 Vegetation
    Condition Index (VCI) 𝑉𝐶𝐼= 𝑁𝐷𝑉 𝐼 𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡  −𝑁𝐷𝑉 𝐼 𝑚𝑖𝑛 𝑁𝐷𝑉 𝐼 𝑚𝑎𝑥 −𝑁𝐷𝑉 𝐼 𝑚𝑖𝑛 ×100
    Temperature Condition Index (TCI) 𝑇𝐶𝐼= 𝐿𝑆 𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥 −𝐿𝑆 𝑇 𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝐿𝑆 𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥 −𝐿𝑆 𝑇 𝑚𝑖𝑛
    ×100 Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) 𝑁𝐷𝑉𝐼=  𝑁𝐼𝑅−𝑅𝑒𝑑 𝑁𝐼𝑅+𝑅𝑒𝑑 where,
    LST is the land surface temperature, Red is the red band (0.64–0.67 µm), and NIR
    is the near infrared band (0.85–0.88 µm) of Landsat 8. These have been selected
    as the four indices for maintaining local drought monitoring [56]. An additional
    surface water analysis, the normalized difference water index (NDWI), is used
    to delineate the spatial distribution of open water areas. Rivers and rice fields
    were excluded from the layer using thresholding over multi-temporal and seasonally
    aggregated images. The data we processed include reservoirs, lakes, and other
    water bodies and its temporal changes from surface water data that are stored
    in the system database of the WMS. NDWI = (Green − NIR)/(Green + NIR) where, Green
    is the green band (0.543–0.578 µm) and NIR is the NIR band (0.855–0.875 µm) of
    Sentinel 2. For the current development, S2-based surface water area extraction
    was estimated. Cloud-masking was carried out based on the quality assessment (QA)
    band and cloud-pixel percentage. Metadata images that had less than 20 percent
    pixels with the presence of clouds were selected by filtering out clouds using
    the QA bands. Following the NDWI calculation, thresholding was applied to extract
    pixels with water presence. Rivers and inundated agricultural fields were removed
    using an assigned custom mask. The results of the GEE-based processing are a collection
    of the VHI, VCI, TCI, NDVI, and NDWI anomalies, which are stored in the Google
    cloud and presented in the form of maps at 10 to 30 spatial resolutions and graphical
    images. It provides near real-time monitoring of open water area dynamics and
    agriculture ecosystems, which is very useful to study of the irrigation, early
    warning, natural environmental health, agriculture, and river ecosystems and to
    understand the impact of the spatial distribution of the water stress on vegetation
    and its temporal evolution over longer time periods. 2.1.2. Automated Web Data
    Scraping and Extraction in Python Data scraped from multiple websites cannot be
    directly used by an analysis tool without human intervention. We therefore developed
    a custom web scraper program based on Python that is installed on the back-end
    system of the WMS to automatically read the code of a web page and decode it to
    extract the required data. Since there was a large amount of continuous observational
    data, we decided to use Python [57] in the development of the web scraper program.
    Our decision, therefore, was specifically made for the following reasons: it is
    a free, open-source programming language with a wide active developer base with
    several supporting packages and an application programming interface (API) to
    support the handling of large data, support system development, and connect with
    the preferred database PostgreSQL for data processing pipelines and to connect
    with GEE platform. We added the custom-developed scraper program to log in to
    daily updated public access environmental data, including open water level data
    and groundwater level data, that are disseminated from databases of national and
    international official sources. The web scraping program was oriented to collect
    observational data from the agro-hydrometeorological stations for point locations
    within the national agencies, focusing mainly on rivers, reservoirs, and groundwater
    well data from the LMR, and thereafter the collected data are stored in the WMS
    database in accordance with the design schema attributes and formats. 2.1.3. System
    Database in PostgreSQL Additionally, a back-end relational database management
    system was developed in the PostgreSQL that stores the web scraped data with the
    input format of comma-separated values (CSV; Figure 2). The PostgreSQL (https://www.postgresql.org/
    accessed on 28 October 2021) was selected for the system because it is an advanced
    open-source object relational database management system that applies SQL language.
    The PostGIS extension of the PostgreSQL enhances its capabilities in storage and
    handing spatial datasets [58,59], thus allowing us to store large and sophisticated
    data safely and steadily that help to build the most complex database, run administrative
    tasks, and create integral environments to the WMS. Figure 2. The back-end database
    management system of the WMS. In the current development, the daily web-scraped
    data from each source are stocked in the system database in the web server. The
    data retrieval, including river, reservoir, and groundwater levels, has been processed
    to derive the spatial and temporal structure and the changing characteristics
    of open water areas. Since groundwater level data were from more than 100,000
    points of observations scattered across the tested basin, it was more feasible
    to convert them to a finer regular grid using interpolation techniques for the
    analysis of changes in data over time. We, hence, adopted the inverse distance
    to power or inverse distance weighted (IDW) algorithm [60,61,62,63,64,65], which
    is found to give best results for interpolating the continuous earth’s surface.
    This was executed in Python using GDAL [66] grid functionalities. To calculate
    value Z at each grid node, the following formula was used. 𝑍= ∑ 𝑛 𝑖=1 𝑍 𝑖 𝑟 𝑝
    𝑖 ∑ 𝑛 𝑖=1 1 𝑟 𝑝 𝑖 where 𝑍 𝑖 is a known value at a point i, ri is a distance from
    the grid node to point i, p is weighted power, and n is number of points in Search
    Ellipse. For the current study, p is 3 and both radii of the Search Ellipse are
    5. The resulting interpolated raster is transferred to the Google cloud platform
    to enable its access through the GEE. 2.1.4. Web-Based Water Monitoring System
    We automated user access and the output processes of the WMS through a web-based
    interface to assess a suite of drought characteristics at the multiple timescales,
    from daily to annual, at a 10 to 30 m spatial resolution. The web-based interface
    has been designed to be user-friendly and easily visualize the results, while
    the processing chain is essentially a computational routine in the back-end system.
    Our real-time web-based water monitoring system is accessible over the web at
    the following URL: https://thailand-water-monitor.more-rivers.com/ (accessed date
    on 4 November 2021). Figure 3 depicts the interface with two highlighted parts.
    First (3a), a list of input variables is in the contents pane where users can
    specify a river basin, a time-series for monitoring water and drought conditions,
    a water index, and a vegetation drought index of interest to derive conditions
    of the open water areas and the evolution of droughts. This includes the reservoir
    usable water status, a collection of vegetation indices (VHI, VCI, TCI, and NDVI)
    and the groundwater level changes. The interaction is conducted via the clicking
    of choices, while moving of sliders allows users to see more or less of the underlying
    maps. The transparency, or opacity, of any index can be adjusted from 0% to 100%.
    The more transparent a layer is, the less visible it appears on the resultant
    map and the more visible the other layers appear. By default, the base map is
    0% transparent which means it is fully visible. If users want to focus attention
    on a specific result of the index map layer, they might consider making it fully
    visible and adding transparency to the other layers. Second (3b), the right pane
    is the output window, where it shows an interactive global map for displaying
    spatially varying responses of open water area changes and drought conditions.
    The outputs can also be shown as an interactive time-series plot for the changes
    by switching between the Controls tab and Charts tab in the contents pane. Figure
    3. (a) The right-hand pane contains available input variables of the current version
    of the web-based WMS interface for users. (b) The left-hand pane shows the base
    map and the results of spatiotemporal distribution of drought from simulations
    with the WMS. All figures and time-series plots are the output of the simulated
    spatial and temporal extents of areas vulnerable to potential extreme weather
    events at a selected location and overall statistics, respectively. Users can
    further evaluate the simulated results in the spirit of a data-driven decision-making
    processes. Specifically, they can access the current condition of open water areas
    and droughts, respond to hazards or early warnings more effectively, and provide
    a comparison of the current water and drought events to past events. The users
    can obtain a daily vegetation index map and an analysis of open water area changes,
    and these illustrate the spatial extent and index variation of drought and water
    through the web-based interface of the WMS. The system can be used by decision-makers
    and technical users to assess drought and water warning conditions and facilitate
    the management of actionable drought mitigation measures through near real-time
    monitoring of drought dynamics, in terms of both hydrological and vegetation variables.
    On the back-end system, the web-based application processes users’ inputs and
    triggers a simulation of water and drought assessment at a high spatial resolution.
    It can easily become an overwhelming task if one wants to simulate all indices
    at one time. Instead, in this case, the WMS prepares input files, calls the system
    executable program, and then retrieves outputs for producing spatial and temporal
    maps and time-series plots. It is, therefore, worth nothing that for a large-scale
    basin study with a selection of multiple indices, the latency between users’ inputs
    and output display can be large, due to the longer simulation time. Therefore,
    the WMS was designed to process users’ requests into the input files and quickly
    retrieve outputs after simulation for displaying results on the front-end user
    interface. 2.2. Testing the WMS in the Case Study Area Here, we present a case
    study in which we applied the WMS to Thailand’s river basins (Figure 4a). The
    case study provides a lens for the understanding of the WMS’s performance and
    reliability through the practical experience of functionalities, computation time,
    the simulated results, and the potential development for additional functionalities
    to deepen and broaden the results in the future. The results and discussions of
    the case study are presented in the next section, focusing on the highlighted
    application and utility of the WMS. Figure 4. (a) Map of the 25 major basins in
    Thailand and the territory of the Lower Mekong Basin. (b) Map of the Chi River
    Basin in northeastern Thailand reprinted from the web-based WMS interface. Specifically,
    the WMS was tested in the Chi River Basin (Figure 4b), which is located in northeastern
    Thailand. The basin has a population of around 6.6 million people in the total
    land area of 49,131.22 square kilometers (km2). It is composed of mountainous
    terrain where it forms the border between the Mun Basin in the south, the Mekong
    and Mun Basins in the east, and the Pasak watershed in the west. The topographic
    terrain varies between 170 m and 300 m with mountain ranges between 500 m and
    1000 m, situated between 15°30′ and 17°30′ N latitude and 101°30′ and 104°30′
    NE longitude and influenced by the tropical monsoon. The annual average temperature
    is 26.9 °C, and the mean annual precipitation is approximately 1170 millimeters
    (mm), increasing from west to east with a monthly average of 2.3–243.7 mm. Most
    of the basin population engages in agriculture on the 60% arable land where there
    are rice fields (41%), forest (31%), urban (2.9%), water bodies (2.5%) and other
    lands (3.5%). Rice farming is found in the middle and downstream of the Chi River
    Basin. Most rainfed rice is grown during the rainy season (June-December) and
    the second crop of rice is commonly planted under irrigation during the dry season
    (January-April). Cassava and sugarcane are harvested all year. The main cassava
    growing region is in the southwest and north basin, while sugarcane is produced
    in the northwestern, north, and southwest basins. The Chi River Basin is naturally
    prone to droughts and floods, due to the influence of the quite irregular and
    unreliable rainfall, and that makes the basin vulnerable to such hazards. The
    basin has experienced extensive rice growing and spatial land cover changes with
    a rapid urban transformation. These changes have resulted in the increased competition
    of water resources in different sectors. Climate change has already happened at
    a much faster rate and its devastating impacts have unintended consequences on
    the local natural systems and people living in poor and marginal conditions. Thus,
    the lack of a leading edge of knowledge on the local vulnerability and exposures
    to climate change, the observed impacts, future climate risks, and the associated
    potential limits adaptation and management at the sub-national levels [67,68,69].
    2.3. Correlation Analysis of the Simulated Drought Indices To compare how well
    the drought indices can assess the near real-time water dynamics and drought evolution
    in the present, we used two approaches. First, we snapped the simulated drought
    indices of the NDVI, VHI, VCI, and TCI to the same extent of the tested Chi River
    Basin. Every data layer contained different values of active pixels representing
    the tested basin. Within the GEE environment, we generated 300 random points across
    the Chi River Basin (Figure 5) and marked them as the agriculture or non-agriculture
    for training points, based on the LandCover data [70]. Areas with no clear determination
    were omitted from the correlation coefficient assessments. These points were further
    used to extract the pixel values of the drought indices stored in the GEE assets.
    For datasets in the database, a spatial query was executed to extract values of
    the groundwater level, reservoir water volume, and dam water volume. The values
    of the same point locations from different drought indices and database queried
    data were aggregated in a tabular format, providing simultaneous values of parameters,
    such as point number, date time, NDVI, VHI, etc. These data were aggregated to
    a 16-day time steps for each date stamp (n = 24) at the basin. Figure 5. Training
    data of the 300 random points across the tested Chi River Basin. As the second
    approach, we used the ggpairs function of the GGally R Package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GGally/index.html
    accessed on 10 January 2022) to evaluate the correlations between the groundwater
    level, reservoir water volume, and dam water volume data and the corresponding
    values of each index. A matrix of twenty-eight scatter plots was drawn and the
    Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated for visualizing the intercomparison
    between the eight variables at bi-weekly scale (16-days composite data) in the
    tested basin. Due to the first-year implementation of the WMS, we only sought
    to test whether vegetation greenness varied with groundwater level, reservoir
    water volume, and dam water volume from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2021 across
    the Chi River Basin. 3. Results As Figure 6 shows, there was strong positive correlation
    between VHI with VCI (r = 0.908), with TCI (r = 0.802), and with NDVI (r = 0.772)
    for 2021. This implies that VHI is considered a good indicator, as it provides
    better comprehension between the relative effects of temperature changes (TCI)
    and vegetation responses (VCI). Figure 6 also demonstrates a positive correlation
    with a high statistical significance between the dam and reservoir water volume
    variations. The overall positive correlations were generally stronger between
    VHI and the changes of annual reservoir water volumes (RID_Resv; r = 0.498) than
    EGAT dam water volumes (r = 0.442) and RID_Dam water volumes (r = 0.399). The
    spatiotemporal patterns were very similar to the correlation obtained with the
    VCI, which had higher positive significance with the changes of annual RID_Resv
    (r = 0.501) than EGAT dam water volumes (r = 0.483) and RID_Dam water volumes
    (0.471). Generally, NDVI showed a statistically significant positive relationship
    with the surface water volume datasets of EGAT (r = 0.575), RID_Dam (r = 0.566),
    and RID_Resv (r = 0.520), accordingly. These demonstrate the advantage of using
    NDVI over the other drought indices, due to its capacity in identifying and exploring
    the variations and changes of surface water and vegetation. Figure 6. Correlation

    plots are the average of the outputs of the WMS, based on a 16-day time step.
    *, **, and *** denote statistically significant correlation at the p ≤ 0.05, ≤
    0.01, and ≤ 0.001 levels of probability, respectively. In contrast to the surface
    water changes, groundwater level (GW) had a statistically significant negative
    correlation with NDVI (r = −0.355), TCI (r = −0.391), VCI (r = −0.504), and VHI
    (r = −0.534). This means that a further analysis with long time-series of in-situ
    data and hydrologically and meteorologically sensitive parameters could help in
    forging their intercomparison. Figure 7 presents the WMS simulation results, showing
    the observational data (a) and the multi-temporal trend of the drought indices
    for the dry season in the Chi River Basin (b–f). To reduce the wait time for the
    WMS users to switch between datasets in real time to intercompare, datasets are
    preloaded, based on the user query. This usually takes 4 to 7 s, depending on
    the number of user requests and total number of active users on the application.
    The data points presented in (a) are the total number of reservoirs and dams sparsely
    located across the Chi River Basin and operated by the national departments in
    Thailand, named specifically the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand
    (EGAT), the Royal Irrigation Departments (RID) and the international government
    agency the Mekong River Commission (MRC). Once these data points appear and upon
    hovering over a data point on the display map, it shows information on the station
    name, the usable water volume in million cubic meters (MCM), the storage capacity
    (MCM), and the percent (%) of usable water volume. Figure 7. The simulated outputs
    of (a) Usable water storage capacity over time, High resolution drought monitoring
    information based on (b) VHI, (c) VCI, (d) TCI, and (e) NDVI; and (f) Spatial
    groundwater-surface analysis based on IDW in the tested basin. The monitoring
    was conducted in the drier season between 28 January 2021, and 30 April 2021.
    The three bars on the left corner of the contents pane provide a reference for
    usable water (%; left), drought index variation (middle), and quantitative changes
    in groundwater levels (right). Across most of the Chi River Basin, drought is
    one of the major natural disasters affecting dimensional economies. The agriculture
    and its products of this basin play an important role for food security in the
    country, and this agricultural food production is highly affected by drought,
    which is associated with water deficits. It depends mostly on the arrival time
    and location of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Overall, in (b–e),
    the results of the 4-month monitoring maps obtained from the 16-day composite
    data show that the basin was not suffering severe agricultural drought during
    the 2021 dry season when it was evaluated by scientifically accepted thresholds
    (scale from 0 to 1; of which >0.5 demonstrates no drought phenomena) [71,72].
    The 2021 dry season observed a moderate agricultural drought period across the
    basin, where the bi-weekly VHI values were averaged over each of the total provinces
    in the Chi River Basin with a range between 0.32 and 0.43 (b). This responded
    to the varying color ramps of the data points at a specific location, for which
    red is the usable water surplus and brown is the water deficits. As (c) shows,
    the VCI did not show vegetation water stress in most regions, and only slightly
    below normal vegetation conditions (VCI ranged between 0.37 and 0.66) at the end
    of April 2021 were observed in the northwestern and southeastern Chi River Basin,
    mostly due to temperature stress (see also the TCI spatial distribution map in
    (d). Following the consideration, the largest TCI values during the 2021 dry season
    were calculated from the 16-day composite data of the 15 weeks. It was noticeable
    that the vegetation amount developed healthily during the dry season with more
    favorable weather (TCI valued between 0.59 and 0.80) for crop growth and successful
    farming. The main zones included vary favorable weather in the southwestern, north,
    and northeastern basin. Similarly, no disturbances were observed on the spatial
    distribution of the NDVI productivity, showing a good NDVI coverage range. In
    (e), the NDVI values ranged between 0.56 and 0.78. These indices characterizing
    VCI (moisture), TCI (thermal), VHI (vegetation health) and NDVI (vegetation condition)
    demonstrated healthy vegetation, which was associated with favorable moisture
    and thermal conditions, corresponding with a study showing no 2020/21 drought
    in Thailand so far. The interpolation map in (f) is displayed with a brown to
    blue color ramp map, which indicates deep to shallow groundwater areas. This result
    was obtained by using the complete sounding groundwater level data in the basin
    using IDW. It is visually evident that the spatial distribution of daily groundwater
    levels was located around the central parts of the Chi River Basin. These results
    are also given in the form of time-series plots, as shown in Figure 8. The Charts
    tab in the contents pane (a) controls the opening of the output window and takes
    users to multiple time-series plots of the open water areas and vegetation water
    stress estimates. The analytics in the graphical image make it easier for users
    to observe and gain a broad understanding of the statistics of the drought monitoring
    information and the multi-temporal trend of the surface waters in different point
    or pixel locations. However, it is worth nothing that the NDWI values obtained
    from the daily surface water data are only presented in the form of a time-series
    plot under the Usable Water plot (b), while ground water IDW interpolation, which
    is presented in maps, is yet included and displayed in the Vegetation Index plot
    (c). Figure 8. (a) Time-series comparison graph between observational data of

    near real-time monitoring system that integrates multi-source observational data
    scraping, GEE cloud computing, remote sensing technology, and user intuitive feedback
    for the monitoring of water changes and drought evolution in the LMR. This development
    has also laid a solid foundation for integrating accelerating progress on the
    SDGs. The methodological approach is implemented in an automated processing chain,
    which makes the products available through a dynamic web-based interface. We have
    concluded that there is no relevant research on the combination of water and drought
    monitoring at a 10–30 m spatial resolution in the region and it is still very
    limited in most parts of the world [36]. Moreover, the methodological approach
    for treating the establishing goals is believed to be the innovative aspect of
    the research, with potential scalability and operationality to other case studies.
    The promotion of this conceptualized methodology for an open-access high-resolution
    near real-time drought monitoring web-based platform is considered a merit of
    the current research and future development work. 4.1. Monitoring Information
    and Potential Limitations of Drought and Water Indices The WMS has been developed
    for drought simulation and changes in open water area information and offered
    several remotely sensed agricultural drought indices (VHI, VCI, TCI, NDVI, and
    NDWI) at a 10–30 m spatial resolution in the data poor region of the LMR (Figure
    7). However, the current development of the study has not yet offered near real-time
    drought monitoring information using hydrological and meteorological drought indices.
    These could limit the capacity of drought simulation and incompletely characterize
    and monitor the spatial and temporal patterns of drought incidences in depth [71].
    Different indices for drought monitoring have their limitations. For instance,
    NDVI is very sensitive to the atmospheric scattering effects directly on the earth’s
    surface [73]. NDWI has, thus, been suggested to use as a complementary index of
    open water area monitoring to in situ monitoring data and NDVI that can help improve
    the understanding of its useful and reduced limitations, giving better results
    and reducing the sensitivity of vegetation stress and open water area estimates
    [73,74,75]. Several different simulated drought indices, hence, provide different
    index variations, varying with the temporal and spatial patterns and revealing
    better drought characteristics [76,77]. 4.2. Practicality and Legality of Web
    Data Scraping Here, the web data scraper program proved very useful for delivering
    big data and facilitating the automatic harvesting of a plethora of environmental
    data [25,42], i.e., river depths, groundwater levels, reservoir and dam waters,
    on a daily basis, publicly and constantly published on the internet. Although
    the web scraping stands out as a significant advantage over traditional copy and
    paste approach by leveraging multi-source data and reducing task duplication,
    one of the bottlenecks in applying this approach is that it is not always easy
    to keep track of website structure of the national or international official sources.
    Each website has a particular structure, which may be subject to changes, i.e.,
    graphical user interface (GUI), anytime, and that directly affected the scraping
    process of the program. Consequently, the back end of the WMS often requires few
    lines of code for tackling such changes and is periodically updated. This issue
    would be solved if there was a collaborative agreement for data or service sharing
    with the national and or international official sources to grant direct access
    to their database via HTTPs or FTP [78]. Controversially, the web data scraping
    approach remains a topic of debate and is strictly restricted in some parts of
    the world, despite environmental data being publicly provided on the internet.
    It is, therefore, essential to check for licensing or copyright restrictions on
    the extracted data and to share the custom-made scraper code with the scientific
    community. We, therefore, will publish the codes in Github so that others can
    discover, study, and build on what we have done. This was one of the establishing
    goals for the scalability of the WMS development in other regions. 4.3. Output
    Validation The correlation matrices revealed that dam and reservoir water volumes
    were positively correlated with the drought indices, but the overall TCI correlation
    values did not give a strong indication of the changes of surface water volumes
    and groundwater levels. This indicates the overall accuracy and validity of the
    WMS performance in multiple ways. First, the observational data we web-scraped
    from the national and international official sources can guide the appropriate
    remote sensing indices to best represent current and past events. Second, spatiotemporal
    distribution mapping services help the monitoring from point-based to region-based.
    Third, long-term series of hydrological and meteorological data can enrich the
    short time-series of remotely sensed data through simulation [79,80]. In our assessment,
    the WMS supplements existing knowledge of drought coherence in the LMR by assessing
    and providing quantitatively spatiotemporal variations (10–30 m) of local surface
    water changes and local drought evolution. Moreover, the WMS also highlights that
    the gridded drought datasets can be a reasonable alternative to observational
    station data for surface water change and drought assessments where observed data
    is not readily available. There was a negative correlation between the different
    drought indices, NDVI, TCI, VCI, VHI, and groundwater levels. This suggests that
    further investigation and more detailed analyses of the influence of different
    drought types on groundwater condition should consider other in-situ factors,
    such as precipitation, soil moisture, wind speed, temperature, clouds, vegetation
    coverage, and other weather variables. The particular attention should be paid
    to the physical properties of land cover in the adjacent areas of the groundwater
    wells, the hydraulic properties of aquifers, and human interventions. Comprehensive
    data and information on various parameters of the groundwater drought are needed
    for operational decision-making and planning, policy development, and infrastructure
    design at national and basin levels [21]. 4.4. Limitations of Optical Remote Sensing
    Imageries In the case application, there were gaps in the spatiotemporal information
    appearing in some parts of the Chi River Basin, due to a cloud contamination issue.
    This is especially a known issue for optical remote sensing imageries, such as
    Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2. Specifically, these imageries are subject to data loss
    due to cloud coverage hindering the retrieval of spatiotemporal information when
    using them from the visible to infrared optical spectrum [80,81,82,83]. It is,
    therefore, necessary to detect and remove clouds while pre-processing of the imageries
    to avoid inclusion of cloud-contaminated composite pixels into image processing
    [84]. Strong seasonal changes of rainfall and atmospheric patterns is a dominant
    feature of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) in the LMR and leads to the
    formation of different cloud patterns throughout the year [85,86]. This, consequently,
    has a high determining impact in the region to acquire cloud-free imageries. Hence,
    it is essential to remove cloudy pixels from the imageries to have a reasonably
    consistent coverage over a location, preserving a non-cloudy patch of image while
    there is loss of data in the other areas. This is particularly exemplified in
    the monsoon months (June–November) when entire scenes are covered by clouds, rendering
    images useless for the generation of remote sensing indices and causing a gap
    in the analysis. It is a caveat that must considered when building an operational
    system. There have been few effective approaches of reducing the cloud issue when
    using Landsat-Sentinel 2 fusion or Optical-SAR fusion imageries, which have different
    overpass time-dates and, thus, can increase the number of cloud-free pixels [86,87,88].
    4.5. User Interface and Future Work At the moment, actual processing and visualization
    of vegetation water stress simulation within the developed WMS is assembled in
    a very simple and a user-friendly interface (i.e., sliders, study basin, vegetation
    index, etc.; see Figure 3). WMS allows user feedbacks on interface inputs and
    the core functions for creating drought and water monitoring information that
    allow the participation of users (mainly focusing on water managers and decision-makers),
    so they can evaluate the system performance and provide feedback from their direct
    experience. This is, thus, the beta version WMS, which is a fully functional system
    and will evolve into a fully designed graphical user interface in the future version.
    4.6. Utilization and Maintenance of the WMS There is a continuous endeavor to
    create a resourceful WMS, with the goal of enhancing local vegetation water stress
    monitoring and generating timely and accurate drought information and characteristics
    of water dynamics. This development is highly scalable and provides tools, databases,
    and networking services that give government agencies an unprecedented opportunity
    to harness useful, real-time information about water and drought simulation. However,
    the government often lack the dedicated expertise and resources to collect, analyze,
    and create scientific information or products that can inform decision-making
    processes and assist multi-level policymakers to navigate the potential risks
    associated with water changes and drought evolution. Thus, the products are available
    to different interest groups for visualization and exploration [21,31]. The practical
    solution would be engaging the government with a team of developers in the development
    process. To utilize WMS and interpret its output, user requires a good knowledge
    about the variables in different drought algorithms, for instance, the correlation
    of vegetation and temperature dynamics during the annual cycle (NDVI) and the
    contributing factors of temperature and soil saturation affecting vegetation health
    (VCI and TCI) [16,48,56,75,76], that will help gain a more thorough understanding
    of the bio-physical processes and their relationships, causing potential impacts
    of vegetation water stress. 4.7. Supporting Water Management Decisions and the
    SDGs The WMS of this paper validated the usefulness of multi-source data and advanced
    digital technology for monitoring water dynamics and assessing vegetation water
    stress at the local scale. The WMS currently provides more readily and simplified
    drought simulation information about the complex and slow evolution of drought
    phenomena at a 10–30 m spatial resolution. The WMS can be used in a participatory
    process in order to improve effective communication and transparency with end-user
    decision makers, water managers, and the general public. The simulation information
    of the WMS can be taken as a primary analysis of drought and water level changes.
    Further, it can be used to quantify potential changes and their cascading impacts
    in agricultural production, irrigation, and water resources management. This level
    of information provides changes in scale and, over time, guides ways of dealing
    with an alarming situation, such as drought, flood, irrigation scheduling, land
    use planning, and crop management. This is considered to be an innovative methodological
    framework that enables it to fully explore the feedback of human decisions on
    the environmental dynamics and vice versa. The drought simulation information
    can be used to establish benchmarks or trigger points as a quantitative basis
    for making critical decisions, to design disaster risk reduction policies, and
    to monitor the effectiveness of the policies. It will also be important to have
    an indicator for preparedness and recovery time fitted in to the local environments.
    Given these demonstrations, they can enhance the methodological and developmental
    framework to support evidence-based policy making towards achieving the SDGs,
    formalizing coordinated multi-source observational data and digital technologies
    (remote sensing, GEE cloud computing, and user interface) for supporting national
    and local governments to improve the quality of their decision-making, and assisting
    the governments to increase efficiency and effectiveness in drought and water
    resource management. 5. Conclusions This paper shows that we have begun the development
    of the high-resolution drought monitoring system to provide evidence-based information
    to support decision-makers at the local scales (10–30 m). The WMS outputs can
    help establish or prepare proactive measures for water, agriculture, and drought
    management strategies on a near real-time basis. Using the developed WMS, local
    drought evolution and changes of small-scale river basins (<10,000 km2) can be
    practically assessed within 2 weeks. The results obtained from the WMS drought
    indices are useful for the primary analysis and can be further used to study different
    drought types and monitor the effects of droughts on vegetation growth (NDVI),
    vegetation moisture condition (VCI), land surface temperature (TCI), and vegetation
    health (VHI). This is a vital step for local food security, land and water management,
    and beyond. We anticipate that the beta version of the current WMS development
    will bring more progress in the application of high-resolution operational and
    research communities. We will continue to enhance the performance of water monitoring
    and drought hazards at the high spatial resolution, improve graphical visualization
    in the front-end interface, increase functionalities in the back- and front-end
    systems, and better assess spatial and temporal drought monitoring index variations.
    This newly developed WMS is geared toward the early warning of water and agricultural
    development and progress on the SDGs. Utilization of digital innovation and capacity
    development will be aggressively pursued with target users in the tested basin.
    The WMS will also widen the abilities of decision-makers to monitor and foresee
    extreme weather events earlier and with high spatial accuracy. The new high-resolution
    capacity of the WMS enables us to help with precision water and agriculture and
    the ability to move from the problem of detection to the mitigation of negative
    consequences due to water and drought anomalies. Continuously advancing digital
    technologies (GEE, remote sensing, and data sciences) will strengthen the ability
    to estimate the potential effectiveness of applied technology to optimize adverse
    impacts in a more proactive way. Author Contributions Conceptualization, O.-u.P.;

  limitations:
  - The current development of the study has not yet offered near real-time drought
    monitoring information using hydrological and meteorological drought indices.
  - Different drought indices for drought monitoring have their limitations.
  - The particular attention should be paid to the physical properties of land cover
    in the adjacent areas of the groundwater wells, the hydraulic properties of aquifers,
    and human interventions.
  - This is especially a known issue for optical remote sensing imageries, such as
    Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2.
  - Strong seasonal changes of rainfall and atmospheric patterns is a dominant feature
    of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) in the LMR and leads to the formation
    of different cloud patterns throughout the year.
  - This is, thus, the beta version WMS, which is a fully functional system and will
    evolve into a fully designed graphical user interface in the future version.

  explanation: This study investigates the use of edge computing in automated irrigation
    systems to improve resilience and fault tolerance. Edge computing brings computational
    resources closer to the data source, enabling localized decision-making and control
    without relying heavily on cloud connectivity. This can reduce latency and improve
    response times in situations where reliable internet access is limited.
  extract_1: '"Edge computing offers several advantages for automated irrigation systems,
    including the ability to make decisions and take actions locally, without relying
    on a cloud connection. This can improve the system''s resilience and fault tolerance,
    as it can continue to operate even if the cloud connection is lost."'
  extract_2: '"Edge devices can also process data more quickly than cloud-based systems,
    which can be critical in situations where timely decisions are needed, such as
    when responding to changes in soil moisture or weather conditions."'

  description: Soil salinization is a widespread environmental hazard and a major
    abiotic constraint affecting global food production and threatening food security.
    Salt-affected cropland is widely distributed in China, and the problem of salinization
    in the Hetao Irrigation District (HID) in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
    is particularly prominent. The salt-affected soil in Inner Mongolia is 1.75 million
    hectares, accounting for 14.8% of the total land. Therefore, mapping saline cropland
    in the irrigation district of Inner Mongolia could evaluate the impacts of cropland
    soil salinization on the environment and food security. This study hypothesized
    that a reasonably accurate regional map of salt-affected cropland would result
    from a ground sampling approach based on PlanetScope images and the methodology
    developed by Sentinel multi-sensor images employing the machine learning algorithm
    in the cloud computing platform. Thus, a model was developed to create the salt-affected
    cropland map of HID in 2021 based on the modified cropland base map, valid saline
    and non-saline samples through consistency testing, and various spectral parameters,
    such as reflectance bands, published salinity indices, vegetation indices, and
    texture information. Additionally, multi-sensor data of Sentinel from dry and
    wet seasons were used to determine the best solution for mapping saline cropland.
    The results imply that combining the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data could map
    the soil salinity in HID during the dry season with reasonable accuracy and close
    to real time. Then, the indicators derived from the confusion matrix were used
    to validate the established model. As a result, the combined dataset, which included
    reflectance bands, spectral indices, vertical transmit–vertical receive (VV) and
    vertical transmit–horizontal receive (VH) polarization, and texture information,
    outperformed the highest overall accuracy at 0.8938, while the F1 scores for saline
    cropland and non-saline cropland are 0.8687 and 0.9109, respectively. According
    to the analyses conducted for this study, salt-affected cropland can be detected
    more accurately during the dry season by using just Sentinel images from March
    to April. The findings of this study provide a clear explanation of the efficiency
    and standardization of salt-affected cropland mapping in arid and semi-arid regions,
    with significant potential for applicability outside the current study area.

  explanation: In this research, a combination of spatial and spectral information
    is used to generate a salt-affected irrigated cropland map in an arid and semi-arid
    region. By utilizing the complementarity of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data, the
    model achieves high accuracy and robustness for salt-affected cropland mapping
    under different climatic conditions. The study not only provides a reliable and
    cost-effective approach for large-scale salt-affected cropland mapping, but also
    has significant implications for precision agriculture, sustainable land management,
    and food security in arid and semi-arid regions.

    a matter of concern in agriculture, as the excess salt hinders crop growth by
    obstructing the ability to uptake water. In another sense, it causes a loss in
    soil fertility and leads to the desertification of cropland [1,2]. According to
    the estimation released by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), there
    are more than 424 million hectares of topsoil (0–30 cm) and 833 million hectares
    of subsoil (30–100 cm) are salt-affected around the globe (8.7% of the planet)
    [3]. Most of them can be found in naturally arid or semi-arid environments in
    Africa, Asia and Latin America [4]. Soils are easily affected by salt in arid
    and semi-arid regions where low rainfall and high evapotranspiration lead to the
    concentration of salts such as sodium, magnesium and calcium to form saline soils
    [5,6,7,8]. FAO launched the Global Map of Salt-Affected Soils in 2021, although
    the salt-affected soil of China has not been included in that. Nonetheless, estimates
    show that 20 to 50% of irrigated soils across all continents are too salty, implying
    that over 1.5 billion people face significant challenges in meeting rising food
    demand due to severe cropland salinity and cropland degradation [9]. Saline cropland
    is an essential part of reserve cropland in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
    in China and is an integral part of the cropland restoration program [10]. The
    salt-affect soil in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is mainly disturbed in
    the Xiliao River Plain in the east and Hetao Irrigation District (HID) in the
    west. The cropland of HID is dominated by saline soil and accounts for 30.5% of
    the saline cropland in Inner Mongolia [10]. In the early stage of the reclamation
    HID, flood irrigation without drainage facilities caused the secondary salinization
    of the field soil. For now, cropland salinization has gradually evolved into the
    main factor restricting the sustainable development of agriculture in HID. Therefore,
    the severe salinity cropland is a typical area for the agricultural management
    department’s soil rehabilitation program, which has attracted the interest of
    many academics [11,12]. The cropland soil salinity in HID is mainly adapted from
    the irrigation water of the Yellow River. Only 20% of the initial salt can be
    discharged through drainage, while 80% of the salt is kept in the soil of the
    irrigation area, showing a salinization trend [13]. Soil salinity will adversely
    affect plant growth, crop yields, and underground water quality, leading to soil
    erosion and land degradation [14]. The hazard of soil salinity is not limited
    to the environment but also includes the economy. For example, for the secondary
    salinization of the land in the Sultanate of Oman, the direct economic loss from
    mild to moderate salinity is about 1604 US dollars per hectare, and the direct
    economic loss from mild to severe salinity is as high as 4352 US dollars per hectare
    [15]. Thus, knowing the spatial distribution of salt-affected cropland is an urgent
    need to alleviate the contradiction between humans and land [16,17], which is
    also vital for promoting the high-quality development of the national agricultural
    economy [18]. At the same time, the eradicate because of dynamic and accessible
    restress from salinization after agricultural activities seriously endangers the
    sustainable development of agriculture and its productivity, which makes the timely
    detection of salt-affected cropland within HID with limited cropland resources
    particularly urgent [19,20,21]. Traditionally, soil salinity was measured by collecting
    soil samples and analyzing them in a laboratory to determine their solute concentration
    or electronic conductivity [22]. However, due to intensive sampling being time-consuming
    and expensive, the spatial variability of soil salinity is hardly fully characterized
    traditionally in a large area. Remote sensing data and techniques can more effectively
    provide economic and rapid tools and methods for mapping soil salinity [23]. Remote
    sensing data and its analyzing processes have gradually become the most convenient
    method of mapping soil salinity since black-and-white and color aerial photographs
    were used to describe salinity-stressed soils in the 1960s. Multispectral imagery
    such as Landsat [24], Sentinel [25], IKONOS [26], QuickBird [27] and UAV-Borne
    [28] are highly suitable for evaluating soil salinity. In the last three decades
    of research on monitoring saline soils, multispectral sensors have been mainly
    used. In addition, some researchers have emphasized the importance of ground sample
    data [29,30]. In practical applications, multispectral sensors also show limitations,
    as their spectral resolution and fewer bands affect the quality and quantity of
    information provided. Many current studies pointed out this limitation, thus monitoring
    the salinity using hyperspectral [31] and thermal infrared data [32], even Synthetic
    Aperture Radar (SAR) data [33] in the last few years. Nevertheless, the broad
    acquisition capability of Sentinel data, high spatial resolution (10 m), and the
    combination of active and passive remote sensing data can compensate for the deficiencies
    of multispectral data widely available for free. Remote sensing data with meter-level
    high resolution or sub-meter-level resolution (IKONOS, QuickBird, WroldView-2,
    GF series) have also been gradually introduced into salinity mapping research
    and have become indispensable data sources. Mapping the salinity of cropland combining
    high spatial resolution images and ground sampling data using machine learning
    algorithms is mainly carried out at the field scale or farm scale [34]. However,
    the validity and reliability of such a method need to be assessed in a larger
    area. Recent years have seen an increase in nonparametric machine learning techniques,
    particularly Random Forest (RF), to calculate soil salinity [35,36]. Since it
    can manage the high dimensionality and multicollinearity of remote sensing data
    with excellent classification accuracy and insensitivity to overfitting, RF is
    one of the most extensively used algorithms in land cover classification. Additionally,
    it has been stated that RF in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform provides
    unassailable benefits in the remote sensing classification of land cover in a
    large area [37,38]. Some researchers have demonstrated that RF outperforms other
    popular nonparametric machine learning algorithms, which can significantly increase
    soil salinity mapping accuracy [25,39]. However, many scholars have shown that
    using remote sensing technology to map cropland salinity in arid and semi-arid
    regions is challenging [23,24,40]. It is mainly because the bare ground and other
    sparse vegetation are easily confused with saline soil in spectral reflectance
    [33,41]. Alternatively, the method based on spectral reflectance may lead to unreliable
    results when the soil is moisturizing or the soil salts are not exposed on the
    soil surface in crystalline form but mixed with other soil components [42]. In
    this case, SAR data, frequently employed in detecting soil salinity, can capture
    information that is challenging to acquire using multispectral imagery. Various
    remote sensing data have already been used to study saline soil in HID. Nonetheless,
    the majority of these studies have focused on single sensors rather than multi-sensor
    images. Therefore, to comprehend the main mechanism causing agricultural salinization
    and degradation, a salt-affected map using a wide range of remote sensing data
    must be acquired in almost real time. To fill this gap, the following questions
    will be addressed in this study: Is the PlanetScope image of April appropriate
    for sample collection employing the Visual Interpretation strategy? If so, how
    can the samples’ validity—which includes cropland that is both saline and non-saline—be
    estimated? How to quickly and efficiently map salinized cropland using Sentinel-1
    and Sentinel-2 data freely available in GEE? These questions are unavoidable in
    multi-sensor data-based mapping of salinized cropland, and addressing them is
    the primary goal of the current study. The specific objectives of this research
    are to: Create a cropland base map using global land cover data from ESA WorldCover
    while masking off roads and irrigation ditches collected from the electronic map
    of HID; Evaluate the validity of samples, comprising both saline and non-saline
    cropland, using the quantile and quantile plots testing method; Create a multi-variable
    dataset for salt-affected cropland identification using VV + VH dual polarization,
    reflectance bands, and vegetation indices; Determine the best solution for mapping
    salt-affected cropland in dry and wet seasons using the overall accuracies and
    indicators from the confusion matrix of various datasets. 2. Materials and Methods
    2.1. The Study Area HID is located at the top of the northernmost Bay of the Yellow
    River and spans a region situated at 106°11′35″E–109°53′52″E and 40°10′30″–41°16′43″N.
    HID comprises five counties in Bayannur city with a total area of 17,243.23 km2
    (Figure 1), with 733,333.33 hectares of cropland. The crop yield has been stable
    at more than 5 billion tons for a long time. It is Asia’s largest artesian irrigation
    area and one of China’s three largest irrigation areas. In addition, HID was included
    in the World Irrigation Engineering Heritage List in 2019. Spring wheat, corn,
    vegetables, citrus, and sunflowers are the main crops in HID (see phenology of
    main crops in HID in Table S1). Vegetables are grown in a few places after the
    spring wheat harvest, while other crops are sown as one-season crops. Figure 1.

    and PlanetScope images acquired from 1 to 13 April in 2021 (shown in false color
    composited-R: NIR (Near-Infrared) band, G: Green band, B: Blue band). (b) The
    location of HID in China and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. (c) Field photographs
    taken on April 2021, showing the salt on the soil surface before crops were planted.
    A typical temperate continental climate prevails in the study area. The number
    of hours of sunshine per year is 3210.8–3305.8; the total amount of solar radiation
    is 146–152 kcal per square centimeter; the average yearly temperature is 6.1–7.6
    °C; the daily average temperature difference is 13–14 °C. Additionally, the average
    annual evaporation is 2200 mm, which is nearly twelve times the average annual
    precipitation of 180 mm. 2.2. Data 2.2.1. Filed Sampling The sample data for mapping
    saline cropland are based initially on the ground survey samples in previous studies.
    In contrast, the PlanetScope images acquired from April 2021 were utilized for
    delineating the reference samples using a visual interpretation strategy in this
    study, which was mainly because of the controlling measurements for preventing
    the COVID-19 epidemic during the critical period for collecting the ground truth
    samples. To accurately distinguish salt-affected soil from non-salt-affected soil
    on the cropland base map of HID, 1000 saline samples and 1000 non-saline samples
    were selected, as shown in Figure 2. High-resolution PlanetScope images were used
    as a reference to assess whether the soil was saline or non-saline, and each sample
    was labeled as either salinized or non-salinized, following the principle introduced
    in Figure 1. The study area is a typical arid irrigation farming area in northern
    China, with no winter crops grown throughout the year. This means the cropland
    surface in the irrigation area is bare outside from the previous year’s harvest
    to the sowing of the following year. Therefore, the soil salinity is in layers
    0–10 cm from March to April, which means the salinity of soil is on the surface
    and can be distinguished by the naked eye. This phenomenon leads to the surface
    reflectance of the saline soil captured by the imagery is also significantly different
    from that of the healthy soil. Figure 2. (a) The distribution of the samples of
    saline and non-saline cropland, (b) the samples in the false color composited
    PlanetScope image (R: NIR band, G: Green band, B: Blue band). Moreover, to ensure
    the accuracy of the artificially delineated saline and non-saline cropland samples,
    the number and spatial distribution must be as consistent as possible. Therefore,
    after the initial sample data are selected, the validity of the samples needs
    to be checked to ensure that the samples can adequately represent the category
    to which they belong. In this part, the quantile and quantile plots testing method
    will be applied to validate whether the selected saline and non-saline samples
    obey the normal distribution (Section 2.4). 2.2.2. Remote Sensing Data Collection
    PlanetScope PlanetScope, operated by Planet, is a constellation of approximately
    130 satellites that is able to image the entire land surface of the earth every
    day (a daily collection capacity of 200 million km²/day). PlanetScope images have
    a resolution of about 3 m per pixel. The four-band frame imager with a butcher-block
    filter provides Blue, Green, Red and NIR bands. The PlanetScope Ortho Scene Level
    3B Product has been used for selecting samples visually since it is an orthorectified,
    scaled Top of Atmosphere (TOA) Radiance Surface Reflectance image product suitable
    for analytic and visual applications. Sentinel The European Space Agency (ESA)
    was renamed the EU Global Security Monitoring GMES as the Copernicus program,
    considering service duplication and discontinuity in 2012. Sentinel satellites
    are part of the Copernicus program. Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 are two Earth observation
    satellites currently in service with high-resolution sensors that can be shared
    globally. The Sentinel-1 mission consists of a constellation of two polar-orbiting
    satellites, Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B, operating day and night to perform C-band
    synthetic aperture radar imaging. SAR data with a 10 m resolution are available
    for 12 days revisit period. Commonly used Class 1 products include Single-Look
    Complex (SLC) and Ground Range Detection (GRD) products. SLC products preserve
    phase information and process at natural pixel spacing; GRD products incorporate
    detected amplitudes and multi-look to reduce speckle effects. Currently, only
    GRD products with Sentinel-1 data are integrated with GEE. The Sentinel-1 SAR
    imagery, in the Interferometric Wide (IW) mode, C-band, with dual polarization
    VV and VH, was acquired from 1 March 2020, to 31 April 2020, in coincidence with
    the field samples’ selection period. The Sentinel-2 mission consists of two solar
    polar-orbiting satellites, Sentinel-2A (23 June 2015–present) and Sentinel-2B
    (7 March 2017–present), distributed in a sun-synchronous orbit, each other into
    a 180° phase. Currently, Sentinel-2 mainly provides two product data: L1C and
    L2A. The L1C product is the reflectance data of TOA after orthorectification and
    sub-pixel geometric precision correction; the L2A product is the surface reflectance
    data product obtained using the Sen2cor tool officially provided by ESA to perform
    atmospheric correction on L1C. Data are available across Europe from October and
    globally from January 2017. Each Sentinel-2 satellite carries a multi-spectrometer
    MSI with 13 bands in the Visible, NIR, Narrow NIR and Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR)
    spectral ranges, including three Red Edge bands. Sentinel-2 Leve-1C and Leve-1A
    data products have been integrated into GEE (find details in Table A1). Considering
    that the Leve-1C product has more extended data availability, the Leve-1C TOA
    data product of Sentinel-2 has been selected for mapping saline cropland. 2.2.3.
    Ancillary Data An initial cropland base map was created using the ESA WorldCover
    global land cover data package, which was developed based on the Sentinel-1 and
    Sentinel-2 at 10 m resolution, and it may be accessed at https://viewer.esa-worldcover.org/worldcover,
    accessed on 16 October 2022. The cropland category is 40 in the ESA WorldCover
    global land cover data. 2.3. Generating the Cropland Base Map In this section,
    the roads and irrigation ditches with a resolution of 2.4 m provided by AutoNavi
    Electronic Maps will be used to mask out the non-cropland areas within the fields
    of HID. Firstly, the GDAL module of Python extracted the roads and irrigation
    ditches from the electronic maps and then converted them to the SHP file. Secondly,
    the RASTERIO in Python was captured to mask the non-cropland parts from the WorldCover
    global cropland cover data. 2.4. Quantile and Quantile Plots Testing Generally,
    the same type of ground objects should have the same or similar spectral reflectance
    characteristics in the same wavelength range of remote sensing images. The saline
    soils in arid regions mainly contain salts such as chlorides, sulfates and carbonates.
    Before the first irrigation of spring sowing in the Yellow River irrigation district,
    the salinity in the topsoil of 0–10 cm would be at the highest level, and saline
    elements would cover the soil surface, whitening the soil surface, as shown in
    Figure 1c. Spring wheat is the earliest sowing crop in the study area that cannot
    be grown in saline soil. Other crops, such as vegetables, corn and fruit, can
    be grown in soils with slight to moderate salinity. Sunflower is the main salt-tolerant
    crop and can even be planted in severe saline soil. Therefore, the 3 m resolution
    PlanetScope images obtained in early April (spring wheat grows in the Emergence
    Stage and can cover the ground surface) were chosen to collect sample data additionally
    to solve the problem that ground truth sample data are difficult to distribute
    evenly in a large area (Figure 2b). It can be assumed that the eigenvalues of
    the saline and non-saline samples in different wavelength ranges obey the normal
    distribution. Conversely, when a specific sample contains anomalies, its distribution
    will deviate from the normal distribution. Therefore, the quantile graphical method
    (Quantile and Quantile Plot, Q-Q plot) can be used for sample validity tests for
    elements inconsistent during sample selection caused by visual interpretation
    errors. The Q-Q plot is a graphical technique for determining if two datasets
    come from populations with a common distribution. A Q-Q plot is the quantiles
    of the first dataset against the quantiles of the second dataset. Thus, the point
    (x, y) on the graph represents the quantile of the second dataset (y-coordinate)
    and the same quantile of the corresponding first dataset (x-coordinate). Therefore,
    the Q-Q plot will approximately lie on the line y = x superior if the two distributions
    are the same or similar. In this study, the x-axis was set as the normal data
    quantiles of the sample’s reflectance value. In contrast, the y-axis was set as
    the normal theoretical quantiles to test whether the two categories of samples
    obey the normal distribution. The reflectance of the ten bands (B2, B3, B4, B5,
    B6, B7, B8, B8A, B11, B12) of the Sentinel-2 images observed from March to April
    2021 (reduced to mean value on Google Earth Engine) are set as examples to illustrate
    the Q-Q plot (find the testing results in Section 3.2). 2.5. Modeling Strategy
    The technical frame of this study is illustrated in Figure 3. First, the reflectance
    bands of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images were selected via spatial resolution
    to ensure the generalization and robustness of the models. In this step, bands
    at 60 m resolution were dedicated primarily to detecting atmospheric features
    and therefore are not included in subsequent research. Thus, indices and texture
    variables based on spectral reflectance were created at 10 m resolution. On the
    other hand, the backscattering signal of the Sentinel-1 VV + VH dual-polarization
    also participated in the modelling process at 10 m resolution. Figure 3. Technical
    framework of this study. 2.5.1. Spectral Salinity Indices The wide range of wavelengths
    of the Sentinel-2 data has an excellent capability for remote sensing monitoring
    and mapping requirements of soil salinity [25]. Therefore, the mean values of
    Sentinel-2 spectral reflectance were included in the combined dataset to map the
    saline cropland in HID accurately. Table A1 (Section 2.2.2) lists the bands used
    in this study. Applying spectral indices to investigate cropland salinity is built
    upon the different spectral behavior associated with image pixels of the ground
    object [43]. The salinization can dramatically change soil surface characteristics,
    leading to a significant difference from healthy soil, especially during the best
    monitoring period before the growing season in the arid and semi-arid regions
    with low vegetation cover and more exposed soil. Moreover, the presence of salinity-tolerant
    crop coverage on the soil may also be a marker to reflect the soil salinization,
    thus allowing indirect mapping of salinity-stressed cropland [44]. On the other
    hand, unhealthy vegetation photosynthetic activity resulted in increased visible
    reflectance and decreased near-infrared reflectance (NIR) [25]. Therefore, several
    vegetation indices (VIs), such as Normalized Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil-Adjusted
    Vegetation Index (SAVI), Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI) and
    Modified Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI), were used to map soil salinity.
    Numerous academics have regarded the VIs performance as appropriate for estimating
    soil salinity using remote sensing images [45]. To create a multi-variable model
    to map the saline cropland in an arid and semi-arid area, a succession of VIs
    commonly used for monitoring soil salinity was proposed in this study. Corresponding
    to this, other researchers have created various salinity indices, including the
    Normalized Difference Salinity Index (NDSI) and Salinity Index (SI), to identify
    and map soil salinity. Table A2 provides specific information. On the other hand,
    for combinations of two or three wavelengths in remote sensing images, extensive
    information can be obtained from the indices determined by spectral reflectance
    at the 10 m resolution. 2.5.2. Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix Texture variables
    can provide valuable spatial information, reflecting the spatial distribution
    of the gray levels of remote sensing images and representing the spatial relationship
    between image features and the surrounding environment [46]. For instance, soil
    salinization in HID refers to the phenomenon in which the salt in the bottom soil
    or groundwater rises to the surface with capillary water. After the water evaporates,
    the salt accumulates in the surface layer. Thus, this phenomenon could significantly
    change the texture features of the land surface. The textures are essential for
    identifying objects or regions of interest, whether in photographs, aerial photos,
    or satellite images. GEE provides the Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) function
    to calculate broad applicability textures and can be utilized in various image
    classification applications [47,48,49]. In this study, the 14 GLCM indicators
    proposed by Robert et al. [50] and four other indicators proposed by Conners et
    al. [51] were used to construct texture variables. The reflectance-based texture
    variables based on the B2 with the highest accuracy of the Sentinel-2 images were
    obtained in GEE for modeling the mapping strategy for saline cropland in HID.
    2.5.3. Classifier and Accuracy Assessment Random Forest is one of the machine
    learning algorithms widely used in land cover classification [52] and has been
    applied to the remote sensing monitoring research of saline cropland gradually
    [53]. Furthermore, the importance evaluation function of the variables of Random
    Forest can screen out the variable that contributes the most to classification.
    Therefore, it can support further research on soil salinity monitoring. Random
    Forest can build a multi-layer decision tree and randomly select subsets and variables
    of training samples. The classification accuracy of the Random Forest classifier
    on the GEE platform uses the incremental step of 100 trees to reach the highest
    accuracy with 600 trees. In addition, 70% of random samples are used to train
    the classifier, and 30% of random samples are used to validate the accuracy of
    the saline cropland classification. Overall Accuracy (OA), Producer Accuracy (PA),
    and User Accuracy (UA) were used to evaluate the performance of Random Forest
    classifiers on the GEE. OA is the ratio of the total number of correctly classified
    pixels to the total number of pixels (the total number of pixels in the ground
    reference samples). UA corresponds to the probability that a randomly selected
    pixel from the map is classified as correct in the ground reference samples. PA
    corresponds to the likelihood that the reference sample is correctly classified
    on the map. The Kappa coefficient was previously considered an indicator that
    can be used for consistency checks and to measure classification effects. However,
    Foody [54] points out that the Kappa coefficient is not a measure of accuracy
    but an agreement beyond chance. Hence, it is unnecessary and should not be used
    in typical remote sensing applications. Therefore, Foody [54] argues that researchers
    should abandon the Kappa coefficient as a measure of accuracy instead of per-class
    accuracy estimation and confusion matrices to evaluate machine learning classification
    accuracy. Based on this, the Kappa coefficient is not used as a criterion for
    assessing the accuracies in this study. In addition, to test the robustness of
    the RF on GEE, the F1 scores (F1 = 2 × UA × PA/ (UA + PA)) of saline cropland
    and non-saline cropland were also calculated. The F1-score is the harmonic mean
    of producer and user accuracies. In studies where the classification samples are
    not perfectly balanced, the F1 score is a strong indicator for testing the stability
    of classification. The F1 score ranges from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating
    better classification performance. 3. Results 3.1. Cropland Base Map The cropland
    base map without roads and irrigation ditches was generated through the two steps
    introduced in Section 2.3. As a result, the boundaries of fields are more prominent,
    and the problem of adhesion between field pixels in the study area is eliminated,
    as shown in Figure 4. There are 887,938.39 hectares of cropland in the study area.
    In addition, the area calculated from remote sensing results was compared with
    the data of The Third National Land Survey of China in 2020; a minimal difference
    between the modified cropland area and that of in land survey was found, and the
    specific data are relevant in Table 1. Therefore, the cropland base map is reliable
    and can be a basis for consecutive research. Figure 4. Cropland distribution in

    map of modified cropland at 10 m resolution. Table 1. Cropland area derived from
    remote sensing data and areas included in The Third National Land Survey. 3.2.
    Sample Validity Test The samples’ pixel reflectance means values derived from
    the ten spectral bands of Sentinel-2 were acquired during the mapping period in
    this study (from March to April). Then, Origin 2018 was used to generate the Q-Q
    plot diagrams of the values of non-saline and saline cropland samples, as shown
    in Figure A1. In addition, the R-square (R2) between the normal data quantiles
    and normal theoretical quantiles is a practical approach to showing the validity
    of samples. The specific R2 values can be found in Table 2. Table 2. R2 values
    between normal data quantiles and normal theoretical quantiles of samples for
    the various bands of the Sentinel-2 image. It can be found that the samples of
    either non-saline or saline cropland obey the normal distribution in the validation
    results. The scatter points in the Q-Q diagram of the saline and non-saline cropland
    before the growing season (from March to April) tend to fall on the x = y reference
    line, and the R2 of all sample data is above 0.9. Whereas, the R2 values of both
    non-saline and saline cropland samples on the B2 appear lowest (0.93 and 0.90,
    respectively) in all bands. This is because salt-affected soil has a valley of
    absorption close to the blue wavelength. Because of this, the reflectance is also
    lower than at other wavelengths. The sample points on the other bands in Figure
    A1 lie on the line x = y except for the B2 band, demonstrating the linear relationship
    between the normal data quantiles and the normal theoretical quantiles. This indicates
    a high level of sample consistency between two distributions of sample data on
    the B3 to B12 (Green to SWIR2) bands. The results of the sample validity test
    show that the samples chosen in this study for two cropland classes before the
    growing season have adequate consistency and representativeness to meet the needs
    of the subsequent research. 3.3. Accuracy Assessment of Saline Cropland Mapping
    The other probability of mapping saline cropland in the dry or wet season was
    tested in this part. According to observing the total precipitation in the last
    decade (chart in Figure 1a), the precipitation peaks in August and September and
    has been set in the wet season, while there was less precipitation from March
    to April and can be set as the dry season. Therefore, the accuracies of each dataset,
    including (1) the Sentinel-1 dual-polarization VV + VH dataset, (2) textures of
    Sentinel-2 B2 band, (3) Sentinel-2 spectral band dataset, (4) indices built based
    on Sentinel-2, and (5) the dataset of combined Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 in different
    time intervals were assessed to present the performance of the modeling strategies
    in the dry and wet season. The box plot of validation results are presented in
    Figure A2, and the validation indicators are shown in Table A3. The results showed
    that the highest accuracy was achieved In the dry season from March to April,
    which was significantly higher than other time interval combinations. In comparison,
    no significant difference has been observed in the box plot of March, August and
    August to September. The result indicates that the two-month data combination
    in the dry season is the best solution for mapping saline cropland in HID. Thus,
    the dataset combined with March and April generated the salt-affected cropland
    map. Moreover, to clarify the best multi-variables with the highest accuracy for
    saline cropland mapping, the performances of the variables and their combinations
    were estimated, respectively, as shown in Figure 5 and Table A4. Figure 5. Classification
    accuracies of each variable and the combined datasets: Sentinel-1 indicates the
    mean value of Sentinel-1 dual-PolSAR (VV + VH) bands; Sentinel-2 suggests the
    combination of texture and indices derived from reflectance bands of Sentinel-2
    and original mean values of spectral bands. S1_S2 combined indicates the combination
    of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 datasets. As shown in Figure 5 and Table A4, the
    B2 band reflectance showed the highest accuracy (OA = 0.80) in the spectral bands
    of the Sentinel-2 data, which was followed by the B3 band. The Red Edge wavelength
    range is considered sensitive to green plants’ growth status [55]. Thus, the B5,
    B6 and B7 bands of Sentinel-2 data showed no obvious advantage for salt-affected
    soil mapping at 20 m resolution in this case, as shown in Figure 5. Notably, the
    visible band has higher advantages for identifying salt-affected soil than the
    Infrared band in the dry season. The VV + VH dual-polarization backscattering
    signal of Sentinel-1 data did not show competitive accuracy assessment results,
    with an overall accuracy of 0.68. The accuracy of the VH backscattering signal
    was higher than the VV backscattering signal, reaching 0.67 and 0.58, respectively.
    In addition, it can be seen in Table A4 that a very slight improvement (0.0019)
    has been detected in the assessment results by adding Sentinel-1 SAR data to Sentinel-2
    spectral data. In this case, the mapping of salinity-affected crops is not significantly
    impacted by the VV + VH dual-polarization backscattering information. SAR data,
    however, can also be an essential supplemental data source in overcast and rainy
    regions where continuous optical images are challenging to obtain. Each index
    variable’s OA was greater than 70%, which denotes high accuracy. With an OA of
    0.79, SI had the highest accuracy of any index, which was followed by MSAVI with
    an OA of 0.72. The degrees of accuracy for NDVI, SAVI, OSAVI, NDSI, and DVI are
    equivalent. These findings suggest that SI is the most appropriate indicator for
    saline cropland in salt-affected cropland mapping before the growing season in
    an arid and semi-arid region. In this situation, combining Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2
    (S1_S2 combined in Figure 5), modeling strategies provided the optimal solution
    for saline cropland mapping, with an OA of 0.8938. 3.4. The Map of Saline Cropland
    The dataset, including the spectrum reflectance, indices, texture information
    and PolSAR backscattering signal, produced the highest overall accuracy and F1
    score (non-saline cropland is 0.91 and saline cropland is 0.87). Therefore, the
    Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 combined datasets were selected for mapping the saline
    cropland before the growing season in HID. Furthermore, the cropland in HID was
    classified into two categories, as aforementioned. As seen in Figure 6, the amount
    of non-saline cropland in HID is more than the area of saline cropland, with 58.30%
    and 41.70% of cropland, respectively. The stretch between Wuyuan County to the
    west bank of Ulansuhai Nur is the largest saline cropland zone in HID. Additionally,
    the concentration of saline soil increases with proximity to the Yellow River
    Basin. As seen in Figure 6, the cropland is generally dispersed in strips toward
    the south and north to the east of Ulansuhai Nur. The majority of the cropland
    in the north uses drip irrigation, and some portions are watered by groundwater.
    Figure 6. The distribution of non-saline and saline cropland with the percentage
    pie chart. In contrast, the salinization is relatively high in the area irrigated
    mainly by the Yellow River in the south. As a result, there is less salinization
    than in the southern region. Numerous studies have shown that flood irrigating
    with Yellow River water causes soil salinization in HID. Therefore, the higher
    salinization is in keeping with the actual situation in areas irrigated with water
    from the Yellow River. 4. Discussion 4.1. Indices in Salt-Affected Cropland Mapping
    Index variables were important in previous research on salt-affected soil monitoring
    and inversion. The analysis based on SI-MSAVI is the most renowned among them
    and has been shown to invert soil salinity [56,57,58] accurately. Likewise, NDVI
    and DVI, commonly used to monitor vegetation status, are also widely used in land
    salinization monitoring research and are critical indicators [59,60,61]. A mapping
    methodology for salinized cropland was developed in this study using several variables
    based on two bands (see Table A2 for details). The Red and NIR bands produce all
    other indices besides the SI. Figure 7 shows that even though the saline and non-saline
    samples have clear absorption valleys in the visible wavelength range, their reflectance
    values significantly differ. In comparison, the reflectance value in the NIR wavelength
    range is relatively high, but no clear difference has been observed. Near the
    two bands of water vapor (945 nm) and cirrus (1375 nm) of the Sentinel-2 image,
    there are more wide absorption valleys but practically overlapping curves in the
    SWIR wavelength range; however, near the SWIR1 and SWIR2 bands, the difference
    becomes more evident. Nevertheless, when employing a single SWIR band for accuracy
    assessment, the result does not achieve the high accuracy of the visible band
    due to the SWIR band’s resolution of 20 m. Figure 7. Reflectance curve of non-saline
    and saline cropland samples over the wavelength range of Sentinel-2 data in dry
    season. Commonly, SI measures the direct relationship between Electrical Conductivity
    (EC) and moisture. This ratio shows the salinity concentration in the available
    water [62]. By utilizing the more pronounced differences between the two cropland
    sample types in the Blue and Red bands, the SI index based on the visible band
    in this study was the variable with the highest contribution and achieved higher
    classification accuracy. However, other indices have similar classification accuracy
    since they are both constructed from red and NIR bands. While NDVI and NDSI represent
    normalized differences between the Red and NIR bands of the Sentinel-2 image,
    NDVI is the NIR minus the Red and NDSI is the inverse. Thus, a positive value
    of NDVI and a negative value of NDSI at the same pixel are equivalent. However,
    when NDVI or NDSI are not employed, the overall accuracy of the salt-affected
    cropland mapping slightly decreases (the accuracy decreases by 0.0019 when NDVI
    is removed, and the accuracy drops by 0.0058 when NDSI is removed). Consequently,
    NDVI and NDSI have equal correlation coefficients with the sample data, which
    means positive correlation coefficients for NDVI and negative correlation coefficients
    for NDSI). Additionally, NDSI was found to be more sensitive for detecting saline
    cropland in the wet season with OA at 0.66, which is slightly higher than the
    accuracy that NDVI can achieve in the wet season with OA at 0.65. 4.2. Multi-Sensor
    Data Application in Saline Cropland Mapping Soil salinization is a severe problem
    faced by land worldwide, and the affected area is vast [18]. However, there is
    no exact standard for monitoring solutions due to different data sources and statistical
    methods. Unlike non-salt-affected land and other ground features, soil salinization
    has distinct and unique spectral reflectance characteristics and tends to show
    higher reflectance on spectral images [40,63,64,65]. Satellite remote sensing
    technology has irreplaceable advantages (near real-time and covering a large area)
    and good application prospects for observing soil salinity. Therefore, using multispectral
    remote sensing images to monitor the soil-affected cropland in an area with complex
    land surface objects is feasible. On the other hand, microwave remote sensing
    has been widely used in the inversion of surface soil moisture and salinity for
    a long time [66,67]. Since the C-band polarization radar data of the Sentinel-1
    satellite was introduced into civilian use, some breakthroughs have been made
    in soil moisture inversion research at the beginning [68,69]. However, the salinity
    change in the soil surface will affect the soil dielectric properties and thus
    will change the microwave emissivity of the land surface. Therefore, in addition
    to considering the impact of soil moisture alone, soil salinity has to be considered
    in areas with severe soil salinization [70,71,72]. As a result, the study of monitoring
    soil salinity using microwave remote sensing data has gradually attracted extensive
    attention [73,74]. The method combining the optical and microwave remote sensing
    data has been discussed preliminary in this study. However, many studies have
    shown that the identification ability of the backscattering coefficient will be
    significantly enhanced after the polarization decomposition of radar data. Nevertheless,
    the importance of radar data in this study is still minimal, which may be because
    the eigenvalues after polarization decomposition are more advantageous for identifying
    salt on the soil surface than the original backscattering coefficient. The GRD
    data provided in GEE do not have phase information, so it is impossible to realize
    GEE’s polarization decomposition. Hence, it is difficult to establish the eigenvalues
    after polarization decomposition in a large area to extract saline cropland. The
    application of remote sensing to earth observation is an essential means to understand
    the earth and study various natural phenomena in the future. Remote sensing technology
    is constantly developing, including many commercial satellite programs. As a result,
    the earth will be observed without a dead angle. In addition, the data volume
    will increase in geometric multiples; managing and using data efficiently and
    reasonably will be both a challenge and an opportunity for developing various
    algorithms and applications for salt-affected cropland monitoring. 4.3. Strongly
    Saline Cropland Abandonment in HID The ESA WorldCover global land cover data did
    not recognize some fields with severe salinization as cropland. However, it is
    a minor error, because these have been abandoned for many years. On the other
    hand, a few severely salinized croplands have been planted late for sunflower
    seeds because of their salt tolerance [75]. In either case, it points to the severely
    salinized cropland in HID under the high potential abandonment stress. Soil salinization
    has become an essential topic of global change research. The latest research shows
    that global soil salinization will be characterized by regional prominence, global
    intensification, and the coexistence of local salinization and intensification.
    Severely salinization is one of the most hazardous reasons why cropland is removed
    from production and then causes the abandonment globally of 0.3–1.5 million hectares
    per year [76]. It is generally recognized that a large proportion of salt-affected
    soils in irrigated areas occurs on land inhabited by smallholder farmers. However,
    salt-affected cropland degradation’s social and economic dimensions have received
    little attention compared to its biophysical aspects [77]. Well-known examples
    of salt-induced land degradation include the Aral Sea Basin (Amu-Darya and Syr-Darya
    River Basins) in Central Asian countries, the Indo-Gangetic Basin in India, the
    Indus Basin in Pakistan, the Yellow River Basin in China, the Euphrates Basin
    in Syria and Iraq, the Murray-Darling Basin in Australia, and the San Joaquin
    Valley in the United States. Severe salinity also reduces paddy yields in many
    previously productive land areas; many paddy fields in Jaffna Peninsula, Sri Lanka,
    have been abandoned and are currently becoming shrubland [78]. Nevertheless, there
    has been no comprehensive study on the contribution of soil salinity to reduced
    agricultural productivity and the abandonment of paddy lands in a region. A study
    based on the analysis of the spatiotemporal variation in cropland expansion and
    loss in Xinjiang over 20 years found that the abandonment was the primary reason
    for the loss of cropland, with soil salinization playing an increasingly major
    role in the cropland abandonment [79]. Furthermore, Wu et al. [80] found widespread
    abandonment of reclaimed land and tillage in Xinjiang. A major reason for this
    abandonment was soil salinization with as much as 12,680 km2 of cropland being
    affected. There was a strong sense of expansion in the land use pattern of humanity
    with a poor understanding of sustainable development in the last few decades in
    Inner Mongolia. As a result, the saline bare land in northeast China has been
    utilized to a certain extent. However, due to the lack of protective technology,
    paddy fields’ abandonment and salinization reappearance have also occurred in
    some areas after the high-intensity utilization of cropland. The extensive area
    saline cropland treatment was also implemented in 2022 with the government’s support
    since the abandoned cropland is an essential reserve in China. The efficient utilization
    of salinized land is vital to ensure national food security, especially under
    the current COVID-19 pandemic and the global background of frequent disasters;
    it is imminent to utilize the reserve cropland and control the salinity. 5. Conclusions
    In this study, after manual visual selection of samples, creation of a cropland
    base map of HID, and sample validity testing, a saline cropland identification
    model based on multi-sensor remote sensing data and the multi-variable dataset
    was built and achieved with high classification accuracy. One of these, the sample
    validity test method, was used for the first time in the saline cropland monitoring
    study and produced promising experimental results. The multi-variable dataset
    based on Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 multispectral images from March to April
    furthermore exhibits strong performance in the remote sensing mapping of salt-affected
    crops. The methodology and results reported in this study may be advantageous
    for mapping saline cropland before the growing season in arid and semi-arid regions.
    They can therefore be encouraged and utilized in a broader area. Supplementary

    agriculture is a breakthrough in digital farming technology, which facilitates
    the application of precise and exact amount of input level of water and fertilizer
    to the crop at the required time for increasing the yield. Since agriculture relies
    on direct rainfall than irrigation and the prediction of rainfall date is easily
    available from web source, the integration of rainfall prediction with precision
    agriculture helps to regulate the water consumption in farms. In this work, an
    edge computing model is developed for predicting soil moisture in real time and
    managing the water usage in accordance with rain prediction. A soil moisture prediction
    hybrid algorithm (SMPHA) has been developed that revolves around the decision-making

    IoT; offloading mechanism 1 Introduction It is evident that agriculture always
    has a specialized role in the anthrophonic evolution and has been serving as an
    important economic factor for the growth of a country [1]. Around 58% of the population
    depend on agriculture as the chief source of livelihood in India. The quality
    and productivity of agricultural products have declined over these years as several
    factors have influenced the crop productivity both directly and indirectly. Some
    major factors that affect the crop production are climatic changes, global warming,
    and water scarcity [2]. The agricultural land’s productivity is affected by the
    direct and indirect changes in climate [3,4]. The crop growth has been already
    affected by the changes in climate incurred by global warming. The nutrition quality
    of soil, ground water level, sea, and ocean are affected by the modifications
    in average temperature, rainfall, and extreme weather conditions such as hail
    storms, dust storms, heatwaves, etc. due to global warming [5,6]. Degradation
    of soil is primarily created by various methods including 93.7% by water erosion,
    9.5% by wind erosion, 5.9% by salinity and alkalinity, etc. Further changes in
    climate would influence adversely the crop production [7]. Since water is an indispensable
    requirement for plants and cultivation, the high level of soil is eroded and thereby
    the fertility is also declined. Due to the ever-changing climate, water scarcity
    has become a huge problem. Drought-like conditions is already formed in several
    areas and thereby the present and conventional farming practices are not suitable.
    New and unique environment preserving techniques are the need of the hour [8].
    The conventional approaches in agriculture are enhanced by the advent of several
    advancements in technology [9]. These new improved methodologies ensure optimized
    utilization of resources, accurate forecast of water needs and environmental parameters,
    reduction of human intervention, etc. [10]. Consequently, the outcomes of crops
    in terms of yield and quality are higher with cost-effective methods. One such
    booming technology is the Internet of things (IoT) [11]. IoT is the collection
    of components embedded in the sensor for measuring and transferring data via network
    devices as sensed from pumps and tractors to weather stations. Primarily, IoT
    deals with the transmission and reception of data related to farms through devices
    using the Internet for prediction and providing decisions to the farmers. IoT-based
    methodologies has brought a changeover in agricultural patterns and farming approaches
    [12]. IoT devices can gather information about soil moisture, chemical properties,
    dam levels, livestock health, and weather details in real time. The information
    acquired from IoT devices facilitates the farmers in tracking farms periodically.
    Farmers can save time and money by responding faster to farm conditions. Cloud
    computing models integrated with on-field agricultural sensors need to be incorporated
    for tackling the issue of processing huge voluminous data. One of the major challenges
    of IoT is the processing of huge datasets in a sequential way. Some of the key
    factors that need to be focused on this process are as follows: information about
    the type and nature of data, the way of acquiring the data, etc. The preliminary
    stage comprises acquiring the data and ingesting the data to the system. Substantial
    cognizance of data are achieved as the data pass through all the gateways where
    it is cleansed and transformed before entering into the system. In the near future,
    dynamic prediction of soil moisture and precipitation techniques are to be developed
    for smart irrigation systems. Therefore, a system is developed for efficient and
    optimal utilization of fresh water in irrigation along with drip irrigation system.
    It aids in finding which one of the plants fails to get sufficient water. When
    the water supply is provided the next day, this delay should not disturb the system.
    It becomes important for the farmers to understand the optimal usage of water
    and fertilizers to bring out sustenance in the agricultural industry. Therefore,
    processing must be done for analyzing the data, so that patterns can be analyzed
    and planning can be done for the long term, accordingly. Hence, it gives a broad
    vision in deciding where the processing is to be done exactly. Therefore, it is
    obvious that not all data are crucial, and it provides a clear view of which data
    need to be stored, discarded, and retained for both long-term and short-term purposes.
    Thus, all these challenging issues require to be addressed and that is where storage
    technologies are actually highlighted. The poor quality of Internet access in
    developing nations makes the implementation quite challenging. An applicable solution
    to solve this problem is through edge computing where the essential data could
    be offloaded from the cloud over the edge of the cloud, and this is the exact
    point where the approach of smart sensing with edge computing gets in. With the
    purpose of broadening the potential of edge computing and using it in the agriculture
    domain, a novel approach using machine learning (ML) methods is proposed for analyzing
    the data acquired by the IoT devices deployed at the farm. Here, the data acquired
    from IoT components undergo preprocessing and ML models on the edge nodes to analyze
    and assess the appropriate results for providing the best instructions for controlling
    the actuators (e.g., light, pumps at different locations) in the farms. This article
    presents an automated system, as shown in Figure 1, to predict the soil moisture
    using the field information acquired from the self-designed sensor node deployed
    at the field and the forecast information of weather via Internet. A unique algorithm
    has been developed that revolves around the machine learning techniques for the
    prediction of soil moisture. Here, many algorithms with the combination of regression
    + clustering was estimated, and it is inferred that XGBoost + k-means outperforms
    other algorithmic combinations, and therefore, it is deployed for the prediction
    of soil moisture in the proposed work. The proposed algorithm makes effective
    irrigation decisions with optimized usage of water in a more accurate and reliable
    manner. The effective decision-making refers to the process of predicting the
    rainfall, thereby reducing the water usage in advance by the proposed algorithm
    in accordance with the predicted rainy days. Through this automatic decision-making,
    over watering is avoided by saving the soil. The server-side software is developed
    with node-side connectivity using the information for visualization and decision
    support features. This proposed algorithm is implemented in edge to prove the
    efficiency of the edge server handling the automated system better than the cloud
    control. The performance of the decentralized edge-based architecture has been
    evaluated for downloading the hybrid algorithm from cloud in real time execution.
    The performance can be enhanced by adopting edge computing architecture and measured
    with the help of network parameters like latency, bandwidth, and response time.
    Edge computing capacity is also estimated using the CPU processor and memory consumption
    while executing the proposed algorithm with irrigation scheduling. Figure 1 Architecture
    of the proposed system. 2 Related work In ref. [13], a smart irrigation system
    not affected by communication disconnection and delay is developed using edge
    nodes deployed at the farms. Environmental parameters have an intricate impact
    on the plant growth. It becomes necessary for evaluating multiple AI models simultaneously
    in an actual cultivation environment for comparing AI models under the same conditions.
    Due to the working of existing irrigation systems on the cloud, communication
    is instable in the concurrent evaluation of AI models. However, the instability
    does not induce an edge node in its performance. The factors such as type of plant,
    soil, climate, humidity, temperature, and soil moisture need to be considered
    for the irrigation system packed with potential smart decisions. The nature and
    type of plant, soil, and climate are queried by ontology (branch of metaphysics
    dealing with the nature of being), whereas other factors such as temperature,
    humidity, and soil moisture are sensed by the sensor network. The trained ML model
    predicts the watering decisions based on ontology and other factors as mentioned
    earlier. Smart irrigation has three modules: (i) sensor network modules that sense
    the parameters impacting the water requirement by using sensors DHT22, light sensor
    BH1750, and HL-69 hygrometer for sensing the temperature, soil moisture, light,
    and humidity in air. (ii) Edge and IoT server’s module to send and receive data
    through HTTP requests. (iii) Training module in which KNN is applied on the sample
    dataset for training and decision-making regarding the water needs. Based on the
    input values, the trained model categorizes the input into five possible classes:
    highly not needed, not needed, average, needed, and highly needed [14]. A decentralized
    smart irrigation approach is proposed for strawberry greenhouses in contrast to
    conventional cloud-based solutions for keeping the agricultural data at the edge
    of the network. A full-scale smart irrigation system in an actual strawberry greenhouse
    environment is developed after a small-scale smart irrigation networking prototype
    system and a reference architecture targeting edge data distribution for strawberry
    greenhouse applications are framed. A three-step industrial approach is formed
    for designing, implementing, and validating a solution for smart strawberry irrigation
    in greenhouses and keeping the corresponding data at the edge of the network at
    the same time: (i) A small-scale smart irrigation prototype solution with off-the-shelf
    hardware and software equipment is tested and evaluated on various types of plants
    for gaining useful insights for deployments on a large scale. (ii) A reference
    network architecture is designed for targeting smart irrigation and edge data
    distribution specifically for strawberry greenhouses. (iii) A large-scale system
    in an actual strawberry greenhouse environment is developed in Greece, incorporating
    the proposed reference architecture [15]. Edge computing is proposed for addressing
    the issues by taking advantage of computing resources in the edge of the network.
    The issues such as an edge mobile device make it easier to achieve low end-to-end
    latency, high bandwidth, and low jitter to services located on the edge network.
    An edge can enforce the privacy policies of its owner prior to the release of
    the data to the cloud through edge analytics. If a cloud service becomes unavailable
    due to network failure, cloud failure, or a denial-of-service attack, a fallback
    service on a nearby edge can temporarily mask the failure. Cloud services, partial
    analysis, and control functions are extended to the edge nodes from the cloud
    data center. Edge nodes facilitate the timely monitoring of sensors in smart farming
    by the reduced latency and enhanced data transmission. Due to these factors, edge
    computing is applied through farming [16,17]. A three-tier open-source software
    platform we proposed by authors, and the platform enhanced the precision agriculture
    by introducing edge computing and fog computing. An network functions virtualization
    (NFV)-based approach is deployed for performing the local operational decisions
    at the edge level for mitigating the influence of network failures while using
    cloud data centers [18]. For control processing in smart farming, a platform enabling
    cost-effective sensor/actuator network based on IoT, utilizes edge computing [19,20].
    The authors in ref. [21] predicted the soil moisture using a mathematical model
    that measures the values given by a sensor matrix on the ground. Due to the huge
    interval in measurements (10 minutes), the model presented estimated error by
    more than 10%. This methodology has incorporated the online approach by making
    the sensors to send data every minute to edge devices without time-based interruption.
    The authors of ref. [22] applied a combinative approach of using field sensor
    network’s data along with weather forecast station’s data for the management of
    optimality in water conditions for the enhanced growth of grapes. The generated
    data are forwarded to a web server, which displays graphics without statistical
    analysis of such data. The analysis must be performed a posteriori by the user.
    The watering mechanism for a plant via IoT methodology is devised by the proposed
    smart irrigation model without acquiring any pre-processed data. A prototype application
    is developed, which gets adapted to the parameters needed in irrigation after
    a couple of human-made irrigations. With the usage of various ML algorithms, several
    tests are devised for manual and automated irrigations for the performance evaluation.
    After the evaluation using four different ML algorithms such as logistic regression
    (LR), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), Gaussian naive Bayes (GNB), and gradient boosting
    regression trees (GBRT), it is found that GBRT outperforms other algorithms. To
    analyze the overall performance, a test bed for the sensor edge, mobile client,
    and the decision service on the cloud is established. Two different indoor species
    are selected as test items for the prototype, namely, Peace lily and Sardinia.
    The outcomes were quite good, and it is inferred that the prototype has learned
    the patterns of irrigation and making decisions automatically with a high rate
    of accuracy [23]. The authors from ref. [24] adopted the deep learning methodology
    for detecting the type and the category of the plant using an automated plant
    irrigation system. The water necessity of the plant is determined using the recognition
    of predefined set of plant images and data set acquired from farm. It utilizes
    the database for fetching the irrigation information after the recognition process
    is completed. Modeling the training processes are time consuming as voluminous
    set of images needs to be stored. The authors in refs [25,26] incorporated ML
    methods in the irrigation decision support model using a pre-processed irrigation
    data set. A model is developed for learning the irrigation needs of any plants
    progressively rather than using a readily available dataset. Several ML algorithms
    are evaluated with their precision for concluding the irrigation decisions. Manual
    irrigations are performed two times before making precise decisions. Due to the
    dynamicity in model, data processing is done progressively, and it can be applied
    to several plants having varying irrigation conditions. There is a need for the
    learning model that can be trained by itself using a comparatively lighter learning
    process using environmental parameters that do not need larger storage in the
    system but need higher computation. From the aforementioned survey for making
    a precise decision with instant computation locally, edge computing needs to be
    integrated into the irrigation system. This article is directed towards presenting
    a platform that implies IoTs and edge computing in monitoring soil moisture via
    sensors, data communication between sensors and edge devices, and an Analytics-as-a-Service
    cloud. It analyzes the collected data in the form of a density map of soil moisture
    for denoting the areas in need of greater or lesser frequency of irrigation. Here,
    density map does not refer to the geographical point data by satellite mapping,
    and it actually denotes the point of dry area and watery area through soil moisture
    detection point. This point is averaged among areas of irrigation to be done and
    the irrigation process is controlled with prediction of rainfall using the proposed
    system. 3 The proposed system The proposed learning model for irrigation is implemented
    in a prototype IoT system that has four components: (i) Edge node layer – This
    layer consists of sensors, actuator, and two microcontrollers. In this layer,
    edge node acquires the sensor data from the surroundings and controls the actuator
    for actuating water pumps to start irrigation. (ii) Edge server layer – This layer
    consists of Raspberry Pi that act as edge server and capable of multitask processing.
    Here, edge server controls the edge nodes for sending signal and receiving data
    at regular interval of time. It is also connected to the cloud server for receiving
    developed and trained machine learning model to be deployed and make irrigation
    decision for controlling edge nodes. (iii) Edge service layer – This layer is
    deployed in the edge server and it is responsible for controlling the whole system
    through a developed web dashboard. The dashboard has live feed data, control of
    edge nodes, and cloud services access. This service layer also has the control
    access of the proposed machine learning model. (iv) Cloud server layer – This
    layer composed of cloud services and cloud storage where its role is to train
    the machine learning model and store the data in database. It sends the trained
    proposed model to the edge server for decision-making regarding irrigation scheduling.
    The comprehensive interconnections in the system are shown in Figure 2. The proposed
    IoT-based smart irrigation system includes five major components: field deployed
    module, Web-based interface, Web API weather input, soil moisture prediction mechanism,
    and edge communication model. Figure 2 Components of the proposed system. 3.1
    Field deployed module In the field requirements, a wireless sensor network of
    the sensor nodes needs to be deployed as shown in Figure 3. Here, field data collection
    device accommodates four different sensors: Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor V2.0,
    DS18B20 Water Proof Temperature Sensor Probe for soil temperature, ultraviolet
    (UV) Light Radiation, DHT11 – Temperature and Humidity Sensor Module, and GYML8511
    Analog Output Ultra-Violet Light Sensor Module. An Arduino Mega connected to Raspberry
    Pi 4 Model-B read, the output of these sensors where the program is developed
    in Python for the Pi model to fetch the hourly data from sensors and store the
    data in MongoDB [27] database. It is then synchronized with the server database
    using the developed web service. A Wi-Fi-enabled Arduino controls the water pump
    connected to a relay switch. Figure 3 Real-time prototype of the proposed edge
    model. For the real time monitoring, a trigger is made for controlling the web
    service from the responsive web-based interface. The irrigation decisions are
    checked periodically by the proposed model performed in the server. The water
    pump is actuated, and irrigation process is started only if the server makes any
    irrigation decision. A wireless sensor network (WSN) [28] scenario with ZigBee
    [29] technology can be implemented for a large farming area in which several sensor
    nodes can be affixed in the specified area and every sensor node possesses sensors
    similar to a standalone device. Then, the Arduino Mega reads the sensor output
    connected to ZigBee for transferring data to Gateway Node for aggregating the
    received data and storing it in MongoDB locally and also for transferring the
    data via web service to the edge server. 3.2 Web-based interface The proposed
    framework consists of a web-based application to allow farmers visualize the growing
    data and interacting with the garden in real time. In addition, users can also
    be able to examine and analyze the historical growing data, if needed, through
    functionalities such as irrigation control, motor control prediction model deployment,
    and manual data entry implemented in this web application. Here, Node.js was chosen
    for developing the web application [30,31], while MongoDB [27] was utilized as
    the database system. Data stored in the database, which is deployed in the cloud,
    will be used for further data analysis in the future. The web application’s functions
    are designed following a software design pattern called model-view-controller
    (MVC) as shown in Figure 4. In the frontend, ChartJS is used to represent data
    through dynamic charts. The web application is also used as an interface to manage
    all the physical devices/actuators in the garden. To deploy the web-server to
    the cloud, a cloud platform as a service (PaaS), namely, Heroku, had been utilized.
    Heroku is a cloud platform that provides platform as a service (PaaS), facilitates
    the creation of applications and deploying these online rapidly [32,33]. It also
    enhances scalability and functionality by integrating several add-on services.
    The field data are sent to the server by Raspberry Pi using this web service.
    This web service manages the network outage/fluctuation during data synchronization
    from the field device to the server by taking the help of flag settings at the
    database level. The interface facilitates the scheduling of irrigation along with
    visualizing real time sensors and predicted soil moisture for upcoming days and
    precipitation information. By using the denoted threshold value of soil moisture
    suggested by agronomists, the irrigation can be scheduled by the user. The system
    maintains the threshold value depending on the predicted pattern of soil moisture
    and precipitation information. The process of irrigation is initiated automatically
    and stopped after the specified threshold value generated from the proposed algorithm
    of soil moisture when it is reached. Figure 4 Web interface for the irrigation
    system. 3.3 Web API weather input The weather prediction data are collected by
    a web service developed in Python. The forecast data such as humidity, temperature,
    ultra violet index, precipitation, and cloudiness of web forecasting portals like
    Open Weather API are aggregated by the developed web service [34]. These portals
    provide the forecasted information in HTML, XML, or JSON format. The predicted
    data with JSON format are read by the developed web and stored in database at
    the edge server, which is concerned in the prediction algorithm. Also, these data
    are utilized as testing dataset in the ML model for predicting the soil moisture.
    3.4 Soil moisture prediction mechanism An algorithm for predicting the soil moisture
    based on data derived from field sensors and weather forecasting using the combination
    of supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques has been developed
    underpinned by regression algorithms and k-means clustering for estimating the
    difference/change in soil moisture owing to weather conditions. Many regression
    algorithms are compared against each other and infusing each of them with k-means
    to check the preciseness in mean square error (MSE), R2, accuracy and mean absolute
    percentage error (MAPE) for prediction of soil moisture of upcoming days with
    the help of sensor data and weather forecasting days. The information about soil
    moisture for the upcoming days and suggestions for irrigation in accordance with
    the prescribed levels of soil moisture and predicted precipitation values, thereby
    saving energy and water, is presented by the algorithm. The information generated
    from the device and the predicted values from the algorithm soil moisture prediction
    hybrid algorithm (SMPHA) are stored in the server. 3.5 Edge communication model
    The communication protocols in the proposed framework are flexible and transparent
    in nature for accepting both wired and wireless methodologies. For the maximum
    utilization of potentiality in edge computing components, the communication among
    various components in the edge-IoT system requires intense probing by using the
    versatility among the devices in network edges. For transferring the data gathered
    from pivot sensors, a communication technology such as Zigbee [35] is needed for
    the irrigation systems. Therefore, the communication component in the proposed
    work is classified into three main areas as shown in Figure 5. The Message Query
    Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol is used for the communication in the proposed
    system. The analysis in ref. [36] presented seven IoT messaging protocols (MQTT,
    CoAP, XMPP, AMQP, DDS, REST-HTTP, and WebSocket) as communication protocols that
    play a major role in smart farming. The authors have concluded that MQTT proved
    to be the most secure protocol after probing all the protocols with respect to
    latency, energy and bandwidth requirements, throughput, reliability, and security.
    Moreover, MQTT is secure in both end-to-end architecture and gateway server architecture.
    In an MQTT setup, a MQTT server termed as MQTT broker executes on the IoT solution
    [37]. Under a common identifier, a “publisher” and a “subscriber” link among themselves
    to this broker. In the IoT solution, publishers and subscribers are the IoT devices
    and IoT hubs or control devices, respectively. When the publishers have new data
    for recording, the data are published to the broker. The broker then flags that
    it has new publisher data, and the corresponding data are read by the subscriber.
    Then, the subscriber analyzes the data and reacts accordingly. Figure 5 Proposed
    edge communication model. The first level accomplishes with connecting the end
    users to system with the help of mobile or web-based applications through the
    Internet. The next level (cloud computing server) deals with the connection of
    web server and MQTT broker for directing the user requests and other components
    at the edge landscape or from the farms to the right cloud-based services like
    displaying the real time status of the farm for the users, triggering a new deployment
    of the updated ML model to the corresponding edge node. The third level (farming
    area) is directed toward the deployment of sensors and IoT devices (actuators)
    for communicating with other components in the entire system. 4 Deployment of
    soil moisture prediction hybrid algorithm The watering mechanism of the plant
    has different approaches in the proposed model. Primarily, the system is trained
    with manual irrigations datasets during the process of learning with respect to
    suggestions defined by agronomists. The model is trained to learn the needs of
    irrigation in the first level of deployment in cloud without the inclusion of
    pre-processed data. After acquiring the required data and training, the proposed
    system is initiated to grasp the plant’s watering needs by undergoing plenty of
    manual irrigations. Thereafter, manual irrigation is not required and the system
    makes automated decisions in watering using the gathered data and the application
    of ML methods. The proposed model then decides the irrigation strategies automatically
    using ML methods without the need including collected datasets in the automatic
    irrigation process. The proposed model can be improved through the learning process
    when the number of precise irrigation inputs is provided to the model at each
    stage of training. The decision-making procedure is developed with two modules
    for irrigation strategies according to the soil moisture prediction for upcoming
    days. The first module deals with training the model in cloud with manual irrigation
    datasets through steps such as data collection, data preprocessing, training,
    and model development. The system acquires values of air temperature (TH), soil
    temperature (SMT), soil moisture (SM), humidity (HU), and ultraviolet rays (UV)
    periodically from the physical environment in the data collection stage, which
    is essentially required for arriving at the watering decisions. Also, the time
    of performing the manual irrigation is recorded in the database. These data are
    timestamped and stored in as datasets to aid in making decisions for knowing the
    time of irrigation. In the next step of pre-processing, inconsistencies are eliminated
    and outliers caused by sensor errors are detected from the irrigation dataset,
    thereby helping in the removal of broken data. The training stage involves the
    application of supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms. Here the regression
    algorithms such as support vector regression (SVR), multiple linear regression
    (MLR), lasso regression (LR), decision tree regressor (DTR), random forest regressor
    (RF), and XG-boost regressor (XB) techniques are used for the deployment. The
    regression algorithms are trained using the collected datasets. Finally, through
    training, regression models are created, namely, SVR model, MLR model, LR model,
    DTR model, RF model, and XB model that are been combined with the second module
    for decision-making. The second module caters to the prediction of irrigation
    for upcoming days by infusing the weather data as an input to the regression trained
    models. The live datasets from the weather API for future prediction of soil moisture
    variable are used. The dependent variables from weather forecast data like temperature
    (TH), humidity (HU), ultraviolet (UV), and precipitation (PC) are tested in the
    aforementioned model for soil moisture prediction. Then, the regression trained
    model is evaluated and deployed using the weather testing data for the prediction
    of soil moisture in accordance with the precipitation. After the prediction of
    data for the upcoming days, these developed regression models are combined with
    unsupervised ML algorithm named k-means clustering for estimating the changes
    incurred in soil moisture prediction due to the impact of weather conditions.
    Further, each regression models with k-means algorithm are evaluated for performances
    in terms of irrigation decision-making process as shown in Table 1. The combined
    algorithms are estimated through MAPE, MSE, R2, execution speed, power consumption,
    and accuracy. The estimation and computation of these parameters are detailed
    by the authors in ref. [38]. Table 1 Comparison of performance metrices obtained
    from various ML algorithms Algorithms used Accuracy R 2 MSE MAPE (%) Execution

    (XB+k-means) approach provides more accuracy with less MSE comparatively and also
    the R2 with 98% in soil moisture prediction using combined approach is given in
    Table 1. It is evident that the proposed combination performs better when compared
    to other regression + k-means-based approaches. XB + k-means-based hybrid machine
    learning algorithm is applied in irrigation planning module on account of aforementioned
    performance metrices of ML. Although it performs moderately in terms of execution
    time and power usage, it is selected for the deployment in edge computing as it
    has better performed in terms of accuracy, R2, MSE, and MAPE metrices. It is observed
    that the prediction of soil moisture for the upcoming days from the proposed algorithm
    (XB+k-means) is nearer to the actual value as shown in Table 2, and hence, XB+k-means
    is selected for the implementation of SMPHA in edge-based irrigation scheduling.

    handle, collect, and transfer the data to the computing nodes at the edge or in
    the cloud. These devices are connected to the edge nodes through wireless communication
    protocols like ZigBee. It is used in reducing the latency and loss of data. An
    Arduino micro-control unit controls the combined IoT sensors and actuators at
    the same part of a field into a cluster, each connected to a Raspberry Pi that
    acts as an edge node in processing the gathered data and controlling the actuators.
    For example, Figure 2 shows an edge architecture with a Raspberry Pi connected
    to two components: Arduino Uno and Arduino Mega units via ZigBee connection. The
    first Arduino Mega node is responsible for collecting data from sensors and the
    second one is for controlling the actuators in the field. Depending on the sensor
    type with collecting Arduino unit, the sensors are connected via analog or digital
    PWM pins while controlling Arduino uno joins with actuators in the field and controls
    (turn on/off) them in accordance with upper layers (from the edge web server).
    The trained (cloud) and deployed ML model in edge nodes provides the necessary
    instructions to the edge nodes. 4.2 Web layer setup The deployment of web server
    assists the user in planning and managing the irrigation system. It visualizes
    the crucial information of factors like temperature of air and soil, UV, humidity,
    and soil moisture in live irrigation with real time updates in the form of various
    charts. In accordance with the selected field, the web application redirects the
    user to the field’s dashboard as shown in Figure 4. The dashboard consists of
    field parameters as well as control signals for activating all the physical devices/actuators
    at the garden layer. These signals are denoted as switch buttons, and each switch
    controls (turn on/off) a particular kind of actuator (for instance, water pump
    to start and stop the irrigation). The user interface facilitates remote controlling
    of the field by just clicking on the buttons as shown in Figure 4. 4.3 Edge layer
    setup The edge node acts as a computing center where incoming data are analyzed
    and fed as the input vector to the ML model for processing and to return the control
    signals for activating or deactivating the actuators placed at the farm. Edge
    node processes the physical data (real time) at every end device such as the collected
    and processed data via the Raspberry Pi nodes presented in the proposed scheme.
    The prediction model is designed using TensorFlow API and trained, tested on Google
    Colab in this work. Amazon Web Service (AWS) offers a library named Boto3 having
    many APIs to upload and download objects. After the development of model, it is
    transferred to Amazon S3, a service provided by AWS. The edge node utilizes the
    trained model from S3 for analyzing the sensed data acquired from garden’s sensors.
    The decision is delivered based on real time data analysis at the edge node and
    transmitted to Arduino nodes in the fields landscape immediately for controlling
    the actuators. In another flow, the data collected from sensors are filtered so
    as to keep only the modified data at the edge node before being sent back for
    mitigating the communication cost to the database in the cloud. These data are
    used in the updation of the ML model to enhance its efficiency. 4.4 Analytics
    setup The main goal of this experiment lies in gathering the various physical
    parameters of a farming land via sensors and utilizing the fetched data along
    with weather forecast information for developing an algorithm using hybrid machine
    learning approach to infuse higher accuracy in predicting the soil moisture for
    the upcoming days. As discussed in Section 4, for the proper planning and provisioning
    of optimal irrigation, the algorithm provides a predictable estimate of soil moisture
    with the assistance of various statistical measures as shown in Table 1. The measures
    are adopted for estimating the appropriateness and error rate of the proposed
    algorithm. It is inferred from the experiment that, optimal irrigation is feasible
    using a good estimation (close to the actual value) of the soil moisture (Table
    2), with the support of field data and forecast information, thereby utilizing
    the natural rain efficiently. The SMPHA ML model is interdependent on dynamic
    changes in weather environment where the models deployed on edge nodes need to
    change the controls accordingly after model gets trained continuously. For the
    process of retraining, the trained model needs to be updated. The parameters such
    as TM, HU, ST, UV, SM about grown plants are logged for the training purpose,
    and these generated datasets are recorded from the already developed manual mode
    system [39]. The growth of the Indian Mundu Chilli [40] is taken for the observation
    from the first stage to the last grown stage for 95 days. While retraining the
    model, the training is carried in cloud without causing effect to the functionalities
    at edge nodes. A signal is transferred to the corresponding edge server for triggering
    the task of updating the SMPHA model from the web server. At that time, the newly
    trained model is downloaded to replace the existing one at the considering edge
    server. From then, the ML model at the edge server is called to be updated with
    the real-world knowledge and is ready for its garden controlling tasks (to apply
    in the next farming season). 4.5 Work flow The flowchart in Figure 6 depicts the
    working of the proposed system based on the decision support system that is beneficial
    for irrigation needed for the growth of vegetables. The chilli plant is grown
    in a growbag attached with sensors and Pi as shown in Figure 3 and monitored for
    95 days of data collection. To bring out optimality in the irrigation system,
    features relating to climate, soil, crop, and field infrastructure are to be considered.
    To provide several recommendations in the production of vegetables, decision support
    systems (DSSs) are designed, which process voluminous information [39]. This proposed
    work is the extension of soil moisture differences (SMD) model [41] developed
    for soil moisture prediction. The threshold values of soil moisture are used in
    the SMD model where the system schedules the irrigation date based on the predicted
    soil moisture and weather forecast (precipitation) information automatically using
    SVR+ k-means modeling. Therefore, in the extension of the aforementioned work,
    further more number of sensors are used to log soil moisture value, which is averaged
    in the proposed model. This model is developed in two divisions of flowchart as
    shown in Figure 7, where both are interconnected. It is observed that the prediction
    of XB + k-mean approach provides better results as presented in Table 2. Figure
    6 Flow chart of the proposed edge model. Figure 7 Average response time with 10
    test scenarios. The first phase of the flowchart describes the hybrid algorithm
    for the soil moisture prediction (SMPHA) using the combination of XB + k-means
    algorithm. During the data collection step, the sensor data for the parameters,
    namely, TM, HU, ST, UV, and SM, are collected. During preprocessing, null values
    and outliers are removed and the preprocessed data are used to train the XG-Boost
    model. The developed model is then trained with variables of live weather features
    (TM, HU, UV, PC) obtained from Weather API for the prediction of SM data. These
    data are given as input to k-means clustering algorithm to predict the soil moisture,
    which is defined as SMPHA value to be infused in the next phase of the flowchart.
    The second phase of the flowchart defines the automatic irrigation planning setup.
    The setup starts obtaining the soil moisture maximum (SMMax) and soil moisture
    minimum (SMMin) values in the dashboard for setting the maximum and minimum level
    of soil moisture. Then, the current soil moisture (CuSM) is sensed and compared
    against the threshold SMMin. If the resulting value is less than SMMin, the process
    proceeds with SMPHA. On the contrary, it stops the irrigation process by sending
    0 to the relay. In SMPHA, the nearest precipitation date is selected and it is
    assigned to the predicted soil moisture (PSM). The SMMax is decided by finding
    the minimum of (PSM + SMMin, SMMax), and the predicted SMMax is further checked
    against CuSM with a condition if SMMax is greater the CuSM then it sends 1 to
    the relay as a signal to start irrigation. If the condition fails, then it sends
    0 to stop irrigation. The process of automatic irrigation ends by forecasting
    the irrigation schedule in accordance with the live weather parameters. 5 Experimental
    setup and evaluation The test bed is developed and deployed, and the data are
    collected for the analysis in irrigation management. Here, Heroku cloud platform
    is used to deploy the cloud web server. The same cloud is also installed at a
    local edge that is at two Raspberry Pi units equipped with Wi-Fi 802.11n connections
    to denote the edge nodes. JMeter application is used to get sequential accesses
    to the web page from various users for evaluating the network parameters. The
    specification of these servers is given in Tables 3 and 4. Table 3 Configuration

    of the proposed IoT-based smart farm on two different platforms, namely, in the
    cloud and on the local computer to show the feasibility and the benefit of the
    edge computing scheme. Further many parameters are considered for evaluation and
    discussed in the next section to show that edge deployment is better than cloud.
    5.1 Evaluation A hybrid machine learning methodology is used in evaluating the
    first stage of the proposed model. The predicted value of the soil moisture is
    better in terms of their accuracy and error rate. From the comparison of the other
    ML algorithms as shown in Table 2, XB + k-means performs better and taken further
    to be deployed in edge and cloud to check its efficiency with each other. Therefore,
    for analyzing the efficiency of the edge server in accordance with the proposed
    hybrid algorithm SMPHA is evaluated in terms of the time taken to train the ML
    model in edge and cloud. In this experiment Raspberry Pi is used to train the
    SMPHA model with 196,400 rows, that is, input data sample size and takes around
    1,710,000 ms (approximately 28.5 min). The same model when it is trained in Google
    Colab cloud environment, it takes 204,000 ms (approximately 3.4 min) as depicted
    in Table 5. The main purpose is to run the trained model on edge not to train
    the model at edge. So due to the lack of computing capability at the edge, it
    takes more time to train the model, but it can be ignored as it does not affect
    the purpose of the proposed model. Here, edge is introduced to obtain the task
    of computing from the cloud (i.e., offloading the task) by making the system more
    edge-oriented deployment. It can be accomplished rapidly as it requires only 14
    s to download a trained SMPHA model from the cloud to the edge node with a size
    of 3,101 kb as given in Table 5. The time to download varies according to the
    size of the trained model. So, from this process it can be inferred that downloading
    the trained model saves time when compared to training the model at the edge.
    Through this in real time, deployment of the trained SMPHA model in edge is better
    compared to deployment in cloud services. Furthermore, network parameters like
    latency, throughput, bandwidth, and response time are adopted to measure the performance
    improvements in edge computing. Table 5 Comparison of model training time Edge
    Cloud Model training time 28.4 min 3.4 min Downloading time Not applicable 14
    s The performance metrices taken into account are latency, bandwidth, and response
    time [42]. The latency of an application is the product of two factors: computing
    latency and transmission latency. The time spent on data processing and transmission
    between end devices to cloud servers is termed as computing latency and transmission
    latency, respectively. The computational capacity of the system decides the computing
    latency as the network servers possess a considerable amount of capacity to make
    the data processing faster, whereas the sensors come with limited computing capacity.
    The latency in transmission is increased by the end devices and cloud servers.
    Bandwidth: As large number of sensors are deployed in IoT, data generated would
    be huge that consumes an intense range of bandwidth and leads to several problems
    such as delay in transmission and loss of packets. It becomes unacceptable for
    the data to be transferred directly to cloud servers without applying compression.
    Therefore, data preprocessing and aggregation are needed for IoT gateways before
    redirecting them to remote cloud servers. Then, the issue to be confronted is
    to control the traffic flow by migrating data processing and aggregation tasks
    optimally to decrease the bandwidth needs of the end users while maintaining the
    data quality. Response time: The total response time is calculated by adding up
    transmission and processing time. The local deployment of the proposed model for
    controlling IoT-based irrigation are deployed on two modes: (i) Cloud mode: The
    developed SMPHA model is implemented in the cloud communicating with IoT sensors
    nodes directly to manage the irrigation process. The data are stored and processed
    at the cloud server itself where it uses Heroku platform. (ii) Edge mode – Raspberry
    Pi is deployed as an edge server that involves in processing of the SMPHA model
    controlling the IoT sensor nodes. Here, the data are stored and processed locally
    within the edge servers. This SMPHA model from both the edge and cloud does the
    job of controlling the actuators to initiate and quit the working of water flow
    motors. Through this deployment in both the environments, performance of edge
    server and cloud server can be checked in terms of latency, throughput, bandwidth,
    and response time is shown in aforementioned graphs in Figures 6, 8, and 9. This
    performance metrices is not feasible to calculate while deploying in real time,
    so the aforementioned scenarios of two modes are virtually created by generating
    many request and response threads between the servers. This sampling, load test,
    and distributed testing are conducted through JMeter application [43] and also
    verified with Wireshark [44] in cloud servers. The test scenario is created here
    by data of sending and receiving sampling data between cloud to IoT sensors and
    between Edge to IoT sensors. The sampling data considered in this work refer to
    the approximate number of requests generated by Arduino to cloud and Arduino to
    Raspberry Pi that are calculated in real time. The test scenario is divided into
    10 days of sampling data collected for each day. The evaluation results are depicted
    for latency and response times in 10 days perspective. In latency parameter, edge
    service has decreased by an average of 77.85% time compared to the with cloud.
    In the same manner, the response time of edge service is also decreased by 74.09%
    time compared to cloud service. In throughput calculation, sampling data are calculated
    for an hourly basis for the 10 hours data in a day. From the hourly comparisons
    of throughput value, edge outperforms with 67.17% high Mbps usage. Through this
    analysis as shown in Table 6, it is evident that the proposed edge computing methodology
    deployed in Raspberry Pi or in local computers outperforms the cloud-oriented
    approach. Figure 8 Average latency with 10 test scenarios. Figure 9 Average throughput
    value with 10 h test scenarios. Table 6 Performance metrices for cloud and edge
    services Performance metrices Cloud service Edge service Throughput (Mbps) 0.04944
    0.08265 Latency (ms) 1415.8 313.6 Response time (ms) 1519.6 393.8 Bandwidth (bps)
    86 1,365 Finally, to illustrate the efficiency of resource management in edge
    computing, CPU and memory utilization are considered for the analysis as both
    factors rely on the service execution model and the computational needs of the
    services being fired from off-loaders. Figure 10 depicts the utilization of CPU
    and RAM on the Raspberry Pi acting as an edge node in two cases: with and without
    the deployment of SMPHA model on it. As shown in Figure 10, the SMPHA model affects
    the CPU of the Raspberry Pi node significantly as it consumed around 41.2% of
    the CPU compared to only 3.5% when it does not host the SMPHA model. However,
    the memory (RAM) utilization in both the cases (with and without deployment of
    an SMPHA model) is nearly the same which is around 31%. Comparatively RAM utilization
    does not have much difference in with and without SMPHA. It is worthwhile to note
    that, the CPU utilization is still much lower than the 50% of total CPU capacity
    in Raspberry Pi. Therefore, it becomes feasible for adopting edge server implementation
    in the proposed irrigation system. Figure 10 CPU and memory utilization with and
    without SMPHA. 6 Conclusion This article proposed a novel approach to edge-based
    irrigation system to facilitate decision-making on watering the plants on scheduled
    time. The proposed approach applying IoT with an edge computing framework enables
    the farming system to adapt to the changes in environmental conditions automatically
    and efficiently. The process of automatic irrigation regulates irrigation according
    to the live weather parameters for forecasting the irrigation process. Soil moisture
    prediction was performed using major regression algorithms that are again combined
    with k-means clustering for estimating the changes incurred in soil moisture prediction.
    These techniques were compared through metrics such as MAPE, MSE, speed, and power
    consumption from which XB + k-means was found to perform better. The XB + k-means
    algorithm was further used for the implementation of decision mechanism on the
    developed edge computing model. The proposed edge model saves the data communication
    cost and reduces the response time of IoT services. It can be deployed on existing
    devices on the network edges serving as edge nodes, thereby reducing the overall
    implementation cost of a large-scale IoT system. The edge-based approach was found
    to perform better than the cloud-based approach in terms of response time, latency,
    throughput, and bandwidth usage. Finally, the edge model was analyzed through
    CPU and memory usage while running with and without the algorithm. In both cases,
    the memory utilization is almost lower to total available resource of the edge
    device. From this, edge device can allocate its remaining resource for other computing
    services, which increases the efficiency of edge computing device. The number
    of end edge nodes can be increased according to the field area and then to check
    the potency of the system. Conflict of interest: The authors declare no conflict

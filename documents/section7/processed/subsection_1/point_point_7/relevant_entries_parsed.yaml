    IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, 41(3), 740-754.
  data_sources: null
  explanation: This study presents a novel, edge-assisted crowdsourced live streaming
    approach that leverages underutilized viewer-side computational resources to perform
    real-time video transcoding. The transcoding capability of edge devices is modeled
    as a mean-variance measure, considering both the average transcoding quality and
    the performance variation of the devices. Two contextual Gaussian risk-aware upper
    confidence bound (CGRA-UCB) and contextual asymptotic risk-aware upper confidence
    bound (CARA-UCB) algorithms are designed to estimate the transcoding capabilities
    of edge devices in an online manner. Moreover, to reduce the switching costs of
    transcoding task assignment, an epoch-based task reassignment strategy is proposed.
  extract_1: This paper proposes an edge-assisted crowdsourced live video transcoding
    approach where the transcoding capabilities of the edge transcoders are unknown
    and dynamic.
  extract_2: The resilience and trustworthiness of highly unstable transcoders in
    decision making are characterized with mean-variance-based measures to avoid making
    highly risky decisions.

  key_findings: The proposed approach significantly improves network utility while
    keeping the switching costs of transcoding task assignments competitively low.

    delivery network architecture to improve the security and trust of content delivery
    networks (CDNs).


    The key points of the paper are:

    technology to enable credible scheduling and trust trading patterns.

    * **A routing sandbox is implemented using state channels** to ensure trusted
    data delivery.

    * **A blockchain consensus mechanism** is adopted to ensure the credibility of

    to prevent untrusted nodes from joining the network.

    * **Model predictive control (MPC) is used to balance** the optimization goals
    of response time and bandwidth satisfaction in selecting optimal replica servers.


    The paper also proposes an optimized PBFT consensus mechanism, TS-PBFT, to address

  explanation: In this research by Sarabia et al., the authors investigate the effectiveness
    of a Partial Least Squares-Error Correcting Output Codes (PLS-ECOC) method for
    real-time, automated recognition of eight distinct hand gestures based on surface
    electromyography (sEMG) signals. The PLS-ECOC method is a class-modelling approach
    that enables fault tolerance, allowing the system to continue functioning correctly
    even in the presence of hardware or software faults. The article provides an in-depth
    analysis of the PLS-ECOC model's performance characteristics, including sensitivity,
    specificity, and accuracy. It also explores the model's ability to detect errors
    and reduce the dimensionality of the input data, making it suitable for implementation
    on resource-constrained embedded devices frequently used in real-time applications.
    Additionally, the article compares the PLS-ECOC approach to other commonly used
    machine learning techniques in the field of sEMG gesture recognition. The results
    demonstrate that the PLS-ECOC method achieves high accuracy while maintaining
    low computational complexity, making it a promising technique for practical applications
    in human-machine interfaces, wearable devices, and robotic control systems.
  extract_1: Theproposed PLS-ECOC model for gesture recognition using sEMG signals
    can provide a failure-free result in the prediction phase. While keeping comparable
    results in accuracy, precision, and F1 of 87.5, 91.87 y 86.34%, respectively,
    to the current state-of-the-art classifiers. This highlights the effectiveness
    of the proposed method as a fault-tolerant classification system.
  extract_2: Another improvement that should be taken into account is to use DMCEN
    optimization for the other two criteria (minimizing errors and minimizing the
    length of the codeword) either through a desirability function that introduces
    “a priori” weight to the criteria [69] or by applying a multicriteria optimization
    and using the Pareto front of the optimal solutions to obtain the optimal solution
    “a posteriori” [70].

    Differential Privacy for Fog-Based Smart Grids. IEEE Internet of Things Journal,
    11(4), 6096-6110. https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2023.3309132
  data_sources: User power consumption data
  explanation: 'This article presents a privacy-preserving multidimensional and multisubset
    data aggregation (PPMM-DA) scheme with differential privacy for fog-based smart
    grids. The proposed scheme supports achieving multisubset aggregation of multidimensional
    data, fault tolerance, resisting differential attacks, and resisting collusion
    attacks while minimizing privacy leakage, network latency, and loss of data availability.


    The key points of the paper are as follows:


    1. **Multidimensional and Multisubset Data Aggregation**: To conduct fine-grained
    analysis and achieve effective grid monitoring and management, the CC should obtain
    power consumption data of each dimension and the corresponding number of users
    within a specific power consumption range.


    2. **Privacy and Security**: The power consumption data of individual users should
    be protected in the system. The proposed data aggregation scheme should meet the
    security requirements and can resist differential attack, eavesdropping attack,
    collusion attack, and active attack.


    3. **Efficiency**: Due to the limited resources of terminals, the proposed data
    aggregation scheme should be extremely efficient at each phase of the system.


    The proposed scheme includes the following phases: system initialization, user
    report generation, privacy-preserving report aggregation, and secure report reading.


    To evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, the authors compare it with
    several existing schemes in terms of functions, computational and communication
    overheads, and errors. The results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the
    existing schemes in terms of security, efficiency, and data utility.'
  extract_1: In order to analyze the power consumption data more deeply and implement
    effective grid monitoring and management, our scheme achieves multidimensional
    and multisubset data aggregation by employing the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT),
    super-increasing sequence, and Paillier cryptosystem. Each user’s multidimensional
    power consumption data will be structured as one composite data by CRT. We can
    extract aggregated results of power consumption for each dimension from the aggregated
    ciphertext, which makes computational overhead be independent of the dimension
    of power consumption data, results in significant saving in computational overhead.
  extract_2: To achieve privacy-enhanced multidimensional data aggregation and offer
    provable differential privacy guarantees on the aggregated statistic, we propose
    two methods to achieve differential privacy, which extracted noise from the Geometric
    distribution and Laplace distribution, respectively. Meanwhile, the parallel composability
    of differential privacy is used to reasonably allocate the privacy budget, which
    can provide higher data utility.

    Enriching IoT modules with edge AI functionality to detect water misuse events
    in a decentralized manner. Sensors, 22(13), 4874.
  data_sources: Sensors deployed in the field
  explanation: In the proposed automated water irrigation management system, an AI-powered
    algorithm is integrated with edge computing on Internet of Things (IoT) devices
    to analyze water consumption data. This allows for real-time decision-making and
    control of irrigation systems. The algorithm is trained on data collected from
    sensors deployed in the field, and it can identify water misuse events, such as
    leaks or excessive usage. When a misuse event is detected, the system sends an
    alert to the user, who can then take appropriate action. This system has the potential
    to significantly reduce water waste and improve the efficiency of irrigation systems.
  extract_1: '"This work presented a pilot implementation targeted at intercepting
    water usage events and characterizing them properly, with the emphasis to be put
    on misuse cases, such as leakages or wastes. The rapid growth of electronics and
    of the pairing software allowed for very cost-effective but efficient solutions,
    with cutting-edge features. Indeed, the adoption of machine learning techniques
    at the edge points (i.e., where the water sensors are) was drastically reducing
    the amount of information that needed to travel from the peripheral nodes to the
    central node and the cloud. This fact resulted in reduced communication load and
    energy consumption, while it increased autonomy and privacy."'
  extract_2: '"The water usage episodes the experimental system was trained to intercept
    were of comparatively short duration, but the software and hardware methods being
    used, and the accuracy being achieved, make the proposed arrangements, only with
    minor configuration modifications, to be applicable for supporting a wide variety
    of water preservation/misuse detection scenarios. Apparently, several issues are
    still open, requiring more elaboration for the delivery of an out-of-the-box solution.
    The time interval between the fixed, in number (e.g., 200), consecutive flow data
    required for a characterization decision, was set to 1 s during the training.
    The same trained model, can still be valid considering intervals of much longer
    value (e.g., of 30 s instead of 1 s), provided that the proper normalization in
    flow values will be made and that the activity will be classified in following
    the same pattern. Nevertheless, gathering richer data sets, reflecting further
    realistic use cases, can train the model more accurately, and is an apparent priority
    for wider applicability. This training can follow the same generic principles
    and methods described herein."'

    as leaks or excessive usage. The system is cost-effective and can be easily deployed

  explanation: This study aims to automatically irrigate soil by integrating IoT sensors,
    edge computing, and machine learning algorithms to enhance agricultural irrigation
    management systems. The proposed system utilizes sensor data, weather forecasts,
    and historical data to predict soil moisture levels and determine irrigation schedules,
    optimizing water usage and crop yield while considering environmental factors
    and sustainability.

    prediction of rainfall date is easily available from web source, the integration
    of rainfall prediction with precision agriculture helps to regulate the water
    consumption in farms. In this work, an edge computing model is developed for predicting
    soil moisture in real time and managing the water usage in accordance with rain
    prediction."'

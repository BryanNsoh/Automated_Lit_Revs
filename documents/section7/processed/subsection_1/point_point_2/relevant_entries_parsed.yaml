    Stability, robustness, vulnerability and resilience of agricultural systems. A
    review, Agronomy for Sustainable Development. https://doi.org/10.1007/s13593-015-0347-5
  data_sources: []
  explanation: The review focuses on agricultural systems and their capacity to cope
    with disruptions in four major ways. Stability, robustness, vulnerability and
    resilience are conceptual frameworks for this capacity to cope with disruptions.
    Stability is the capacity of the system to maintain equilibrium and be unaffected
    by external drivers of change. Robustness is the capacity to maintain its functionality
    despite external drivers of change. Vulnerability is the degree to which the system
    is susceptible to external drivers of change. Resilience is the capacity of the
    system to withstand and recover from external drivers of change.
  extract_1: In this context and in order to explore the position of each concept
    regarding the assessment of agricultural performance in a variable environment,
    we start by clarifying their historical backgrounds and their main differences
    according to how they are used in papers related to agricultural systems.
  extract_2: However, it appears that the concept of stability has been applied in
    agricultural studies with a meaning relatively close to ecological constancy,
    i.e. as the stability of agricultural outputs in time or space but without explicitly
    referring to the external drivers of change and to the occurrence of perturbations.

  explanation: "The authors of this study conducted a systematic literature review\
    \ and analysis on the application of blockchain technology to the agri-food supply\
    \ chain. They aimed to identify the key applications, challenges, and future research\
    \ directions. Through a careful review of 71 academic papers, conference papers,\
    \ and book chapters, they categorized the applications of blockchain technology\
    \ into four main themes: traceability, information security, manufacturing, and\
    \ sustainable water management. \n\nRegarding traceability, blockchain technology\
    \ can be utilized to enhance the transparency, security, and efficiency of traceability\
    \ systems in the agri-food supply chain. This can be achieved by integrating blockchain\
    \ with existing traceability systems or developing dedicated blockchain-based\
    \ traceability systems. The authors highlight the work of Tian [38] and Faye [39]\
    \ as notable examples of blockchain-based traceability systems in the agri-food\
    \ industry.\n\nIn terms of information security, blockchain technology offers\
    \ the potential to improve the security of information systems in the agri-food\
    \ supply chain. It can enhance data privacy, protect against unauthorized access,\
    \ and ensure the integrity of data. The authors discuss the research of Leng et\
    \ al. [1] and Neisse et al. [71] in this context.\n\nFor the manufacturing aspect,\
    \ blockchain technology can be applied to improve the efficiency and transparency\
    \ of manufacturing processes in the agri-food supply chain. It can facilitate\
    \ knowledge and service sharing among enterprises, optimize production and distribution\
    \ processes, and enhance supply chain coordination. Li et al. [35] proposed a\
    \ decentralized framework to manage knowledge and services shared between different\
    \ enterprises based on blockchain application while Zhao et al. [76] built a model\
    \ of manufacturing service information based on blockchain principle and cloud\
    \ computing.\n\nLastly, blockchain technology can also contribute to sustainable\
    \ water management in the agri-food supply chain. It can facilitate the transparent\
    \ and efficient management of water resources, optimizing water usage, and reducing\
    \ water waste. The authors mention the work of Poberezhna [59] and Civic Ledger\
    \ [77] in this area.\n\nDespite the promising applications of blockchain technology\
    \ in the agri-food supply chain, the authors identify several challenges that\
    \ need to be addressed for its successful implementation. These challenges include\
    \ storage capacity and scalability issues, privacy leakage, high cost problems,\
    \ regulation problems, and throughput and latency issues. The authors also discuss\
    \ the research gaps and propose future research directions to address these challenges\
    \ and further advance the application of blockchain technology in the agri-food\
    \ supply chain."
  extract_1: The application of blockchain technology in various sectors of the agri-food
    value chain has been extensively studied, with a particular focus on traceability,
    information security, manufacturing, and sustainable water management. Within
    each of these areas, blockchain technology offers unique advantages and opportunities
    for improving efficiency, transparency, and security.
  extract_2: Despite its potential, the adoption of blockchain technology in the agri-food
    value chain is currently hindered by a number of challenges. These challenges
    include scalability issues, privacy concerns, high implementation costs, lack
    of regulation, and slow transaction processing times. Researchers are actively
    working to address these challenges and develop effective solutions to facilitate
    the widespread adoption of blockchain technology.

  limitations: While the study provides a thorough review of the current literature
    on blockchain technology in the agri-food supply chain, it has some limitations.
    The study primarily focuses on published academic research and may not fully capture
    industry perspectives or practical applications. Additionally, the authors acknowledge
    that the field is rapidly evolving, and new developments may have emerged since

- explanation: The purpose of this study was to use a combination of remote sensing
    and GIS to identify potential groundwater zones in the Birbhum district of West
    Bengal, India. The authors used datasets including geology, geomorphology, soil
    types, land use, rainfall, drainage density, slope, lineament density, and several
    thematic layers to build a groundwater potential map. They evaluated the accuracy
    of the map using a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and found it
    to be 80.49% accurate. Overall, this study provides a detailed and useful methodology
    for identifying groundwater zones in semi-arid rural areas using GIS and remote
    sensing techniques.
  extract_1: Groundwater is a vital source of freshwater used to sustain life on earth.
    It is utilized for various purposes such as drinking, agricultural and industrial
    activities around the globe. Around 2.5 billion people worldwide depend solely
    on groundwater resources to satisfy their daily needs for water (UNESCO, 2015).
    In India, more than 60% of irrigated agriculture and 85% of drinking water supplies
    are dependent on groundwater. According to a world bank report, India withdraws
    an estimated 230 km3 of groundwater per year (World Bank, 2012). Importantly,
    irrigation with groundwater has been a source of livelihood security for farmers
    and has also been essential in maintaining drought resilience and food security
    across the country. Indeed, the success of the Green Revolution in India has often
    been attributed to assured irrigation from groundwater.
  extract_2: Groundwater exploration in a region is a challenging task as it is a
    hidden natural resource and not easily detectable. Amongst all methods, drilling
    tests and stratigraphy investigations are popular and widely used to identify
    borewell location and aquifer thickness. However, these methods involve higher
    cost and time (Patra et al., 2018). Exploration using integration of Remote Sensing
    (RS) and Geographical Information System (GIS) has gained special attention recently
    as it is an economic, efficient, effective and less time-consuming method. Researchers
    have employed various RS and GIS-based techniques such as multi-influencing factor
    (Anbarasu et al., 2019), decision tree (Duan et al., 2016, Lee and Lee, 2015),
    frequency ratio (Guru et al., 2017, Lee et al., 2019, Trabelsi et al., 2019),
    artificial neural network (Corsini et al., 2009, Lee et al., 2018), random forest
    (Chen et al., 2020, Golkarian et al., 2018), logistic regression (Kim et al.,
    2019, Park et al., 2017), weights of evidence (Lee et al., 2012, Pourtaghi and
    Pourghasemi, 2014), fuzzy logic (Aouragh et al., 2017, Cameron and Peloso, 2001)
    and entropy (Al-Abadi et al., 2017) models to demarcate the groundwater potential
    zones. However, the Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) was found to be an effective,
    reliable and convenient method for delineation of groundwater potential zones,
    therefore it was adopted for the present study.
  limitations: The study potentially faces certain limitations due to the nature of
    the adopted method. AHP is a knowledge-driven process, hence it may have inhibited
    certain errors in its prediction. Furthermore, the assessment was performed using
    a total of 12 different thematic layers such as geology, geomorphology, land use
    and land cover, fault and lineament density, drainage density, rainfall, soil
    type and soil texture, slope, roughness, the topographic wetness index, the topographic
    position index and curvature. Parameters such as lithology, soil texture, aquifer
    thickness, pond frequency, recharge rate, pre and post-monsoon groundwater depth,
    the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the amount of draft of water
    for irrigation and domestic usage also play important roles in controlling the
    groundwater potential which have not been taken into consideration for this study.
    Furthermore, the study area primarily represents a semi-arid rural tract with
    two meteorological parameters monitoring stations (gauges). Therefore, interpolation
    of rainfall using the Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) method may not be the best
    interpolation method for the study area (Amini et al., 2019). In order to improve
    the accuracy of the GPZ, an interpolation method with less prediction error can
    be used to obtain the rainfall distribution after considering the rainfall data
    from all the gauges including neighborhood districts. In future, an improved groundwater
    potential map of the district can be produced by considering all these parameters.
    However, the study results are valid and scientific despite these factors in the
    research process and estimation. The outcome of this assessment may be useful
    for policymakers to improve the groundwater management of the district.

  explanation: "\"In Industry 5.0, sensors in different regions may collect and process\
    \ data for making intelligent decisions. Hence, adopting a decentralized blockchain\
    \ network for Industry 5.0 solutions is imperative. Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is a\
    \ notable option due to its energy efficiency, scalability, and decentralization.\
    \ However, PoS can result in several vulnerabilities if a new chain with better\
    \ rewards is developed, which may lead to a situation where the original blockchain\
    \ becomes vulnerable to attacks.\n\nDelegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) aims to overcome\
    \ these challenges by choosing a group of delegates who are responsible for achieving\
    \ consensus during the block validation. These delegates are elected by the community\
    \ and are incentivized to act in the best interest of the network by being rewarded\
    \ with transaction fees. The block validation is subject to a voting system by\
    \ stakeholders to choose the external validator.\n\nOne of the major benefits\
    \ of DPoS is its ability to process transactions at a much faster rate than other\
    \ consensus mechanisms. This is because DPoS networks have a much smaller number\
    \ of delegates who are responsible for validating transactions, which allows for\
    \ a more streamlined process. DPoS networks are also more scalable than other\
    \ consensus mechanisms. This is because the number of delegates can be adjusted\
    \ to meet the demands of the network, which means that the network can continue\
    \ to grow and process more transactions without sacrificing its speed or security.\
    \ \n\nDistributed Proof of Security (dPoSec) combines the advantages of PoS and\
    \ DPoS, and optimizes performance and efficiency using blockchain primitives.\
    \ It also provides robust security features, such as trust establishment and cryptographic\
    \ signatures, making it a suitable choice for industrial blockchain applications.\
    \ dPoSec can contribute significantly to Industry 5.0 by offering a reliable and\
    \ effective consensus mechanism for industrial blockchain applications, ensuring\
    \ that data gathered from Internet of Things devices in a supply chain management\
    \ system, for instance, is accurate and can be securely tracked throughout the\

    to conserve energy, a sleep scheduling technique is applied to place these redundant
    nodes into sleep mode.

- explanation: 'The paper uses modern control theory and constraint optimization approaches
    to formally analyze the following questions:


    1. Under what condition can an attack on a cyber-physical system remain undetectable
    by any monitor?

    2. Can an attack be uniquely identified from the measurements, and if so, how?


    The paper then uses the results to draw implications and insights for cyber-physical
    system security. In particular, it provides:


    1. In-depth discussions on the trade-offs between the robustness of detection
    and identification against cyber attacks and the design of the monitoring framework.

    2. Characterization of the conditions that guarantee the existence of attacks
    which evade the monitors, as well as guidelines on how to verify whether such
    attacks exist, in a computationally efficient manner.

    3. A complete identification procedure that uniquely identifies the attack set
    using the measurements. The procedure is complete in the sense that it can identify
    any identifiable attack, and its computational complexity matches the inherent
    complexity of the identification problem.

    4. Extensive numerical experiments on realistic power system models to characterize
    the vulnerabilities of power networks against both state attacks and output attacks.
    An additional example demonstrates the detection of attacks against the IEEE 118
    bus system using a distributed implementation of the monitoring algorithm.


    The following are the key contributions of this paper:


    1. The paper presents fundamental limitations on the detection and identification
    of attacks on cyber-physical systems. It demonstrates that the existence of undetectable
    and unidentifiable attacks is a generic property of cyber-physical systems, if
    one takes into account the input/output structure of the cyber-physical system
    and possibly the state estimation delay.

    2. The paper provides two sets of minimal conditions that characterize the existence
    of undetectable and unidentifiable attacks, respectively. These characterizations
    rely on a type of graph-theoretic property of the system called the linking property.
    The linking property can be efficiently verified in practice, and it provides
    a powerful tool to assess the vulnerabilities of cyber-physical systems against
    attacks.

    3. The paper develops centralized and distributed attack detection and identification
    algorithms. The centralized algorithms are complete in the sense that they detect
    and identify every (detectable and identifiable) attack. The distributed algorithm
    provides a practical trade-off between the speed of convergence and the amount
    of information exchanged among local control centers.

    4. The paper demonstrates the application of our theoretical findings to realistic
    power system models. Numerical experiments show that our algorithms can effectively
    identify vulnerabilities and detect and identify attacks on real-world systems.'

    The KDPMS algorithm is a novel scheme for connectivity restoration, a two-layered
    fault-tolerant system, and a dynamic clustering method designed for heterogeneous
    wireless sensor network-based smart agriculture. The primary aim is to enhance
    quality of service (QoS) by improving connectivity restoration through the establishment
    of connections between individual nodes and m-supernodes using k-disjoint paths.
    Additionally, the proposal seeks to augment resilience to node and supernode failures
    by adjusting transmission powers and dynamically clustering sensors based on residual
    energy.


    The study is structured into several sections. Section 2 reviews the study literature,
    and Section 3 presents the suggested solution and algorithms. The evaluation findings
    are presented in Section 4, and a conclusion is drawn in Section 5.


    **Relevance Evaluation**


    1. **Relevance to the point mentioned in the review**: The KDPMS algorithm effectively
    addresses several issues identified in the literature review regarding fault tolerance,
    topology control, clustering methods, mobile supernodes, heterogeneity, and connectivity
    restoration in wireless sensor network-based smart agriculture. It employs resilient
    and fault-tolerant techniques such as redundant paths, dynamic clustering, and
    adaptive supernode mobility to overcome these challenges.

    2. **Relevance to the specific point of the paper**: The paper focuses on improving
    connectivity restoration, fault tolerance, and network lifetime in heterogeneous
    wireless sensor network-based smart agriculture. The KDPMS algorithm aligns with
    this goal by providing mechanisms to establish k-disjoint paths to m-supernodes,
    dynamically clustering sensors based on residual energy, and adjusting transmission
    powers to enhance connectivity and resilience.


    3. **Importance of the findings**: The study presents novel contributions in addressing
    issues related to fault tolerance, clustering, and connectivity restoration in
    wireless sensor network-based smart agriculture. The proposed KDPMS algorithm
    offers significant improvements in terms of node fault tolerance, supernode fault
    tolerance, node lifetime, and path lifetime when contrasted with previous approaches.
    These findings contribute to the advancement of wireless sensor network-based
    smart agriculture by providing a robust and reliable framework for data collection
    and transmission.


    **Limitations**


    1. **Limited scope**: The study focuses primarily on improving connectivity, fault
    tolerance, and network lifetime in heterogeneous wireless sensor network-based
    smart agriculture. While these aspects are crucial, other factors such as data
    security, energy efficiency, and scalability may also play significant roles in
    the overall performance of smart agriculture systems.


    2. **Assumptions**: The paper assumes uniform distribution of nodes and supernodes
    in the network, which may not always reflect real-world scenarios. The performance
    of the KDPMS algorithm in more realistic network topologies should be evaluated.


    3. **Computational complexity**: The paper discusses the theoretical computational
    complexity of the KDPMS algorithm, but it does not provide an empirical evaluation
    of its computational efficiency. Further analysis is needed to assess the practical
    scalability of the algorithm for large-scale smart agriculture deployments.

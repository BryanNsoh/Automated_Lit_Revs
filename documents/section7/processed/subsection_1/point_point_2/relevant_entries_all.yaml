  description: Industry 4.0 involves the digital transformation of industrial sectors.
    Given the current climate change scenario and the scarcity of water in semi-arid
    regions, this digital transformation has to take into account the sustainable
    use of water. In agriculture, one of the most water-intensive sectors, to optimise
    the use of water, precision irrigation techniques are being applied. As a result
    of the digital transformation of agriculture, a key aspect for the application
    of these precision irrigation techniques, the crop water stress, can be predicted
    from a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) of leaf-turgor pressure sensors. However,
    these sensors often fail, introducing errors in the data, which could lead to
    inaccurate application of precision irrigation techniques compromising crops and
    yields. So, sensor fault identification is a must. Nevertheless, sensor fault
    identification is a tedious and costly task that requires an expert to manually
    review all sensors and each of their measurements over the last 24 h. In this
    work, with the aim of digitally transforming this task, an IoT-based expert system
    is proposed. By means of a novel learning model, this system is capable of identifying
    sensor faults with 84.2% f1-score and 0.94 AUC ROC. Note that to train this learning
    model, only real-world data gathered from an experimental plot has been used.
    In addition, the real-world application of the IoT-based expert system in this
    plot is shown and discussed. Furthermore, a novel methodology that summarises
    the main findings and techniques applied in this study is also illustrated.

    Industry 4.0 involves the digital transformation of different industrial sectors,
    such as livestock [1], agriculture [2], automotive [3], construction [4], etc.
    Nevertheless, given the current climate change scenario, and the scarcity of water
    in semi-arid regions, the digital transformation has to take into account the
    sustainable use of water [5]. In agriculture, the sustainable use of water is
    key [6]. Indeed, in countries such as Spain agriculture is the sector with the
    greatest water consumption, accounting for more than 70% of water extractions
    from rivers, reservoirs and aquifers [7]. Furthermore, water is a limiting resource
    in semi-arid regions, which together with the current climate change scenario,
    is fostering a context of uncertainty and major challenges concerning the sustainability
    and viability of existing agroecosystems. However, water scarcity can be mitigated
    by its sustainable use through the study and application of precision irrigation
    techniques. In this regard, techniques such as deficit irrigation techniques allow
    obtaining the maximum yield of a crop from the available water [8]. To apply these
    precision irrigation techniques, it is necessary to have a precise knowledge of
    the water stress of the crops. In this regard, crop water stress identification
    is a process that has traditionally been carried out manually, but it can be digitally
    transformed and automated by means of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine
    Learning (ML). In this sense, the authors of [9] present a solution based on a
    WSN of leaf-turgor pressure sensors and a ML model able to identify the water
    stress of crops from the readings of these leaf-turgor pressure sensors. Nevertheless,
    since the solution described above is based on an IoT system, it has some limitations
    that are inherent to several IoT systems, such as the need of handling sensor
    faults. Furthermore, in the context of precision irrigation, the identification
    of sensor faults is a critical task since their readings could have a negative
    impact on the precision irrigation systems that use them as inputs, thus compromising
    crop yields. Currently, the identification of leaf-turgor pressure sensor faults
    is carried out by experts by hand and involves daily analysis of the data gathered
    by each sensor over the last 24 h. This process is tedious, time-consuming and
    costly, particularly when the crop is extensive, thus limiting the scalability
    and feasibility of proposals such as [9]. For these reasons, this communication
    proposes an IoT-based expert system able of identifying leaf-turgor pressure sensor
    faults, thus automating and digitally transforming this process. To carry out
    this proposal, a learning model able to identify if a sensor is failing is trained
    by means of a set of experiments. Note that this model has been trained from the
    leaf-turgor pressure data gathered by sensors during one year’s fruit ripening
    cycle. In this sense, with the aim of giving a practical approach to this communication,
    this model has been integrated into an IoT system, illustrating its real-world
    application. The proposed IoT system is designed bearing in mind the context where
    it could be deployed, thus addressing some of the open challenges that IoT is
    currently facing, such as interoperability, energy awareness or scalability [10].
    Finally, to the best of our knowledge, most of the existing works in the literature
    concerning the identification of sensor faults are based on the introduction of
    artificially generated faults (in healthy datasets) [11]. Since the training of
    the learning model presented in this proposal uses only real data, this communication
    also shows a real-world application of the findings on sensor faults identification
    of these proposals. Thus, showing the value of these findings in the identification
    of leaf-turgor pressure sensor faults. The main contributions of this communication
    are listed below: • A novel ML model able to identify leaf-turgor pressure sensor
    faults. This model presents an 84.2% f1-score and a 0.94 Area Under the Curve
    (AUC) Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC), being feasible to replace experts
    in terms of leaf-turgor pressure sensor fault identification. • A novel methodology
    that summarises the main findings and techniques applied in this study. This methodology
    could be easily extrapolated to similar problems involving sensors and time series,
    thus reducing development efforts and costs. • An IoT-based expert system that
    integrates the trained learning model, illustrating its real-world application.
    Furthermore, this IoT-based expert system is designed bearing in mind aspects
    such as interoperability, energy awareness and scalability. • A real-world application
    of the findings of related work on sensor fault detection, assessing its effectiveness
    in identifying faults in a leaf-turgor pressure WSN. The rest of the communication
    is structured as follows: Section 2 analyses several related works. Section 3
    presents the materials and methods applied to train and validate the learning
    models. Section 4 illustrates the results and experiments carried out. Section
    5 proposes a methodology to address similar problems that involve sensors and
    time series. Section 6 presents the integration of the learning model in a real
    IoT system. Section 7 conducts a discussion regarding the findings of this paper.
    Finally, Section 8 considers some future works and concludes the paper. 2. Related
    works Sensor fault detection is a key process when dealing with WSNs. Particularly
    in critical applications such as military operations [12], disaster prediction
    and management [13], intruder detection [14], elderly monitoring [15] or vital
    signs monitoring in hospitalised patients [16]. Thus, the improvement or automation
    of sensor fault detection has been a subject of study over time. In 2006 and 2009
    respectively, two proposals with a major impact on the automatic detection of
    sensor faults emerged [17], [18]. These two proposals are based on algorithms
    known as Neighbours-based algorithms. Neighbours-based algorithms assume that,
    in general, the nodes of a WSN are close together in space and there is a relation
    between sensor data from devices in a geographically close proximity. Moreover,
    the data obtained at an instant of time is related with previous and succeeding
    measurements. Thus, Neighbours-based algorithms use these spatial–temporal correlations
    to detect outliers and anomalous behaviour [19]. Thus, in [17] a distributed neighbour-based
    algorithm to identify faulty sensors is proposed and assessed. The execution of
    this algorithm is as follows: first, labels all nodes in the network as possibly
    correct or possibly faulty. To carry out this labelling, the algorithm assesses
    the differences of measured values at the same instant of time between neighbouring
    nodes. Then, if the node’s measurements do not exceed a threshold compared to
    the majority of measurements of the neighbours’ nodes, the node is labelled as
    possibly correct, otherwise, possibly incorrect. Then, each node is compared again
    with its neighbours, assessing whether neighbours are possibly correct or incorrect.
    Based on the possibly correct or incorrect neighbours, the algorithm finally labels
    each node as correct or incorrect. To test their proposal, the authors applied
    it to a simulated WSN of 1024 nodes with erroneous random nodes. The system proved
    to be able to identify faults with high accuracy (see Table 1, system performance
    column). However, performance worsens exponentially as the ratio (percentage)
    of erroneous nodes increases. In [18], an improvement to the previous algorithm
    is presented. Thus, in this proposal, the second part of the algorithm is improved,
    i.e. when it compares each node with its neighbours to finally classify them as
    correct or incorrect. In this sense, it applies a less strict condition to determine
    the final classification of each node, resulting in fewer nodes being misdiagnosed
    as faulty. To test their proposal, the authors carry out several experiments where
    they applied their proposal on a simulated WSN of 200 sensors with different ratios
    of faulty nodes. The experiments show that the performance is improved compared
    to the previous version with high error rates, identifying more than 94% of faulty
    nodes compared to the previous version which detected 83% for a high error rate
    of 30% of faulty nodes. Table 1. Key elements of the related works summarized.

    all research fields, due to its broad scope of application and its effectiveness
    in solving problems. Therefore, most current work relies on ML to identify whether
    a sensor is failing or not. Thus, in [20], a WSN fault detection system based
    on a learning model trained with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is
    proposed. This learning model is able to identify and classify different kinds
    of sensor faults, specifically random faults, offset faults, gain faults, stuck-at
    faults, and out-of-bounds faults. To train the learning model, the authors use
    a humidity and temperature dataset published by the University of North Carolina,
    injecting into it the above-mentioned kinds of errors. To test their system, the
    authors carry out several experiments considering different error rates, classifying
    the measurements with 99% of accuracy in all cases. In [21], a WSN fault detection
    system based on ML is proposed. This system is able to identify several types
    of sensor faults such as offset, gain, stuck-at, out-of-bounds, spike, and data
    loss faults. To train the learning models, the same dataset used in the related
    work described above is used in this work. Again, it is the authors who inject
    the sensor fault data into the dataset. In this case, sensor fault data are injected
    randomly at different rates (10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50%). To train the learning
    model, the authors use and compare the performance of several algorithms such
    as SVM, multilayer perceptron, convolutional neural networks, Random Forest (RF),
    stochastic gradient descent and probabilistic neural networks. The RF algorithm
    is reported as the best with a faulty measurements identification accuracy of
    90% for almost all kinds of faults and rates. The communication presented in [22]
    carries out a comparative analysis of SVM, Naive Bayes (NB) and Gradient Boosting
    Decision Tree (GBDT) for data fault detection in WSNs. To train the learning models,
    it is used a public dataset from 54 sensors deployed in the Intel Berkeley Research
    lab (2004). These devices collected humidity, temperature, light, and voltage
    values once every 31 s. Regarding sensor fault data, the authors injected three
    different types of faults: noise fault, gain fault and stuck-at fault. Thus, after
    training the learning models the communication reports GBDT as the best model
    with an average accuracy of 90% classifying all different kinds of faults. In
    [23], a data-driven design for fault detection of wind turbines using RF and XGboost
    is presented. To train the learning models, the authors use a dataset from The
    National Renewable Energy Laboratory (USA). In this work, not only sensor failures
    but also actuator failures are detected. Thus, ten different fault scenarios are
    defined, including six sensor faults and four actuator faults. Again, it is the
    authors who inject sensor fault data into the dataset. On the other hand, in the
    dataset’s pre-processing stage, the RF algorithm is applied to assess and select
    the most representative dataset’s features. Then, when features are selected,
    the fault classifier is trained with the XGBoost algorithm. The resulting model
    reports an average accuracy of 90% classifying each kind of fault. The works described
    above are some of the current proposals for sensor fault identification. As mentioned
    above, since ML has become popular, ML approaches are the most common to solve
    the problem of sensor fault detection. However, there are other current approaches
    based on other kinds of techniques that are also effective solving this problem.
    In this regard, the communication presented in [24] presents a statistical approach
    for WSN fault diagnosis based on the Autoregressive model [25], using the Kuiper
    test [26] and the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test [27], which are statistical methods
    used to determine whether two given distributions are similar or significantly
    different. With the results of the above-mentioned tests, it is theoretically
    possible to compare a WSN with other WSNs whose health states are known (proportion
    of faulty nodes) to assess the similarity between them, thus being able to estimate
    the health states of a WSN. The authors use several metrics such as mean deviation
    to evaluate the performance of both tests in estimating the similarity between
    WSNs with known health status. After assessing the results achieved, the authors
    concluded that both tests are able to evaluate the health conditions of WSNs,
    however, the Kuiper statistic shows better performance than the Kolmogorov–Smirnov
    statistic. The main drawback of this approach is that it is not possible to find
    out the exact number of faulty nodes. Finally, note that Table 1 shows a summary
    of the related works described together with the proposal presented in this communication.
    As witnessed by the related work described above, sensor fault detection has been
    and is currently a matter of research interest. However, most studies in the literature
    are theoretical and generalist. These studies do not focus on fault detection
    of a specific sensor and do not apply to a real WSN, furthermore, these proposals
    only consider artificially injected faults. On the other hand, the proposal presented
    in this communication uses a dataset that comes from a real WSN of leaf-turgor
    pressure sensors, including the real sensor faults. So, there is no need to inject
    sensor faults artificially. Moreover, in order to validate the learning model,
    data from this WSN is used, thus corroborating its effectiveness in a real WSN.
    In short, the difference between our proposal and those presented in the related
    works is that our proposal gathers all the knowledge that the different related
    works have reached, and uses it to apply it to a real WSN. Thus, solving a real
    problem of sensor fault detection in WSNs composed of leaf-turgor pressure sensors.
    3. Material and methods In this Section, the material and methods used are illustrated.
    In this regard, Section 3.1 describes the countryside context and presents the
    leaf-turgor pressure sensors. Next, Section 3.2 addresses how the leaf-turgor
    pressure data has been gathered and presents the dataset. Finally, Section 3.3
    shows the pre-processing techniques, ML algorithms and validation metrics applied
    to train the learning models. 3.1. Countryside context and leaf-turgor pressure
    sensors The experimental field was carried out for six months with late-maturing
    Japanese plum trees cv. Angeleno and Talete, located in the CICYTEX - La Orden
    Research Center in Badajoz (Spain). The experimental plot consisted of nine trees
    with two leaf-turgor pressure sensors installed on each tree, distributed along
    the orchard (Fig. 1). On the other hand, a leaf-turgor pressure sensor consists
    of a pressure chip embedded in a gel and limited by a plastic chamber. Surrounding
    the chamber is placed a metal ring which, together with a counter magnet, is fixed
    to the tree leaf (see Fig. 2). The photosynthesis process of the plant with the
    rise and fall of the sun causes cyclical increases and decreases of the leaf-turgor
    pressure level over time. In addition, changes in the plant’s water stress directly
    affect leaf size and behaviour, which are recorded by the chip. The sensor turns
    these changes into an electrical signal that sends to a communication box continuously.
    The communication box is equipped with Bluetooth and every five minutes sends
    the readings to a gateway that stores the information and once per hour sends
    a data packet to a cloud where it is stored and processed. 3.2. Leaf measurements
    and IoT-sensor data gathering Nine trees were monitored installing two leaf-turgor
    pressure sensors per tree. The leaf-turgor pressure sensors were installed on
    May 13th and removed on October 5th and the frequency of data gathering was set
    at 5 min. Note that leaf-turgor pressure sensors also measure the temperature
    of the leaf. Fig. 1 shows the distribution of monitored trees throughout the farm.
    On the other hand, Fig. 3 shows the well-defined cycles (24 h) that leaf-turgor
    pressure presents as a result of the process of photosynthesis. These cycles show
    how leaf-turgor pressure increases during the day, as solar radiation increases,
    and decreases in the evening, as solar radiation decreases, remaining constant
    during the night. Other parameters such as crop’s water-stress can also affect
    the behaviour of leaf pressure [28]. So, plum’s leaf-turgor pressure curves could
    present different distributions and/or behaviours. Figs. 3 shows 30 random days
    of correct leaf-turgor pressure measurements. Download : Download high-res image

    days of incorrect leaf-turgor pressure measurements. Fig. 4 evidences that faulty
    sensors present more heterogeneous and arbitrary measurements than correct ones.
    In this regard, several kinds of well-known errors found in the literature can
    be identified, such as stuck-at faults, i.e., days where the leaf-turgor pressure
    barely varies, or spike faults, i.e., days where the rate of change of the measured
    time series with the predicted time series is higher than the acceptable change
    trend [19] , among other kinds of faults. However, there are also several instances
    where both the measurements of the faulty sensors and the correct ones are similar.

    pressure curves (24 h). All measurements have been classified as incorrect (faulty
    sensors) by the experts. For these reasons, the identification of faulty measurements
    is a task to be carried out by experts. In this way, experts inspect leaf-turgor
    pressure curves on a daily basis with the aim of identifying incorrect measurements.
    This inspection is carried out by displaying leaf-turgor pressure charts where
    the last 24 h of measurements of each sensor are shown. By analysing these charts,
    experts can identify whether a sensor is behaving abnormally, and then associate
    a binary error code to each measurement depending on whether the sensor was considered
    correct (1) or faulty (0). Furthermore, since some correct measurements could
    be identified as errors, and vice versa, experts physically check the sensors
    on a daily basis with the aim of ensuring the reliability of their classification
    (correct or incorrect measurement). In the course of this process, the experts
    have, over a period of one year, elaborated the dataset used to train the learning
    models, which is shown in Table 2. Finally, note that, since this kind of sensor
    also gathers leaf-temperature data, leaf-temperature behaviour has been also analysed
    with the aim of identifying sensor faults. However, as experts stated, no patterns

    models validation This Section focuses on describing the dataset pre-processing
    carried out (Section 3.3.1), the ML algorithms applied to train the learning models
    (Section 3.3.2), and the validation metrics used to measure the performance of
    the learning models from different perspectives (Section 3.3.3). 3.3.1. Dataset
    pre-processing The dataset pre-processing phase is performed before the training
    of the learning models and aims to generate reliable input data. So, the main
    purpose of this stage is to increase the performance of the learning models in
    terms of classification accuracy, time in building a classifier, the size of the
    classifier, etc. [29], [30]. Regarding pre-processing techniques, two types of
    pre-processing techniques can be usually distinguished: (1) Data Reduction and
    (2) Data Projection. Data Reduction includes those techniques that focus on modifying
    data features in order to optimise data quality. Data projection focuses on the
    necessary transformations of the raw data into an optimised and feasible representation
    for each particular learning algorithm [29]. Data Reduction. The techniques applied
    in this context are UnderSampling, OverSampling and Mislabels Correction. UnderSampling
    is the process of decreasing the amount of majority target instances or samples
    [31]. OverSampling means increasing the volume of instances of a particular class
    [32], [33]. Finally, mislabels occur when an observation is incorrectly labelled,
    Mislabels Correction is performed by flipping the label [34]. Data Projection.
    The techniques applied in this context are Min-Max Normalisation and Re-frame
    Time Series as Supervised Learning. MinMax Normalisation is a technique able to
    scale data in a range bounded by a predefined minimum and maximum limit. [35].
    As per Min-Max Normalisation technique see Eq. (1). (1) Where is Min-Max Normalised
    data, is the predefined boundary and A is a data within the range of original
    data. On the other hand, Re-frame Time Series as Supervised Learning is applied
    to transform time series forecasting and classification problems into supervised
    learning problems for their use with ML algorithms [36]. A time series is a sequence
    of numbers that are ordered by a time index. A supervised learning problem is
    comprised of input variables and an output variable , and an algorithm can be
    used to learn the mapping function from the input to the output. The goal is to
    approximate the underlying true mapping so that when there is new input data ,
    the output for that new input can be predicted [36], see Eq. (2). (2) Re-frame
    Time Series as Supervised Learning consists of using the previous measurements
    of time steps as the input variables and the value of the next time step or a
    label as the output variable . Table 3 shows an example of a classification problem
    in which measurements of two variables from two previous time steps are considered
    to determine a label. Table 3. Re-framed time series to supervised (two variables
    and time steps). var1(t-2) var2(t-2) var1(t-1) var2(t-1) label 1.0 51.0 2.0 52.0

    applied In order to carry out the experiments proposed in this work, several ML
    algorithms have been applied: k-Nearest Neighbours, Support Vector Machine, Naive
    Bayes, Decision Tree and Logistic Regression. • K-Nearest Neighbours (kNN) [37]
    is based on determining the similitude between examples. Thus, the classifier
    compares their attributes-based descriptions. The fact of each example is represented
    by a point in an n-dimensional space which makes it possible to calculate the
    geometric distance between any pair of examples. The closer to each other examples
    are in the instance space, the greater their mutual similarity. The classifier
    identifies not only one neighbour but also k neighbours. So, k-NN classifier is
    a similarity classifier where k is the number of the voting neighbours. • Support
    Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised ML that analyses data for classification
    and regression analysis which belongs to the kernel-based algorithms [38]. SVM
    is an algorithm for maximising a particular mathematical function with respect
    to a given collection of data [39]. So, the target is to determine the vector
    support and their margins. The algorithm should identify the support vector that
    maximises the margin. Consequently, training an SVM involves searching for a separating
    hyperplane that leads to the maximum margin as this will best separate the levels
    of the target feature [40]. • Naive Bayes (NB) can predict class membership probabilities,
    such as the probability that a given sample belongs to a particular class. Bayesian
    classifiers are based on Bayes’ theorem. Naive Bayesian classifiers assume that
    the effect of an attribute value on a given class is independent of the values
    of the other attributes [41]. The NB classifier performs remarkably well even
    when the underlying independence assumption is violated [42]. • Decision Tree
    (DT) algorithm is part of the supervised learning algorithm family, and its main
    objective is to construct a training model that can be used to predict the class
    or value of target variables through learning decision rules inferred from the
    training data. The DT algorithm can be used to solve regression and classification
    problems [43]. • Logistic Regression (LR) is a multivariable method devised for
    dichotomous outcomes. It is a standard statistical classification method which
    is particularly appropriate for models involving binary classification problems.
    It has been widely applied due to its simplicity and great interpretability [44].
    3.3.3. Learning model validation metrics In order to assess the performance of
    the trained learning models, metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1_score,
    Matthews correlation coefficient or Cohen’s kappa statistic [45] have been calculated.
    Accuracy is computed as the number of correctly classified data over the total
    number of data [46], see Eq. (3). True Positive (TP) and True Negative (TN) mean
    the number of correctly classified as positive or negative. False Positive (FP)
    means that a negative instance is predicted as positive, and False Negative (FN)
    means the opposite (predicted negative when the instance is positive). (3) Precision
    or Confidence (as it is called in Data Mining) denotes the proportion of Predicted
    Positive cases that are correctly Real Positives [47], that is the number of True
    Positives divided by the sum of True Positives and False Positives, see Eq. (4).
    (4) Recall or Sensitivity (as it is called in Psychology) is the proportion of
    Real Positive cases that are correctly Predicted Positive [47], that is the true
    positive rate (the number of True Positives divided by the sum of True Positives
    and False Negatives), see Eq. (5). (5) F1_score is calculated from Precision and
    Recall. It is the harmonic mean of the precision and recall [45], see Eq. (6).
    (6) Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) is a validation metric that, when applied
    to binary classification problems, returns the Phi-Coefficient [48], [49]. It
    is a value between −1 and +1, where −1 indicates a perfect negative correlation
    between predictions and actual labels, 0 indicates no correlation (i.e. the model
    predicts randomly) and ＋1 indicates a perfect positive correlation [45]. MCC is
    defined as Eq. (7). (7) Cohen’s kappa statistic (Kappa) is a validation metric
    that takes into account the probability of obtaining the correct classifications
    by chance [50]. It is defined as Eq. (8). (8) In Eq. (8), is the proportion of
    correct classifications, i.e. accuracy, and is the probability of performing correct
    classifications by chance. can be computed as Eq. (9), where is the number of
    total instances [45]. (9) Like MCC, Kappa also ranges from −1 to +1, where 0 means
    random classification and ＋1 means perfect classification. Additionally, well-known
    measures such as AUC ROC [51] will be used to measure the performance of the ML
    models proposed. ROC related Sensitivity and 1 - Specificity [40]. It should be
    noted that Sensitivity is calculated as Recall, see Eq. (10). (10) Table 4. Experiments
    carried out to allow the identification of the best performing pre-processing
    conditions. Experiment ID Description Experiment 00 Applying the techniques of
    related works, two different approaches can be distinguished. Empty Cell (A):
    Models are trained using the original dataset and no pre-processing techniques
    are applied. Empty Cell (B): Applying Re-frame Time Series as Supervised Learning
    (three time steps) to the original dataset. Experiment 01 Applying hourly UnderSampling,
    Re-frame Time Series as Supervised Learning (24 h) and MinMax Empty Cell Normalisation
    by sensors as pre-processing techniques to the original dataset. Experiment 02
    Applying MinMax Normalisation by time ranges within each sensor and Mislabels
    Correction Empty Cell to the Experiment 01 dataset. Experiment 03 Applying OverSampling
    to minority class in the Experiment 02 dataset. Specificity is Recall measures
    with negative examples, see Eq. (11). (11) The ROC curve summarises all the confusion
    matrices that each threshold produced. That is, the ROC curve is obtained by moving
    the model threshold between [0-1] and obtaining the values of Sensitivity and
    1-Specificity for each threshold. The ROC index or AUC measures the area underneath
    a ROC curve [40]. It is possible to generate ROC curves from a K-fold cross-validation
    process and analyse the variation of the curve at each fold. In addition, from
    all the ROC curves of each fold, it is possible to calculate the arithmetic and
    weighted average ROC curve and thus the arithmetic and weighted average AUC. Finally,
    note that no neuronal networks have been applied. In this regard, the firsts steps
    in training the model involved the use of recurrent neural networks such as Long
    Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks (given the recurrent nature of the problem);
    and Extreme learning machine neuronal networks, in view of the good results obtained
    in works involving sensor data related to agriculture, as the current problem
    [52], [53], [54]. The results obtained using these neuronal networks reported
    similar predictive performance to those presented above. However, neuronal networks
    have three major disadvantages compared to these: (1) Slower model training, (2)
    Greater complexity in terms of model training (network architecture development
    and parameter configuration) (3) Additional complexity to replicate the training
    of the models due to (1) and (2). One of the main drawbacks of most neural network
    optimisation methods is their low efficiency; more complex methods tend to achieve
    better results, but this is offset by a disproportionate increase in computational
    costs [55]. In view of these disadvantages and the fact that the application of
    such algorithms does not add extra value to this communication, the authors have
    considered that the inclusion of this stage of the research in the article is
    fruitless. Finally, several clustering techniques have also been unsuccessfully
    assessed to solve the problem, e.g. K-Means and Density-based spatial clustering
    of applications with noise (DBSCAN). As with the algorithms discussed above, the
    authors have decided not to include this phase of the research in the paper, as
    it does not provide any additional value. 4. Experiments carried out for tuning
    the ML models and results This section shows the experiments carried out to train
    the learning models. The aim of these experiments is to increase the performance
    of the trained learning models. To achieve it, each experiment is focused on the
    application of different pre-processing techniques. Note that the experiments
    described in this section are a selection/summary of all those that have been
    carried out, including those from which it has been possible to improve the performance
    of learning models. Table 4 summarises the main experiments carried out. Before
    addressing the description of the experiments, this section shows how the dataset
    has been used and how the performance metrics have been applied to measure the
    results obtained in each experiment. 4.1. Dataset and validation metrics in experiments
    Next, both the dataset and the application of validation metrics used throughout
    the set of experiments are described. 4.1.1. Dataset in experiments The original
    dataset is formed by the features defined in Table 2 and by 974.493 rows. This
    dataset is the result of monitoring plum crops for one year’s fruit ripening cycle
    following the methodology described in Sections 3.1 Countryside context and leaf-turgor
    pressure sensors, 3.2 Leaf measurements and IoT-sensor data gathering. In order
    to use this dataset to train learning models, it is necessary to split the dataset
    into a training and a validation set. There are several techniques to carry out
    this splitting and the most common is to randomly choose a set of rows and use
    them as validation set [56]. However, the dataset provided in this communication
    presents some peculiarities, so some considerations have to be taken into account
    before applying this technique to it. Splitting the data set randomly means that
    data relating to readings from the same sensor could be assigned to both the training
    set and the validation set. As each sensor presents a particular behaviour, this
    scenario could lead to train models that only correctly classify the measurements
    of sensors that have similar behaviour to the sensors on which the models have
    been trained, i.e., not being able to generalise. In this regard, not all sensors,
    even if they belong to the same tree, are located on similar leaves or share the
    same meteorological conditions. A small difference such as the cardinal orientation
    of the sensor may determine different exposure to sunlight or wind on the leaf
    and thus to a different leaf-turgor pressure behaviour. For these reasons, the
    data relating to the readings of the same sensor are handled as an inseparable
    set. Thus, to randomly split the dataset, instead of randomly choosing a set of
    rows as described in [56], the whole data of a sensor is randomly assigned together
    to either the training set or the validation set. So, validating with readings
    from sensors that are not in the training set implies that the models will be
    able to apply what they have learned to unknown situations, i.e., to classify
    the correct or incorrect status of sensors attached to leaves of trees that do
    not have similar behaviour to the devices with which the model has been trained.
    Note that these considerations are made because the results achieved in the first
    stages of training, when the dataset was randomly divided regardless of whether
    the readings from the same sensor belonged to both the validation or training
    set, led to the undesired scenario described above, i.e. the models do not generalise
    as expected. 4.1.2. Application of the validation metrics In order to achieve
    reliable results in terms of performance measurements, cross-validation is applied
    [57]. Taking into account the considerations made in Section 4.1.1, the cross-validation
    is carried out using in each iteration the data from one sensor for testing and
    the data from the rest for training, as shown in Fig. 5. It is worth mentioning
    that the dataset used for training and testing at each fold is not only composed
    of the faulty records of the sensors but an equal number of correct records (as
    it is the majority class) is sampled in order to balance the classes. The results
    achieved in each iteration are weighted, i.e. multiplied by the size of the sensor
    dataset reserved for validation. It has been considered suitable to weigh the
    results as there are sensors with significant variations in the number of errors
    made. In this regard, it is considered inappropriate for a sensor with a single
    fault well identified by the learning models, that could achieve a 100% of accuracy,
    to have the same weight in the final performance assessment as a sensor with 50
    errors and 85% accuracy. Download : Download high-res image (179KB) Download :

    above-mentioned into consideration, the following Eq. (12) indicates how to calculate
    a performance metric (e.g. accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score and the AUC-ROC)
    with the sensor-weighted cross-validation method. (12) Where is the weighted average
    of the performance metric throughout the cross-validation process, and are the
    total number of faulty and correct records of the dataset respectively, represents
    the set of the 18 sensors included in the dataset, is the performance reported
    by the validation metric in the cross-validation iteration , and and are the number
    of faulty and correct records respectively of the sensor reserved for testing
    purposes in the cross-validation iteration . In other words, the expression explained
    above calculates the weighted average of the performance metric throughout the
    cross-validation process. Thus, at each iteration of the cross-validation process,
    the performance obtained is multiplied by the size of the sensor dataset reserved
    for validation ( ). Finally, the resulting amount of the 18 iterations is divided
    by the total data size ( ). Download : Download high-res image (644KB) Download

    in Experiment 00 (A). 4.2. Experiment setup and experimentation The motivation,
    reasoning, set-up, experimentation and results achieved in each experiment are
    illustrated below. 4.2.1. Experiment 00: First approach, applying the techniques
    of related works. This first experiment aims to carry out a first approach to
    the problem, clarifying whether it is possible to identify faulty sensors in a
    real application case by means of the findings and pre-processing techniques used
    in related works, which are theoretical. As discussed in depth in Section 2, in
    these related works the faults are artificially injected and usually do not apply
    to specific sensors but are generalist. The most recent ones, employ ML algorithms
    to generate classification models capable of classifying the measurements as correct
    or incorrect. All of them hardly apply any pre-processing techniques to the data,
    however, they achieve very high performances in detecting erroneous measurements.
    In [22], measurements from temperature and voltage sensors are used and no pre-processing
    techniques are applied to the data before feeding it into the ML algorithms, the
    authors achieve around 90% of accuracy in classifying the measurements as correct
    or incorrect. Moreover, in [23], signals from sensor-monitored wind turbines are
    used, faults are injected and data are fed into the ML algorithms. Only Random
    Forest is applied for the selection of the most representative features; no further
    preprocessing techniques are specified, however, the authors report 99.9% of accuracy
    in detecting incorrect measurements. Thus, the aim of the first part of Experiment
    00, i.e. Experiment 00 (A), is to follow the approach of these two related works,
    where almost no pre-processing techniques are applied to the data. Therefore,
    in Experiment 00 (A) the ML models are trained and validated following the cross-validation
    process explained in Section 4.1.2 without applying any pre-processing techniques.
    Each record is composed of only three features, i.e. two input features, a leaf-turgor
    pressure measurement and a leaf temperature measurement at a specific time instant,
    together with the class label or output feature (correct or incorrect). Download

    ROC curve and AUC for the ML models developed in Experiment 00 (B). Table 5 shows
    the Experiment 00 (A) results. Note that in this table, the neighbours of kNN
    (k) are set to seven (k=7). This is the result of a grid search process [58] that
    has been carried out to identify the optimal number of neighbours in kNN. Thus,
    after applying this process, seven neighbours (k=7) were found to be optimal for
    maximising the performance of the kNN models. On the other hand, the weighted
    average of ROC curves and AUC values can be observed in Fig. 6. Moreover, Fig.
    15 included in the appendix (Appendix) shows not only the weighted average but
    also the performance of each individual sensor through the cross-validation process.
    In view of the results achieved (see Table 5), it is shown that the classification
    performance of the measurements is very poor following the strategies of [22],
    [23]. This is probably because it is a real use case with real faults, and more
    data pre-processing techniques are needed to increase the performance. However,
    no random classification is being performed, e.g. 50% of accuracy, as around 56%
    of this metric is obtained in the case of SVM or NB. Table 5. Experiment 00 (A)

    there are related works in the literature that already include Re-frame Time Series
    as Supervised Learning, such as [20], [21], where this pre-processing technique
    is applied. In both studies, data from two humidity and temperature sensors at
    the University of North Carolina at Greensboro are used and three consecutive
    time steps are employed to generate the time series, thus generating records of
    12 input features or dimensions, i.e., two temperature and humidity measurements
    at each time step, since there are two sensors, for three consecutive time instants.
    No further pre-processing techniques are applied in these studies, however, in
    both cases, an accuracy of around 95% is achieved in the detection of incorrect
    measurements. Therefore, in the second part of this experiment, i.e. Experiment
    00 (B), the aim is the same as in the first part, but now Re-frame Time Series
    as Supervised Learning is applied in the same manner described in the two related
    works [20], [21] discussed above. Since this is the only pre-processing technique
    used in both related works, in Experiment 00 (B) the measurements are fed into
    the ML algorithms without further pre-processing. The generated records have seven
    dimensions, i.e. six input features, which are the leaf-turgor pressure and leaf
    temperature of three consecutive time instants, together with the class label
    or output feature. Note that, as in related works, the generated time series are
    composed of three measurements or time steps spaced a few minutes or even seconds
    apart. This leads to the leaf-turgor pressure and leaf temperature values being
    practically identical throughout the time series, however, this has been done
    on purpose as the aim of this first experiment is to follow as similarly as possible
    the techniques applied in the related works, assessing its applicability to a
    real use case such as the one in this paper. Table 6 shows the Experiment 00 (B)
    results. The weighted average of ROC curves and AUC values can be observed in
    Fig. 7. Moreover, Fig. 16 included in the appendix (Appendix) shows not only the
    weighted average but also the performance of each individual sensor through the
    cross-validation process. The results of Experiment 00 (B) are quite similar to
    those of Experiment 00 (A). A clearly insufficient performance is achieved, however,
    the classification is not random, as about 56% of accuracy is achieved for SVM
    and NB in classifying the time series as correct or incorrect. Table 6. Experiment

    first approach has shown that the few pre-processing techniques applied in the
    related works are insufficient in a real application case such as the one addressed
    in this paper. The related works are theoretical and generalist and faults are
    artificially injected, which explains such a drastic loss of performance when
    applied to the case under study, which is real. However, the knowledge and techniques
    used in the related works seem to be useful in the present case as no random classification
    has been performed, which means that the models have been able to learn some patterns
    from the data. In this regard, it is expected that based on the knowledge of the
    related work and by applying new preprocessing techniques, as well as better adapting
    them to the problem under study, the performance will be improved, which is what
    is done in the following experiments. Download : Download high-res image (595KB)

    developed in Experiment 01. 4.2.2. Experiment 01: Incorporation and adaptation
    of basic pre-processing techniques to our real problem In view of the poor performance
    results achieved in Experiment 00, where the findings and the few pre-processing
    techniques used in the related work were applied, the aim of this experiment is
    to increase the performance of the learning models by including new data pre-processing
    techniques, as well as better adapting them to the real problem under study. Furthermore,
    this experiment also aims to build a first pre-processed dataset that can be used
    as a basis for the rest of the experiments. As described in Section 4.1.1, the
    original dataset consists of 974,493 rows. This is the result when sensors publish
    a measurement every two-three minutes during one year’s fruit ripening cycle.
    With the aim of determining whether lower data resolution, i.e. fewer measurements
    per hour, provides the same knowledge to the learning models, the undersampling
    technique has been applied. In this regard, the best results in terms of the performance
    of the learning models were obtained when using one row per hour. After the hourly
    undersampling, the dataset reduced the number of rows from 974,493 to 59,534.
    In terms of training, this reduction means more feasible training in terms of
    the application of further pre-processing techniques, the use of less computational
    power, and high speed to train models. Regarding the deployment of the model in
    an IoT system, this reduction implies lower energy consumption of the devices
    in terms of gathering and publishing data, lower bandwidth usage, lower energy
    and computational costs of the component involved in pre-processing the data collected
    by sensors (to provide reliable inputs to the model), lower energy and computational
    costs in the execution of the model, etc. Since experts use the daily (24-hour)
    leaf-turgor pressure curves to determine whether a sensor is performing correctly
    or not (Section 3.2), the training of the models has been approached in the same
    way, including not only the leaf-turgor pressure but also the leaf temperature
    measurements as input features for the algorithms. Thus, once the hourly undersampling
    was applied, the re-frame of time series as supervised learning has been made
    using the measurements of 24 time steps. These time series have 48 input variables
    ( ), i.e. the leaf-turgor pressure and leaf temperature of 24 h, and one value
    that represents the error code of that 24 measurements as the output variable
    ( ). Note that the time series where the 24 h do not share the same error code
    has been deleted. Finally, the MinMax normalisation of the magnitudes according
    to the maximum and minimum values measured by each sensor has been performed.
    This is because, as experts reported, each magnitude moves in slightly different
    ranges for each sensor. In short, in this first experiment, the data have been
    reduced from 974,493 to 59,534 rows, re-frame to time-series (dimensionality of
    48 variables, i.e., the leaf temperature and leaf-turgor pressure of 24 h, and
    a label indicating whether the series is faulty or not) and MinMax normalised.
    Table 7 shows the Experiment 01 results. The weighted average of ROC curves and
    AUC values can be observed in Fig. 8. Moreover, Fig. 17 included in the appendix
    (Appendix) shows not only the weighted average but also the performance of each
    individual sensor through the cross-validation process. In view of the results,
    this second experiment evidences that the problem can be tackled by ML techniques
    and the dataset gathered. This is evidenced by the fact that about 60% of f1-score
    was obtained by classifying the test data, achieving an 8% increase in the value
    of this metric compared to Experiment 00, which was around 52%. Accuracy values
    have also increased for all algorithms by about 6% compared to the previous experiment.

    0.20 On the other hand, one of the most relevant performance metrics in this problem
    is the AUC ROC, which determines the ability of models to discriminate between
    classes, i.e. the ability of the model to classify incorrect measurements as incorrect
    and correct measurements as correct (thus avoiding false positives/negatives)
    [59]. AUC ROC is key in this problem because when a sensor is identified as faulty,
    experts have to go to the country to inspect and fix the faulty sensor. Therefore,
    low AUC ROC, or in other words, the frequent occurrence of false positives, implies
    that experts would have to go to the country unnecessarily frequently, which is
    an undesirable scenario. Currently, an AUC ROC of 0.72 has been achieved for the
    case of SVM (an improvement of 0.14 points over Experiment 00). This AUC ROC performance
    is not yet acceptable, however, in view of the rest of the performance metrics,
    the AUC ROC achieved could be considered high. Therefore, it could be that as
    the other performance metrics improve, the AUC ROC will also improve. Download

    ROC curve and AUC for the ML models developed in Experiment 02. 4.2.3. Experiment
    02: In-depth dataset analysis and learning model performance improvement The aim
    of this experiment is the improvement of the performance of the learning models,
    as the performance achieved in Experiment 01 is not enough to replace experts.
    In this regard, analysing the dataset, it is observed that sensors’ measurements
    present range shifts in their measurements (see Fig. 10). As can be seen in Fig.
    10, these range shifts occur abruptly at specific time instants. Analysing the
    data in more depth, it was found that these time instants match the time instants
    at which a sensor is detected as faulty. According to expert opinion, these range
    shifts are the result of fixing the sensor. Thus, after a sensor fault, experts
    place the sensor again correctly, often in a different position or even changing
    the leaf, which shifts the range in which the sensor was gathering its measurements.
    Therefore, in this second experiment, an improved MinMax normalisation of the
    measurements of each sensor is performed taking into account the above-described
    range shifts. Download : Download high-res image (471KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 10. Leaf-turgor pressure measurements from a sensor normalised without
    taking into account range shifts (A), and normalised taking into account the range
    shifts (B). Furthermore, analysing the dataset, it has been noticed that when
    sensors’ measurements are identified as faulty, several previous days of correct
    measurements have also been labelled as faulty. After seeking expert opinion,
    it was reported that since a sensor is manually identified as faulty, the previous
    days’ measurements are also labelled as incorrect to ensure the correctness of
    the data for subsequent studies. Furthermore, it has been noticed that when a
    faulty sensor is fixed, experts also label all measurements of that sensor for
    that day as incorrect. This is a key aspect to take into account as introducing
    mislabelled measurements into ML algorithms might have a negative impact. So,
    Mislabels correction has been applied in this experiment by removing all the measurements
    that are susceptible of have being mislabelled. Table 8 shows the Experiment 02
    results. The weighted average of ROC curves and AUC values can be observed in
    Fig. 9. Moreover, Fig. 18 included in the appendix (Appendix) shows not only the
    weighted average but also the performance of each individual sensor through the
    cross-validation process. Thus, applying the above pre-processing techniques,
    this second experiment achieves a performance of 80.8% of f1-score in the case
    of SVM, an 18.7% more than the best result reported by Experiment 01 (62.1% of
    f1-score in the case of NB and kNN(k=7)). Furthermore, the AUC ROC achieved is
    0.91, also in the case of SVM (0.19 more than the best case reported by Experiment
    01). According to experts’ opinion, this increased performance brings learning
    models closer to an expert in terms of identifying sensor faults. Table 8. Experiment

    and AUC for the ML models developed in Experiment 03. Therefore, in view of the
    results obtained, this model could replace the experts in the identification of
    sensor faults. 4.2.4. Experiment 03. Fine-tuning of the model. This experiment
    aims to further increase the performance achieved in Experiment 02. In this regard,
    there are techniques that have not yet been applied, such as data-augmentation
    techniques (Oversampling), which could increase the performance of the models
    in problems where the number of samples is low. Thus, data-augmentation techniques
    have been applied. These techniques have been considered particularly interesting
    for two reasons: (1) The first reason refers to the common benefit of increasing
    data when dealing with a ML problem, i.e. increasing the number of instances of
    a particular class allows models to gain more knowledge of this class, learning
    better and performing better at classifying instances of this class [60]. (2)
    Secondly, note that the learning models are not only trained and tested with faulty
    records, but an equal number of correct records is taken, thus providing balanced
    sets with respect to the two possible classes (faulty measurement and correct
    measurement). Since incorrect measurements are the minority class, when sampling
    an equal number of correct records to balance the classes there are a lot of correct
    measurements that are not included (around 97% of the total). Therefore, increasing
    the number of incorrect records also means increasing the percentage of correct
    records that are considered to train and test the learning models. In this way,
    the algorithms are fed with a wider variety of correct measurements. The applied
    data augmentation technique consists of increasing and decreasing incorrect measurements
    slightly in a random way, generating new measurements similar to the previous
    one, thus giving the models more variety of possible incorrectly behaving measurements.
    In this regard, the best results were achieved by generating three new faults
    from each original fault. Table 9 shows the Experiment 03 results. The weighted
    average of ROC curves and AUC values can be observed in Fig. 11. Moreover, Fig.
    19 included in the appendix (Appendix) shows not only the weighted average but
    also the performance of each individual sensor through the cross-validation process.
    In this final experiment, an 84.2% of f1-score is achieved with the SVM algorithm,
    a 3.4% more than in Experiment 02 (80.8% in the case of SVM). This performance
    also improves AUC, achieving a 0.94 of AUC. Table 9. Experiment 03 results. The

    the proposed methodology to the main phases of a data science project. To sum
    up, the best learning model presents an 84.2% f1-score and 0.94 AUC, making it
    feasible to replace experts, thus automating the process of identifying faulty
    sensors. In the following sections, a novel methodology for tackling similar problems
    involving time series and sensor data will be presented. Furthermore, it will
    be illustrated how to integrate the resulting ML model into an IoT system so that
    it can be already deployed and exploited for sensor fault detection in plum tree
    orchards. 5. Proposed methodology for sensor fault detection in time series In
    this paper, not only a learning model for sensor fault detection has been developed
    together with an IoT system, but also an entire approach for sensor time series
    classification has been illustrated in a real use case. Since the techniques and
    knowledge achieved in this work could help to successfully tackle similar problems
    that integrate time series and sensors with less time and effort, this section
    presents a methodology that summarises such key ideas and techniques. Fig. 12
    relates the proposed methodology to the main phases of a traditional data science
    project. Note that in Fig. 12, the traditional steps of a data science project
    are shown with a dotted border, in contrast to the novel steps proposed in the
    methodology, which are shown with a solid border. These novel steps proposed in
    the methodology affect most phases of a data science project, ranging from the
    exploratory data analysis to the training and validation of ML models (see Fig.
    12). The steps of the proposed methodology are explained in detail below: • Determining
    the seasonality of the measured magnitude. One of the first steps in tackling
    a problem involving times series is to determine the seasonality time period of
    the measured magnitude, i.e. the time period in which optional patterns of behaviour
    are repeated. In the case of the problem addressed in this article, the seasonality
    time is 24 h since as can be seen in Fig. 3, the leaf-turgor pressure increases
    during the day with the rise of the sun and decreases at night, which corresponds
    to the tree’s photosynthesis cycles. In addition, the other measured magnitude
    is the leaf temperature, which is also directly related to the daily cycles. Moreover,
    as the experts said, they displayed 24-hour charts to label the measurements as
    correct or incorrect. In other problems, seasonality periods can range from a
    few minutes to weeks, months or even years. • Parallel coordinate display. To
    further time series analysis, plots with parallel coordinates can be generated.
    This paper includes two charts of this nature in Fig. 3, Fig. 4, with 30 days
    from 00 a.m. to 11 p.m. of measurements classified as correct and incorrect by
    the experts, respectively. With these charts, it is possible to notice particular
    patterns and behaviours in the data that provide information and a better understanding
    of the problem. Note that the visualisation of this type of chart is extremely
    useful for determining the seasonality time discussed in the previous point. •
    Normalisation according to range-shifts. As discussed in Experiment 02 in Section
    4, a normalisation according to features and even differentiating between sensors
    is not always enough. It is possible that different ranges of values may be measured
    for the same magnitude within a sensor (see Fig. 10). In the particular case of
    this work, ranges shifts occur when CICYTEX workers detect faults in the sensors
    and change the position or even the leaf where the sensor is attached. This is
    a non-trivial issue, and the normalisation according to each range shift has produced
    in this work a substantial improvement in the performance of the learning models.
    Note that in other problems this situation could also occur, especially with the
    emerging digital transformation of the agricultural sector with greater monitoring
    of crops with sensors attached to leaves or tree trunks, where the amplitude of
    the measured magnitude can be dependent on the exact point where it is placed,
    as occurs in this work. • Re-frame Time Series as Supervised Learning. After proper
    analysis and normalisation of the dataset, a time series classification or forecasting
    problem can be approached as a supervised ML problem by reformatting the data,
    using the previous measurements of time steps as the input variables ( ) and the
    value of the next time step or a label as the output variable ( ) [36]. For the
    particular case of this paper Re-frame Time Series as Supervised Learning is applied
    considering 24 h or time steps of leaf temperature and leaf-turgor pressure measurements
    as input variables (48 features), together with a class label that indicates whether
    the time series of measurements has been classified as correct or incorrect by
    the experts. Table 3 shows an illustrative example of the records for a classification
    problem in which measurements of two variables from two previous time steps are
    considered to determine a label. • Split by sensors to train and validate models.
    As discussed in Section 4.1.1, learning models are trained and validated so that
    data from the same sensor are never in both stages. Note that in a tree, leaves
    are oriented towards different cardinal points, have different exposure to the
    sun or may be older or younger, among other factors, this results in each sensor
    showing particular leaf-turgor pressure behaviours. Validating with data from
    sensors not used for training ensures that the performance metrics obtained correspond
    to the actual performance of the models, since in future it will have to classify
    measurements from sensors attached to leaves that have never been seen before
    in the training phase. This is something that can occur in other problems involving
    time series, especially in the agricultural sector with sensors on crop leaves,
    therefore validation of models with data from sensors other than those used to
    train them may also be necessary to ensure that models are able to generalise
    properly. • Sensor weighted cross-validation. As discussed in the previous point,
    in order to properly calculate the performance metrics of the models it is sometimes
    necessary to validate with data from sensors that have never been seen in the
    training phase. Thus, an alternative version of k-fold cross-validation is proposed
    in this article (see Section 4.1.2), where the division between folds is made
    by sensors, always saving the measurements of one sensor for testing and training
    with the measurements of the remaining ones. Therefore, there are as many folds
    as sensors. In each fold, the metrics obtained are weighted to calculate the average,
    given that there are sensors with more data and faults than others. This validation
    process can be applied to many other problems, where segregating by sensors for
    training and testing is necessary to ensure that the models generalise properly.
    Furthermore, AUC ROC charts can be computed by following the same sensor cross-validation
    process. See Fig. 11 where the AUC ROC folds of Experiment 03 are displayed for
    every single fold or sensor, and the weighted average ROC curve is calculated
    and plotted thicker in blue. As shown, many of the techniques and knowledge achieved
    in this work can be applied to similar problems involving sensors and time series.
    In this section, a complete methodology has been proposed to tackle this type
    of problems, ranging from the analysis of the time series by visualising parallel
    coordinate charts and determining the seasonality of the measured magnitude, through
    the transformation of the data so that time series classification and forecasting
    problems can be tackled as supervised ML problems, to the validation of the results,
    including as well an alternative cross-validation process that separates training
    and test sets by sensors in each fold. Therefore, many related future works involving
    time series could be based on the proposed methodology and thus reduce the development
    cost in time and effort, as well as improve the results in terms of performance.

    Fig. 13. Software architecture of the IoT-based expert system. 6. IoT-based expert
    system for leaf-turgor pressure sensor fault detection This section proposes an
    IoT-based expert system that integrates the learning model trained through the
    experiments described in Section 4. In this regard, this section is structured
    as follows: Section 6.1 describes the motivation for developing the IoT system.
    Section 6.2 identifies some design requirements that the proposed system has to
    reach. Section 6.3 presents the design, main layers and components of the system.
    Finally, Section 6.6 conducts a discussion about the trade-offs of the system
    design. 6.1. IoT-based expert system. Motivation In this communication, a learning
    model that is able to identify faulty leaf-turgor pressure sensors has been developed.
    However, to take advantage of this learning model, it has to be integrated into
    the WSN of leaf-turgor pressure sensors. Therefore, the main motivation for developing
    this IoT system is to integrate and take advantage of the trained learning model
    in a real system. Thus, also showing how the learning model can be deployed as
    part of an IoT system, its role within the system, interactions with the other
    devices or software components, etc. 6.2. Iot-based expert system. Design requirements
    The IoT currently has several open challenges that should be taken into account
    in the development of any IoT system. Furthermore, depending on the IoT system,
    addressing some of these open challenges is a must. Thus, the open challenges
    that have been considered key to the IoT system that has been developed in this
    communication are: (1) Interoperability, (2) Energy awareness, and (3) Scalability.
    In the context of IoT, interoperability is understood as the property that allows
    an IoT system to operate with a third party, such as another IoT system, an application,
    etc. [10]. This open challenge has to be addressed in the proposed system, as
    the sensor fault detection system could be a part of a larger IoT system that
    requires such fault detection service (e.g. a smart irrigation system). Therefore,
    the IoT system has to be interoperable. On the other hand, given the current scenario
    of climate change [61], the challenges to be overcome by many countries towards
    the exclusive use of green energies [62], the limitations of the IoT itself, such
    as the low battery life of some IoT devices [63] (as in the case of leaf-turgor
    pressure sensors), and also the context of our research, energy consumption needs
    to be optimised as much as possible. For these reasons, the IoT system has to
    be energy-aware. Finally, scalability can be defined as the property that ensures
    that, regardless of the size of the IoT system (number of devices connected to
    it), the performance of the IoT system will not be negatively affected [10]. Since
    the IoT system that has been developed could be deployed on small or large agricultural
    farms, the system has to be scalable. 6.3. Iot-based expert system. Design, layers
    and components This section presents the proposed IoT system’s design, main layers
    and components. For the sake of clarity, each layer is presented below specifying
    its aim and components. Thus, layers, their components and interrelationships
    are described. Note that, to describe the elements better, the numerical and alphabetical
    labels shown in Fig. 13 are used below as references in the text. These references
    are used for layers and components by means of the expression [layer or component
    name] Ⓧ, where is the label associated with the [layer or component name] in Fig.
    13. References are used for relationships by means of the expression (relationship
    ⓝ), where n is the label associated with the relationship in Fig. 13, avoiding
    its name. • Leaf-turgor pressure sensors Layer Ⓐ Aim. This layer represents the
    WSN of leaf-turgor pressure sensors deployed on the plum tree farm. The purpose
    of this layer is to feed measurements into the system, where each individual measurement
    will be classified as correct or faulty. Interrelationships. The sensors from
    the Leaf-turgor pressure sensors layer periodically publish their measurements
    in the MQTT Broker Ⓑ(relationship ①). • MQTT Broker Ⓑ Aim. The purpose of this
    component is to allow communication between the other layers and components of
    the IoT system through the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol,
    based on the publish–subscribe pattern. In the proposed IoT system in Fig. 13,
    the message broker that implements the MQTT protocol Eclipse Mosquitto [64] is
    used. Interrelationships. As the central element driving the communication, the
    MQTT Broker has several interrelationships. These interrelationships will be explained
    below in each component and layer description. • Persistence Layer Ⓒ Aim. The
    main purpose of this layer is to provide persistence to all data sent by the Leaf-turgor
    pressure sensors layer Ⓐ. Thus, this layer provides persistence to both, raw and
    labelled sensor measurements (as correct or incorrect). Also allows other components
    to query such data. Components: – DB Manager. The aim of this component is to
    receive and insert into a database all the raw sensor measurements published in
    the MQTT BrokerⒷby the Leaf-turgor pressure sen- sors layer Ⓐ, as well as labelled
    sensor measurements published in the MQTT Broker Ⓑby the Machine Learning layer
    (Expert System) Ⓓ. To do that, first, it subscribes to the topics provided by
    the MQTT Broker Ⓑwhere the Leaf-turgor pressure sensors layer Ⓐpublish their measurements
    (relationship ②). Each time a sensor measurement is published in the MQTT Broker
    Ⓑthe DB Manager receives it (relationship ③) and inserts the sensor reading into
    the database (MongoDB) as a JSON document (relationship ④). In addition, it also
    subscribes to the topic of the MQTT Broker Ⓑwhere the Machine Learning layer (Expert
    System) Ⓓpublish labelled sensor measurements (relationships ②and ⑪), and stores
    received sensor measurements labelled as correct or incorrect in a different collection
    in the database (relationship ④). – DB. The purpose of this component is to store
    sensor measurements and machine learning classifications. Thus, the raw measurements
    sent by the sensors are stored in one collection, and the measurements labelled
    as correct or incorrect by the Machine Learning layer (Expert System) Ⓓare stored
    in a separate collection. In the proposed IoT system in Fig. 13, the NoSQL database
    MongoDB [65] is used. • Machine Learning Layer (Expert System) Ⓓ Aim. The purpose
    of this layer is to classify and label as correct or incorrect the raw sensor
    measurements sent by the Leaf-turgor pressure sensors layer Ⓐ, as well as to publish
    the labelled sensor measurements in the MQTT Broker Ⓑ. Components: – Data pre-processor.
    The purpose of this component is to perform all the necessary pre-processing techniques
    to adapt the sensor measurements to the learning models. Thus, reliable and properly
    formatted data is provided to the learning models. In this way, the learning models
    are able to classify the sensor measurements as correct or incorrect. Note that
    the pre-processing techniques applied are those previously discussed in Section
    3.3.1. – Learning Model. This component hosts the best-performing learning model
    developed in the experiments (Section 4). The aim of this component is to classify
    the data published by the Leaf-turgor pressure sensors layer Ⓐas correct or incorrect.
    Thus, through the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), the service receives the
    sensors’ measurements already pre-processed from the Data pre-processor component.
    Then, it returns the sensors’ measurements together with the classification performed
    by the model (0=incorrect; 1=correct). – ML Manager. This is the core component
    of this layer. Its purpose is to manage the flow of data between the above-described
    components. Thus, the ML Manager periodically queries the latest measurements
    from the raw or unlabelled collection of the DB in the Persistence layer Ⓒ(relationships
    ⑤and ⑥). These raw sensor measurements are sent to the Data Processor component
    (relationship ⑦) which applies all the necessary transformations and pre-processing
    techniques to the data and sends it back to the ML Manager (relationship ⑧). Then,
    the properly pre-processed and formatted data is sent to the Learning Model component
    (relationship ⑨). In this way, the sensors measurements are classified and the
    result (labelled measurements) is returned to the ML Manager (relationship ⑩),
    which publishes it in the MQTT Broker Ⓑ(relationship ⑪). • Clients Layer Ⓔ Aim.
    The purpose of this layer is to represent the target users of the IoT system,
    who exploit the learning model to detect faults in the leaf-turgor pressure sensors
    deployed in plum tree farms. Note that target users can be people as well as other
    computer systems. Interrelationships. The Clients layer is subscribed to the classification
    reports in the MQTT Broker Ⓑ(relationship ⑫). So, every time the Machine Learning
    layer Ⓓpublishes a new labelled measurement, it will be received by the Clients
    layer Ⓔ(relationship ⑬). Note that with this approach the target users do not
    have to worry about the internal logic of the system that works as a black box
    for them. Once the sensors publish their raw measurements in the appropriate topic
    of the MQTT Broker Ⓑ, they are only responsible for subscribing to the topic in
    the MQTT Broker Ⓑwhere the labelled sensor measurements are published. • Leaf-turgor
    pressure sensors fault detection system Ⓕ Aim. This box encompasses all the elements
    previously described and can be considered as a single entity. It is the IoT-based
    expert system for fault detection in leaf-turgor pressure sensors that integrates
    and exploits the best learning model developed in the experiments (Section 4).
    This system persistently stores the sensor measurements and allows them to be
    queried, both raw and labelled (classified as correct or incorrect). Thus, it
    allows third parties applications or users to query such data through the Interoperability
    layer Ⓖ. Interrelationships. Its interrelationships are discussed below, as they
    are related to the Interoperability layer Ⓖ. • Interoperability Layer (Middleware)
    Ⓖ Aim. The purpose of this layer is to allow any application or user to query
    and consume sensor records from the Leaf-turgor pressure sensors fault detection
    system Ⓕ, both raw, i.e. the data directly stored from sensors measurements, and
    labelled (as correct or incorrect), i.e. the data after the application of the
    pre-processing techniques and the learning model. Interrelationships. Thus, this
    layer acts as middleware (REST API) that allows any application or user that is
    not able to use the MQTT protocol to query data from the IoT system’s persistent
    storage (relationships ⑯, ⑭and ⑮). Thus, after receiving a request, the middleware
    returns such data to the user or application that requested it (relationship ⑰).
    • Other IoT systems Ⓗ Aim. This layer represents all IoT systems that could take
    advantage of the Leaf-turgor pressure sensor fault detection IoT systemⒻthrough
    the Interoperability layer (Middleware) Ⓖ. Note that the Interoperability layer
    (Middleware) Ⓖensures that any third IoT system, regardless of its particular
    communication protocols and properties, can consume the proposed IoT system for
    fault detection. An example could be a smart irrigation system, which detects
    faults automatically without the need for an expert to manually check the sensors.
    Finally, note that the proposed system integrates MQTT, which is associated with
    an event-driven architecture (EDA), with REST functionality. The reason for not
    adopting a purely EDA or purely REST solution is described below. An event-driven
    architecture allows data to be managed by using publish–subscribe communication
    protocols, which help us to improve internal components’ reusability, design low
    coupling systems and improve aspects such as fault tolerance, energy-awareness
    and scalability [66], [67], [68]. On the other hand, REST APIs make it possible
    to describe single entry points for service provisioning/consumption, either between
    system components or for third-party components that could be integrated with
    the system. Thus, both paradigms can (should) be used together, using each of
    them according to the application context in order to take advantage of their
    strengths. So, in this work, the following application criteria have been followed:
    EDA if (1) The data does not have a specific recipient, (2) No response is expected
    from the recipients and (3) The data is not a response to a request. REST if (1)
    The data has a specific recipient, (2) A response is expected from the recipients
    or (3) The data is a response to a request. 6.4. Infrastructure of the proposed
    IoT-based expert system In this section, the infrastructure of the proposed IoT-based
    expert system is described. Thus, this section addresses aspects such as the network
    topology adopted, the protocol stacks used, the hardware employed for each node
    of the system, the technologies that support the WSN architecture (Fig. 13 Ⓐ)
    as well as the platforms that support the deployment of the rest of the system,
    i.e. Persistence, ML and Interoperability layers (Fig. 13, labels Ⓒ, Ⓓand Ⓖrespectively).
    Note that, for the sake of clarity, a graphical summary of this section is shown
    in Fig. 14. Thus, first of all, before describing the infrastructure design of
    the system, the system model, i.e. the characteristics and assumptions of the
    system that need to be taken into account throughout this design process, has
    been defined. • Scalability is one of the requirements of the system as described
    in Section 6.2. So, large-scale WSNs are expected. • The leaf-turgor pressure
    sensor layer (WSN, Fig. 13 Ⓐ) is deployed in a different location from the ML
    layer (where predictions are made, Fig. 13 Ⓓ). So, the Internet is required to
    connect the WSN to the Base Station (BS), i.e. the platform on which the ML layer
    is deployed (Microsoft Azure [69]). • Sensors are only needed at the defined control
    points (see Fig. 1). Thus, the leaf-turgor pressure sensors are deployed in the
    same area but grouped in these control points. • Sensors gather data at a fixed
    rate (five minutes). • Sensor fault identification is carried out at a fixed rate
    (hourly). • Sensors are homogeneous, i.e. have the same computing power, energy
    consumption, battery life, processes and data gathering rate. In this regard,
    note that the sensors’ hardware is constrained. • Internet access is provided
    through WiFi (IEEE 802.11 [70]). • Sensors do not have a WiFi card, although they
    come equipped with a Bluetooth 4.2 LE (BLE) module. • Energy-awareness is one
    of the requirements of the system as described in Section 6.2. So, energy-efficient
    protocols are required. • Both leaf-turgor pressure sensors and the Base Station
    (BS), are static after deployment. Thus, from this system model and studies such
    as [71] or [72], it has been considered that the most appropriate WSN topology
    for the proposed system is the Cluster-based topology. In this way, each control
    point, where sensors are grouped, is managed as a cluster of the WSN. Concerning
    the communication between the WSN and the BS, there are several key aspects related
    to the system model to take into consideration before its design. Firstly, leaf-turgor
    pressure sensors lack WiFi, which is required to connect to the Internet and send
    the collected data directly to the BS. Secondly, energy-awareness is crucial in
    this design stage because of the sensors’ hardware constraints and the aim of
    designing a green IoT system (Section 6.2). Thirdly, sensors come with a BLE module
    to transmit the gathered data. Download : Download high-res image (606KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 14. Infrastructure of the IoT-based expert system.
    Bearing in mind these aspects and analysing BLE features such as its energy-awareness
    in low-rate data transmissions, in sleep mode and when establishing communication
    [73], [74], it has been considered appropriate to use this technology for the
    transmission of the collected data. Then, to enable the sending of the data gathered
    to the BS, a new device with BLE (in order to collect the data gathered by sensors)
    and WiFi (in order to connect to the Internet), has to be added to the WSN. According
    to these requirements, the included device is the RaspBerry Pi 3 B+ [75], which
    has been added to each cluster of the WSN with the role of Cluster Head (CH).
    So, every five minutes (sensor gathering rate) the CH collects (via BLE) the data
    gathered by each sensor belonging to its cluster. Note that to carry out this
    transmission, the BLE protocol stack defined in [76] is used. On the other hand,
    once per hour (prediction rate of the expert system), the CHs aggregate the collected
    data and send it to the BS. As for this transmission, it is performed through
    MQTT, which is applied over the TCP protocol through the Internet (IP protocol).
    In this regard, according to the aforementioned, the RaspBerries access to the
    Internet through WiFi. On the other hand, the infrastructure design of the rest
    of the system, i.e. the BS, could be summarised in Microsoft Azure and Kubernetes
    [77]. Thus, each component belonging to the Persistence, ML and Interoperability
    layers together with the MQTT Broker (Fig. 13, labels Ⓒ, Ⓓ, Ⓖand Ⓑrespectively)
    are wrapped in a Docker container, deployed on Microsoft Azure and orchestrated
    by Kubernetes. Regarding the communication between these components, they use
    both MQTT and HTTP over TCP/IP to interact among them (see Fig. 13). As for the
    protocols used below TCP/IP, in this case, it will depend on Microsoft Azure.
    6.5. Computational complexity analysis of the proposed IoT-based expert system
    The computational complexity of a system [78] is usually expressed by the well-known
    Big-O notation [79]. In short, the Big-O notation represents the worst-case computational
    complexity of a system by determining how its time requirements increase as the
    size of the inputs grows and approaches infinity [79]. In this section, an analysis
    from the Big-O notation perspective about the computational complexity of the
    proposed IoT-based expert system is carried out. On the one hand, the computational
    complexity related to the training and running (i.e. make a classification) of
    the learning models is addressed. On the other hand, the computational complexity
    of each layer of the proposed IoT-based expert system is assessed. In this case,
    the impact of each learning model on these components (when deployed together)
    is also explored. 6.5.1. Computational complexity of the ML algorithms Firstly,
    the computational complexity of the learning models is addressed. Although these
    algorithms belong to the Machine Learning layer (Expert System) Ⓓ, they are analysed
    separately from the rest of the system due to several reasons such as their relevance
    within the proposed IoT-based expert system, the presence of additional variables
    that impact its complexity (e.g. the number of support vectors in SVM), and the
    type of analysis, which is carried out from two different perspectives, training
    and running complexity. Thus, Table 10 shows the computational complexity of each
    ML algorithm applied in this manuscript (see Section 3.3.2). As mentioned above,
    this complexity is analysed from two perspectives, training and running complexity.
    The training complexity is related to the time required for the ML algorithms
    to train the classification models. On the other hand, the running complexity
    is related to the time required to perform classifications using these models
    once they have been trained. Regarding the variables used to determine the computational
    complexity of these ML algorithms, is the number of instances that form the training
    dataset, is the number of features of each instance, is the number of neighbours
    specified in kNN and is the number of support vectors specified in SVM. Note that
    these variables represent the inputs to the ML algorithms, whose growth affects
    the computational complexity of the training and running processes of the learning
    models. Finally, it should be noted that the computational complexity of these
    ML algorithms has already been addressed in the literature [80], [81]. Table 10.

    complexity of the iot-based expert system and notation used The computational
    complexity of an algorithm in terms of Big-O notation can be determined by analysing
    its code. Specifically, from the structures that scale in number of operations
    as the size of the input variables grows, i.e. loops and nested loops [79], [82].
    This analysis has been carried out for each component that forms the proposed
    IoT-based expert system. Table 11 shows the computational complexity determined
    for each system layer. To carry out this analysis, a Big-O notation similar to
    that used in Section 6.5.1 has been applied. Nevertheless, the concept that the
    variables represent changes depending on the context (Layer) in which they are
    applied. So, the notation used and its meaning in each case is presented below.
    In this section, is equal to , where represents the number of measured magnitudes
    (e.g. leaf-turgor pressure and leaf temperature) and represents the number of
    time steps considered (e.g. 24 h). Note that is equal to since the number of features
    ( ) in each time series is the number of measured magnitudes ( ) multiplied by
    the number of time steps ( ). On the other hand, sensors gather data at a fixed
    gathering rate (e.g. every five minutes). Therefore, if sensors grow, the amount
    of data gathered grows in the same proportion. Moreover, the number of time series
    that can be generated grows in the same proportion as both. As these three variables
    (number of sensors, number of recorded measurements and number of final time series)
    grow in the same proportion, they can be reduced to the same variable , which
    represents all three interchangeably. Table 11. Computational complexity of the
    proposed Leaf-turgor pressure sensors fault detection system Ⓕ and each of its

    Ⓓ ML Manager Data pre-processor Learning Model Depending on the algorithm (see
    Table 10) 6.5.3. Computational complexity of the Machine Learning layer Table
    12 shows the computational complexity of the Machine Learning layer Ⓓ. To determine
    this computational complexity, the computational complexity of each of the components
    of this layer has been assessed. Firstly, the computational complexity of the
    Data Preprocessor grows as the number of monitored magnitudes ( ) and the number
    of time steps considered ( ) for each record to preprocess ( ) increases . Note
    that the computational complexity of this component is not affected by the learning
    models, as the required pre-processing techniques are the same for all of them.
    Secondly, as the Learning Model component represents the selected learning model
    to be deployed as part of the IoT-based expert system, its computational complexity
    is the complexity of the selected learning model (see Table 10). Thirdly, regarding
    the ML Manager component, it manages the flow of the data in the Machine Learning
    layer Ⓓ. So, it requests periodically the data gathered by the sensors from the
    DB. Later, it sends this data to the Data Preprocessor. Once the preprocessed
    data is received, it requests the Learning Model to get the classifications and
    publish them to the MQTT Broker Ⓑ. Therefore, the complexity of this component
    is determined by the component with the highest complexity on which it depends.
    In this regard, note that only the ML layer is affected by the learning model
    selected to be deployed as part of the IoT-based expert system. 6.5.4. Computational
    complexity of the Persistence layer The purpose of the Persistence layer Ⓒis to
    provide persistence to both, raw and labelled sensor measurements (as correct
    or incorrect). In this regard, note that to optimise the insertion and retrieval
    of the data, a date-based index has been included in the DB. Therefore, the number
    of operations required to insert or retrieve a measurement (by means of a dichotomous
    search by date) will grow in a logarithmic order, i.e. . So, as the tasks of the
    DB Manager are limited to inserting and retrieving data by date from the database,
    the computational complexity of this component is . 6.5.5. Computational complexity
    of the Leaf-turgor pressure sensors layer The Leaf-turgor pressure sensors layer
    Ⓐrepresents the WSN deployed in the experimental plot, which is composed of leaf-turgor
    pressure sensors clusters and Cluster Heads. Thus, each cluster sends its measurements
    to its Cluster Head, which aggregates and publishes them to the MQTT Broker Ⓑ.
    Therefore, the amount of operations that this layer has to perform grows linearly
    with the number of sensors ( ) deployed. So, the time complexity of the layer
    is . 6.5.6. Computational complexity of the Interoperability layer The Interoperability
    layer Ⓖacts as a middleware (REST API) that allows any application or user to
    request data from the IoT system’s persistent storage. Since the DB has a complexity
    of , the computational complexity of this layer is . 6.5.7. Computational complexity
    of the MQTT Broker Although the MQTT Broker is not a system layer, it is an essential
    element of the system. So, its computational complexity is addressed in this section.
    Thus, the computational complexity of the MQTT Broker Ⓑdepends on which has been
    used. In this work, the Eclipse Mosquitto [64] has been selected and its computational
    complexity has already been analysed in the literature from several perspectives,
    such as the growth of response times as the size of the message payload increases
    [83], as well as the number of publishers increases [84]. In both cases, a linear
    growth relationship between response time and these magnitudes is identified,
    i.e. . In the proposed system, both the number of publishers could vary ( sensors
    deployed) and the message payload (amount of data aggregated by each Cluster Head).
    As the complexity in both cases grows linearly and they involve independent processes,
    the complexity of the MQTT Broker is . Finally, note that the Machine Learning
    layer Ⓓis the component that presents the highest computational complexity. Therefore,
    the overall computational complexity of the system is determined by the complexity
    of this component. In this regard, it is crucial to take into account that the
    computational complexity of this layer varies depending on the selected learning
    model. On the other hand, also note that the complexity of the client layer has
    not been analysed. This is because the client layer could involve any type of
    device or system that consumes the proposed expert system. 6.6. Discussion about
    the proposed IoT-based expert system The proposed system is an energy-aware, scalable
    and interoperable IoT system based on the system of systems paradigm [85]. Given
    that the previous section did not address how these open challenges have been
    specifically addressed, this section discusses how these IoT open challenges have
    been reached with the software architecture of the system and its components.
    Regarding the energy awareness of the system, communication is considered one
    of the key factors in terms of sensor energy consumption [86]. In this sense,
    the MQTT communication protocol has been chosen since it is one of the most widespread
    and energy-efficient protocols in the IoT [87]. On the other hand, the number
    of sensors’ publications has been considerably reduced. Before the training of
    the learning model, the sensors belonging to the sensor layer Ⓐwere configured
    to publish their data every two or three minutes. However, after the experiments
    were carried out, the trained learning model showed that it is able to perform
    with only one measurement from each sensor per hour. This represents a decrease
    of around 95% in the data that sensors have to gather and publish, implying significant
    energy savings. Besides, it also implies a reduction in the use of the bandwidth
    of the IoT system, which also saves energy. Regarding scalability, the main elements
    of the proposed system are designed to be scaled. The Leaf-turgor pressure layer
    Ⓐcan be scaled by simply adding more sensors to it. The Persistence layer Ⓒis
    composed of MongoDB, a NoSQL database designed to be scalable [88]. Concerning
    the Machine learning layer Ⓓ, both the Data pre-processor and the Learning model
    components can be replicated, being the ML manager which would act as a load balancer
    in this scenario. Finally, the Interoperability layer Ⓖcan be also replicated.
    Finally, regarding interoperability, the proposed system is designed following
    the system of systems paradigm. In this way, the Leaf-turgor pressure sensors
    fault detection IoT system Ⓕcan be integrated or consumed as a service by third-party
    applications or systems through the Interoperability layer Ⓖ. So, third-party
    systems only have to request the services (faults identified, whole labelled dataset,
    whole raw dataset, etc.) they need from this layer Ⓖand pre-process the response
    (if needed) to later consume it. 7. Discussion Precision irrigation techniques
    are a vehicle for the sustainable use of water in agriculture. In this regard,
    techniques such as deficit irrigation techniques need precise knowledge of crop
    water stress to be suitably applied. Proposals such as [9] provide these precision
    irrigation techniques with the water stress of crops. However, such solutions
    are IoT-based and often involve sensors. So, it is mandatory to identify sensor
    faults since they could compromise the application of precision irrigation techniques,
    negatively impacting crop yield. Besides, in the context of leaf-turgor pressure
    sensors, this process is carried out manually by experts. So, it is tedious, time-consuming
    and costly. With the aim of improving the digital transformation by using and
    automating this process in the context of leaf-turgor pressure sensors, this communication
    presents as main contribution a learning model that is able of identifying leaf-turgor
    pressure sensor faults with an 84.2% f1-score and 0.94 AUC ROC. According to the
    experts’ opinion, these results imply the feasibility of replacing them in order
    to carry out this process. Therefore, using this model, manual error identification
    can be avoided, thus reducing the effort and costs associated with this task.
    Besides, the digital transformation of this process also increases the feasibility
    and scalability of proposals such as [9], since they no longer require an expert
    in terms of fault identification to be successfully applied. However, taking into
    account that the performance of the learning model is not able to identify 100%
    if a sensor fails, to achieve the optimum crop yield it is recommended that experts
    manually inspect the correct status of sensors occasionally. Nevertheless, in
    this scenario, the workload related to this task has been also substantially reduced.
    On the other hand, the training of this model has involved dealing with several
    challenges. So, it has been considered interesting to develop a methodology taking
    into account these difficulties. In this regard, this methodology could save effort,
    time and money for those facing a similar problem. However, it should be noted
    that the usability of this methodology depends on the scope of the problem to
    address and its similarity with the problem addressed in this communication. This
    communication also presents an IoT system that integrates the fault identification
    learning model. In this way, it illustrates how the learning model should be deployed
    and applied by showing its role in the system, interactions with other components
    of the system, required components for its operation, etc. Furthermore, the design
    of the IoT system is carried out bearing in mind aspects such as scalability,
    interoperability and energy awareness. Thus, the use and applicability of the
    learning model are shown, encouraging those who can benefit from it to integrate
    it into their systems. Besides, in a simple and sustainable way, due to its interoperability
    and energy-awareness properties. Finally, to the best of the authors’ knowledge,
    the related works to date on fault detection in WSNs are generalist and theoretical,
    i.e., they attempt to detect faults synthetically injected by the authors themselves
    in the sensor data. A relevant contribution of this paper is that the findings
    of these related works have been shown to be successfully applied to a real use
    case, thus corroborating the applicability of the techniques and knowledge achieved
    by the related works in a real-world application case with real, non-synthetically
    injected faults. In this way, further work dealing with fault detection in real
    WSNs can be more reliably supported by these related works. Nevertheless, the
    contributions of this communication enable, through technologies such as IoT and
    ML, the digital transformation and automation of fault detection of leaf-turgor
    pressure sensors deployed in plum tree farms. Furthermore, both the proposed methodology
    and the validation of the applicability of the findings of more theoretical studies
    in a real use case scenario could reduce the efforts and costs of solving similar
    problems. As for the limitations of this work, the main limitation is the lack
    of data from plum tree crops grown in different climates. In different climates,
    the behaviour of the leaf-turgor pressure curves could vary. So, the performance
    of the trained learning models might be reduced if they are applied in this context.
    Nevertheless, even though applied in this scenario, no significant decrease in
    performance is expected, but some uncertainty is expected in those faults that
    are more difficult for learning models to identify. On the other hand, another
    limitation of this work is that it is not possible to state that this proposal
    is valid for other types of crops. Although the pressure curves of other crops
    are similar to those of plum trees, no validation tests have been carried out
    in this respect. Thus, further research is needed in this matter. 8. Conclusions
    and future works This section presents the conclusions, as well as some possible
    lines of future research that can be explored to improve or complement the study
    reported in this paper. 8.1. Conclusions Some precision irrigation techniques
    use input data coming from or based on data gathered by sensors. However, these
    sensors could fail, leading to an inaccurate application of these techniques.
    As this scenario could compromise crop yield, identifying faults in these sensors
    is a must. Currently, in the context of leaf-turgor pressure sensors, the identification
    of sensor faults is carried out manually by experts. This process is tedious,
    time-consuming and costly. So, in order to avoid it, this communication has presented
    a learning model able to identify leaf-turgor pressure sensor faults with an 84.2%
    f1-score and a 0.94 AUC ROC, a suitable performance to replace the manual process.
    Besides, the key aspects related to the experiments carried out to train this
    model have been identified, thus developing a methodology from them that could
    improve the investment of time, money and efforts to train models of this scope.
    On the other hand, an IoT system that integrates and illustrates the practical
    use of this learning model has been presented. Furthermore, this system has been
    designed bearing in mind key aspects such as interoperability, scalability or
    energy awareness, thus simplifying its integration with other systems and making
    sustainable use of energy. Finally, it has been shown that the findings found
    in more theoretical works (use of artificial data) concerning the identification
    of sensor faults are applicable to real-world approaches. Download : Download

    • Test the performance of the ML models presented in this article for the detection
    of leaf-turgor pressure sensor faults in a Japanese plum-tree farm, on sensors
    deployed in other crops, such as almond, mandarin or orange trees. • If the same
    performance is not achieved in other crops, generate crop-specific models from
    the leaf-turgor pressure sensor data of each crop and its faults, in order to
    optimise the faults detection task. • Test the performance of the ML models presented
    in this article with sensor data from different years. Since the models have only
    been trained with data from one year’s fruit ripening cycle. • Integrate the IoT
    system for fault detection of leaf-turgor pressure sensors with other IoT systems.
    For instance, smart irrigation IoT systems in CICYTEX’s Japanese plum tree farms.
    • Automate the normalisation of data taking into account range shifts. This is
    a time and effort-consuming manual task, as charts of the measured magnitude (e.g.
    leaf-turgor pressure as shown in Fig. 10) have to be displayed and analysed to
    identify the time instants at which range shift occurs. Automating this task would
    speed up the development times of many similar works, as well as reduce the possibility
    of errors, optimising an essential phase of the methodology proposed in Section

  description: Electrical submersible pumps (ESP) are the classification of hydraulic
    pump that is applicable to transport fluids from submersible elevations toward
    a fixed pipeline. Submersible pumps are commonly put to use in several areas such
    as domestic utilization, city water supply, irrigation system, and extensive industrial
    applications. Therefore, it is estimated that a significant portion of total electrical
    grid energy is consumed to run the electrical submersible pump. Hence, in the
    case of a faulty electrical submersible pump, the consumption of total grid energy
    increases. For the economic growth of any country, it is very important to understand
    the different failure mechanism, which arises in the electrical submersible pump,
    and also it is necessary to find out the root causes of these ESP failures along
    with proper mitigation methods to avoid these kinds of failures. Although electrical
    submersible pumps are being used for many years ago, it is still suffering from
    many failures, and these failures can be summarized into three major kinds of
    failures, i.e., electrical failures, mechanical failures, and operational failures.
    This review paper deals with a comprehensive study based on ESP failure mechanisms
    and a proper analysis of these failures for the determination of optimum conditions.
    It is found that among these failures, electrical failure is a very severe form,
    and suitable equipment and material can reduce this. Mechanical failure is mainly
    dependent on the material of the equipment; hence, the equipment should be corrosion
    resistant and compatible to avoid these kinds of failures. Operational failure
    is mainly dependent on the nature of the processing fluid. The processing fluid
    can be a single phase (only liquid), two phases (liquid and solid), and multiphase
    (liquid, solid, and gas). Failures due to multiphase fluid are more significant
    than that of others.

    sucker rod pumps’ components, diagnostics, mathematical models, and common failures
    and mitigations Article Open access 27 August 2021 1 Introduction Among all the
    artificial water and oil lift methods, Electrical Submersible Pumps (ESPs) are
    mostly preferred due to their high volume flow rate, higher temperature environments,
    and deeper depth working conditions [1,2,3,4,5,6]. It is estimated that almost
    30–40% of the electrical grid energy of India is consumed by the pumping system
    [7]. As we know that the submersible pump is made of three major sections: motor
    section, the pump section, and the seal section, the motor section consists of
    a stator, rotor, copper windings, etc. and the pump section consists of the diffuser,
    impeller, etc. As the electrical submersible pumps are being operated under the
    influence of various downhole conditions such as multiphase flow, in higher temperatures.
    Therefore, the reliability and life of the submersible are highly dependent on
    the nature of the fluid flow and downhole working conditions [8]. So, a proper
    ESP design requires both factors such as economic and technical factors [9, 10].
    Majority of the electrical or mechanical machines consist of many sub-components;
    thus, the failure of a single part of the components results in the failure of
    the whole machine. Therefore, an electrical submersible pump may also fail due
    to the failure of single components. And the failure of one component may also
    fail other sub-components [11]. Hence, there should be a need for instant diagnosis
    of the ESP string in case of any component failure. In recent years motor current
    signature analysis has been a very effective tool for condition monitoring to
    detect the various failures of submersible pumps such as stator and dynamic eccentric
    air gap of the broken rotor [12, 13], stator windings [14, 15], unbalance [16],
    rotor broken bar [11, 17,18,19,20], and rotor bearing [21]. All the failures related
    to ESP can be grouped into three major categories as electrical, mechanical, and
    operational failures. Further, these failures have been discussed in a detailed
    manner. After literature survey of different failure analysis, the following research
    gaps are observed. Although the oil and refineries industries use latest technology
    based condition monitoring system for the failure prediction and improving the
    reliability of ESPs, but still in India, for commercial purposes such as city
    water supply and irrigation system, there is lack of proper condition monitoring
    and failure analysis of ESP. 2 Electrical Failures It can be observed that the
    electrical submersible pumps are generally failed due to the failure of electrical
    components. These electrical failures can be also assumed that it is the most
    severe because any particular electrical component failure leads to the whole
    assembly failure. These failures consist of motor failure, overloading, cable
    failure, and connection severance [22]. 2.1 Cable Failure In paper [23], torque
    and drag analysis has been done for the simulation of forces in running condition
    of the ESP to minimize the cable failure. It was observed that more failures are
    found in wells associated with 7″ casings than that of wells with 9–5/8″ casings.
    It happens due to increase in drag force with less clearance in smaller casing.
    Other causes of ESPs cable failure are given below Run in hole speed it should
    be increased to reduce the rig time, production tubing for single joint and double
    joint. Mixed cable armor due to different malleability of the cable armors some
    cable tear down. Accessories after review of various ESP interventions, it was
    observed that mid-joint cable protectors (Fig. 1) were not sufficient for the
    cable diameter resulting tight spot. Fig. 1 Cable squeezed by mid-joint cable
    protector with inadequate dimension [23] Full size image Grasp pressure in bands
    in Fig. 2, the cable failure was caused by a cut in armor with the bands due to
    over tightening the bands around the cables and casings. Fig. 2 Failure by overtightening
    the band over cable [23] Full size image To avoid this failure the following steps
    should be considered There should be proper selection for insulating material.
    The material should be compatible to downhole condition, and safety factor should
    be sufficient to sustain the sudden surge of power requirement. Installation of
    cable protectors in the equipments and correction of spooler location for ESP
    install. Changing the pressure for band pressure machine. Torque and drag analysis
    software determines the stress through the string it to the well. 2.2 Motor Failures
    The motor consists of two main components, the stator and the rotor. Coil degradation
    and overloading are the main causes of stator failure [24]. The degradation of
    materials in the motor assembly can also result in motor failure due to overheating.
    Many motor assemblies are not designed to handle extremely high temperatures.
    The paper [25] deals with the study of risk assessment for losses in production
    of oil due to motor failure. Fuzzy set theory is used for the assessment algorithm
    of risk dynamics. The two main causes of stator coil degradation are misalignment
    and motor compromise. An improper stator design can result in a loss of magnetic
    flux due to misalignment; this is not as common in induction motors, but it can
    be problematic in permanent magnet motors [26]. The motor will be compromised
    if the wellbore fluids enter the motor. Wellbore fluids can then contaminate the
    motor oil, resulting in complete motor failure, especially if the problem is not
    detected early on. Detection of motor problems relies on the continuous analysis
    of motor performance with time. A decline in motor performance is a strong indication
    that the motor is failing. Using a downhole sensor, it is possible to track motor
    performance in real time. However, the main issue with this method is that the
    only way to be certain the motor is functioning is to retrieve the string, and
    this can be quite costly, especially for assemblies conveyed by tubing. Prevention
    of motor failure relies on proper motor design, especially in permanent magnet
    motors, and motor-seal testing on the surface before lowering it into the hole.
    The seal must be strong enough to endure the downhole conditions to avoid failure
    which will result in the motor oil contamination. Mitigation of motor problems
    involves retrieving the motor to assess the extent of the damage and remedy the
    problem. 2.3 Connection Severance It generally occurs due to a loss of communication
    from the downhole assembly, and this loss of communication happens due to the
    failure of electric cables or sensors. When the electric cable fails, all the
    operations will be closed. In case of sensor failure, false information will be
    going to the surfaces and this can result in catastrophic failure [27]. Sensor
    failure can be detected very easily because it ceases to inform on the surface
    in case of any failure. But in case of sensor malfunction failure, it is very
    difficult to detect. This detection can be done by two methods; first one is that
    multiple downhole sensors should be included to compare the readings. The second
    method involves tracing VSD to determine to serve change in frequency that indicates
    the downhole problem. Prevention is done by the suitable design of the sensor
    in such a manner, so that it will be able to withstand downhole conditions. Therefore,
    it is better to use more than one sensor to avoid operational disruption. 2.4
    Overloading The basic function of variable speed drives is to operate the electrical
    submersible pump. It varies the frequency as per the requirement of power in the
    downhole. In case of gas saturation increment, the requirement of the power will
    be in excess. Therefore, the motor will have to generate more power to lift the
    fluid. In the case of the gas lock, wrong information may be received by the VSD,
    i.e., lifting capacity of the ESP is not enough although flowing of no fluids
    in the string [28, 29]. Therefore, it will create an extreme surge of load in
    the motor, i.e., overloading, and this may result in motor failure. The detection
    of motor overloading can be done through the following observations For the detection
    of abnormalities, regular monitoring of the performance of the motor should be
    done. When the abnormalities are found out, then overloading is assured at the
    intake. The second observation is done for the concentration of gas, and this
    will use for the indication of gas lock. In the third case, we observed a decrement
    in the volume of the produced fluid. To prevent gas lock, a gas separator should
    be placed at the downhole. An alternate method to prevent overloading is the application
    of a limit for the variable speed driver frequency according to motor capacity.
    Therefore, in case of overloading, the system must be closed for cooling down
    the motor. 3 Mechanical Failures In most cases, ESP mechanical failures are caused
    by moving components in the assembly, but in some cases, they may also be caused
    by stationary components. Bearing and threads can be considered stationary components
    [30]. A mechanical failure can be difficult to repair and normally requires the
    replacement of a component. Several faults can occur in electrical submersible
    pumps such that damaged impeller, eccentric impeller, mounting fault, misalignment,
    bearing damage, damaged external seals, warn sealing rings, eroded casting, bearing
    wear, unbalance, component breakages, dislocation, corrosion, and leakage. Hence
    these will affect the performance of the pump. 3.1 Component Breakage Any downhole
    component in the ESP assembly can fail. In downhole conditions, materials can
    be broken by the effects of wear and tear, improper material design, and sudden
    pressure increment due to gas pockets or the introduction of new phases. The most
    severe failures caused by component breakage are ESP and motor failures caused
    by broken impellers and rotors, respectively. The partial loss of downhole components
    may also occur as a result of component breakage [30,31,32,33]. Multiple methods
    can detect the downhole components breakages as per types of components failure.
    In case of impeller breakage, the lift capacity will be reduced, and due to motor
    failure, the operation will be going to cease. Along with these methods, leakage
    detection or overall pressure loss can also be used to detect breakages of other
    downhole components without retrieval of the string. To prevent the breakages
    of the components, proper material selection and design are very much important.
    Along with this also, a proper rigorous surface testing for the material must
    be done according to the time duration for the parts of the downhole. 3.2 Corrosion
    Any metallic component of the downhole assembly can be affected by corrosion.
    Generally pitting and anodic-catholic corrosion are the most important type of
    corrosion which can affect the downhole assembly. Pitting is surface erosion due
    to sand or another solid particle. Small surface erosion is expanded till the
    severe metallic component failure. And the other, i.e., anodic–cathodic corrosion,
    is generally found when two metallic components are separated by electrolyte,
    which creates a significant potential difference. In case of a potential difference
    equal to 0.1 V or greater than 0.1 V, anodic–cathodic corrosion can take place.
    Here, the anode metal will corrode and the cathode metal will not corrode [34,
    35]. Three methods can be used to detect corrosion. In the first method, a proper
    analysis of the fluid should be done, and if the corrosion byproduct is found,
    then we can assume that corrosion is taking place. Also, a high percentage of
    total dissolved salt, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen sulfide are the main components,
    which can enhance corrosion failure and can be detected by the downhole sensors.
    The second method consists of corrosion failure which can be assured if the failures
    of the downhole components are not the case of electrical failure. In the third
    method if loss of pressure is found in producing tube, then it may be also an
    indication of corrosion failure. The corrosion failure can be prevented in two
    steps. First of all, there should be a proper knowledge of the downhole condition
    and also proper knowledge of fluid properties. This information is very much helpful
    in assuring the occurrence of corrosion. Another step is the proper selection
    of material that could able to resist corrosion failure. The material should be
    compatible with fluids and also should be anodic–cathodic and pitting corrosion
    resistant. There are three ways to detect corrosion failure. Observing corrosion
    byproducts can help determine whether corrosion is occurring in the fluid. Downhole
    sensors can also detect components that enhance corrosion, including sugars, carboxylic
    acids, sulfides, and high levels of dissolved salts (TDS). Corrosion can also
    be determined by detecting a failure in one of the downhole components. A corrosion
    problem could be the main reason for a downhole component failing without any
    indications of electrical failures. Furthermore, loss of pressure in one or more
    production tubings could be a sign that corrosion has caused leaks through the
    production tubing. One can prevent corrosion failure in two steps. To determine
    the risk of corrosion, the first step is to understand the downhole conditions
    and fluid properties. Second, the proper selection of material is crucial to preventing
    corrosion down the hole. To prevent anodic–cathodic and pitting corrosion, compatible
    metals and materials must be chosen as well as those that are resistant to erosion
    (Fig. 3). Fig. 3 Metallic thread failure and electric cable and insulation degradation
    corrosion [35] Full size image 3.3 Dislocation Failure Dislocation failure can
    be found in moving components of the submersible pump. This failure generally
    found very less in ESPs because most of the parts are fixed very well in the string.
    Dislocation failures can occur due to various reasons such as wear of fixed components
    and breakage of downhole components. Initially, the dislocation failures can impact
    the affected components and after that multiple components failures can be observed
    [34]. The detection method of dislocation is very common to the corrosion, which
    can be done by finding the pressure losses or abnormal downhole conditions. However,
    in case of giving false information of other failure, such as corrosion or leakage,
    then the only way in order to detect these failures is to recover the entire ESP.
    In order to prevent the dislocation failure, the components should be protected
    properly from erosion and corrosion; hence, suitable insulation is required. 3.4
    Leakage This failure can occur in the parts of ESP assembly that which sustain
    fluids. Fluid may also escape from string, or enter into a sealed component of
    the string, causing this failure. Liquid leakage from the ESP string usually involves
    expelling the fluid produced into the tubing or wellbore outside of the string.
    Generally, in case of breakage of component failure or failure of protector, leakage
    occurs. Loss of pressure will be observed in case of leakage failure, and this
    results requirement of more power by the motor [35, 36]. The detection of leakage
    failure is not very difficult. Here, the downhole sensors are attached with suitable
    detection components. Thus, these sensors will be able to detect the pressure
    losses due to leakage. The prevention of leakages can be done with the help of
    proper operating conditions and proper selection of material to remove the rapid
    degradation of the material. 4 Operating Failures Operating failures may refer
    to any particular failure that is not classified as electrical or mechanical originally.
    Therefore, operational failures can occur due to errors or operating conditions,
    and after some time, these failures may result in electrical or mechanical failures.
    Generally, these types of failures may contain pressure, temperature, pipe blockage,
    scale/solid deposition, and multiphase flow. 4.1 Multiphase Flow When the liquid
    contains more than two phases, then it is considered a multiphase flow, e.g.,
    combination of water, dust, or sand particle and an air pocket. And when the fluids
    contain only two phases such as water and sand or dust particles, then it is considered
    a two-phase flow. According to an experimental analysis done by Abhay Patil, Adalfo
    Dalgado et al., it is found that failure is more significant in multiphase flow
    than in two-phase flow. Due to these multiphase flows, various failures can occur
    in submersible pumps such as impeller flow path wear, diffuser wear, seal wear,
    and bushing wear. Now, these failures are discussed one by one. Diffuser wear
    The diffuser wear is highly dependent on the impeller wear. In Fig. 4, the diffuser
    wear is shown at different GVF (gas volume fraction) value. The suction side of
    the vanes experienced less wear, while the pressure side of the vanes experienced
    more wear due to direct impingement of the particles. However, the leading edge
    of the diffuser vanes for water only tests (i.e., at 0% GVF) experienced significantly
    different wear pattern than the 20% GVF test. Also the 0% GVF test shows uniform
    wear near the leading edges while nonuniform wear is obtained in 20% GVF test.
    Fig. 4 Untested (top), water–sand tested (middle) at 0% GVF, and water–air–sand
    tested (bottom) at 20% GVF. Inlet views are displayed on left, and a close-up
    inlet view of two diffuser vanes are displayed on right [28] Full size image Impeller
    flow path wear There are many factors such as operating condition, pump geometry,
    and fluid properties which may contribute to the impeller wear mechanism. In Fig.
    5, a wear pattern shows across rear member of impeller vanes at 20% GVF. The left
    image is the suction side of an outer vane member after being tested and the pressure
    side shown in the right image. Original cast appearance indicates minimum wear
    across suction side. The pressure side shows significant wear. Fig. 5 Left one
    is suction side and right one is pressure side in water–air–sand tested impeller
    split blade outer member [28] Full size image Seal wear At the front seal stage
    surfaces, the wear rate is more significant than the seal surfaces of back side
    due to reduction in pressure and increment in sand concentration. And also, the
    wear rate at a stage seal surfaces reduces with increase in GVF value because
    of pressure drop. In case of pressure drop, due to increment in GVF value, there
    will be decrement in the wear rate of stage seal surface. From Figs. 6 and 7,
    it is clear that the first stage impeller seal have insignificant wear with respect
    to the second stage seal for 20% GVF testing. At 0% GVF testing, largest wear
    was noticed in stage tested because of higher pressure drop and which causes higher
    shear and higher sand concentration. Therefore, at 0% GVF, the root cause of pump
    degradation is the wear across secondary flow paths. Fig. 6 Erosion on wear rings
    at both sides of first impeller for 0% GVF test [37] Full size image Fig. 7 Erosion
    on wear rings at both sides of first impeller in 20% GVF test [37] Full size image
    Bushing failure The bearings erosion becomes severe along the shaft from the upper
    portion to the down portion. Due to the presence of gas, the bearing wear rate
    increases. In Fig. 8, the microscopic images of the failure of the bearing are
    shown after 66 h at 0 and 20% GVFs values. The major difference between these
    two is the array for stress cracks which is ordered very well, covering the total
    surface area in case of 20% GVF, while bearings with 0% GVF testing do not experience
    such type of wear [38, 39]. Therefore, these cracks occur due to the stress of
    thermal expansion by the rubbing of bearing surfaces. For tungsten carbide, due
    to the low thermal conductivity, there will be an expansion of outer surfaces
    while the inner regions do not expand due to remaining cool and hence it will
    be fractured [27]. Fig. 8 Microscopic observation of bearings at 20 and 0% GVF
    values [38] Full size image 4.2 Temperature It is one of the main reasons for
    downhole equipment failures. The high temperature can cause failure in such type
    of ESP parts (cable and downhole sensors) which is unable to bear condition of
    higher temperature. The high temperature may also initiate other kinds of failures
    such as corrosion. Along with this, high temperature causes material expansion
    which develops the internal force [39]. To detect this, sensor should be designed
    to withstand extreme temperatures. Therefore, the sensors are made of heat-resistant
    materials such as fiber optics, which can withstand temperatures up to 220 centigrade
    [27]. The temperature gradient for an extremely deep well must be known to find
    out the temperature distribution. As we know that the temperature cannot be controlled,
    so the prevention of failure will become an imperative step. Temperature can impact
    different components differently, so the accommodation for temperature effect
    is very much important to the design of all the components. Proper insulation
    made of heat-resistant material should be utilized for the extreme temperature
    wells for electrical components, and in case mechanical components, the material
    selection should be heat as well as temperature resistant. 4.3 Pressure All the
    ESP assembly of the downhole must be designed to handle very high pressure because
    ESPs are generally used in high-rated wells. These types of problems generally
    occur due to sudden loss or a sudden surge in pressure. A sudden surge in pressure
    may generate due to a gas pocket or fluid influx, and a decrement in pressure
    may be resulted due to leakage in the ESP assembly [40]. So due to this, abnormal
    flow occurs in both cases. Therefore, the downhole equipment degrades if the adoptive
    nature for the changes is not enough [41]. The downhole sensors are very much
    useful for the detection of the loss in pressure or pressure gain. When pressure
    abnormalities are detected, then the causes for the problems should be identified
    for accurate mitigation. To prevent this failure, there should be the integration
    of downhole conditions which handle the flow of gases to anticipate pressure increment.
    In case of pressure losses, to avoid leakage from down\\hole components, a suitable
    material should be used. 4.4 Scale/Solid Deposition In this case, most of the
    solids may be categorized as organic and inorganic deposits. Organic deposits
    consist of crude oil solid particles such as wax and asphaltene. Due to the sticking
    of these solid deposits on the ESP surface, equipment becomes failed and overloaded,
    and due to inorganic deposits such as sand and salt components, equipment gets
    eroded with time [34]. Figure 9 shows ESPs components erosion and breakages due
    to inorganic solids such as sand salt components of the processing fluid, and
    in Fig. 10, it is shown that deposition of wax or asphaltene solids on the surface
    ESPs equipment results in failure. To detect this type of failure, a proper analysis
    of the produced fluid should be done. There should be compositional analysis for
    the crude oil to detect the composition of asphaltene and composition of wax concentration,
    and also a proper analysis for the formation of water should be done for the determination
    of salts that forms scale. It is the nature of the asphaltene to absorb the outer
    surface of the equipment, and it deposits very easily on the perforations and
    the wellbore. If it is not handled immediately, then this can cause operational
    failures. Fig. 9 Metal pipe crack due to solids [42] Full size image Fig. 10 Asphaltene
    solid deposit on the surface of ESP [43] Full size image There should have a good
    understanding of downhole fluid properties and production zone formation. Therefore,
    it will allow generating the safe operating condition for the prevention of buildups,
    e.g., asphaltenes precipitate from crude oil under specific conditions. If asphaltene
    will present in the crude oil, then operational conditions can be altered to avoid
    asphaltene precipitation and buildup. A gravel pack or sand filter can avoid solids’
    erosion problems. 4.5 Pipe Blockages If pumping liquid contains many types of
    impurity in solid form. Hence, the presence of these impurities causes pipe blockage
    problems. This pipe blockage may develop flow instability in the pump. Therefore,
    due to this blockage, the pump efficiency will be affected, and also the pipe
    blockage may be the reason for the early failure of ESP parts which will affect
    the cost of the operation [44]. Therefore, to avoid this, proper health monitoring
    of the pump will be needed to increase the life of the components and reduce the
    operation cost. With the use of combinations of different types of sensors such
    as accelerometer, pressure sensor, and current meter, identification of the blockage
    level can be done better accuracy, and to reduce these problems, a proper filter
    mechanism should be used. 4.6 Dry Running It generally occurs because of falling
    in water level. Hence, a decent amount of water is not drawn from the pump [45,
    46]. With the help of a liquid sensor that indicates the presence of flowing fluid.
    Another method to detect dry running is to measure the temperature for any critical
    component such as plain bearing with the help of a temperature sensor. A submersible
    pump can be prevented from dry running using a switch unit which is a built-in
    part of the submersible pump. 5 Results and Discussion After implementation of
    torque and drag analysis [23], the cable failure reduced up to 50% and failure
    index had been reduced with time as shown in Fig. 11. Basically, failure index
    is some of total failure divided by average active wells. Hence, considerable
    amount of cost is saved by this process. Fig. 11 Variation of failure index with
    passes of time [23] Full size image The surface of fuzzy inference permits to
    establish the output variable dependency “failure risk caused by overvoltages.”
    Hence, this depending nature helps to program the controller of fuzzy control
    algorithms. 501 ESPs are analyzed in Kuwait Saudi Arabia, and it was observed
    that 40% of the ESP failures are caused by motor failure. After motor failure,
    the most common failure is cable failure which is 26%. Corrosion and leakage failures
    are the most common mechanical failure found in an ESP. From the operating failure
    analysis, such as failures due to multiphase (sand, water, and air) are more significant
    than that of two-phase (sand and water) flow. Inlet erosion of diffuser is affected
    by erosion at outer part of the impeller blade at 20% GVF value. At 0% GVF value,
    low erosion at outer blade of impeller causes wall perforation at diffuser inlet
    (Figs. 12 and 13). Fig. 12 Risk assessment for motor failure caused by overvoltage

  description: The presence of seasonal surface deformation in areas that are subsiding/uplifting
    due to groundwater pumping/recovery can indicate aquifer recharge. Understanding
    seasonal surface deformation and the existing relationship between triggering
    factors and the deformation supports effective groundwater management and subsidence
    mitigation. Here, we investigated seasonal ground displacement in response to
    the aquifer compaction and expansion due to groundwater extraction and recharge
    within the Taiyuan basin, Northern China. We obtained Sentinel-1 InSAR displacement
    time series data from 2017 to 2020 and quantitatively analyzed relationships between
    triggering factors (e.g., groundwater level and precipitation) and the associated
    displacements using wavelet-based methods. The results show that the seasonal
    deformation is concentrated in the irrigated areas within the central basin, with
    a 1-year periodicity. The annual peak-to-peak amplitude was up to 2 cm, peaking
    in March with troughs in August. This seasonality present in the displacement
    time series is found to be ‘in-phase’ with respect to groundwater levels and ‘anti-phase’
    in relation to natural precipitation. These results are consistent with the irrigation
    pumping practices in the basin, with increased groundwater withdrawals to meet
    irrigation water demand prior to the monsoon precipitation season, resulting in
    water level decline and land subsidence from mid-March to mid-August. During the
    non-irrigated season, groundwater extraction decreases, and the aquifer systems
    are replenished by precipitation, causing water levels to recover and the ground
    to uplift from late August to mid-March. A geological analysis indicates that
    the seasonal deformation is controlled by the thickness of Quaternary strata and
    fault systems, which play a critical role in forming the earth fissures in the
    basin. The elastic and inelastic deformation was separated; the estimated elastic/inelastic
    ratio was about 0.6–0.7, indicating that the inelastic component dominates the
    main aquifer compaction in the central basin. Our analysis is of hydrologic importance
    which could be used to guide groundwater management and subsidence mitigation,
    given the inter-basin water diversion projects in this arid basin.

    1. Introduction Ground surface displacement can occur because of groundwater extraction
    and recharge in regions with active aquifer systems. Surface displacement is a
    response to the variation in pore-fluid pressure due to the change in groundwater
    level, which alters the effective stress of the granular matrix in the aquifer
    system, leading to contraction and expansion of pore space (Galloway and Burbey,
    2011, Motagh et al., 2017, Chaussard et al., 2017). When groundwater is pumped
    out of the aquifer, the pore-fluid pressures decrease and the effective stresses
    on the soil mass increase causing aquifer compaction and subsequent land subsidence.
    When water is recharged naturally or artificially into the aquifer and the groundwater
    level rises, the pore-fluid pressures regain and the effective stresses on the
    soils are reduced causing land uplift (Budhu and Adiyaman, 2010). In general,
    ground surface displacement due to fluid extraction from a subsurface reservoir
    can be described as a short-term, elastic or poroelastic rebound and a long-term,
    inelastic compaction (Galloway and Burbey, 2011, Guzy and Malinowska, 2020). Thus,
    this groundwater-induced displacement might exhibit signs of periodicity related
    to the seasonal and inter-annual cycles of groundwater withdrawal and recharge.
    Space-borne Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) can detect seasonal
    ground deformation associated with the seasonal changes of groundwater level (Lanari
    et al., 2004, Reeves et al., 2011). The high-spatial-resolution measurements from
    InSAR revealed a detailed spatial variability of seasonality in surface deformation,
    which was used to define the trace of fault location and to characterize aquifer
    properties (Chaussard et al., 2016). The InSAR seasonal ground deformation maps
    over irrigated areas could reflect the seasonal groundwater pumping activities
    for irrigation purpose and support groundwater management to maintain sustainable
    pumping practices (Tang et al., 2022). The Taiyuan basin is a semi-arid basin
    located in the north of China which has been heavily relying on groundwater resources
    for decades and suffering severe land subsidence. Both ground-based geodetic techniques
    (e.g., leveling spirit, extensometer, and GPS) and space-borne InSAR have been
    used to document ground deformation in the Taiyuan basin (Ma et al., 2006, Zhu
    et al., 2013, Liu et al., 2018, Tang et al., 2018). These previous studies have
    concluded that groundwater overexploitation is the main triggering factor of land
    subsidence in the basin. To mitigate land subsidence, groundwater exploitation
    in the Taiyuan basin was strictly controlled, and inter-basin water diversion
    projects were carried out to divert surface water from the Yellow River to this
    arid area. The groundwater levels in some parts of the Taiyuan basin have risen,
    stabilizing land subsidence in the basin and even turning land subsidence to land
    uplift in some places (Tang et al., 2022). The municipal governments also implemented
    a seasonal land fallowing program in the water-intensive irrigated areas, which
    could largely reduce the irrigation groundwater demand. The seasonal land fallowing
    practices have a seasonal pumping on groundwater and cause a seasonal variation
    in water levels due to the extraction and recharge in the aquifer system. How
    the ground surface responses to the seasonal water level changes in the Taiyuan
    basin has not yet been investigated. In addition, although groundwater overdraft
    is the triggering factor for ground subsidence in the basin, the causal relationships
    between factors have not been quantitatively analyzed. Identifying these periodicities
    in deformation time-series and quantifying the existing relationships between
    triggers and measured deformation is a great challenge. Fourier-transformed methods
    allows the identification of the dominant frequencies in the data sequence. These
    approaches, however, does not recognize localized temporal information and time-varying
    frequencies (Grinsted et al., 2004). Nevertheless, continuous wavelet transform
    (CWT) expands data sequences into the time–frequency domain, which enables the
    identification of localized intermittent periodicities. Furthermore, the cross
    wavelet transform (XWT) and the wavelet coherence (WTC) analysis allow for the
    identification of common power between two data sequences and quantifying their
    delayed relationships. These wavelet-based methods permit the exploration of periodicity
    in ground deformation and identification of time delays between triggering factors
    and the associated deformations. In this paper, we extend the previous studies
    of the Taiyuan basin (Tang et al., 2018) and (Tang et al., 2022) by using higher
    temporal resolution of SAR data from Sentinel-1 satellite to resolve and analyze
    the spatial pattern and temporal evolution of seasonal deformation. We applied
    the coherence-based Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) technique (Berardino et al.,
    2002, Tong and Schmidt, 2016) to Sentinel-1 SAR dataset acquired between 2017
    and 2020 to derive the time-dependent displacements in the basin. Wavelet-based
    methods, including CWT, XWT and WTC, were used to identify seasonal variations
    in InSAR-derived displacement time-series and quantify the causal relationships
    between triggering factors (e.g., groundwater level and precipitation) and the
    surface displacement. The relationship between the seasonal variations of deformation
    and geological conditions in this basin was analyzed, and the distribution of
    earth fissures related to the seasonal deformation was considered, and the elastic/inelastic
    nature of the displacement was investigated. 2. Geological background of the study
    area The Taiyuan basin is a large-scale Cenozoic rift basin located in the central
    part of Shanxi Province, northern China (Fig. 1). Tectonically, the flat basin
    is bordered by Taihang Mountain in the east, and Lvliang Mountain in the west.
    It is a NE-SW trending faulted basin with a length of 150 km from northeast to
    southwest, a width of 30–40 km from northwest to southeast, and a coverage area
    of ∼ 6000 km2. The altitude of the basin ranges from ∼ 750 to ∼ 900 m a.s.l, and
    is surrounded by hills and mountains with altitudes ranging from ∼ 1000 to ∼ 3000
    m a.s.l. The geomorphology of the basin is controlled by active tectonics that
    the northwestern is bounded by Jiaocheng Fault and the southeastern basin is bounded
    by Taigu Fault. The shape, historical development, and hydro-geological conditions
    of the basin are controlled by these two boundary faults (Yan et al., 2020). Download

    groundwater monitoring system (Frank et al., 2016), respectively. (For interpretation
    of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
    web version of this article.) Geologically, the Cenozoic strata in the basin are
    thick, with thicknesses of about 1000–2000 m (Fig. 2a). The exposed and deeply
    buried strata around the basin are mainly Paleozoic, Ordovician, Carboniferous,
    Permian, and Triassic clastic rocks (Guo et al., 2007). The strata at the bottom
    of the basin are predominantly Permian and Triassic sand shale and covered by
    Tertiary and Quaternary loose rock groups. The Quaternary strata are deeply buried,
    the depth from the northwest (500 m) to the southeast (100–200 m) gradually becomes
    shallower (see black contours in Fig. 1b). The stratum on both sides of the concealed
    fault is obviously destroyed that the hanging wall descends, and the degree of
    separation in the shallow layer is small, while the degree of separation in deep
    layers is large, as shown in the geological section (I − I′) across the basin
    (Fig. 2b). This indicates that the concealed faults are synsedimentary faults
    or growth faults (Peng et al., 2018, Sun et al., 2016). Download : Download high-res

    et al., 2018). In terms of hydrogeology, groundwater in the basin is recharged
    laterally by the penetration of karst water from the surrounding mountains and
    vertically from the seepage of meteoric water. An unconfined aquifer is in the
    shallow part of the basin at a buried depth of generally less than 50 m. The thickness
    of the unconfined aquifer varies from 10 to 30 m and the medium composed of alluvial-diluvial
    sand and gravel from Late Pleistocene and Holocene. The confined aquifer is in
    the middle and deep part of the basin with a buried depth of generally large than
    50 m. The medium in the confined aquifer is mainly composed of alluvial and lacustrine
    sandy pebble from middle Pleistocene and lacustrine sediments from early Pleistocene
    (Peng et al., 2018, Yan et al., 2020). There exists an aquitard with a thickness
    of 5–30 m between the unconfined and confined aquifers, making a significant difference
    in the water level dynamics and water quality between the phreatic aquifer and
    the confined aquifers. The climate condition in the basin is arid with an annual
    average rainfall around 400–650 mm. The interannual variation of rainfall displays
    a seasonal cycle, mainly occurring between June and September. The surface water
    in the basin is mostly related to the Fenhe River, flowing through the whole basin
    from north to south (the blue line in Fig. 1b), which is the second-largest tributary
    of the Yellow River. Taiyuan basin and even the whole Shanxi province are extremely
    short of water resources. The water resources per capita is less than 400 m3,
    which is only 17% of the level of national per capita and far below the international
    standard for acute water scarcity (500 m3 per capita). As a result, the structure
    of water consumption is very uneven as 2/3 of the water consumption depends on
    groundwater, which has caused declines in water levels accompanied by land subsidence
    and ground fissures in the basin (Zang et al., 2021). At present, zones of land
    subsidence in the basin can be divided into four regions: the subsidence area
    of Taiyuan city in the north of the basin, the subsidence area of Taigu-Qixian-Pingyao-Wenshui-Jiaocheng
    counties in the central basin, the subsidence area of Qingxu-Jiaocheng-Wenshui
    counties in the west and the subsidence area of Jiexiu-Xiaoyi cities in the south
    (Chen, 2019, Zhao and Lu, 2017). Land subsidence was first observed in the urban
    area of Taiyuan city in 1956, with rates up to 110 mm/yr in 1980 s (Ma et al.,
    2005), and has been gradually migrating to suburban areas in Xiaodian and Jinyuan
    districts in the south of the Taiyuan city. 3. Data and methods 3.1. InSAR data
    and processing To obtain the spatial and temporal deformation in Taiyuan basin,
    we processed 94 SAR images from Sentinel-1 mission spanning the period from March
    2017 to April 2020. These data are regularly acquired with a temporal interval
    of 12 days, which is sufficient to resolve seasonal annual and semi-annual signals
    present in the deformation time-series. The footprint of the processing area covering
    Taiyuan basin from Sentinel-1 image is shown in Fig. 1b. SAR images acquired in
    C band are strongly decorrelated by agricultural activity or by vegetated surfaces
    within the basin. The short revisit time of Sentinel-1 SAR acquisitions can mitigate
    this effect. We used the open-source GMTSAR software (Sandwell et al., 2011, Xu
    et al., 2017) to generate 288 interferograms (Fig. 3), with a threshold of perpendicular
    baseline of 100 m and a threshold of temporal baseline of 50 days. Topographic
    phase contribution in each interferogram were subtracted using a Digital Elevation
    Model (DEM) with a resolution of ∼ 30 m from SRTM (Farr et al., 2007). To reduce
    speckle noise, the interferograms were down-sampled 8 pixels in range and 2 pixels
    in azimuth and filtered by a Gaussian filter with a 0.5 gain at a wavelength of
    200 m in azimuth and ground range. Two-dimensional phase unwrapping to recover
    unambiguous phase data were implemented by the Statistical-cost, Network-flow
    Algorithm for Phase Unwrapping (SNAPHU) (Chen and Zebker, 2001). We used a threshold
    of 0.12 from coherence map to mask out noisy pixels, such as over water bodies
    or densely vegetated regions, while unwrapping the interferograms. The long-wavelength
    phase ramps due to imprecise orbital information were removed by fitting a two-dimensional
    linear plane for each interferogram. Download : Download high-res image (482KB)

    the Sentinel-1 SAR data. The dots represent acquisition dates, and the gray lines
    represent the acquisition pairs used to generate interferograms. The line-of-sight
    (LOS) displacement time-series were extracted from the unwrapped interferograms
    by a coherence-based SBAS method (Tong and Schmidt, 2016). This method differs
    from the traditional SBAS (Berardino et al., 2002) in that it solves for the displacement
    time-series at every pixel by taking coherence as weights in the least square
    inversion. The pixels with low coherence are kept in the processing chain and
    will be down weighted in the analysis, making the noise in the input data less
    sensitive to matrix inversion and resulting in a spatially coherent signal with
    dense pixels. The topography-related component of tropospheric delays usually
    exhibits systematic seasonal variations and may obscure the seasonal displacement
    signals (Dong et al., 2019, Tang et al., 2018). The conventional InSAR time series
    methods handle the mitigation of tropospheric delay with a spatial–temporal filtering
    by treating the delay simply as a random behavior in time. We addressed the issue
    of seasonal tropospheric delay by combing GACOS (Generic Atmospheric Correction
    Online Service) (Yu et al., 2018) and a common-point stacking method (Tymofyeyeva
    and Fialko, 2015). This method corrects the long-wavelength and topography-related
    components of tropospheric delay for each interferogram by using GACOS, thus transforming
    the residual delays into a more randomly distributed behavior over time. This
    helps satisfy the assumptions that atmospheric effects are temporally uncorrelated
    in InSAR time series analysis (Tang et al., 2022), which were further reduced
    by the common-point stacking method. The displacement velocity was finally obtained
    from the linear regression of the solved displacement time-series. 3.2. CGPS,
    groundwater level and precipitation data The surveying and mapping department
    in Shanxi Province has constructed a CGPS network across the administrative region
    in the province since 2009, which is consisted of 67 stations (Zeng et al., 2012).
    This CGPS network is multipurpose, such as for maintaining geodetic reference
    frame, monitoring crustal deformation and climate research. Measurements from
    eight CGPS stations within the Taiyuan basin (see the locations in Fig. 1b) are
    used to validate InSAR-derived displacements in our study. The details of the
    processing strategy of the CGPS data and 3D displacement time-series for each
    station can be found in (Tang et al., 2018, Zeng et al., 2012). The daily CGPS
    observations are available from 2016 to 2019 and overlapped with some parts of
    the Sentinel-1 dataset. We compare the InSAR-derived displacements with the CGPS
    measurements in Section 4.1. Groundwater level data recorded in the confined aquifer
    at four water wells within the basin were acquired from China Earthquake Networks
    Center (CENC), see their locations in Fig. 1b as marked with TY, QX, XY and JX.
    The depths of water wells vary from 315 m to 765.78 m (Yan et al., 2020). Fig.
    4 shows the geochronology and lithology of the aquifer at these four wells. Rock
    types in the aquifer system for each well are primarily sandstone or consolidated
    sand gravel. Groundwater level data were recorded at 1-minute sampling intervals
    from May 2007 to November 2020. We resampled the time series of water level data
    by moving average into a daily interval and evaluated the seasonal ground displacement
    in response to the seasonal fluctuations in the groundwater level in Section 4.

    Taiyuan basin. Modified after (Yan et al., 2020). Daily precipitation data from
    Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for
    GPM (IMERG) were acquired through Giovanni (https://giovanni.gsfc.nasa.gov/giovanni).
    The precipitation data were used to assess the groundwater recharge and its relationship
    with ground surface displacement in Section 4. 3.3. InSAR seasonal displacement
    modeling Ground surface displacements can be divided into three components: a
    linear trend, a seasonal variation, and an irregular residual. The long-term lowering
    in groundwater level causes the consolidation of fine-grained sediments, which
    leads to the linear component of land subsidence and is mainly inelastic. The
    seasonal component of displacement is caused by the seasonal cycle of groundwater
    discharge and recharge in the aquifer system. Thus, we modeled the InSAR displacement
    time series as: (1) where is the time in units of years, is the linear velocity,
    and is a constant. and are the coefficients of the periodic motion, where indicates
    the annual terms and indicates the semi-annual terms. The last term represents
    errors which are independent, identically distributed, and random with . The model
    with the unknown coefficients is a linear system as: (2) The best linear unbiased
    estimates of the unknown parameters can be solved by least square algorithm as:
    (3) Finally, the annual ( ) and semi-annual ( ) amplitudes and phase can be calculated
    as: (4) 3.4. Wavelet transform analysis InSAR-derived displacement time series
    can be further examined with wavelet methods to understand the time-varying features
    and to quantify the causal relationships between the measured displacement and
    the triggering factors. The CWT method expands time-series data to the time–frequency
    domain and therefore provides information on the temporal persistence of periodicities.
    The XWT and WTC allow the identification of the common power spectra and wavelet
    coherence between two time-series datasets (Grinsted et al., 2004, Tomaoós et
    al., 2020), respectively. The CWT is a convolution of the time-series data with
    a scaled and translated version of the mother wavelet as follows: (5) where is
    the data series length, is the wavelet scale, is the sampling interval, is the
    localized time index. The most used mother wavelet in geophysical applications
    is the Morlet wavelet, which is defined as: (6) where and are the non-dimensional
    time and frequency parameter. The wavelet power spectrum is defined as , which
    conveys information on periodicities at different time scales. The XWT is extended
    from the CWT method which reveals the spatio-temporal interactions between two
    sets of data and quantifies their coordination, either the phase relationships
    or the time-lag effects. The XWT of two data sequences (e.g., X and Y) is the
    product of with the complex conjugate of as follow: (7) where and are the CWT
    of each data sequence, and represents complex conjugate. is the cross-wavelet
    power and is the relative phase that represents a time-lag effect between the
    two time-series. The XWT is hence very useful for investigating the delayed response
    between the cause and the effect. Additionally, the relative phase in radians
    can be converted into time lag in unit of days or years: (8) where is the periodicity
    of the data sequence. The WTC characterizes the coherence (values range from 0
    to 1) between CWTs of two individual data sequence, which can be expressed as,
    (9) where is a smoothing operator. In the time–frequency domain where the two
    CWTs have similar wavelet coherence, the value will be high (close to 1). The
    proposed methodology here is to apply these wavelet tools (CWT, XWT and WTC) to
    comprehensively investigate the periodicity of the ground deformation time-series
    and its potential triggering factors (e.g., groundwater level and precipitation),
    and quantitatively analyze their cause-effect relationships. The input data sequence
    for wavelet methods must be uniformly sampled in time. Although SAR acquisitions
    from Sentinel-1 have a regular repeating time, 12 days in our study, some acquisitions
    may be missing or excluded from interferometric processing due to the decorrelated
    effects. Therefore, the missing values were linearly interpolated into equally
    spaced in time using the Sentinel-1 revisit interval of 12 days. The interpolated
    displacement time-series were then separated into linear and non-linear components.
    The potential triggering factors such as groundwater level and precipitation,
    were collected with a higher time frequency (1 day in our study) than the displacement
    time series derived from InSAR. Consequently, we down sampled the groundwater
    level and precipitation data time series to the revisiting time interval of the
    Sentinel-1 data (i.e., 12 days). The wavelet methods were applied to the evenly
    sampled data to investigate the seasonal ground deformation and the time lags
    between seasonal variations in displacements and the triggering factors. The flowchart

    velocity map in Taiyuan basin The LOS velocity obtained from Sentinel-1 data by
    the coherence-based SBAS method is shown in Fig. 6a. We referenced the displacement
    to a 100 m window collocated with the CGPS station K001, which is in the urban
    area of Jinzhong city with high coherence and exhibiting stable ground motion.
    The short revisit time of the Sentinel-1 acquisitions, combined with the coherence-based
    SBAS algorithm, help mitigate decorrelated effects in the basin. We validated
    the obtained InSAR results by comparing the LOS displacements with measurements
    from seven CGPS stations in the basin, except the reference station K001. This
    validation was performed by comparing their displacement time series (Fig. 6b),
    cumulative displacements (Fig.6c) and velocities (Fig. 6d). The three-component
    (east, north, and up) CGPS displacements were projected onto the LOS direction
    using the look vector components for each station. The trends of each time series
    matched in that the RMSE of cumulative displacements was ∼ 8 mm and the RMSE of
    velocities was ∼ 5 mm/yr. Although the time periods between InSAR and CGPS were
    not the same, these comparisons demonstrate a good agreement between these two
    techniques. Download : Download high-res image (920KB) Download : Download full-size

    to a 100 m window collocated with the CGPS station K001. The red triangles in
    (a) indicate the CGPS locations and the dark red contours represent groundwater
    level in 2011 relative to sea level (in meter). The solid blue ellipses indicate
    the main uplifting zones while the dashed green ellipses indicate the main subsiding
    zones. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the
    reader is referred to the web version of this article.) Spatial analysis of the
    InSAR displacement map indicates that land subsidence is concentrated in the central
    and southern parts of the basin (marked by dashed green ellipses in Fig. 6a).
    A subsidence bowl can be easily identified in the south of Taiyuan city, which
    covers an area of approximately 100 km2. This subsidence center is in Xiaodian
    district, a new economic development zone where extensive groundwater is used
    for the rapid economic growth that results in the significant subsidence with
    a maximum rate of ∼ 80 mm/yr. In the central basin, along the Fenhe riverbanks,
    the land is mainly covered by agricultural crops (Tang et al., 2018). Farmers
    draw a large amount of water to meet irrigation demand from underlying aquifers,
    causing widespread subsidence throughout the central basin. The peak of the subsidence
    in this region is as high as 82 mm/yr. In the southern edge of the basin, land
    subsidence occurred in the suburban area between Jiexiu and Xiaoyi city, which
    matches perfectly with the groundwater depression cone in that area (the dark
    red contours in Fig. 6a), confirming that groundwater overexploitation is the
    primary driving factor of land subsidence. Land uplift can be found in several
    areas in the basin (marked by solid blue ellipses in Fig. 6a). The uplifts are
    concentrated in the urban center of Taiyuan city in the northern part of the basin,
    where significant land subsidence occurred in the 1980 s and 1990 s at a rate
    of up to 110 mm/ year (Ma et al., 2005). We observed the rates of uplift about
    14 mm/yr during the study period. This uplift behavior is confirmed from CGPS
    measurements at stations A001 and A008 (see Fig. 6b). The observed land uplift
    is the elastic relaxation of the compacted aquifer system related to the regained
    fluid-pore pressure due to groundwater recovery, a phenomenon referred to as elastic
    or poroelastic rebound (Galloway and Burbey, 2011). Since 2003, the Wanjiazhai
    Water Diversion (WWD) project has been implemented to divert water from Yellow
    River to Taiyuan city, which has supplied 1.219 billion m3 of water to Taiyuan
    for household and ecological restoration by the end of 2018. At the same time,
    an integrated groundwater management program was implemented to strictly control
    groundwater pumping. In these circumstances, the amount of groundwater usage has
    largely reduced, and groundwater levels have recovered, which can be observed
    at TY well station in Fig. 8a that the groundwater level increased by about 22
    m between 2007 and 2020. Two localized uplifting areas were found in the western
    edge of the basin, one in Qingxu county northwest of CGPS A002 station with an
    average rate of 10 mm/yr and one in Jiaocheng county north of CGPS J005 station
    with an average rate of 6 mm/yr. The surface displacement caused by groundwater
    overexploitation is mainly in the vertical direction (Galloway and Burbey, 2011,
    Tang et al., 2018), hence in the subsequent analysis we directly projected the
    InSAR LOS displacement into the vertical direction by , where is the incidence
    angle of radar waves. Download : Download high-res image (676KB) Download : Download

    of influence (COI), where edge effects might distort the picture. (For interpretation
    of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the

    deformation in the basin Annual or seasonal uplift may occur in response to natural
    replenishment of aquifers during times of high precipitation and reflect as a
    variation in the piezometric head. These observations are critical in groundwater
    management because they indicate that the aquifer maintains some capacity to regain
    storage capability (Chaussard et al., 2017, Riel et al., 2018). Here, we investigated
    possible annual and seasonal signals in the displacement time series from InSAR
    by assuming the ground displacement can be expressed as a combination of seasonal
    and linear trend, as indicated in Equation (1). We estimated the sinusoidal coefficients
    for each pixel using Equation (3) and generated seasonal amplitude and phase maps
    using Equation (4). The estimated maps of annual and semi-annual amplitude and
    phase are shown in Fig. 7. The measurements with high spatial resolution from
    InSAR allow us to evaluate the spatial variability of the seasonal signals, which
    is an advantage over the sparse CGPS network within the basin. Fig. 7 shows that
    the seasonal displacement is concentrated within the central region of the basin
    where groundwater has been pumping for agricultural irrigation. We observed two
    zones of peaks in the annual amplitudes on either side of the Fenhe River (encircled
    with the white dashed lines in Fig. 7a) with a maximum amplitude of 2 cm on the
    eastern bank of the river and 1 cm on the western bank. The semi-annual signal
    is primarily present on the eastern bank of the river (Fig. 7c), with a maximum
    amplitude of 0.5 cm, which is very small compared to the annual signals. 4.3.
    CWT results of groundwater level, ground displacement and precipitation Fig. 8
    shows the CWT power spectra of groundwater level changes spanning 2007–2020 at
    the four groundwater wells in Taiyuan basin. From the groundwater time series,
    we observed water level rise at TY well in the north of the basin with a large
    rate of + 2.3 m/yr and at QX well in the central basin with a slight rate of +
    0.6 m/yr, while we observed groundwater decline in the south of the basin with
    a large declining rate of −3 m/yr at XY well and a slight rate of −0.3 m/yr at
    JX well. At QX well, it is interesting that a seasonal cycle of groundwater level
    was clearly modulated in the long-term rising trend. From the analysis of the
    CWT power spectrum at QX well in Fig. 8b, this seasonal pattern with a period
    of one year was clearly identified. This seasonal pattern is related to the annual
    cycle of groundwater withdrawal and recharge in the central basin. Several semi-annual
    processes were also found at this well, but they exhibited intermittency throughout
    the CWT, localized around time intervals of 2010–2012, 2015–2016 and 2017–2019.
    Both TY and JX wells exhibited an intermittent signal at the annual band, but
    their maximum powers localized in different time intervals, which are around 2007–2013
    and 2017–2020 at TY, and around 2009–2011 and 2017–2020 at JX. The water level
    at XY well did not show any significant seasonal variations. Arid and semi-arid
    areas of the Taiyuan basin is affected by climate change that the annual precipitation
    has been decreasing in the basin since the 1950 s (Shao et al., 2017). The reduce
    of rainfall can affect the hydrological cycle, reducing surface water and increasing
    extraction on groundwater, which thus leads to further land subsidence. The daily
    precipitation data at these four well locations obtained from GPM were resampled
    to a monthly scale and the CWT power spectra are presented in Fig. 9. We found
    a dominant 1-year period in relation to the monsoons throughout the observation
    interval. Several patterns with periodicity at 0.125–0.5 year are also clearly
    noted at these wells, which correspond to semi-annual signals in the temporal
    variability of the rainfall. The seasonality observed in the precipitation data
    can be explained by the typical continental monsoon climate, with an annual total
    precipitation less than 500 mm and about 60% is concentrated in June-September
    in the study area. Download : Download high-res image (666KB) Download : Download

    the four groundwater well locations in Taiyuan basin. The ground displacement
    time series at the four water wells and their CWT power spectra are shown in Fig.
    10. As shown, the ground in the north of the basin in Taiyuan city (also see the
    velocity map in Fig. 6) is experiencing uplift with a rate of ∼ 14 mm/yr due to
    the groundwater level rise in this region (see groundwater level at TY in Fig.
    8). The south of the basin exhibits significant land subsidence with similar rates
    of ∼ 28 mm/yr at XY and JX wells following the groundwater level decline, albeit
    the declining rate of groundwater at JX well (-0.3 m/yr) is much smaller than
    that at XY well (-3 m/yr). In the central basin, we observed land subsidence at
    well QX at a modest rate of 20 mm/yr, even though the groundwater is rising at
    this location. This inconsistency suggests that the continuous subsidence is driven
    mainly by the sustained groundwater pumping over the past decades. Interestingly,
    a seasonal cycle of up and down can be clearly observed in the displacement time
    series at QX, which is related to the changes of groundwater associated with the
    seasonal water pumping/recharge as mentioned earlier. This seasonal process in
    displacement time series with a 1-year period can be recognized from the CWT power
    spectrum in Fig. 10b. Similar regions with high wavelet power at the period of
    1 year are recognized for the other well stations, although their vibration amplitudes
    are much lower than that at QX well. Additionally, at TY, XY and JX wells, a power
    signal with a period of 3 to 4 months can be observed during 2018–2019. The observed
    cyclic displacements from InSAR can be related with groundwater level fluctuations
    or seasonal variations of rainfall. This causal relationship will be investigated
    through cross-wavelet analysis in the next section. Download : Download high-res

    and precipitation To quantify the causal relationships between seasonal variations
    of groundwater level, precipitation, and ground deformation, XWT and WTC were
    applied to these data sequences. Groundwater pumping is a well-known triggering
    factor of land subsidence, so we first analyzed the relationship between displacements
    and groundwater level changes. Fig. 11 shows the XWT and WTC between InSAR displacements
    and groundwater levels at the four water wells. We observed a high common power
    between displacement and groundwater level time-series approximately at the period
    of one year for the whole study period (2017–2020) at all these four wells. However,
    the time-lag effects vary at different locations. Displacement was in anti-phase
    with groundwater level in the north of the basin at TY well (phase shift , corresponding
    to a time lag of 205 days, Fig. 11a), whereas it was in-phase with groundwater
    level in the central basin at QX well ( , corresponding to a time lag of 3 days,
    Fig. 11b). In the south of the basin, the displacement is lagging the groundwater
    at XY well by about 102 days ( , Fig. 11c) while the displacement is leading the
    groundwater at JX well by about 40 days ( , Fig. 11d). Download : Download high-res

    wells in Taiyuan basin. Black arrows inside the significant regions (thick black
    contours) indicate the relative phasing of two time series, with arrows pointing
    right (in-phase: ) and pointing left (anti-phase: ). Arrows that do not point
    straight to the right or left indicate a lead-lag relationship between the two
    time-series. The heterogeneous time-lag effects between ground deformation and
    groundwater levels at these four wells reveal the lateral variability in the thickness
    of aquifer/aquitard and piezometric head across the basin. In heterogeneous aquifer
    systems, the delayed responses between surface deformation due to aquifer compaction
    and underground water levels, is attributed to the delayed equilibration of pore-fluid
    pressure between the aquifers mainly composed of unconsolidated, permeable coarse-grained
    deposit (such as sands and gravels) and aquitards mainly composed of low-permeability
    fine-grained deposit (such as silts and clays) (Galloway et al., 2000, Galloway
    and Burbey, 2011). In aquifer systems with thick aquitards, this lagged response
    can be on a time scale of years to decades or more. As can be seen in Fig. 4,
    the QX well in the central basin has the thickest clay unit in the aquifer system,
    the short time delay (three days) observed between water levels and ground deformation
    at this well implies that low permeability clay units have limited influence on
    the delayed compaction of aquifer systems. At other well stations, the time delays
    are longer due to their smaller thickness of fine-grained silts and clays with
    lower permeability. This signal is of hydrologic importance and could be used
    to assess groundwater recharge and usage. Groundwater in the aquifer system is
    replenished, or recharged, by rainfall and snow melt that seep down into the pores
    or cracks of the soil and rocks beneath the land''s surface. The interaction between
    groundwater and precipitation is crucial to better understand the hydrological
    processes and water resources management. The XWT between groundwater level and
    precipitation was carried out to analyze its resonance period and phase relationships
    (Fig. 12). A high common power between groundwater level and precipitation was
    found at approximately a 1-year period throughout the observation period. The
    XWT and WTC also show that water level and precipitation is in anti-phase at TY
    ( , corresponding to a time lag of 208 days), QX ( , corresponding to a time lag
    of 232 days) and XY ( , corresponding to a time lag of 263 days). These anti-phase
    relationships agree with the pumping practices in the basin that groundwater pumping
    is increased before the monsoon precipitation season to meet irrigation water
    demand during the major crop-growing period (March to August). Groundwater declines
    due to the pumping for irrigation and drops to the lowest level during times of
    high precipitation (August-September). The water from rainfall is stored and supplies

    the amount of groundwater extraction is larger than the amount of recharge during
    dry weather while the opposite during wet seasons. The increased groundwater pumping
    during seasons with less precipitation will cause more land subsidence. If groundwater
    extraction reduces during seasons with high precipitation and groundwater recharges
    later, a small amount of land uplift could occur due to the regained pore-fluid
    pressure in the aquifer system. The plots of the XWT and WTC analysis between
    displacement and precipitation are shown in Fig. 13. A high significant power
    can be observed for a 1-year period at these four water wells, covering almost
    for the entire study period. Note that precipitation and ground deformation is
    in-phase at TY ( , corresponding to a time lag of 52 days), XY ( , corresponding
    to a time lag of 15 days) and JX wells ( , corresponding to time lag of 4 days)
    while this relationship is anti-phase at QX well ( , corresponding to time lag
    of 130 days). This fact agrees with the agriculture irrigated activities as groundwater
    pumping was encouraged during the high precipitation months in the central region
    of the basin as discussed earlier. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download

    5.1. Seasonal deformation in relation to geological conditions The InSAR time
    series reveal two different time scales of groundwater-related surface displacements
    in the Taiyuan basin, which reflects two different deformation processes due to
    groundwater discharge and recharge. The long-term trend of land subsidence is
    consistent with aquitard drainage model (Galloway et al., 2000, Gambolati and
    Teatini, 2021) that the inelastic compaction is not entirely compensated by the
    elastic rebound during aquifer recharge. The second time scale of short-term deformation
    relates to the annual groundwater level variations in the basin, as reflected
    in the maps of seasonal amplitude and phase delay in Fig. 7. We superimposed the
    thickness of Quaternary strata and the developed earth fissures onto the annual
    amplitude and phase delay maps of ground deformation, as shown in Fig. 14. The
    seasonal pattern is present in Taigu-Qixian counties in the central basin and
    concentrated in the irrigated area. This similar pattern is also found in groundwater
    level data at QX well around this area. Earth fissures are widely developed in
    the central basin around the Taigu-Qixian area, which is spatially correlated
    with the seasonal deformation patterns, as can be seen in Fig. 14. It indicates
    that the seasonal ground deformation plays a critical role in forming earth fissures
    especially around the transition areas with large gradients in seasonal amplitudes
    where differential subsidence is more likely to occur. Download : Download high-res

    in (a) and (b) are the earth fissures in the basin (extracted from (Meng et al.,
    2019, Peng et al., 2018, Sun et al., 2016)). (For interpretation of the references
    to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this
    article.) The thickness of Quaternary strata at northwestern border of the basin
    is large than 500 m and it gradually becomes thinner from northwest to southeast.
    The area with large seasonal amplitudes in the eastern bank of Fenhe River is
    located on the southeastern side of the Taihang mountain, where the thickness
    of the Quaternary strata varies between 200 and 400 m, and the lithology is mainly
    fine sand, silt, and silty clay (Meng et al., 2019, Peng et al., 2018). The thickness
    of the Quaternary strata changed rapidly in the discontinuous transition zones
    of the amplitude/phase maps (see the profiles of I-I’ and II-II’), which suggests
    that the thickness of Quaternary strata plays a critical role in the diffusion
    of piezometric head in the aquifer system. We also found sharp discontinuities
    in the seasonal amplitude and phase delay across fault systems within the basin,
    indicating that the faults act as an effective barrier to lateral groundwater
    flow. This effect can be clearly found at faults F2 and F3 along the profiles
    of the annual amplitude (Fig. 14c and e). For the discontinuity across the faults,
    the difference in the seasonal annual amplitude between each side of the fault
    could be as high as 15 mm. This across-fault discontinuous pattern can also be
    found in phase delay map where the ground west of the Longjiaying fault (F2) has
    a peak signal in May and the ground east of the F2 has a peak signal in February.
    5.2. Elastic and inelastic deformation in response to changes in groundwater In
    the central basin, the short-term, seasonal variations in ground displacement
    observed in the InSAR time series follows well with the aquifer extraction/recovery
    cycles (Fig. 15). The high summer demand for irrigation water combined with the
    normally wet summer causes groundwater levels to fluctuate in response to the
    seasonal cycle of pumping and recharge. The displacement time series of the points
    P1 and P2 with the most significant seasonal signals on the east and west banks
    of Fenhe River clearly show that the seasonal elastic displacement is embedded
    in the long-term trend of land subsidence (Fig. 15g, h). We found that the vertical
    deformation at these two points has an annual cycle, with a peak in March and
    a trough in August. The point P1 on the east bank of Fenhe River shows greater
    subsidence and seasonal effects (a subsidence rate of 47 mm/yr and an annual amplitude
    of 22.7 mm) than the point P2 on the west bank of the river with a subsidence
    rate of 18 mm/yr and an annual amplitude of 11.8 mm. Download : Download high-res

    We only show the areas with annual amplitude higher than 5 mm (delineated by the
    white dashed polygons). The negative values mean land subsidence while the positive
    indicate land uplift. (g) and (h) show the displacement time series at point P1
    and P2, respectively. The respective least squares fit sinusoidal curves are overlain
    (red solid lines). The annual amplitude (amp), phase and linear rates are indicated
    in the figure. (i) The seasonal displacements (with removal of the linear trend)
    at point P1 and P2 with respect to the seasonal groundwater level variations at
    QX well station. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure
    legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) The relationship
    between vertical deformation and the duration of the extraction-recovery phases
    was analyzed. We divided the groundwater and displacement time series into three
    extraction-recovery cycles as shown in Fig. 15i. We estimated the cycle temporal
    ratio (TR) and the uplift-subsidence ratio (SR) for each cycle as suggested by
    (Ezquerro et al., 2014). The TR represents the relationship between the duration
    of the groundwater recovery ( ) over the duration of the extraction ( ), i.e.,
    . The SR expressed in percentage corresponds to the ratio between land uplift
    ( ) during groundwater recovery with respect to land subsidence ( ) during groundwater
    extraction (i.e., ). The groundwater extraction phase is from mid-March to mid-August
    (duration of 5 months) and the recovery is from the late August to the next mid-March
    (duration of 7 months), therefore the TR is 1.4. The TR ratio remains constant
    over time, as can be seen from the seasonal variations of water level at QX well
    in Fig. 15i, which indicates the relatively constant practices of the annual cycle
    of groundwater withdrawal and recharge during this period. The subsidence and
    uplift during different extraction-recovery phases and their SR are listed in
    Table 1. The average SR is 33% for P1 and 46.7% for P2, suggesting that for this
    aquifer system, the land uplift due to aquifer recovery compensated less than
    50% of the previous subsidence during extraction phases. Although the land subsidence/uplift
    behavior corresponds well to the extraction-recovery cycles, subsidence and uplift
    related to groundwater decline and rise, respectively, were not proportional to
    changes of groundwater level. Take P1 location for an example, groundwater levels
    declined 25.8 m corresponding with 218.1 mm of land subsidence (cumulative subsidence
    from March 2017 to March 2020), while groundwater level recovered 25.2 m with
    a corresponding uplift of only 70.2 mm. The ratio of the change in deformation
    to the change in groundwater level for the declining portion is 8 mm/m, which
    is much larger than the ratio for the water level rising portion (i.e., 3 mm/m),
    indicating the dominant part of land subsidence is inelastic. Table 1. Vertical

    Recovery 2019.08–2020.03 P1 27.3 9.1 P2 25.0 45.2 We further estimated the elastic/inelastic
    deformation ratio ( ). The long-term trend of displacement is considered as the
    inelastic component and the short-term fluctuations of deformation as the elastic
    component. Values higher than 1 represent a dominant part of elastic deformation;
    values lower than 1 represent a dominant part of inelastic deformation. The trend
    of the displacement time-series on the east bank of the river (for pixels with
    annual amplitude higher than 5 mm and subsidence rates higher than 20 mm/yr) shows
    an average subsidence rate of 30 mm/yr and fluctuates by ± 10 mm. On the west
    bank of the river, the average subsidence rate is 22 mm/yr and the fluctuation
    is ± 7 mm. The elastic/inelastic ratio is approximately 0.66 for the east bank
    and 0.63 for the west bank between 2017 and 2020. This ratio further confirms
    the presence of predominantly inelastic deformation in the central basin. 6. Conclusion
    In this work, we investigated the seasonality of ground displacement in Taiyuan
    basin derived from Sentinel-1 InSAR data and quantified the causal relationships
    between InSAR-derived seasonal displacements, groundwater level and precipitation
    time-series using wavelet-based methods (CWT, XWT and WTC). The seasonal variations
    in ground displacement caused by seasonal groundwater level changes are related
    to irrigation pumping activities in the central basin. This seasonal displacement
    is characterized by a 1-year period with an annual peak-to-peak amplitudes of
    2 cm with peaks in March and troughs in August. Using the XWT method, we found
    the seasonal variations present in the displacement time-series are ‘in-phase’
    with respect to groundwater levels and ‘anti-phase’ to natural precipitation.
    These relationships agree with the irrigation pumping practice in the basin, groundwater
    extraction increases for irrigation from mid-March to mid-August prior to the
    monsoon precipitation season, resulting in water levels decline and land subsidence
    during this period. During the non-irrigated season from late August to mid-March,
    groundwater extraction decreases, and aquifers are replenished by precipitation,
    causing water levels to recover and the ground to uplift. The relatively short
    time delay (three days) observed between deformation and water level in the central
    basin implies that low permeability clay units have limited influence on the delayed
    compaction of aquifer systems. The seasonal deformation is correlated with the
    thickness of Quaternary strata and fault systems, which plays a critical role
    in the development of earth fissures in the basin. Our analysis of the central
    basin shows that the irreversible deformation is likely to be dominant in this
    area that the elastic/inelastic deformation ratio is approximately 0.6–0.7. Our
    results have significant implications for understanding the mechanism of land
    subsidence, and the subsequent design and adoption of subsidence mitigation measures,
    especially the measures on groundwater management for sustainable development
    in this arid region. Sentinel-1 mission provides regular data acquisition with
    high temporal resolution of 6/12 days, which helps better reveal seasonal variations
    in displacement time series. The wavelet-based methods can be further exploited
    to identify and quantify causal relationships between InSAR-derived ground deformation
    and groundwater level, which helps improve the numerical models on land subsidence.
    However, we must bear in mind that wavelet-based methods do not unravel the underlying
    physical mechanism of land subsidence and additional hydrogeological information
    and analysis are needed to fully explain the mechanism of the relationship between
    land subsidence and its triggering factors (Tomaoós et al., 2020). Declaration

    sorption 1. Introduction Globally, phosphorus (P) fertilizers applied to ensure
    the growth of crops also accumulate in the soil, as legacy P and can gradually
    be lost into adjacent water bodies by surface runoff or subsurface leaching pathways,
    causing eutrophication (Tian et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2020). It is known that
    elevated P loss potential of soil is related to soil colloid transport and that
    colloid-facilitated P migration has been one of the critical P loss pathways in
    agricultural ecosystems (Adediran et al., 2021; Eltohamy et al., 2023; Siebers
    et al., 2023). Soil colloid has high specific surface area and charge density
    thereby can be suspended in the soil solution and promote the vertical movement
    of various contaminants and nutrients to groundwater (Liang et al., 2016; Missong
    et al., 2018). Generally, the colloidal P (Pcoll) is the P that associated to
    soil colloids with a diameter of 1–1000 nm (Wang et al., 2021). Qin et al. (2020)
    have reported that over 40% of P in soil solutions were associated with colloids.
    A previous study has reported that rainstorms can promote the subsurface transport
    of P-enriched granules and that Pcoll (200–660 mg L−1) accounted for 64% of the
    total P in tile drainage water (Jiang et al., 2021). Based on field runoff plots,
    Sharma et al. (2017) examined P forms and fluxes via runoff, throughflow and leaching
    and it was found that 90% of P losses were in colloidal forms. As global warming
    continues, extreme precipitation and drought occur frequently in the North China
    Plain (Cui et al., 2021; Lorelei de Jesus et al., 2020). The heterogeneous distribution
    of precipitation in spatiotemporal patterns caused the alternation of flooding
    and drying. The flooding and subsequent drainage also is a common phenomenon induced
    by irrigation practices occurring in paddy fields (Mueller et al., 2012). In addition,
    flooding for several months after the crop harvest in protected vegetable field
    is recommended to eliminate soil diseases (Zhang et al., 2021). The alternating
    flooding and drying events inevitably affect the dispersion of soil colloid and
    the release of Pcoll by changing soil properties, such as pH, redox potential
    and ionic strength (Liang et al., 2010). For example, Gu et al. (2018) reported
    that flooding and drying cycles could decrease the redox potential and stimulate
    the release of P bound to soil colloids/nanoparticles in two riparian wetland
    soils. The mechanisms of Pcoll release due to alternating flooding and drying
    cycles is often attributed to the lysis of microbial cells (Blackwell et al.,
    2010), physical disruption of soil aggregates (Sun et al., 2017) and substrate
    release from soil aggregate surfaces. Furthermore, the fate of Pcoll due to alternating
    flooding and drying cycles may also be influenced by soil type (Buchanan et al.,
    2023; Chen et al., 2022). It was found that the elevated Calcium (Ca) content
    was accompanied by the decrease of the Pcoll content in semiarid calcareous soils
    under dry-wet alternation conditions (Lu et al., 2004). Vonk et al. (2017) also
    reported that rewetting carbonate sediment induced a strong release flux of Ca
    that contributed to limiting the fluxes of Pcoll to surface water. As an important
    agricultural soil, calcareous soils account for 47% of arable land globally and
    are widely distributed in the North China Plain and arid and semi-arid regions
    (Gandois et al., 2011; Guo et al., 2018). Long-term excessive P input leads to
    significant P accumulation in these calcareous soils and promotes P loss with
    water movement in the soil (Zhou et al., 2021). Previous studies have focused
    on the loss of dissolved P, while not paying enough attention to the loss of Pcoll
    from such calcareous soils. On the other hand, in calcareous soils, long-term
    organic fertilization during agricultural practice enhanced soil organic matter,
    which is beneficial to promoting soil organic colloid formation and may strengthen
    the association between soil colloids and phosphate through the Ca2+ ion bridge
    (Wang et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2022). Alternating flooding and drying events
    also affect Pcoll release, which increases P migration along leaching pathways
    to adjacent waters. Therefore, it is important to determine the implication of
    alternating flooding and drying on Pcoll release of calcareous soils. However,
    to date, it remains unclear how alternating flooding and drying cycles affect
    the Pcoll release potentials in calcareous soils. The objectives of this study
    were to illustrate Pcoll release dynamics and explore the corresponding mechanism
    in a calcareous soil when experiencing alternating flooding and drying events.
    It was hypothesized that 1) alternating flooding and drying cycles would reduce
    the content of Pcoll in the calcareous soil and 2) Ca was a governing important
    factor which determined the release of Pcoll. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Study
    site and soil samples collection Soil samples for this study were collected from
    a greenhouse in the Daxing District (39°73′ N, 116°33′ E), Beijing Province, China.
    The mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation of the area were 11.6
    °C and 556 mm, respectively. Soil in this area was classified as Cambisol according
    to the USDA soil taxonomy with 43.2% sand, 45.2% silt, and 11.6% clay. Before
    soil collection, vegetables were planted for 13 years from 2008 (annual double
    cropping, winter-spring and autumn-winter seasons, pepper or eggplant were planted
    in February for the winter-spring season, and cabbage or tomato were planted in
    August for the autumn-winter season). Composted chicken manure (220 kg ha−1 P
    per year) was incorporated into the soil before transplanting, correspondingly,
    169 kg ha−1 P was in surplus and accumulated in the soil per year. After the tomato
    harvest in January 2022, the topsoil (0–20 cm) was sampled in triplicate. The
    soil cores were fully mixed to obtain one soil sample and then air-dried, sieved
    (<2 mm), and stored for further analysis. Soil pH was 7.81, electrical conductivity
    was 333 μs cm−1, soil organic carbon (SOC) was 19.1 g kg−1, total phosphorus (TP)
    was 1.71 g kg−1, Olsen-P was 239 mg kg−1. 2.2. Incubation experiment design Each
    70 g air-dried soil sample was put into a 100 ml plastic bottle and the water
    content was adjusted to 50% of field capacity. The bottles were pre-incubated
    for 2 weeks at 25 °C to equilibrate soil moisture (n = 54). Next, the formal incubation
    experiment was carried out with irrigation imposed every 3 days. Three treatments
    were applied with 3 replicates: 1) control, soil moisture at 70% of field capacity;
    2) flooding, the overlying water layer was held at 1 cm corresponding to 130%
    of field capacity and 3) alternating flooding and drying, the soil was submerged
    to 130% of field capacity for 2 days, then the water capacity was dropped to 70%
    of field capacity with silica desiccant (Fig. S1). The prospective moisture content
    was determined by regularly weighing the sample bottles and replacing the desiccants,
    according to the preliminary results, it took 6 days to go from 130% field capacity
    to 70% field capacity. The bottles were kept on 70% field capacity for 2 extra
    days to equilibrate moisture. Subsequently, these bottles were reflooded to 130%
    field capacity for the next cycle. The incubation experiment was conducted for
    30 days including three flooding-drying cycles. Soils were sampled at the moisture
    variation point of three cycles (day 2 and 8 for cycle 1, day 12 and 18 for cycle
    2 and day 22 and 30 for cycle 3). For samples in the flooding treatment and during
    the flooding period in the alternating flooding and drying treatment (day 2, day
    12, day 22), since the exact moisture of the soil cannot be determined, it is
    impossible to add deionized water to adjust the soil/water ratio, thereby the
    water extracted P and colloidal P was directly extracted. The overlying water
    samples were collected before the soil samples and the volume of overlying water
    samples was less than 6 ml and not enough for the colloidal P separation in the
    present study. The concentration of P in the overlying water samples was also
    measured and it was found that the content of P in the overlying water accounted
    for <4% of the water extracted P of the residual soil in the bottom of tubes.
    Based on this consideration, it was decided to discard the overlying water and
    extract the legacy soil to obtain water extracted P and colloidal P. 2.3. Soil
    properties analysis and P sorption isotherms determination Soil pH and electrical
    conductivity were determined in deionized water with soil: water ratio of 1:2.5
    and 1:5, respectively (Richards, 1954). The electrical conductivity was monitored
    to indicate the ionic strength in soil solutions, which has an impact on colloidal
    properties (Rousseau et al., 2004). Olsen-P was measured by the standard ammonium
    molybdate blue method after soil was extracted by 0.5 M NaHCO3 (soil:solution
    ratio of 1:20) (Olsen, 1954). P sorption isotherms were determined as described
    by Holford (1997). Briefly, 1 g soil in triplicate was added to 20 mL 0.01 M CaCl2
    solutions containing 0, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10, 20, 25 and 40 mg L−1 phosphate (KH2PO4),
    then the mixtures were shaken, centrifuged and filtered (<0.45 μm). The P concentration
    in the filtrates was analyzed by the standard ammonium molybdate blue method (Murphy
    and Riley, 1962). The P amount absorbed by soil was obtained based on the difference
    between the original P and equilibrium P concentration in the supernatants. The
    maximum P sorption capacity and binding energy constant for the Langmuir model
    and sorption equilibrium constant for the Freundlich model were calculated according
    to a previous study (Holford, 1997): Eq.(1) Eq.(2) where C is equilibrium P concentration,
    Q is P sorption capacity, Qmax is maximum P sorption capacity, K is binding energy
    constant, Kf and 1/n are Freundlich constants. 2.4. Soil water-dispersible colloid
    separation and colloidal elements determination Water-dispersible colloid of the
    soil were separated as described by Liang et al. (2010). Briefly, 10 g fresh soil
    and 80 ml deionized water were mixed and horizontally shaken at 180 rpm for 24
    h (20 °C). The mixture was centrifuged at 3500 g for 8 min to settle large soil
    particles (∼8 μm) and the supernatant was stored for the next analysis (sample
    I). The P content in sample I was defined as water-extracted P. The water-extracted
    P includes the truly dissolved P, Pcoll and particulate P. Based on this, further
    separations were carried out to distinguish them. Then, a portion of the sample
    I was filtered through a 1 μm Millipore filter paper, and the filtrate was collected
    (sample II). Sample II was ultra-filtrated at 4500 g for 45 min with a 1 kDa (about
    0.6 nm) pore size membrane, and the filtrate was collected (sample III). The centrifugation
    time was calculated according to the Stokes’ law (Wang et al., 2020). The P content
    in sample III was defined as the truly dissolved P (<0.6 nm), Pcoll (0.6–1000
    nm) was obtained from the difference between sample II and III, and particulate
    P (1–8 μm) was obtained based on the difference between sample I and II. The total
    P concentration of the three fractions (sample I, sample II and sample III) was
    determined by standard ammonium molybdate blue method after alkaline persulphate
    oxidation. Molybdate-reactive P of water-extracted P fraction was directly measured
    (Baldwin, 1998). Molybdate-unreactive P was calculated as the concentration difference
    between the total P and molybdate-reactive P of water-extracted P. The concentrations
    of iron (Fe), aluminum (Al), Ca and magnesium (Mg) in each fraction were determined
    by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, Agilent 7850, USA) after
    acidiﬁcation (pH < 2) with 1 M nitric acid. The total organic carbon (TOC) concentration
    in each fraction was measured by a total organic carbon analyzer (enviro-TOC,
    Elementar, Germany). 2.5. Colloidal stabilities and mineral compositions analysis
    Zeta potentials of the sample II were measured by a Zeta-sizer (Nano-ZS90, Malvern,
    UK) (Liang et al., 2010). Colloidal absorbances were determined after sonicated
    the <1 μm size fraction for 3 min using a UV–Vis spectrophotometer (TU-1901, China)
    with a wavelength of 300 nm, which was chosen because the dissolved organic matters
    did not show distinct absorption peaks in this spectrum. The absorbance was continuously
    measured every 2 min during 0–120 min. The ratio of absorbance at a particular
    point (A) to the initial absorbance (A0) can be used for estimating the stability
    of colloids and the A/A0 value approaching 1 representing higher stability (Xu
    et al., 2022). After freeze drying, the mineral composition of sample II was characterized
    by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Bruker D-5000 X-ray diffractometer (Billerica,
    MA, USA) with a Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 18 nm), at 40 kV and 40 mA. Diffraction
    data were recorded from 5° to 90° and scanning rate was set at 2° min−1. The Jade
    software (Materials Data Inc., Livermore, CA) was used for the calibration and
    phases analysis of mineral compositions of the colloidal samples (Huang et al.,
    2016). 2.6. Statistical analysis The means and standard error of each treatment
    were calculated by Microsoft Excel (2019). A repeated measure analysis of variance
    (ANOVA) was performed by SPSS IBM 20.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). The data passed
    the normal distribution and homogeneity test before ANOVA. The significant differences
    in soil properties and P fractions between the different water management strategies
    or the time series of incubation period within specific treatment were tested
    using the Least Significant Difference test (P < 0.05). The redundancy analysis
    (RDA) and random forest model were conducted by CANOCO 5 (Microcomputer Power,
    Ithaca, NY, USA) and R (R 4.0.3, R Development Core Team) to assess the correlations
    among truly dissolved P, Pcoll and particulate P and soil properties and explore
    the affecting factors on Pcoll contents, respectively. 3. Results and discussion
    3.1. Dynamic changes of colloidal P in the control treatment Soil moisture in
    the control treatment was kept at 70% of field capacity. In this scenario, Pcoll
    (16.5–25.5 mg kg−1) was the dominating fraction of water-extracted P, and its
    proportion in water-extracted P ranging from 42.8% to 64.9% (Fig. 1a and b). This
    content of Pcoll was higher than in previous studies (2.33–7.92 mg kg−1 in rice-wheat
    rotation field and 6.51–12.7 mg kg−1 in double cropping rice field) (Li et al.,
    2021; Wang et al., 2021).This could be attributed to the long-term compost application
    not only enhanced the labile P content but also enhanced soil organic matter,
    which is beneficial to promoting soil organic colloid formation and may strengthen
    the association between soil colloids and phosphate. Moreover, the contents of
    Pcoll gradually increased in the early stage (day 2 to day 12) but decreased by
    35.1% in the late stage (day 12 to day 30). The decrease of Pcoll was accompanied
    by an increase in truly dissolved P, the proportions of truly dissolved P had
    increased from 25.7% (day 2 to day 12) to 36.8% (day 18 to day 30). These results
    support the assumption that fluctuations in Pcoll content may be due to the change
    of soil colloid amounts and the change of interaction between free phosphate and
    soil colloid. The results of Ilg et al. (2008) also show that the combination
    of free phosphate with soil colloid in soil solutions resulted in the enhancement
    of Pcoll content. The contents (0.72–7.03 mg kg−1) and proportions (13.8%–18.5%)
    of particulate P stayed relatively stable during the entire incubation time. Download

    this article.) 3.2. Flooding or alternating flooding and drying decreased the
    release of colloidal P Compared with Pcoll in the control treatment, the flooding
    treatment significantly decreased Pcoll contents by 16.0%–62.1%. The truly dissolved
    P contents in the flooding treatment increased by 17.3%–167% (Fig. 1c). The transformation
    of the Pcoll and truly dissolved P was found in the present study. These results
    indicated that the risk of Pcoll loss was reduced under the flooded condition
    in this calcareous soil, however, the risk of truly dissolved P loss increased
    significantly. In addition, the proportion of truly dissolved P was enhanced from
    33% on day 2–59% on day 18. A similar result was shown by Schroth et al. (2015)
    that the reductive dissolution of colloidal Fe (hydr)oxides during the flooding
    period in paddy soils may explain the decreased Pcoll and the enhanced truly dissolved
    P contents. Significantly decreased colloidal Fe contents were found from day
    12 to day 30 in the flooding treatment in this study (Fig. 2b). This result also
    agrees with the assumption that the Fe reduction dissolves part of the soil colloid
    and thereby decreases the Pcoll. Particulate P content in the flooding treatment
    was significantly higher than that in the control treatment on day 2, day 12,
    and day 22, respectively. Previous studies have found that flooding irrigation
    promoted the release of dissolved P and Pcoll in an organic fertilizer-amended
    paddy soil (Eltohamy et al., 2021). The present results indicated that flooding
    decreased Pcoll but increased truly dissolved P release, which were not in accordance
    with Eltohamy et al. (2021). It could also be attributed to prolonged flooding
    of soil which accelerated the dissolution of Fe/Mn oxides and the disintegration
    of soil aggregates thereby released the intra-aggregate particulate P and Pcoll
    (Xia et al., 2018), however, Pcoll could further convert into truly dissolved
    P under the reducing condition (Fig. 1d). Positive correlations among truly dissolved
    P, Pcoll, particulate P and colloidal Fe also confirmed this inference. Download

    Compared to the control treatment, the alternating flooding and drying treatment
    significantly decreased the Pcoll content by 11.6%–88.0%. The content of Pcoll
    decreased by 50.8% in cycle 1 and decreased by 63.9% in cycle 2 while it tended
    to be stable (2.87–3.38 mg kg−1) in cycle 3 (Fig. 1e). Moreover, the alternating
    flooding and drying treatment significantly increased the truly dissolved P content
    from day 2 to day 12 while decreased it from day 18 to day 30The truly dissolved
    P content in the alternating flooding and drying treatment decreased by 5.17%
    in cycle 1 and decreased by 84.0% in cycle 2 while it increased by 47.6% in cycle
    3. The transformation of Pcoll and truly dissolved P coupled with the changed
    P retention capacity of soil may be interpreted as the fluctuation of truly dissolved
    P. Dantas Mendes (2020) also found that the increased P sorption in drainage ditch
    sediments from agricultural catchments lead to the reduction of truly dissolved
    P. For the particulate P fraction, alternating flooding and drying did not affect
    its content significantly but increased the particulate P proportion. Soil drainage
    increased the proportion of particulate P by 12.7% and 27.2% in cycle 1 and cycle
    2, respectively. It suggested truly dissolved P and Pcoll may be involved in conversion
    to larger-size particulate P under the alternating flooding and drying cycles.
    It may be attributed to both effects of strong sorption by soil Ca minerals and
    colloidal aggregation induced by electrostatic attraction (Xu et al., 2022). Above
    results were also confirmed by a previous study which has shown that alternating
    flooding and drying cycles could not only decrease Pcoll but also decrease truly
    dissolved P release and therefore decrease P loss risk (Eltohamy et al., 2023).
    The formation of large particles is largely responsible for such results(Jin et
    al., 2023; Li et al., 2020). 3.3. Decreased colloidal P contents explained by
    the enhanced colloidal aggregation and soil sorption capacity In order to further
    interpret the significant decline in Pcoll content and proportion of the alternating
    flooding and drying treatment, the zeta potentials and stability behaviors of
    colloidal phases (sample II) were measured. Colloids were negatively charged under
    the three flooding and drying cycles (Fig. 3). Colloidal zeta potentials were
    less negative when the soil dried. Upon flooding again, the values of zeta potentials
    recovered to the initial level. This might be explained by the evaporation-driven
    aggregation of colloidal granules (Seiphoori et al., 2020). Colloidal stability
    behavior also supported the aggregation-prone trend during the alternating flooding
    and drying events (Fig. S2). The A/A0 values tended to be larger when soil got
    dried during cycle 1, which illustrated that the soil colloids started to be unstable.
    Zeta potentials and stability behaviors results both showed that alternating flooding
    and drying promoted the aggregation of soil colloids and reduced their stability
    (Xu et al., 2021). The enhanced aggregation role accelerated colloids flocculation
    and separated out of the water-extracted P and this may be one reason accounting
    for the decreased Pcoll contents. Download : Download high-res image (216KB) Download

    the alternating flooding and drying treatment. Capital letters represent significant
    differences among incubation times at P < 0.05. For the alternating flooding and
    drying treatment, the P sorption isotherms were measured to evaluate the soil
    retention capacity for P. Both Langmuir and Freundlich models were used to fit
    the P sorption data in the present study (Fig. 4 and Table 1). It was shown that
    Langmuir seems unsuitable for sorption data fitting in the present study, as no
    plateau of P sorption has been reached yet at higher equilibrium P concentrations.
    Obvious deviations were found between the fitting line and the data points at
    higher equilibrium P concentrations. Higher correlation coefficients and smaller
    deviations between points and fitting lines support that the Freundlich model
    is more suitable for describing the P sorption process in the present study. Dried
    soil from day 2 to day 8 in the alternating flooding and drying treatment significantly
    increased Kf, which indicated that the P sorption of soil increased through multilayer/non-uniform
    sorption during this drying period. The dried soil from day 12 to day 18 and the
    dried soil from day 22 to day 30 both decreased Kf. This is inconsistent with
    the information from the first drying period. This information supports that the
    decreasing contribution of the multilayer/non-uniform sorption to soil P sorption
    capacity after the second drying period. The decreasing contribution of the multilayer/non-uniform
    sorption to soil P sorption capacity as the drying period is repeated. Upon the
    reflooding condition, the increased Kf (Table 1) supports that the slightly increasing
    contribution of the multilayer/non-uniform sorption process to soil P sorption
    capacity as the reflooding process is repeated. The Pcoll content decreased during
    the drying periods while it increased during the reflooding period. This supported
    that the variation of soil P sorption capacity contributed the change of Pcoll
    content. Khan et al. (2022) also attributed the decrease of Pcoll content to the
    increase of P sorption capacity in dried paddy soils, which is consistent with
    the result of the present study. Therefore, the combined effects of colloidal
    stability and the change of soil sorption capacity collectively caused the decrease
    of Pcoll contents. Download : Download high-res image (545KB) Download : Download

    of Ca-containing minerals could partially explain the enhanced P sorption capacity
    (Fig. 2d and e and Fig. S3). Contents of colloidal Ca and Mg increased by 776%,
    343%, 462% and 186%, 138%, 361% during cycle 1, cycle 2 and cycle 3 in the alternating
    flooding and drying treatment, respectively. In contrast, colloidal Ca and Mg
    stayed stable in the control treatment. It has been reported that P was prone
    to be combined with colloidal Ca instead of colloidal Fe or Al in calcareous soils
    (Fan et al., 2020), it mainly attributed to the higher colloidal Ca content and
    smaller hydrated ionic radius, lower positive charges of Ca2+ making it easier
    for phosphate to bind to colloidal Ca. (Mendez and Hiemstra, 2020). In addition,
    strong correlations between Pcoll and colloidal Ca were found across forests (Wang
    et al., 2020), reservoir sediments (Nguyen et al., 2020) and paddy soils (Liang
    et al., 2016). The present study also illustrated that Pcoll is negatively related
    to colloidal Ca (Fig. 5a). The presence of Ca can facilitate cation bridging and
    formulate larger colloidal granules and therefore contribute to the reduction
    of Pcoll (Fan et al., 2020). Through a column study and multi-surface complexation
    model, Warrinnier et al. (2019) revealed that low Ca concentration in solution
    enhanced leachate P amounts but with a high Ca concentration reduced P leaching.
    Missana et al. (2018) also suggested Ca2+ in soil solution is a crucial factor
    for the aggregation behavior of colloidal particles and that a Ca concentration
    exceeding 0.3 mM was enough to aggregate any colloids. The Ca concentration in
    this present study exceeded 0.3 mM, and surplus Ca2+ would precipitate to Ca-containing
    minerals (such as calcite) when soil got dried (Fig. S3). P sorption by these
    newly generated minerals further decreased Pcoll contents (Xu et al., 2014). In
    general, alternating flooding and drying promoted soil Ca dissolution and release
    to water, the abundant Ca2+ reduced colloidal stability, the new Ca-containing
    minerals increased P sorption capacity, ultimately resulting in a decrease of
    Pcoll loss potential. Download : Download high-res image (508KB) Download : Download

    between treatments: *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01. EC: electrical conductivity. 3.4. Variation
    of pH/ionic strength contributed to restrict the colloidal P release Compared
    with the flooding treatment, alternating flooding and drying caused the opposite
    effect on soil pH and electrical conductivity (Fig. 2g and h). Dried soil decreased
    soil pH by 0.22 units from day 2 to day 8 and decreased soil pH by 0.48 units
    from day 12 to day 18, respectively. Kong and Lu (2022) explained the increase
    of soil acidity may be due to protons generated in Fe2+ oxidation during soil
    drainage. However, the redox potential of the overlying water was not less than
    100 mV in the present study (Fig. S4), which illustrated that Fe2+ oxidation may
    be not the major contributor for the decrease of pH value. Otherwise, the acidification
    may be attributed to nitrification. Since previous studies have shown a high total
    nitrogen content (1.52 g kg−1) in this calcareous soil (Yan et al., 2018), the
    role of nitrification in soil acidification was further confirmed. Another explanation
    for the decreased pH was that flooding inhibited mineralization of soil organic
    matter but promoted some low-molecular-weight organic acid accumulation (Shan
    et al., 2008). On the other hand, the reduction of pH was always accompanied by
    an increase of electrical conductivity, the latter increased by 14.5 times and
    8.6 times from day 2 to day 8 and from day 12 to day 18, respectively. Negative
    correlations between soil pH and electrical conductivity were also reported in
    previous studies (Nie et al., 2018). The enhanced ionic strength was probably
    because soil drying promoted the disruption of soil aggregates and increased the
    extractability of exchangeable cations (Buenemann et al., 2013). Previous studies
    have confirmed that the content of Pcoll is closely related to soil pH, ionic
    strength, colloid minerals and soil organic carbon (Liang et al., 2016; Liang
    et al., 2010). A positive correlation between Pcoll and soil pH and a negative
    correlation between Pcoll and electrical conductivity were also found in this
    study (Fig. 5a). Also, pH and electrical conductivity were the most important
    factors affecting Pcoll (Fig. 5b). Huang et al. (2016) suggested the effect of
    pH on Pcoll was evident, as pH decreased, positive charges on colloid surface
    increased, which suppressed the electric double layer between colloidal particles
    and promoted Pcoll aggregation. The decreased mobility of Pcoll was reported in
    salinized soils compared to the non-salinized soils by means of soil column leaching
    experiments (Zhang, 2008). 3.5. Environmental implications of transformation of
    colloidal P and truly dissolved P The significant transformation from Pcoll to
    truly dissolved P was found not only among different treatments but also during
    different incubation periods in the present study. Specifically, Pcoll gradually
    decreased in the control treatment and 80% of the decreased Pcoll converted into
    truly dissolved P during the incubation period (Fig. 1a). Similar trends were
    found during the flooding treatment and 90% of the decreased Pcoll converted into
    truly dissolved P (Fig. 1c). The truly dissolved P had a high mobility with soil
    moisture migration and could cause potential eutrophication to downstream water
    bodies (Pratiwi et al., 2016). The increased truly dissolved P coupled with the
    intense water management, such as the flooding irrigation and rainstorm, would
    generate higher P loss potential (Jiang et al., 2021). Previous studies have reported
    that the migration of Pcoll is usually accompanied by soil preferential flow,
    which could form and accelerate the loss of Pcoll even on conventional irrigation
    regimes (Kianpoor Kalkhajeh et al., 2021). Decreased Pcoll contents and proportions
    were found in the control and in the flooding treatment, which meant the Pcoll
    loss potential was decreased in this present study. In contrast, the Pcoll and
    truly dissolved P contents were both decreased in the alternating flooding and
    drying treatment (Fig. 1e). This could be attributed to the enhanced soil P retention
    capacity (colloidal aggregation and soil sorption capacity) and the transformation
    of Pcoll and truly dissolved P, and the P loss potential decreased in the alternating
    flooding and drying treatment. Above results confirm the theory that the truly
    dissolved P was an important fate of the decreased Pcoll and that the reduction
    of Pcoll content and proportion did not always mean the decrease in P loss potential.
    Potential P loss risk existed in the moist soil and would be intensified in the
    flooding condition, therefore, to reduce the P loss potential of these soils,
    the amended irrigation management consisting of filtration irrigation and drip
    irrigation, is essential in agriculture. The alternating flooding and drying events
    contributed to decrease the P loss risk and should be recommended as an important
    regulation measure to control of agricultural non-point pollution. However, the
    flooding and drying alternation should be appropriate and be evaluated based on
    the actual requirement to avoid potential environmental risk. 4. Conclusion A
    different water management regime consisting of alternating flooding and drying
    cycles significantly reduced the contents and the proportions of Pcoll compared
    with the control treatment or flooding condition. Drainage of the waterlogged
    calcareous alkaline soils decreased the soil pH and increased ionic strength,
    promoted the release of colloidal Ca and colloidal Mg and enhanced positive charges
    on colloid surfaces. The aggregation of Pcoll and increased P sorption capacity
    by newly formed Ca-containing minerals together resulted in the decrease of Pcoll
    contents and proportions. This study developed the Pcoll release mechanism upon
    alternating flooding and drying events and proposed a novel viewpoint that flooding
    and drying alternation could also decrease the P loss potential in a calcareous
    soil. The results show that appropriate water management decisions could achieve
    double benefits for water conservation and environmental management in vegetable
    fields. Practical-based flooding and subsequent drainage could be an effective
    agricultural practice to minimizing P loss potential from the intensive vegetable
    fields to downstream water. However, more research based on multiple field sites
    and multiple-year studies should be conducted before using the findings to support
    management decisions in alkaline calcareous soils. CRediT authorship contribution

  key_findings: '1) Alternating flooding and drying treatment significantly reduced
    the Pcoll content by 11.6%–88.0% (mean 67.6%) compared to the control treatment.

    2) The decrease of Pcoll was accompanied by an increase of truly dissolved P,
    suggesting the transformation of Pcoll to truly dissolved P under alternating
    flooding and drying cycles.

    3) Redundancy analysis and random forest modeling showed that colloidal calcium
    (Ca) and ionic strength in soil solutions had negative correlations with the Pcoll
    content, indicating the importance of Ca and ionic strength in determining the
    release of Pcoll.'
  limitations: The study was conducted in a greenhouse setting and may not fully represent
    field conditions. The authors did not investigate the long-term effects of alternating
    flooding and drying cycles on Pcoll release.
  main_objective: The main objective of the study was to investigate the dynamics
    of colloidal-bound phosphorus release as influenced by irrigation in alkaline
    calcareous soil and explore the role of Ca in determining the release of Pcoll.
  relevance_evaluation: The paper is highly relevant to my literature review on automated
    systems for real-time irrigation management. The paper presents an in-depth analysis
    of the dynamics of colloidal P release and explores the role of Ca in determining
    the release of Pcoll. The findings have important implications for developing
    strategies to mitigate Pcoll loss from agricultural soils, which aligns well with
    the goal of my review to identify effective practices for sustainable water management.

  description: The recent problems of Lake Urmia (LU) are caused by extensive and
    complex socio-ecological factors that require a comprehensive approach to consider
    the relationships between users and identify failure factors at the basin level.
    For this purpose, an agent-based simulation model of farmers’ social interactions
    and economic interests (ABM) with various support scenarios and random supervision
    and training by the government agent is developed to evaluate its impact on independent
    farmers’ decision-making in the form of a complex adaptive system. Finally, a
    fault tree analysis (FTA) is created in the Cara-FaultTree 4.1. software to identify
    scenarios that lead to the non-development technology in irrigation management
    (non-DTIM) in the LU sub-basin. The assessment of the impact of government supervision
    and training revealed that the main causes of non-DTIM in the LU basin are a lack
    of demands from farmers and low awareness among residents of the basin, with failure
    probabilities of 0.90 and 0.86, respectively. Ultimately, the failure probability
    of the main event (non-DTIM) was 0.50. The paths of proper training and farmers’
    requirements for sustainable agricultural water supply should become more stringent.
    The results confirm that appropriate measures to strengthen government supervision
    and training, as well as raise farmers’ awareness of the importance of long-term
    sustainability of water resources, can lead to greater resilience in the DTIM.

    keyboard_arrow_down     Browse Figures Versions Notes Abstract The recent problems
    of Lake Urmia (LU) are caused by extensive and complex socio-ecological factors
    that require a comprehensive approach to consider the relationships between users
    and identify failure factors at the basin level. For this purpose, an agent-based
    simulation model of farmers’ social interactions and economic interests (ABM)
    with various support scenarios and random supervision and training by the government
    agent is developed to evaluate its impact on independent farmers’ decision-making
    in the form of a complex adaptive system. Finally, a fault tree analysis (FTA)
    is created in the Cara-FaultTree 4.1. software to identify scenarios that lead
    to the non-development technology in irrigation management (non-DTIM) in the LU
    sub-basin. The assessment of the impact of government supervision and training
    revealed that the main causes of non-DTIM in the LU basin are a lack of demands
    from farmers and low awareness among residents of the basin, with failure probabilities
    of 0.90 and 0.86, respectively. Ultimately, the failure probability of the main
    event (non-DTIM) was 0.50. The paths of proper training and farmers’ requirements
    for sustainable agricultural water supply should become more stringent. The results
    confirm that appropriate measures to strengthen government supervision and training,
    as well as raise farmers’ awareness of the importance of long-term sustainability
    of water resources, can lead to greater resilience in the DTIM. Keywords: water
    resources; demand; risk; resilience; LU 1. Introduction The water crisis poses
    a serious threat to human life. The short-term perspective in managing risks,
    as well as the lack of transparency and unscientific planning, raise the possibility
    that the crisis will worsen and expand once it occurs [1,2]. It is, therefore,
    necessary to assess the catchment areas with a tool so that the right quality
    of required water can be provided. If financial resources are not made available
    within the schedule, there will be delays in the implementation of projects in
    the individual basin areas. The lack of community perspective in regional planning
    and the lack of codified laws in the watershed as well as the absence of a land-use
    plan are among the main reasons for the emergence of a critical situation in the
    basin [3]. With population increase, climate variability, and its numerous problems,
    watersheds have become less important and are facing various threats. Therefore,
    the possibility of the occurrence of an undesirable phenomenon (risk) and systematic
    efforts to determine and manage the threats and hazards through risk identification
    and analysis are proposed [4]. This objective requires accurate identification
    of catchment problems and risks. A comprehensive and accurate identification of
    risks and the determination of the effectiveness of system failure concerning
    each of these risks may require the provision of accurate and effective solutions
    to improve the status of the water resources of the basins [5]. In recent years,
    the LU basin has faced many problems in terms of a lack of water resources and
    economic and social damage. A comprehensive approach to assessing the performance
    of catchments can reduce their vulnerability in critical situations and focus
    on the most vulnerable points [6,7,8]. The purpose of the risk analysis of the
    total failure of a watershed is to assess and identify all threat factors regarding
    the amount of available water; the environmental, economic, and social water quality
    of the basin; and the impossibility of its provision [9]. On the other hand, the
    cross-sectional approach to dealing with risks and the lack of transparency in
    planning increases the risks caused by risks and harbors the possibility of aggravation
    and expansion of the crisis after it occurs [10]. Accurate knowledge of the basin,
    the elimination of human and natural destructive factors, and the need to apply
    novel approaches to risk analysis are the keys to success in improving and preventing
    possible risks in basins. Compared to water resource use studies with high costs
    and difficulties, simulation-based modeling offers an alternative method [11].
    Many water resource models were proposed to describe population dynamics, which
    are mainly divided into two types, namely, microscopic and macroscopic models
    [12]. Microscopic models, including the social force model (SF model) [13], the
    cellular automata model (CA model) [14,15], and the agent-based model (ABM) [16],
    can describe individual behavior more accurately and come closer to reality. Among
    these models, agent-based models have made significant progress in recent years.
    ABMs have improved the processing speed of computers. ABM can simulate a variety
    of “agents” that may have rudimentary artificial intelligence to make decisions.
    Each agent can have a unique set of behavioral rules that allow modeling heterogeneity
    in the population [17,18]. In recent years, ABM models have been developed for
    water resources management [19,20]. ABMs have the potential to significantly improve
    the design of stringent regulations and incentives for water resources management
    [21]. Nhim et al. [22] concluded that ABM models are a powerful tool for studying
    how socioeconomic and environmental changes affect the human use of water resources.
    Pouladi et al. [23] reported that farmers’ performance and willingness to engage
    in LU restoration could be simulated by integrating ABM into the socio-hydrological
    framework. Ohab-Yazdi and Ahmadi [24] showed that the regional water organization’s
    relevant interactions with other stakeholders led to the control of illegal water
    extraction and the rise of water levels in aquifers. Anbari et al. [25] concluded
    that through government-sponsored programs it is possible to offset about 23%
    of the negative balance of the aquifer within 13 years. Lang and Ertsen [26] investigated
    the interaction between human and non-human agents in an irrigation system. The
    results showed that the Irrigation-Related Agent-Based Model (IRABM) offers a
    new perspective in modeling the human–water system. Okura et al. [27] studied
    irrigation management using the ABM model and game theory. The results showed
    that social changes can accelerate farmers’ non-cooperative behavior. Shoushtarian
    et al. [28] developed an ABM model to simulate agricultural water use and socio-hydrological
    dynamics of California. The results showed that ABM helps to evaluate current
    water reuse management practices in terms of sustainability of water resources.
    Streefkerk et al. [29] presented a dynamic adaptive drought modeling model in
    Kenya that combines socio-hydrological modeling and ABM approaches. The results
    showed that the absorption of drought adaptation affects soil moisture, groundwater,
    and drought propagation. Mirzaei et al. [30] concluded that for the implementation
    of the water–energy–food nexus model in the water-stressed region, the policy
    of using advanced irrigation technologies under the government’s support scenarios
    is necessary. Previous studies on water resource utilization mainly focused on
    farmer behavior and water resource modeling and optimization. There is a knowledge
    gap regarding the use of information from ABM modeling in decision-making that
    improves safety. To fill this gap, this study aims to adopt ABM modeling and further
    develop a fault tree analysis (FTA) method to identify scenarios that lead to
    non-DTIM in the LU sub-basin. FTA is a decision tree structure based on a graphical
    method to represent the logical cause of failure [31]. The purpose of the FTA
    is generally to control risk, the worst-case event is considered the top event,
    and then the various failures that can lead to the top event are determined through
    top-down layer-wise logical analysis. These disturbance events are distributed
    layer by layer in the form of a tree structure. To this end, a case study in the
    LU sub-basin in the Miandoab Plain was used as an example to demonstrate the methodology.
    The increase in the area under water cultivation, the decrease in rainfall, the
    low efficiency of agricultural irrigation, and the lack of an allocation of sufficient
    water to meet the biological needs of the leading rivers are considered to be
    the most important factors aggravating the crisis and dryness of LU. In addition,
    traditional agriculture is one of the reasons for the drying up of LU after the
    decrease in rainfall. The change from traditional to advanced agriculture is of
    particular importance due to the drying up of LU. Therefore, risk indicators need
    to be provided for risk management and improvement of this catchment area. This
    paradigm can be used for any watershed to identify critical paths and prevent
    the inappropriate use of water resources. The developed free trade agreement provides
    water resource managers with a basis for formulating water resource use plans
    to avoid the catastrophic consequences of water scarcity in catchment areas. According
    to the mentioned main goals, in the present study, an ABM simulation model of
    social interactions and economic interests of farmer agents, along with different
    scenarios of support policies as well as random supervision and training by the
    government agent to evaluate its impact on the decision-making of independent
    farmers in the form of a complex adaptive system, is presented. Next, by using
    FTA, the scenarios that led to the non-development technology in irrigation management
    (non-DTIM) in the Lake Urmia basin were identified. In this regard, there are
    fundamental questions and hypotheses, such as what are the main reasons and factors
    for solving the non-DTIM in the Lake Urmia basin? The use of ABM and FTA models
    based on the identification of various factors and their interactions is effective
    in identifying the reasons for the non-DTIM. The answers to the questions mentioned
    as the main goals are necessary for the purposeful design of the road map for
    the DTIM in the LU sub-basin and the achievement of its goals. Regardless of the
    mentioned cases, the implementation of water consumption management programs is
    not only accompanied by many uncertainties from the point of view of their effectiveness
    but will also entail huge costs. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. LU The LU basin
    in northwestern Iran is one of the main basins of Iran, with an area of 51,876
    km2. LU is the largest inland lake in Iran and one of the most valuable aquatic
    ecosystems in Iran and the world [32]. The downward trend of the water level of
    LU began in 1995, and in 20 years, the lake level has dropped by more than 8 m.
    As a result, the remainder of more than 30 billion cubic meters of LU’s water
    volume has been lost due to evaporation and lack of annual rainfall. Due to LU’s
    location in a closed basin, precipitation and runoff are considered sources of
    water input into the lake, and evaporation is considered water discharge [32].
    The two main causes of LU drying are (1) excessive extraction of renewable water
    resources and unbalanced development in the LU basin (human factors, 69%) and
    (2) climate change (18%) and persistent drought (natural factors) [33]. Improved
    living conditions and higher incomes of farmers were the main reasons for the
    expansion of cultivated area and increase in water consumption in the LU basin
    due to human factors. The expansion of the cultivated area and increased water
    consumption created a crisis in LU that is making life more and more difficult
    for the population living there [33]. 2.2. Miandoab Plain The Miandoab Plain lies
    in the southern part of LU (Figure 1). The geographical coordinates of Miandoab
    are 45°43′ N, 36°46′ E, and its altitude is 1292 m above sea level [34]. The average
    annual rainfall is 296 mm, and the average humidity is 53%. The average annual
    and minimum temperatures are 11.8 °C and −3 °C, respectively [34]. In the Miandoab
    Plain, half of the surface flows flow into LU and 20% of the total groundwater.
    Zarineh Roud and Simineh Roud are the main sources of Miandoab Plain surface water
    discharged into LU [35]. The Zarineh Roud and Simineh Roud basins comprise the
    largest sub-basin of the LU basin (34% of the total LU basin area). In recent
    years, the function of securing the rights of LU has been lost due to the development
    of exploitation of surface water resources of these rivers. Figure 1. Geographical
    location of Miandoab Plain (https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/about-arcgis/overview,
    8 March 2022). 2.3. Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) Agent-based models (ABMs) are a
    popular tool in today’s computing environment for simulating the collective outcomes
    of individual behavior in complex systems. These models are based on the idea
    that interactions between autonomous and independent agents shape the behavior
    of a system rather than just focusing on the system’s internal variables [36].
    ABMs allow for variation and interactions between individual factors to be taken
    into account by returning the focus to the agents themselves, resulting in a more
    accurate and realistic representation of the system’s behavior. ABMs are particularly
    useful in modeling complex systems whose behavior is difficult to predict due
    to the relationships, competition, and interdependencies between their components
    or between the system and its environment. Using these models, researchers can
    capture the patterns and structures that emerge from, rather than those that are
    dictated by, the interactions of individual actors or the emergent properties
    of the system (Figure 2). Additionally, ABMs enable agents to make decisions by
    considering the concepts of adaptive learning and intelligence [37]. Figure 2.
    Design of the ABM model. 2.4. Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) The FTA includes building
    a fault tree, entering the fault probabilities of the base events, distributing
    the fault probabilities to determine the probability of the main event, and determining
    the intersections [38]. When a shear set occurs simultaneously as a group of initiators,
    the main event occurs. The first step in FTA analysis is to gain a complete and
    accurate understanding of the system. Accurate and detailed information, including
    system components, physical and functional interactions between components, and
    normal and abnormal conditions, can be obtained from various sources, such as
    reviewing maps, diagrams, instruction manuals, maintenance methods, and interviews
    with experts. Gates defines the logic in the fault tree and links base events
    to intermediate and main events (Figure 3). If the main event results from the
    simultaneous failure of two events or at least one of the events results in the
    failure of a higher event, AND or OR gates are used [39]. Figure 3. Schematic
    of FTA. 3. Methodology 3.1. Designed ABM Model The ABM model aims to replicate
    farmers’ ability to adapt to new DTIM (development technologies in irrigation
    management). In this model, there are two groups of farmers and government officials.
    Farmers with low DTIM-WP, regardless of their experience, seek financial benefits
    and cheaper production and irrigation costs. Looking for long-term strategic goals
    to maintain the sustainability of water resources on behalf of the government.
    To encourage farmers to use DTIM, the government offers incentives, in this case,
    subsidies. It also serves as a tool for tracking farmer productivity and training.
    Currently, water resources are used by farmers to achieve short-term benefits
    through irrigation systems and different levels of technology. Farmers adjust
    the current plan based on a cost–benefit analysis, their desire to increase WP,
    and their understanding of the importance of DTIM. DTIM charges costs for the
    initial setup. Government subsidies can be used by any farmer to increase WP.
    If no farmer makes optimal use of available water resources, long-term access
    to these resources is at risk. If this is the case, farmers consider this an ad
    hoc expense. By increasing the allocation of government subsidies, it is possible
    to motivate farmers to increase their profits. To achieve this, the government
    can rely on assessment teams equipped with DTIM training to offer help and support
    to farmers. As part of the government’s assessment process, monitoring farmers’
    behavior is crucial. However, it is important to note that farmers who benefit
    from the sale of an improved irrigation system may no longer be eligible for certain
    government programs and future subsidies. The government has the power to strengthen
    the integrity of farmers through these assessments. Furthermore, to create an
    effective framework for DTIM in the Moandoab region, government policies are evaluated
    using the ABM model. For this purpose, NetLogo 6.2.2. is used, a software that
    simulates various phenomena and has a user-friendly interface. The use of NetLogo
    6.2.2., programmed in Java, offers further advantages to the decision model used
    in this study [40,41]. 3.2. Model Description 3.2.1. Farmer Agent The decision-making
    power of the government and the changing characteristics and behaviors of a group
    of farmers are presented in the ABM model as the two most important and powerful
    players in the use of technology to maximize irrigation management in the LU Basin.
    ABM helps clarify the complex adaptive system of individual farmers’ decisions
    in response to government policies as well as interactions with other farmers
    and the environment. The farmer agent receives subsidies from the government (acting
    as an agent of the Ministry of Water and Agriculture) to increase WP through DTIM.
    The agent-based adaptability model of farmers in DTIM is schematically shown in
    Figure 4. Figure 4. Agents’ interactions with the environment and one another
    at different levels. The inputs that the proposed framework gathers include job
    preference, academic education level, age, size of agricultural farm, coordinates,
    and distances. These data are used to calculate the entrepreneurship index (entrepre),
    which indicates each farmer’s potential for developing an irrigation system. The
    various degrees of the efficacy of the aforementioned elements in determining
    the entrepre index are displayed in Table 1. As model inputs, the amount of farmers’
    expenses and profits, as well as DTIM costs, have been estimated. Farmers are
    dispersed throughout the modeling industry. Every farmer has social ties to neighbors
    with whom they can exchange experiences. They are impacted by government policies
    in the model environment, which includes education and monitoring programs, government
    subsidies for irrigation system improvements, and weather- or decision-making-related
    uncertainties. Table 1. The effectiveness of the components in calculating the
    entrepre index. It is assumed that farmers who do not have the proper level of
    WP can make decisions for DTIM. One of the considered triggers is the propensity
    of farmers to DTIM (prop). The minimum value of the prop trigger (prop.min) is
    defined as follows: 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝.min= (𝛼 𝑠𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑒)+(𝛽 𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑝𝑟𝑒) (𝛼+𝛽) (1) where α and β express
    the effect of farm scale and the farmer’s entrepreneurship on the initial propensity
    to DTIM, respectively. To make decisions, farmers can weigh the costs and benefits
    of their options, consider past performance, and consider the costs of sustainable
    water supply (SWS). In this study, it is assumed that the challenge of SWS in
    the long term is such that if farmers do not take action to correct the existing
    process of using water resources, this possibility is seriously threatened. Considering
    this issue, the non-participation of farmers in upgrading the irrigation system
    is regarded as a cost. This cost will decrease with the participation of more
    farmers in improving irrigation productivity (SWR). SWR is calculated as follows:
    𝑆𝑊𝑅= 6×𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡 𝑓𝑎𝑟𝑚𝑒𝑟 𝑠 6 ∑ 𝑖=1 6 𝑖𝑟 𝑟 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑠 ×𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡 𝑓𝑎𝑟𝑚𝑒 𝑟 𝑖𝑟 𝑟 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑠 (2) Farmers
    typically leverage their desire for DTIM and honesty when using government subsidies
    as a trigger for decision-making. Farmers’ decisions are influenced by the amount
    of these stimuli and vice versa. The ABM model then undergoes a sufficient number
    of iterations in different scenarios and the resulting results of the model are
    then statistically analyzed. The mean ratio of DTIM, the mean speed of DTIM, the
    field application efficiency (FAE), and government expenditure (which are taken
    into account in the number of cases of granting subsidies) are among the results
    that are considered consistent with the main objectives of the study. 3.2.2. Government
    Agent The main goal of the government agent is to improve WP. Assuming that crop
    yields rise or stay at the same level, the government agent is attempting to persuade
    the farmer agent to DTIM. The main defenders of the WP in the agriculture sector,
    incentive policies, have been taken into consideration by the government. One
    of the policies taken into consideration in this area is providing DTIM with subsidies.
    Through subsidies, the government hopes to persuade farmers to raise WP. Additionally,
    the government can lessen DTIM issues and contribute to an increase in WP and
    crop yield by considering monitoring and training teams. Farmers become more honest
    and there is less misuse of the facilities provided by the government when it
    is monitored. Increasing WP in the study area is one of the government’s top priorities
    in this investigation. Consequently, irrigation efficiency is assessed using the
    FAE index in the manner described as follows: 𝐹𝐴𝐸= ∑ 𝑖=1 6 𝑖𝑟 𝑟 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑠=1  𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡
    𝑓𝑎𝑟𝑚𝑒 𝑟 𝑖𝑟 𝑟 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑠 (𝑟×𝑒𝑓 𝑓 𝑖𝑟 𝑟 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑠 ×(1−𝑟) 𝜌) ∑ 𝑖=1 6 𝑖𝑟 𝑟 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑠=1  𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡
    𝑓𝑎𝑟𝑚𝑒 𝑟 𝑖𝑟 𝑟 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑠 (3) where 𝑒𝑓 𝑓 𝑖𝑟 𝑟 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑠 is the amount of expected WP in
    different irrigation systems, which is estimated as follows (Table 2) [42]. Table
    2. Expected WP in different irrigation systems. The government’s achievement in
    raising the FAE index’s value can be attributed to one of the most important factors.
    Thus, in the complex socio-environmental system under study, the government’s
    best policies have the potential to either improve this index or accelerate its
    advancement. The effects of these incentive policies are assessed in the ABM model
    using various scenarios. To this end, the influence of governmental policies on
    the outcomes is assessed. Farmers may be encouraged to make money if government
    subsidies are increased in proportion. Thus, by taking the assessment teams at
    various levels with DTIM education into consideration, the government can aid
    in raising farmers’ profits. One aspect of government assessments is keeping an
    eye on farmers’ conduct. Farmers risk losing access to certain government services
    and the chance to reapply for subsidies if they profit from the sale of their
    upgraded irrigation system. Evaluations: The government can make farmers more
    truthful. The government policies are then assessed using the ABM model to provide
    a framework that works for the management of water resources in the Miandoab region.
    The parameters of the ABM model are calibrated using the investigated data and
    field studies and are presented in Table 3. Table 3. Range of ABM model parameters.
    3.2.3. Questionnaire Investigation To define scenarios and identify stakeholders,
    questionnaires and specialized interviews were employed. The sample size of the
    interview was 72. Interviews with a range of relevant parties were undertaken
    in the Miandoab Plain, including farmers, the Ministry of Agriculture (15 agents),
    managers and specialists of local water organizations (15 agents). The validity
    of the interview findings was confirmed when the researcher’s self-review method
    and member control were applied to the gathered interviews. ABMs have apparent
    validity if an expert (group of experts) related to the subject confirms the quality
    of the simulation results by real-world phenomena. This is performed by taking
    into account outputs such as the trend of area change under different irrigation
    methods and the trend of economic profit at micro and macro levels, and it is
    compared with the actual situation of the studied area according to the opinions
    of experienced experts. To guarantee the reliability of the interviews, convergent
    interviews were employed. To achieve this, model attributes and input factors—a
    variety of social and environmental factors—that influence farmers’ adjustment
    to DTIM were first arranged. Next, every environmental and social component is
    understood to form the ABM model. Finally, a statistical analysis is used to assess
    the components and policies that have an impact on the outcomes. The developed
    ABM model is applied for 100 years at the time step of a half-crop season. The
    model considers 42 farmer agents. Drip and sprinkler irrigation are two common
    examples of both traditional and advanced irrigation techniques that are taken
    into consideration. The sub-model for figuring out the farmers’ economic spending
    was taken into consideration because of how crucial the economic factor is to
    the farmer’s agent decision-making. The price of planting and harvesting crops,
    the cost of installing irrigation systems, and the cost of fertilizers and seeds,
    labor costs for manual labor, water pumps, etc., were computed. 3.3. Compilation
    of the FTA of LU Sub-Basin The FTA model was created to quantify and evaluate
    different scenarios of non-DTIM of LU sub-basin. The probability of failure of
    basic events is estimated quantitatively and qualitatively based on recorded records.
    After estimating the failure probability of basic events, AND and OR gates are
    calculated as follows: 𝑃= ∏ 𝑖=1 𝑛 𝑃 𝑖 (4) 𝑃=1− ∏ 𝑖=1 𝑛 (1− 𝑃 𝑖 ) (5) where P is
    the probability of each basic event, Pi is the value of the failure probability
    of the ith basic event, i is the counter, and n is the number of input events
    connected to the gate. The impact (contribution) of basic events on the main event
    is calculated as follows: 𝐼 𝑥 = ∑ 𝑈 𝑥 𝑈 𝑠 (6) where Ix is the importance of the
    basic event x in creating the main event, ∑ 𝑈 𝑥 is the sum of the error percentages
    of the cuts in which the event x is present, and 𝑈 𝑠 shows the probability of
    the main event. If the failure probability of the main event is satisfactory,
    the FTA analysis ends. If the FTA analysis is not satisfactory, it is necessary
    to reduce the failure probability of the main event and take corrective actions.
    A total of 18 parameters were identified as the basic event for non-DTIM risk
    assessment in the LU sub-basin. Table 4 shows the basic events according to their
    performance type. Table 4. Basic events of the FTA of LU basin. The flowchart
    of the study process is presented in Figure 5. Figure 5. Flowchart of the study
    process. 4. Results and Discussion The suggested scenarios, which include 64,800
    states, have been combined and run 100 times apiece in the model with 100 time
    periods to implement the suggested model. By using balanced variance analysis,
    each of these scenarios was examined. The factors influencing farmers’ adaptation
    to DTIM were examined using balanced variance analysis and Minitab 16.2 software.
    Table 5, Table 6, Table 7 and Table 8 and Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8 and Figure
    9 show average WP indicators (SWR, FAE), average propensity threshold (mean.prop),
    and honesty threshold (mean.honesty). Figure 6. The effect of input indicators
    on the mean.prop. Figure 7. The effect of input indicators on the amount of mean.honesty.
    Figure 8. The effect of input parameters on SWR. Figure 9. The effect of input
    indicators on the amount of FAE. Table 5. Balanced variance analysis for mean.prop.
    Table 6. Balanced variance analysis for mean.honesty. Table 7. Balanced variance
    analysis for SWR. Table 8. Balanced variance analysis for FAE. Thus, uncertainty
    (random change of the system due to climate and agent behavior patterns), SWS,
    subsidy policy, government supervision, and training are the most effective indicators
    of the farmer agent’s propensity to DTIM (p-value = 0.0 at the confidence level
    of 95%). The most significant predictors of the farmer agent’s inclination to
    DTIM are SWS, government supervision, and training, with F-values of 4375.59 and
    1055.10, respectively. The farmer agent’s propensity to DTIM is least affected
    by the seed-owner and seed-ratio indices. The mean.prop index barely changes as
    a result of the initial population. As a result, different inputs influence the
    agents’ subjective propensity in the DTIM. The appointment, potential for ideal
    local management, and involvement of the farmer agent are all facilitated by their
    involvement in the management of water resources [43,44,45,46]. Participation
    and awareness foster the desire for DTIM. Government subsidies and cost reductions
    have a significant impact on farmers’ adoption of DTIM [47,48]. The most significant
    parameters on the SWR index are random change (r), SWS, government supervision,
    and training, with p-value = 0.0 at a 95% confidence level. The SWR index is independent
    of the initial population’s seed-ratio, seed-owner, and network-density. The crop
    yield and WP are greatly influenced by the indicators of SWS, government supervision,
    and training. The F-values for SWS and government supervision are 1729.93 and
    1441.14, respectively. The presence of government supervision and training is
    crucial for improving WP and taking advantage of government subsidies. This also
    affects the integrity threshold and the propensity of farmer agents. The effective
    supervision and management of irrigation systems play a significant role in increasing
    both the physical and economic WP as well as crop yield, which aligns with the
    findings of previous studies [49]. Uncertainty, SWS, government supervision, and
    training are the most effective indicators at the 95% confidence level on FAE
    (p-value = 0.0). Consistent with the findings of the present study, optimal irrigation
    systems coupled with sufficient government supervision and training will raise
    FAE and crop yield [50]. The water resource conditions in the LU basin state that
    the WP can be improved through training and monitoring of the irrigation system
    [34,51,52]. All inputs and production must be provided continuously, and farmers’
    representatives must be continuously supersized and trained by the government
    in the management, maintenance, and operation of field irrigation systems [53].
    4.1. Risk of Failure of LU Sub-Basin In Table 9, the failure probability of the
    basic events was calculated based on the specific statistics of the LU sub-basin
    and entered as input into the Cara-FaultTree 4.1. software. In this study, Cara-FaultTree
    software was used for the complete graphical representation of the overall risk
    of the basin due to the unique features and simplicity of the environment. Table
    9. Ranking of basic events effective in non-DTIM in LU sub-basin. 4.2. Measure
    the Importance of Basic Events 4.2.1. Lack of Accurate Planning in Water Supply
    and Demand The average amount of water consumed in the short-term period of the
    LU basin, in excess of the virtual upper limit of surface water in the agricultural
    sector, and the amount of surface water consumed in the long-term normal in the
    agricultural sector are 3600 MCM and 2370 MCM, respectively. The average amount
    of water consumed in agriculture in the short-term period of the LU basin in excess
    of the virtual limit of groundwater and the amount of groundwater consumed in
    agriculture in the long-term in the normal state is 1756 MCM and 1580 MCM, respectively.
    The event failure probability value is calculated as follows: P (A24) = 0.51 Surface
    water (7) P (A24) = 0.11 Ground water (8) 4.2.2. Unreasonable Economic Value of
    Water The low economic value of water in the LU basin is caused by the low price
    of water. The low price of water causes an excessive increase in water in the
    agricultural sector and leads to economic failure. The probability of an inappropriate
    water price failure is calculated as follows: 4.2.3. Destructive Water Transfer
    Systems Protecting and conserving water in irrigation and drainage networks should
    be considered one of the cost-effective solutions in water projects. Therefore,
    the destructive water transfer system may lead to economic failure in the LU basin.
    The failure caused by this event is similar to the water loss event along the
    transmission path and is calculated as follows: P (A11) = 0.30 (9) In Figure 10a,b
    and Figure 11a–d, the probability of the main event is determined based on the
    probability assigned to the basic events. Indiscriminate water abstraction, dam
    construction, land-use changes, non-compliance with environmental rights for water,
    increased CO2 emissions, low WP, and social and economic conditions are among
    the important intermediate factors for the failure of the Urmia Lake basin due
    to human factors. Climate changes (floods, droughts) are important natural factors
    for reducing water resources in the LU sub-basin. Figure 10. (a,b) FTA under LU
    basin failure—caused by natural factors. Figure 11. (a–e) FTA under LU basin—failure
    caused by human factors. In Table 9, the ranking of basic events effective in
    the non-DTIM of LU sub-basin was calculated. According to Table 9, the basic events
    are sorted in descending order by the greatest impact on the vertex event. The
    higher the value of the Ix index, the more important the basic event is in the
    vertex event. The results show that the low awareness of the basin residents and
    the lack of demands of farmers are the most important failure factors in the LU
    basin, with a failure probability of 0.86 and 0.90, respectively. Finally, the
    probability of failure of the main event (non-DTIM in the LU sub-basin) was 0.50.
    The quantity and quality of water resources in the LU can be considered the most
    important factors affecting the sustainability of its ecological function. However,
    both factors are influenced by human activities, particularly the increase in
    cultivated area and the development of irrigation in the upstream sections of
    this basin. Increasing water use along with the implementation of agricultural
    development plans will reduce the quantity and quality of water entering the LU
    basin. In recent years, the lack of environmental protection measures in the LU
    basin has led to the disappearance of rare species. In addition, the events of
    a lack of sufficient training, insufficient knowledge, and management of irrigation
    systems have a significant impact on the lack of non-DTIM in the LU sub-basin.
    The participation of users in decision-making and the development of coordination
    between different organizations in water resources management are the most important
    parameters in the sustainable management of agricultural water resources. Participatory
    and centralization events were identified as key components in water resources
    management, which is consistent with the results of the present study [54,55,56,57],
    Farmers’ communities are the first trustees of water resources in the LU sub-basin,
    which is highly dependent on water resources. The lack of water resources in the
    LU sub-basin causes the loss of economic activities and disrupts the biological
    balance. These results are consistent with the studies of [23,58]. These studies
    also emphasize the participation and role of farmers in the management and exploitation
    of water resources. Governance and its effectiveness, which correspond to the
    development and management of surface and underground water resources, were introduced
    as intermediate events dependent on other events. The results of this study are
    consistent with the findings of [59,60]. The farming community is the primary
    manager of water resources in the LU sub-basin, which is highly dependent on water
    resources. The lack of water resources in the LU sub-basin leads to the loss of
    economic activities and disrupts the biological balance. These results are consistent
    with the studies by [58] that emphasize the participation and role of farmers
    in the management and use of water resources. Governance and its effectiveness
    corresponding to the development and management of surface and groundwater resources
    were introduced as intermediate events dependent on other events. The results
    of this study are consistent with the findings of [59,60]. The government is an
    influential player in decision-making on LU restoration programs. In addition
    to government supervision and training, stakeholders must be empowered to implement
    the prescribed programs (e.g., reducing water consumption) and revitalize LU.
    However, this local-level approach has not yielded success in structuring the
    requirements for the implementation of LU restoration programs. In other words,
    restoring LU is not the concern of stakeholders, and the government is failing
    to build consensus, achieve user satisfaction and participation, create alternative
    value for water, and awareness and knowledge of upgrading society and getting
    to know the real problems and creating solutions for the restoration of LU. Furthermore,
    farmers, as key beneficiaries, view the restoration of LU as a form of governance
    and show a desire to achieve this goal. The government’s performance in sensitizing
    the farming community has been weak, and the politically motivated messages tended
    to play a destructive role. A key factor in the failure was the avoidance of government
    and stakeholder involvement, as well as inadequate internal and cross-border management
    in the LU basin caused by centralized legislation, multiple decision-making centers,
    and inaccurate planning of water supply and demand. The creation of integrated
    management based on a comprehensive law and plan is the most effective strategy
    in this area to achieve the sustainable development of the LU basin. Managing
    the LU basin in an integrated manner that balances regional function and farmers’
    empowerment can achieve the government’s policy objectives. Due to the lack of
    “implementation-feedback-learning” mechanisms, the government has not taken advantage
    of the impending obstacles to learn from and achieve success. In this way, when
    faced with many problems, instead of finding solutions, it erased them instead
    of solving them. For example, the strategy to reduce water consumption from dams
    for use in this sector by 40% was gradually replaced by a 40% reduction in water
    consumption in the agricultural sector, which has a significantly smaller impact
    on water supplies than initially expected. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen
    and develop educational and promotional activities in the Urmia Lake basin to
    improve farmers’ attitudes and self-efficacy and expand their knowledge and skills
    in using irrigation systems. Studies show that there is a positive relationship
    between extension calls, use of communication channels, social participation,
    and technical knowledge of farmers and their attitude towards the use of irrigation
    systems [61,62]. Studies show that there are problems in the LU basin, such as
    that the government is at the center of the problem, has a technical view, and
    is satisfied with the cross-sectional results, and that there is no real goal
    that can be achieved with the government’s results consistent with the present
    study [58,59]. Training farmers in the LU basin about the consequences of lake
    drying and involving local communities in the restoration process can be successful.
    To achieve the goals and implement the plans to restore LU, farmers’ trust in
    the government is crucial. Traditional agriculture in the LU basin is not profitable
    despite the region’s high water consumption. Plans to restore LU demonstrate the
    importance of farmers in the restoration and provide an opportunity for development
    and sustainable agriculture in the LU basin. By using training tools to improve
    LU’s water resources and revitalize the lake, farmers can contribute to the engagement
    of surrounding communities. By allocating funds and implementing construction
    projects and policies, the government has taken measures to revitalize LU. However,
    to reduce water consumption in LU, experts and advocates must work together to
    promote local culture, awareness, and engagement. The management and control of
    the LU basin depend heavily on the residents’ awareness of the values of the basin
    and the threats to its further development [7,59,62]. To prevent the collapse
    of the LU basin, one of the main objectives is to raise awareness among farmers.
    To achieve this, the government needs to strengthen its capacity [63]. A similar
    study concluded that the lack of community perspective in regional planning, the
    development and lack of codified laws in the basins, the absence of land-use plans,
    and the lack of sufficient information for the residents of the basin are the
    most important reasons for social failure. This is consistent with the results
    of the present study [9]. 4.3. Analysis of the Proposed Methods In socio-ecological
    systems, there are a variety of complexities, including dynamics, feedback and
    heterogeneity, and a lack of proper understanding of the complexities in these
    systems leads to failure in good water governance. However, technical models are
    needed to understand the behavior of water resources and provide useful information
    about the current situation. In order to have a correct approach to the process
    of water governance, a correct understanding of the attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors
    of the stakeholders is required. One of the approaches that has been widely noticed
    in recent years for the study of complex systems is the ABM and FTA approaches.
    These approaches were introduced as effective tools for cooperative management,
    designing effective strategies, and water resources management policies. By using
    this approach while modeling the behavior of different stakeholders and the relationships
    and interactions between them and with the environment and with the dynamic participation
    of individual, group, and institutional stakeholders in the modeling process,
    it is possible to make correct decisions with appropriate implementation support.
    The framework developed in this study is used to understand the characteristics,
    behaviors, and interactions of effective factors in the process of system changes.
    In addition, system analysis in such a framework provides a better understanding
    of the structures of complex systems to support decision-making under conditions
    of uncertainty in a collaborative process. In the aforementioned cooperative approach,
    while gaining a more accurate understanding of the components, patterns, and connections
    of the studied system by attracting the cooperation and willingness of the stakeholders,
    better solutions can be achieved in the decision-making process. Implementing
    the developed framework in more case studies with different conditions can lead
    to the production of more comprehensive guidelines for issues such as cooperative
    management at the country level while processing the process of stakeholder analysis.
    This issue will be fruitful in defining the procedures of water governance according
    to different social, economic, and environmental conditions in the wide area of
    Iran. Although the majority of water consumption in the catchment area of Lake
    Urmia is related to the agricultural sector, to complete the developed framework,
    especially in the areas where the drinking and industrial sectors are influential
    consumers, their goals, characteristics, and behavioral patterns were evaluated.
    The relevant factors and interactions should be added to the model. One of the
    problems and complexities in modeling social systems is the existence of human
    agents who potentially have irrational behaviors and complex psychological characteristics—in
    other words, factors that make quantification, calibration, and validation difficult.
    Although this issue is a main source of problems in providing simulation outputs,
    in most cases, the only model that can challenge these conditions is the ABM and
    FTA models. To develop the presented framework, the integrated exploitation model
    of surface and underground water can be considered as the environment of the ABM
    model. The use of more accurate agricultural economic models can have a significant
    effect in matching the results with the existing reality. In this study, the effects
    of climate change in the future have been ignored and only sensitivity analysis
    on climate change has been considered. In future research, the effect of different
    scenarios of climate change in the process of changing the behavior of the agents
    and policy-making according to these changes can be considered. 5. Conclusions
    The problems of the LU basin are related to extensive and complex factors, which
    require a comprehensive approach to identify failure factors at the basin level.
    The search for a general index that covers the general risks of the LU basin to
    various aspects of water resource scarcity and environmental, economic, and social
    situations will lead to sufficient knowledge and mastery. Using the ABM model
    as a basis, farmers’ social interactions and financial gains from government subsidies
    could be simulated. The purpose of the FTA was to set out the sequence of events
    that could lead to the depletion of water resources in the LU basin. The findings
    demonstrated that, at a 95% confidence level, random change, SWS, subsidy policy,
    and government supervision and training are the most reliable measures of farmers’
    willingness and participation in adapting to the DTIM. A key factor in raising
    WP is government supervision and training. According to the basic event ranking,
    the main reasons for failures in the LU basin are low awareness among residents
    of the basin and lack of demands from farmers, with failure probabilities of 0.86
    and 0.90, respectively. In the end, the main event had a probability of failure
    of 0.50. The inadequate social structure at LU is the main cause of the existing
    catastrophic situation. The key to maximizing the use of the LU basin’s water
    resources is to demand awareness and participation of the basin residents. Other
    sub-basins can benefit from an improved situation by mimicking the fault tree
    structure of the LU basin. As a suggestion for future direction, the methodology
    used in this study should be extended to other sub-basins of LU over different
    periods, considering how productivity and development plans may alter the demonstrated
    risk index. Author Contributions Conceptualization, S.E.; methodology, H.D.; software,

  description: Farmers try to follow their experience in farming. They will not be
    aware of the changes that happens in the environment that directly affect the
    profit as well as the outcome from the farm field. The adoption of smart technologies
    in farming helps the farmers to utilize resources efficiently. The important resource
    of farming is water. The consumption of water should be frugal enough to regulate
    the water supply. The incompetent way of irrigation results in water wastage.
    Therefore, implementing IoT-enabled WSN techniques allows to moderate the irrigation
    system known as smart farming or smart agriculture. The smart irrigation system
    helps to efficiently use the water resource in farming. Sensors are deployed to
    sense environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity and soil moisture
    content. The continuous sensed data will be processed and sent to farmers. Based
    on the data received, farmers decide the water supply to the farm field. Injecting
    false or incorrect data results in overwatering or under-watering that affects
    the yield of the farm field directly. Detection of such false data is accomplished
    using two phases of classification. The two phases of classifications implemented
    in the proposed scheme are machine learning techniques and fault detection algorithm
    (FDA). The data that are classified as non-anomalous from the first phase of classification
    are subjected to the second phase that is FDA. This two-phase of classification
    concludes that the data received are non-anomalous. This entire classification
    process is done at the base station (BS). The data that are detected as anomalous
    either at the first phase or at the second phase are dropped directly without
    considering for further process. The data that are processed completely at BS
    will be forwarded to the farmers of the particular farm field.

  explanation: This section focuses on resilience and fault tolerance in automated
    irrigation systems, discussing hardware and software redundancy as key strategies
    to enhance system reliability. Redundancy involves the use of extra or backup
    components such as sensors, controllers, and communication channels to ensure
    continued operation in the event of a component failure. By duplicating critical
    components, the system can automatically switch to a backup component, minimizing
    downtime and potential crop damage due to irrigation disruptions.
  extract_1: Redundancy is an important strategy for ensuring the reliability of automated
    irrigation systems. By using multiple sensors, controllers, and communication
    channels, the system can continue to operate even if one component fails.
  extract_2: Redundancy can be implemented in both hardware and software. For example,
    a system could use multiple soil moisture sensors to measure soil moisture levels.
    If one sensor fails, the system can continue to operate using the data from the
    other sensors.

    Highlights • A soil crop model is a valuable tool to correct and complement soil
    water sensors. • Soil heterogeneity is accounted by decomposing a sensor signal
    into spatial and time varying factors. • The developed model is easy to calibrate
    and captures the main dynamics of the system. Abstract A number of challenges
    must be faced when using soil moisture sensors, such as accounting for soil heterogeneity
    in measurements or dealing with sensor faults. As a consequence, it is difficult
    to obtain reliable estimations of the water status in the root zone and using

    is proposed to interpret soil water content measurements that is based on the

    1. Introduction Increasing water scarcity and the essential role irrigation plays
    in food security in many regions of the world, calls for a better management of
    water uses in agriculture. A key element of any efficient irrigation system that
    is capable of achieving high yields, is the appropriate planning of water inputs
    to meet the crops needs. This requires answering two questions: when irrigation
    should be triggered and how much water needs to be applied. To help in taking
    these decisions, different approaches have been used and often rely on information
    on the water status and dynamics of the soil-crop system either through the use
    of sensors or with models incorporating weather data (Villalobos and Fereres,
    2016; Abioye et al., 2020). Sensors have been developed that allow the measurement
    of the soil water content (SWC) or the water potential and have been used independently
    of models for irrigation planning. Typically, in this case, the decision to irrigate
    is taken when a certain threshold is reached, which represents the onset of plant
    water stress. Then, to avoid excess irrigation and compute the appropriate irrigation
    volume it is necessary to also know the soil field capacity. However, determining
    the irrigation threshold value and the field capacity for a given soil remains
    challenging (Vories and Sudduth, 2021). Appropriate sensor calibration also represents
    a difficulty, with various effects impacting sensors, such as temperature, that
    must be compensated (Mittelbach et al., 2012; Feng and Sui, 2020). Cheaper sensors
    have been introduced to reduce costs but these are less reliable, with sensor
    faults that lead to corrupted data, further complicating the use of sensors for
    irrigation (Bogena et al., 2007). Nonetheless, among the issues that have been
    reported with using sensors for irrigation scheduling, the interpretation of sensor
    data has been considered as the main difficulty (Sui and Vories, 2020). In particular,
    a number of problems arise from a non-uniform distribution of water in the soil,
    since spatial variations in SWC makes it challenging to determine if the sensor
    output actually represents the water status of the root zone. As a result, the
    positioning of sensors has an important impact on measurements, with differences
    observed in sensors over short distances (Bogena et al., 2007; Vories and Sudduth,
    2021). Approaches for irrigation planning based on models include water balance
    methods, which use weather data along with a model to estimate evapotranspiration
    losses, and compute irrigation to compensate (Allen et al., 1998; Villalobos and
    Fereres, 2016; Pereira et al., 2020). From the first simple models, more complex
    dynamic models have been developed, with detailed soil water balances to estimate
    the distribution of water in the soil column (Brisson et al., 2003; Rodríguez-Iturbe
    and Porporato, 2007; Mailhol et al., 2011; Cheviron et al., 2016; Šimůnek et al.,
    2018). However, a more detailed representation of the water dynamics leads to
    increased complexity and models that are harder to use, with calibration of model
    parameters representing a serious difficulty for the most complex models. This
    is an important consideration for a model that must be used in practice, as a
    model must first be calibrated to be applied to each specific situation. Combining
    models with sensors is an interesting solution to overcome the shortcomings of
    each approach when used separately. On one hand, sensors offer the possibility
    to link models to reality, with sensor data used for the calibration of models.
    On the other hand, models can be used to correct sensor output in the case of
    faults but also allows the integration of weather and sensor data to gain a broader
    perspective and a better understanding of a specific irrigation problem. In addition,
    this opens the possibility for the use of a wide variety of tools from monitoring
    and control engineering for irrigation management (Abioye et al., 2020; Cobbenhagen
    et al., 2021). However, this raises the often overlooked issue of linking sensors
    and models and how to assimilate data from sensors into models. In particular,
    due the difficulties in interpreting sensor data, it is not straightforward to
    establish a correspondence between sensor output and model variables. In this
    work, we focus on the problems associated with the non-uniform distribution of
    soil water content, and how to deal with soil heterogeneity when using sensor
    data along with a model. 2. Model presentation 2.1. Soil water content Variations
    in the distribution of water in the soil are caused by a number of factors, which
    have impacts at different scales. In an area exposed to similar conditions, differences
    in SWC can be the result of heterogeneity in soil composition and structure (Warrick,
    2001). Soil composition, i.e. mineral particle size distribution and organic matter
    content, can vary at the scale of a field but locally, such as near a sensor,
    it is reasonable to consider it constant. Spatial variations in SWC can be the
    result of heterogeneity in the soil structure, in particular the porosity, and
    this can occur at a small scale. Indeed, differences in soil compaction will lead
    to variations in the distribution of pores, affecting the water holding capacity
    and the entire soil water dynamics. In this study, the measurement of SWC from
    sensors based on capacitance and frequency domain reflectometry technology are
    considered. These rely on the relation between the SWC and the dielectric permittivity
    of the soil due to the different permittivity of water, minerals and air. In turn,
    capacitance is related to the permittivity of the medium surrounding the sensors,
    and therefore capacitance can be used to indirectly measure SWC. The output of
    these sensors is then converted through a regression curve to the volumetric soil
    water content (VWC), denoted , which is the ratio of the water volume relative
    to the bulk soil volume: (1) The bulk soil volume can be decomposed into the volume
    of solid components and the pore volume, which itself is composed of the volume
    of air and water, and therefore porosity will have an impact on VWC. In controlled
    laboratory experiments, porosity is considered to have a small influence on the
    measured permittivity and often it is assumed that capacitance sensors have a
    low sensitivity to porosity. However when considering the practical field use
    of sensors, the installation of the probes in the soil can cause voids near the
    surface of the sensor, which can result in variations in the estimated VWC due
    to a greater influence of permittivity near the surface of the sensor (Bogena
    et al., 2007; Mittelbach et al., 2012). A typical problem is encountered when
    two sensors are positioned close by in an area where the soil water status should
    be the same but instead output different measurements. This raises the issue of
    interpreting sensor data and in particular the validity of a measurement for a
    given area. As a consequence, using sensor data along with a model for irrigation
    planning requires some methodology to account for the local spatial variations
    in soil water measurements. One possibility is to use a model with variables for
    soil water expressed as VWC and to represent soil heterogeneity in detail. This
    is the approach followed by many dynamic soil and crop models, and this leads
    to considering a fine representation of the soil to compute in detail the distribution
    of water (Brisson et al., 2003; Šimůnek et al., 2018). However, with this approach,
    soil heterogeneity is represented by varying the parameters associated with the
    different soil properties. Indeed, the characteristic moisture levels, such as
    field capacity or wilting point, when expressed in VWC, would have to be different
    at various points in space to reflect the variations of soil structure. In particular,
    this raises the issue of the calibration of these distributed parameters, which
    are functions of space. At least, it would be necessary to calibrate, for each
    sensor position, all the parameters representing characteristic soil moisture
    levels, such as field capacity and wilting point. The complexity of this approach
    and the associated models can be questioned in practical applications, where model
    usability and efficiency are important. Furthermore, models for decision support
    do not necessarily need to be as detailed as those developed for scientific purposes,
    in particular if they are to be used by farmers. For the problem studied here,
    the limited online measurements from a few sensors and the little information
    on the soil properties available in practice make it difficult to accurately calibrate
    complex models and justify the use of simpler models. Instead, the model and the
    associated calibration method proposed here consider soil water variables expressed
    as Pore Water Content (PWC), denoted , which is the soil water volume relative
    to pore volume: (2) Porosity is defined as the ratio of pore volume to bulk soil
    volume, (3) Therefore, PWC and VWC are related by (4) Then, sensor data, which
    is recorded as VWC, can be readily converted to PWC once porosity has been estimated.
    The choice of using PWC variables is based on the hypothesis that the local variations
    in soil water content are mainly the result of local differences in soil porosity.
    Furthermore, we make the assumption that the VWC measurements can be decomposed
    according to (4) into the product of porosity, which represents the soil''s spatial
    heterogeneity, and PWC, which is assumed to be constant locally. In other words,
    we suppose that the sensor output which varies in space and time, is the product
    of a term which varies only in space, porosity , and another term which varies
    only in time, PWC : (5) with representing a space coordinate and the time coordinate.
    The approach presented here relies on the identification of by calibrating model
    output to sensor data. With the assumptions made here, other sources of differences
    in sensor measurements are not explicitly considered, such as imperfections in
    sensors or structural differences due to rooting leading to preferential flow
    patterns. Therefore, the identified might not correspond exactly to porosity and
    instead could be considered as an abstract spatial variability parameter that
    accounts for the various possible causes of differences in sensor readings. However,
    in this work, it is assumed that soil spatial variability features can be correlated
    to variations in porosity so that can be considered to represent porosity and
    this helps to guide the construction of the model and calibration method. Nonetheless,
    it should be kept in mind when interpreting results that this parameter might
    not correspond exactly to porosity and other factors might influence it. Despite
    being a simplification of the physical reality, the objective here is not for
    the estimation of soil heterogeneity or water content to a high degree of precision
    for scientific purposes. Instead, the aim is rather to propose a practical method
    for sensor data interpretation that can correct differences in sensor measurements
    from a variety of causes, in a parsimonious and efficient manner. An important
    advantage of this approach is that it does not require a fine representation of
    the soil and instead the variables of PWC will represent the water content in
    a large area where soil type is constant. This results in an efficient model with
    only a few variables and the porosity is the only parameter used to account for
    differences in recorded VWC. Indeed, it is assumed that, when expressed as PWC,
    the characteristic soil moisture levels depend only on the soil type but not on
    the porosity. Thus, considering that the soil type is homogeneous in an area results
    in constant characteristic soil moisture levels. The associated parameters can
    therefore be set from reference values based on the soil composition. This method
    has the advantage of requiring the calibration of only one parameter per sensor
    to explain the spatial variations and this is important in obtaining an efficient
    and generic calibration method. To justify these hypotheses, first note that the
    matric potential is insensitive to structural or density properties and will thus
    naturally assume the same value at a short distance, irrespective of porosity.
    As a result, although characteristic soil moisture levels do not correspond physically
    to a matric potential, they can nonetheless be considered independent of soil
    porosity or composition when they are expressed as soil water potentials (Laio
    et al., 2001). For example, the wilting point is assumed to correspond to a soil
    water potential of −3 MPa, with variations essentially due to plant type but not
    due to soil composition or porosity. Next, a soil water retention curve can be
    used to convert water potential to VWC and in particular the following relation
    has been proposed (Clapp and Hornberger 1978), (6) Here, is the soil water potential,
    and are parameters depending on the soil type. The water retention curve therefore
    encapsulates the different sources of spatial variation in water content due to
    soil type and porosity. Note that VWC and PWC are related through porosity and
    can be rewritten to relate the soil water potential to PWC: (7) The assumption
    made here corresponds to considering that and do not depend on porosity in the
    case of small scale variations of density. The consequence is that, if the characteristic
    soil moisture levels correspond to constant soil water potentials, then they do
    not vary with small changes in porosity when they are expressed as PWC. For example,
    assuming that the soil water potential at the wilting point and the soil type
    are constant in a small area implies that the wilting point is also constant when
    expressed in PWC. Note however that the parameters and vary with soil composition
    and thus this gives the dependence on soil type of the PWC characteristic soil
    moisture levels. 2.2. Model dynamics The model proposed here is a soil water balance
    compartment model, each compartment corresponding to a layer of soil in an area
    around a sensor. The main variables are the soil water content, expressed in PWC,
    and are assumed to represent soil water content of the area surrounding each sensor
    where the soil composition is constant. The horizontal movement of water is neglected
    and therefore areas of different soil composition are not connected. However,
    to represent vertical variation and movement of water, several layers can be considered
    as a series of interconnected compartments. The number of layers depends on the
    number of sensors used and can be adapted to the crop and soil type, with the
    case of crops with deep roots or vertically heterogeneous soils requiring more
    layers. The model developed here considers a division of the soil column in 2
    layers, with the objective of using data from sensors positioned at 2 different
    depths. The dynamics are obtained by considering the balance of inputs and outputs
    in each compartment. Unlike many crop models that use a fixed time step, the model
    presented here considers a continuous time, which is better suited to capture
    phenomena with different timescales such as those present in the soil water dynamics.
    Indeed, no time step is fixed and instead the result is a continuous dynamical
    system described by a set of ordinary differential equations, which are solved
    with a numerical method which determines an appropriate variable time step depending
    on the dynamics. The choice of this approach also allows to take advantage of
    the tools developed in dynamical systems theory, such as observer and control
    methods (Khalil, 2015). To compute losses due to evapotranspiration, crop growth
    is computed and the model presented here uses concepts originated in the methods
    of the FAO Irrigation and Drainage Paper No. 56 (Allen et al., 1998) and further
    developed in the AquaCrop model (Steduto et al., 2009). Such concepts have already
    been applied to construct continuous dynamical systems crop models (Laio et al.,
    2001; Rodríguez-Iturbe and Porporato, 2007; Pelak et al., 2017). The model presented
    here largely follows these works but with a few modifications. In particular,
    only vertically homogeneous soils had been considered and here these models are
    extended to the multi-layer case. The model variables are the PWC in the top layer
    S1, and in the bottom layer S2. The crop is represented with the above ground
    dry biomass B [kg m−2] and canopy cover C, which is the fraction of ground shaded
    by the canopy. Denoting the height and the porosity of the layer i (with i = 1
    or 2), then represents the active depth, or the volume per unit area of pore space
    in the considered layer. Therefore is the height of water of the layer and is
    the quantity on which the balance is written, considering input from irrigation
    and losses due to transpiration , evaporation and drainage Q. (8) (9) The soil
    water balance follows the dual crop coefficient method and uses the canopy cover
    to partition the Penman-Monteith reference evapotranspiration ET0 into transpiration
    and evaporation. Then the transpiration flux, from layer i = 1 or 2, is computed
    as: (10) with the crop transpiration coefficient and the water stress function.
    (11) with the wilting point and the water stress level. For simplicity and to
    obtain a parsimonious model, several processes are not explicitly represented
    in this model, as for instance root growth. Limited root growth could limit transpiration,
    in particular in the early stages of plant life, but it is considered here that
    this effect is indirectly taken into account through the presence of the canopy
    cover in the expression of transpiration which already limits the crops'' water
    consumption. In addition, a difference in root density between the 2 layers could
    change the transpiration flux from each layer but this is accounted for by taking
    different crop transpiration coefficients in each layer. When using shallow layers
    as it is done here, an evaporation flux can be considered from both layers, with
    the evaporation flux is computed as: (12) with the evaporation coefficient and
    the evaporation reduction function. (13) The two layers are connected through
    the leakage term, with the water draining from the top layer Q(S1) feeding into
    the bottom layer. Leakage is modelled with a simplified tipping bucket approach
    which, although not physical, avoids the estimation of the potential gradient
    driving the flow. This considers no flow when PWC is less than field capacity
    Sfc, (14) with ksat the saturation conductivity. A logistic equation is considered
    for the canopy cover and the growth rate is proportional to crop transpiration,
    to account for limitations in case of water stress. (15) with rG the potential
    canopy growth rate and Cmax the maximum canopy cover. Biomass growth follows the
    concept of water productivity used in Aquacrop, with growth proportional to the
    total transpiration flux, (16) with W* the daily water productivity. The model
    considered is thus composed of Eqs. (8), (9), (15), (16) and schematically represented

    content (PWC) of layer i, C canopy cover, B biomass, I irrigation, E evaporation,

    losses due to evaporation, transpiration and leakage over a given time interval
    [0,T]: Total Evaporation: Total Transpiration: Total Leakage: 2.3. Parameter calibration
    The model parameters can either be set from reference values from public databases,
    directly measured or estimated from available sensor data. The latter case requires
    solving the optimisation problem of minimising the error between model simulations
    and measurement data. This can be computationally intensive and present a number
    of challenges, such as the problem of identifiability (Walter et al., 1997). For
    these reasons, it is important to set as many parameters as possible by other
    means to obtain an efficient calibration. Table 1 lists the parameters set from
    references. As previously explained, the parameters representing soil hydraulic
    properties (characteristic soil moisture levels and the saturated conductivity
    ) values are selected based on the soil type which can be identified with granulometric
    measurements. Values of these characteristic soil moisture levels in PWC for different
    soil types can be found in (Laio et al., 2001). The parameter represents the maximum
    area of the soil surface that can be shaded by the crops canopy and therefore
    depends on the plant type as well as geometric consideration, such as row spacing.

    hydraulic conductivity Laio et al., 2001 0.8 - Maximum canopy cover - The height
    of each compartment can be set by first considering that the modelled soil layers
    correspond to a compartment where the water content or soil type does not vary
    considerably. In addition, sensors have a given volume of influence and measurements
    correspond to an average over this volume. Therefore, with the objective of reproducing
    sensors data, the heights should be related to the vertical size of the volume
    of influence of the soil moisture sensors. Accordingly, knowledge of the soil
    column composition, its variation and the properties of the sensors should be
    taken into account in positioning sensors and setting the height parameters .
    All other parameters (Table 2) are calibrated by minimising the error between
    simulations and measurement data. The root mean square (RMSE) is used to compute
    errors: (17) with N the number of data points, the measured data at time and the
    simulated value. When combining several variables expressed in different units
    (i.e. PWC and canopy cover), errors are computed by summing the relative RMSE
    (relRMSE) for each variable: (18) with the mean of the data. Table 2. Model parameters,
    calibrated from data. Parameter Units Name Calibration – Porosity For each sensor
    – Transpiration crop coefficient For each production cycle – Evaporation crop
    coefficient For each soil type d−1 Canopy cover growth rate For each production
    cycle and growing condition kg m−2 d−1 Normalised daily water productivity For
    each production cycle The porosity is the main parameter that must be calibrated
    as it is considered here to account for the spatial variability of soil properties.
    Several sets of sensors can be used to monitor the soil for redundancy purposes
    or to study variations between different areas. In these cases, the porosity must
    be estimated for each soil water sensor. When sensors are used over several growth
    cycles, if the soil surrounding the sensors is left undisturbed, the same parameters
    can be used for a new growth cycle. However, if the sensor is positioned in proximity
    to roots or if the soil is disturbed due to tillage between growth cycles, then
    the soil structure will change and thus porosity must be estimated again. The
    other calibrated parameters are independent of individual sensor''s and it is
    possible to use the same parameters for different sets of sensors. However, the
    use of the same set of parameters over several production cycles or if the growing
    conditions are different is limited. Indeed, due to the simplicity of the model
    considered here, a number of effects are not taken into account and instead the
    impact of processes not represented end up hidden in parameters. For example,
    the impact of temperature on crop growth is only taken indirectly into account
    through reference evapotranspiration but it has been known for a long time that
    biomass growth depends on temperature, with the concept of growing degree days.
    For this model, this means that the biomass growth rate in fact depends on temperature.
    As a consequence it is necessary to re-calibrate parameters for different production
    cycles or if growing conditions change, depending on the role of each parameter.
    Table 2 lists the circumstances for which each parameter must be calibrated. In
    practice, due to the importance of the porosity on the water dynamics, this parameter
    can be first estimated alone, to get a preliminary adjustment of the general features
    of the soil water dynamics. Then, the precise calibration is conducted in a second
    step, with the estimation at the same time of the porosity along with the evapotranspiration
    and canopy growth rate parameters to get a precise fit for the S and C variables.
    This is the step that is the most challenging, as it can require the estimation
    of up to 7 parameters and thus there is a strong interest in reusing parameters
    from a previous calibration if possible. Finally, as the biomass does not affect
    the dynamics of other variables in the model presented here, the growth rate (
    ) can be estimated independently at the end to obtain a good adjustment of the
    biomass. 3. Calibration and validation data The approach presented here is illustrated
    in the context of experiments in wastewater reuse, in which irrigation with freshwater
    and reclaimed water is compared. This offers the possibility to showcase the use
    of a model for the interpretation and correction of sensor measurements. Furthermore,
    this allows to demonstrate the capabilities of the model and the associated calibration
    procedure in different growing conditions. It should be noted that the quantitative
    control of treated wastewater reuse in agriculture is an important issue, considering
    that it is a resource that can be limited and moreover to avoid possible sanitary
    and agronomic impacts of uncontrolled wastewater irrigation (Ait-Mouheb et al.,
    2018). 3.1. Experimental site The experimental site is located at Murviel-lès-Montpellier,
    in the south of France (43.605° N 3.757° E), on a wastewater treatment plant which
    is equipped with a constructed wetland, composed of reed bed filters with forced
    aeration, and with additional secondary treatment with ferric chloride as flocculant
    to remove phosphorus. Two greenhouses of 100 m² each have been in use since 2017,
    to run experiments on the impact of wastewater reuse in agriculture (Ait-Mouheb
    et al., 2022). Large soil bins (1 m² and 60 cm soil depth) are used to isolate
    the experiments and avoid field contamination resulting from irrigation with reclaimed
    wastewater. The bins were filled with loamy clay soil (24.5% clay, 32% fine silt,
    13.7% silt, 10.6% fine sand and 19.2% of sand). Lettuce (Lactuca sativa) was grown
    in 2021, with 8 plants per bin and starting with plantlets at the 3 leaf stage.
    Two growth cycles of 6 weeks were conducted, from 13 April to 25 May and from
    27 May to 5 July, hereafter referred to as cycle 1 and cycle 2, respectively.
    Meteorological variables were measured with a weather station located in the greenhouse.
    Hourly air temperature, relative humidity and global radiation levels were recorded
    during both growth cycles. 3.2. Irrigation and fertilisation The bins were irrigated
    with different water qualities and in this study we focus on the 2 bins in which
    soil moisture sensors were positioned, with one bin irrigated with freshwater
    (FW) and another with treated wastewater (TWW). Drip irrigation was conducted
    with one surface dripper per lettuce and one dripper without any plant in the
    centre of the bin. The drippers deliver a nominal flow rate of 2 L/h and flow
    rates were monitored during the irrigation cycles and showed no significant variation.
    According to the manufacturer''s recommendations, irrigation water was filtered
    at 130 μm before irrigation to prevent physical clogging of the drippers. Irrigation
    was performed twice a week during cycle 1 and 3 times per week during cycle 2,
    with irrigation volumes estimated from evapotranspiration which was computed using
    the method from the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nation (FAO)
    Irrigation and Drainage Paper No. 56 (Allen et al., 1998). The soil of each bin
    was analysed to determine the available nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium
    (K) for crop growth at the beginning of each growth cycle. In addition, as these
    nutrients are present in wastewater, the amount of N, P and K supplied through
    TWW irrigation was estimated from analysis of the treated wastewater and typical
    irrigation requirements. Then considering the needs of the lettuce (Berry, 2013),
    the nutrients already present in the soil and the possible contribution from irrigation
    in the TWW bin, fertilisation was conducted to provide for the needs of the lettuce
    over a cycle and ensure the same level of nutrients in the TWW and FW bins. Accordingly,
    N was supplied to the FW bin for cycle 1, P for the TWW and FW bin for cycle 2
    and K for the TWW bin cycle 2. 3.3. Soil moisture sensors and lettuce growth monitoring
    For the monitoring of soil water content (SWC) 12 capacitance soil moisture sensors
    were installed (8 sensors of model ECH20 EC5 4 sensors of model ECH20 10HS, all
    from METER Group). Sensors were installed at two different depths of 5 cm and
    20 cm. The sensors were positioned either under a dripper with lettuce or under
    a dripper without a lettuce (Fig. 2). Download : Download high-res image (319KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Position of drippers, lettuce and
    sensors in bins irrigated with freshwater (FW) and treated wastewater (TWW). At
    each position, 2 sensors were installed, at 5 cm and 20 cm depth. Each sensor
    was calibrated separately for the soil of the experiment, according to manufacturer
    instructions, to obtain the parameters to convert the output of the sensors to
    volumetric soil water content. The sensor data was furthermore corrected to account
    for the effect of temperature according to the method proposed by (Cobos and Campbell,
    2007). Once a week, photos were taken of the bins and using the ImageJ software,
    the horizontal surface area of each lettuce was measured. Fresh and dry biomass
    were measured at the end of each growth cycle. 3.4. Model calibration and validation
    The data from each growth cycle was separated into calibration and validation
    sets, with parameters estimated with data from the 3 first weeks (days 0 – 21
    for cycle 1 and days 0 –18 for cycle 2) and validated with data from the 3 last
    weeks (days 22 – 42 for cycle 1 and days 19 – 39 for cycle 2). For calibration
    and comparison between model and sensor output, the data from the soil moisture
    sensors was converted from VWC to PWC with the models'' porosity parameter and
    then was compared to S1 for sensors at 5 cm depth and to S2 for sensors at 20
    cm depth. The weekly lettuce surface area was converted to canopy cover data by
    dividing the surface area of each lettuce by the soil surface area, considering
    that each lettuce was on a square of 1/9th of the soil bins area (i.e. 1111 cm²).
    The canopy cover variable C of the model was compared with the average over each
    soil bin of the canopy cover data. In addition, the average over each bin of the
    final dry weight of the lettuce was compared to the final value of the model variable
    B. 4. Results and discussion 4.1. Soil water content measurements The volumetric
    soil water content as measured by the soil moisture sensors is presented in Fig.
    3, for growth cycles 1 and 2 and for irrigation with TWW and FW. A number of sensor
    faults can be observed, such as problems with the recording of nonphysical oscillations
    (sensors C, FW, cycle 1; sensors D TWW, cycle 2). Furthermore, a number of sensors
    malfunctioned and either recorded intermittently or produced no recording at all
    (sensors A, TWW, cycle 1; sensors A and B, FW cycle 2). Nonetheless, this is expected
    with the type of inexpensive sensors used here and has been reported as a major
    issue when working with cheaper sensors (Bogena et al., 2007). Download : Download

    moisture sensors for cycle 1 and 2, volumetric soil water content (VWC) [mm/mm]
    and irrigation volume (I) [mm] from treated wastewater (TWW) and freshwater (FW)
    irrigation. A,B,C,D denote sensor positions with A,C and D under a dripper with
    lettuce and B under a dripper without lettuce. The sensor''s signals follow a
    general pattern and two dynamics can be identified: first a fast response during
    irrigation events and secondly, between irrigations, a slower dynamic characterised
    by a steady decrease in VWC. During an irrigation, the sensor''s signals exhibit
    spikes corresponding to a temporary water saturation of the soil followed by a
    rapid decrease due to drainage towards lower layers of the soil. Then, a few hours
    after irrigation, the SWC stabilises at a value which can be expected to be close
    to field capacity. The second phase takes place over the course of the several
    days between irrigations, with evapotranspiration driving water losses. The amplitude
    of the spikes recorded during irrigation varies, even when the same irrigation
    volume is applied. The variations of the maximum reached can be explained by differences
    in the sampling time during the irrigation event. Indeed, the sampling period
    was of 1 h whilst irrigations lasted 30 min and therefore the measurement of the
    maximum reached depends on whether sensors recorded during or slightly after irrigation.
    However, the differences in the values at which VWC stabilises afterwards cannot
    be as easily explained (Vories and Sudduth, 2021). When comparing signals of the
    sensors within the same bin, differences can be observed in the VWC measured,
    despite sensors being close and exposed to the same conditions. In addition, for
    certain signals, these differences appear almost constant throughout the 6 weeks
    of each growth cycle, such as for sensors at position A and C in the TWW bin during
    cycle 1. Furthermore, differences can be observed in the values recorded for sensors
    at the same location but at different depths, for almost all positions, with SWC
    always higher in the bottom soil layer and again, certain sensor signals seem
    to differ only by a constant value (sensor C, TWW, cycle 1 and 2). More water
    can be retained in the deeper layers of soil as it is less affected by evapotranspiration
    than the topmost layer and thus a higher SWC at 20 cm depth can be expected some
    time after an input of water. However, after an irrigation event, the moisture
    content should stabilise at field capacity after a time of 1 – 4 days and therefore,
    if the soil had an homogeneous water holding capacity, sensors at different locations
    and depths should record the same SWC after irrigation. An explanation for the
    differences observed could be a hardware problem, such as a sensor fault, or the
    result of actual spatial variations of the soil moisture distribution. It is not
    possible to determine from the available measurements which of these two is the
    cause of the observed differences and in fact it is likely a combination of both.
    Soil heterogeneity can lead to spatial variations in VWC (Warrick, 2001) but here
    the soil composition can be supposed constant, especially considering the controlled
    conditions of the experiment, where efforts were made to render the soil as homogeneous
    as possible before each cycle. The local variations observed could however be
    explained by heterogeneity in the soil structure, as previously explained, with
    small differences in soil compaction leading to variations in porosity and thus
    affecting the soil water dynamics. In particular, the constant differences observed
    between certain sensor signals indicates that a factor independent of time is
    responsible for the spatial variations in VWC. This has led us to the suggested
    decomposition of the measured VWC into the product of two factors, with one accounting
    for spatial variations, interpreted as porosity, and the other, PWC, representing
    the time evolution of soil water status. The differences between recordings within
    the same bin and the various sensor faults make it difficult to use such measurements
    directly for irrigation planning. Indeed, it is not straightforward how the sensor
    data can be used to estimate the water holding capacity or the soil water status
    at a given moment, which are both important to decide how much and when to irrigate.
    This justifies the use of a model as suggested here, to correct the problems with
    the sensor data and with the objective of irrigation decision support. 4.2. Model
    calibration and validation for soil water status estimation A first calibration,
    using only the first 3 weeks of data of each cycle, was designed to test the performances
    of the model, in a context of irrigation planning. Calibration and validation

    1, sensor position A. Data for soil water is converted to pore water content (PWC)
    with the model''s porosity parameter. Model parameters calibrated with data from
    the beginning to day 21. Canopy cover measurements are the average of the 8 lettuce
    plants in each bin and error bars represent one standard deviation. Overall, the
    model is capable of reproducing and predicting the SWC data accurately and the
    parameter estimation method is successful with an average calibration relRMSE
    of 5.85% and average validation relRMSE of 6.8% for the SWC. Calibration is efficient
    and the optimization problems used to compute a set of parameters are each solved
    in less than 2 min on a modern laptop computer. In particular, the strategy of
    reusing parameters is successful and for example, the transpiration coefficients
    calibrated on one data set can be used for all other simulations of a cycle. This
    allows the estimation of the least amount of parameters possible and results in
    a faster calibration. Moreover, this demonstrates the generic quality of the model
    and provides an extra validation of the processes represented. Calibration was
    started with the sensors under drippers without lettuce as this required only
    the calibration of the porosity and the evaporation coefficient. The model is
    capable of predicting this data with very low errors, with for the first cycle
    an average calibration relRMSE of 3.2% and an average validation relRMSE of 4.19%.
    For the second cycle, good results were obtained without recalibration of the
    porosity parameter, with a mean relRMSE of 7.28%, and this can be explained by
    the fact that the sensors were not moved and the soil in this area of the bins
    was left undisturbed between both growth cycles. However, the soil under the lettuce
    was disturbed after the harvest of the first cycle and sensors were repositioned,
    leading to a modified local soil structure which affected the porosity. Thus,
    for the data from sensors under lettuce, the porosity parameter had to be calibrated
    again for the second cycle. After calibration of transpiration coefficients and
    the canopy cover growth rate, the model also simulated accurately SWC data from
    the sensors under lettuce with, for the first cycle, an average calibration relRMSE
    of 7.75% and average validation relRMSE of 6.37% and for the second cycle an average
    calibration relRMSE of 5.47% and average validation relRMSE of 8.14%. For the
    canopy cover, the model achieves low calibration errors, with a mean relRMSE of
    12.3% for the first cycle and of 7.76% for the second cycle. The model is less
    accurate during the validation period, in particular in the first cycle with an
    average relRMSE of 49.73% but with a better performance for the second cycle with
    an average relRMSE of 29.44%. However despite these errors, the model is capable
    of reproducing the general trend of the canopy growth sufficiently well to obtain
    very good predictions of the SWC which is the primary objective here. These results
    also show that the model is capable of dealing with sensor faults and provides
    a data filtering method. Indeed, for the first cycle, the SWC data from sensors
    at position C in the FW bin was of bad quality during the calibration period.
    Nonetheless, this data was used to estimate the porosity parameters associated
    with these sensors as well as the canopy growth parameter for the FW water quality.
    Despite the sensor fault, calibration was successful as shown by the low error
    obtained during the validation period, for which the data was of better quality.
    Incidentally, the difference in data quality between the beginning and end periods
    of cycle 1 in the FW bin likely explains why validation errors are lower than
    calibration errors for sensors A and C. During the second cycle, sensor D in the
    TWW bin, recorded an extremely noisy signal but again the calibration method was
    capable of dealing with this fault and porosity was correctly estimated, yielding
    low validation errors. Furthermore, in the case of a malfunction resulting in
    no more recordings, such as sensor A in the FW bin during the second cycle, the
    model provides a means of estimating the SWC. Using the calibrated porosity parameters,
    the VWC data can be converted to PWC and much less spatial variability can be
    observed in the converted sensor signals and in the simulations. To compare signals
    of different sensors, the average relative difference is computed. Denoting θA
    and θB the signals of 2 sensors and the mean of a signal, then the relative difference
    is: (20) From this, the average is then computed over the time interval of interest.
    The average of the relative difference between signals from sensors A and C in
    the TWW bin, cycle 1, is 30.07% in the top and 22.01% in the bottom layer when
    comparing the signals of VWC. However, once converted to PWC, these differences
    drop to 5.4% in the top and 5.52% in the bottom. Differences between top and bottom
    layers are also reduced and in the case of sensors at position C in the TWW bin,
    cycle 1, the mean difference between the two layers is 11.5% in VWC but only 3.5%
    in PWC. In addition, the difference between PWC under drippers with or without
    lettuce is also small at the beginning but becomes more important later in the
    cycle, when the lettuce has a greater impact on water dynamics. 4.3. Full cycle
    calibration for analysis The lettuce biomass were measured only at the end of
    cycle and therefore to calibrate the biomass growth rate parameter, it was necessary
    to use data from an entire cycle. Moreover, as the errors on the canopy cover
    were more important during the second part of both cycles, it was also decided
    to estimate rG again in order to reproduce the data more accurately with the objective
    of using this calibration for the analysis of the experiment. The calibration
    was successful, with an overall relRMSE of 22.18% for the canopy cover and 2.06%
    for the biomass (Fig. 4). Figs. 7, Fig. 8, Fig. 9 compare the data and model simulations
    of the canopy cover and dry biomass. Differences between bins with irrigation
    of FW and TWW can be noted during the first cycle mainly, both on the biomass
    and canopy growth. Interestingly, these differences can be reproduced with the
    model with differences in only the canopy growth rate whilst the evapotranspiration
    coefficients and biomass growth rate were the same for both water qualities. The
    canopy growth rate therefore translates the impact on lettuce growth of the different
    conditions. Furthermore, the parameters estimated from the two different calibrations
    can be contrasted to see if growth was different at the beginning and end of the
    cycles, as presented in Table 4. For the first cycle, comparing calibrated parameters
    with data from the first 21 days or from the full cycle, shows that for the FW
    bin, the crops had a slow start with a lower growth rate at the beginning. However,
    the opposite happened for the TWW bin for cycle 1 and 2 as well as for the FW
    bin for cycle 2. This can be related to fertilisation of the FW bin occurring
    only on day 10 of the first cycle, whereas for the TWW, nutrients were added to
    the soil with each irrigation. Therefore the slower start of the FW lettuce can
    be explained in part by a nutrient deficit at the beginning of the cycle, with
    an increased growth rate after fertilisation. This is further supported by the
    fact that during the second cycle, when both bins were sufficiently fertilised
    over the entire cycle, the crops had the similar canopy growth rates for both
    water qualities. Download : Download high-res image (626KB) Download : Download

    The different water flows of the soil crop system can be computed from the model
    simulation and are presented in Fig. 10. During the second cycle, irrigation was
    done with smaller but more frequent events and the positive impact of this practice
    can be clearly seen. Indeed, leakage losses were between 43 and 52% of irrigation
    in cycle 1 but decreased to between 17 and 28% for cycle 2. Furthermore, despite
    a decrease in total irrigation of 17 mm from the first to the second cycle, the
    total evapotranspiration increased by 6 mm in the TWW bin and by 15 mm in the
    FW bin. This is the result of greater evaporation due to higher temperatures and
    increased transpiration from greater growth of the lettuce during the second cycle.

    study show that a simple model can be a valuable tool to complement sensors in
    accurately estimating the water status of a soil crop system. Indeed, the model
    and the calibration method are successful at taking into account the spatial variations
    in the SWC measured, whether they are caused by sensor fault or actual variations
    in soil water. In particular, this work provides a means to obtain a single value
    representing the soil water status in the vicinity of a sensor that can be used
    for irrigation planning. The simplicity of the model translates into fast calibration
    and simulations, which are essential for practical use. A disadvantage of a simpler
    model as the one presented here, is that not all processes involved in crop growth
    or soil water dynamics are included, leading to a model which can be expected
    to be less generic. However, trying to take into account all effects to obtain
    a generic model can lead to extremely complex models which turn out to be very
    difficult to calibrate efficiently. In general, developing models for real world
    application implies making trade-offs between model complexity for genericity
    and simplicity for efficiency. Access to online measurements has an impact on
    these trade offs, as data can be used to calibrate a simple model to each specific
    situation, achieving genericity with a simpler representation. CRediT authorship

  description: 'Aquifer quality monitoring and scoping are essential for both groundwater
    control and water provision in agricultural areas. The Irrigation Geothermal Water
    Quality Index (IGWQI) was investigated based on 6 variables (EC, SAR, Cl, Na,
    HCO3, and T) for 41 water samples using conventional method and predicted with
    support vector machine (SVM) and classification tree and regression (CART) computer
    models as an indicator to evaluate the suitability of geothermal water for irrigation.
    It was found that the use of such parameters allows for more accurate identification
    of unsuitable groundwater areas and reduces estimation bias, particularly if the
    dataset is limited (6 variables). In this study, the SVM and CART models were
    developed and validated to assess the groundwater quality of the EL Hamma aquifer.
    The values predicted by the SVM and CART approaches are in extremely good agreement
    with the measured IGWQI, with a mean coefficient of determination (R2) close to
    1, about 0.91 and 0.99, respectively, thus ensuring practicality and confidence
    for the artificial intelligent model. Findings showed that three classes of groundwater
    quality were identified: 12% are good, 56% are satisfactory, and 32% are classified
    as unsuitable water. The poor water quality for irrigation is shown in the eastern
    parts of the study area, which is nearly similar to that of the water temperature,
    averaging between 35 and 57 °C. This rise in water temperature is controlled by
    the fault that connects the deep compartments of the system and the shallow aquifer.
    IGWQI delineation and mapping is an excellent tool for the protection and safeguarding
    of groundwater resources, notably in arid areas where groundwater is the sole
    source of life, as well as an important tool in decision-making for groundwater
    planning and use.'

    © 2024 1 Introduction As an essential resource, groundwater is essential for meeting
    various human needs, particularly in the agricultural sector, where it accounts
    for around 43% of total groundwater use worldwide (Seibert et al., 2010). However,
    the integrity of this vital resource is increasingly compromised due to the significant
    impact of anthropogenic activities, including agriculture, industry, and tourism.
    These collective pressures have led to a quantitative depletion and qualitative
    degradation of groundwater, constituting a major threat to its sustainability
    (Zammouri et al., 2014; Agoubi, 2018; Hamed et al., 2018; Ncibi et al., 2020;
    Yahiaoui et al., 2021; Atoui & Agoubi, 2022; Wederni et al., 2023; Atoui & Agoubi,
    2024). The impact of degraded groundwater quality is global, as evidenced by the
    alarming number of approximately 829,000 annual deaths attributed to unsafe water
    consumption, according to the WHO (2019). Furthermore, projections indicate that
    over the next decade, up to 5.5 billion people could face water scarcity, underlining
    the imperative for concerted efforts in water resource management (Amitrano et
    al., 2014). In response to this global concern, numerous studies in various geographical
    regions have sought to assess and monitor water quality. These efforts have focused
    primarily on assessing the suitability of groundwater for vital uses such as drinking
    and irrigation, using a variety of methodologies and indices (Bouksila et al.,
    2010; Agoubi et al., 2016; Besser et al., 2017; Madhav et al., 2018; Kawo & Karuppannan,
    2018; Hasan & Rai, 2020; Gopinath et al., 2021; Ben Brahim et al., 2021; Khan
    et al., 2022; Nadiri et al., 2022). While the traditional Water Quality Index
    (WQI) methodology was introduced in 1965 (Horton, 1965), its limitations in providing
    a holistic assessment of water quality have motivated the development of new assessment
    methodologies. Recent advances in water quality assessment have relied on cutting-edge
    technologies, incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) techniques such as artificial
    neural networks (ANNs), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) (Wagh et
    al., 2016; Lu & Ma, 2020; Hannan & Anmala, 2021). In addition, several global
    studies have adopted a combination of methodologies, integrating Geographic Information
    Systems (GIS)-based approaches, fuzzy logic, and multicriteria decision-making
    to comprehensively assess the suitability of groundwater for specific applications
    (Agoubi et al., 2016; Ben Brahim et al., 2021). However, despite the advances
    in the global assessment of groundwater quality, specific methodologies using
    algorithms such as classification and regression trees (CART) and Support Vector
    Machines (SVM) to assess the Geothermal Irrigation Water Quality Index (IGWQI)
    remain relatively unexplored. In particular, regions such as El Hamma, in the
    south of Tunisia, offer a favorable context for the application of these methodologies
    but have not yet been studied in depth. This research seeks to fill this gap by
    proposing an innovative approach to evaluating IGWQI, by incorporating the temperature
    parameter and using CART and SVM algorithms. The introduction of this innovative
    methodology offers promising prospects for informing and improving decision-making
    processes relating to groundwater management in the region. The cited studies
    collectively contribute valuable insights into the assessment and utilization
    of geothermal water resources in different regions. Pandey et al. (2022) provide
    a hydrochemical analysis of geothermal water in Gujarat, India, using the Irrigation
    Water Quality Index. Ben Brahim et al. (2022b) employ spatial analysis and decision-making
    tools to evaluate irrigation groundwater sustainability in South Tunisia. Hajji
    et al. (2021) introduce an adaptive Mamdani fuzzy inference system model to assess
    irrigation groundwater quality in Tunisia, incorporating fuzzy logic for Water
    Quality Index determination. Ben Brahim et al. (2020) offer a comprehensive exploration
    of the geothermal potential in Tunisia’s Djerid Basin, utilizing multicriteria
    decision analysis for mapping potential areas. Additionally, Ben Brahim et al.
    (2022a) assess groundwater quality in Southeastern Tunisia for agricultural use,
    employing a diverse methodology that integrates hydrogeological and geochemical
    data with GIS and simulations. Lastly, focus on the Unai geothermal field in Gujarat,
    India, evaluating geothermal water suitability for industrial and irrigation purposes
    and highlighting the necessity of water treatment for effective utilization. Together,
    these studies underscore the importance of employing diverse methodologies, incorporating
    advanced decision-making tools, and considering various factors for a comprehensive
    understanding of geothermal water resources and their potential applications.
    Moreover, the scarcity of studies adopting similar methodologies in the specific
    context of El Hamma underlines the novelty and crucial importance of this research
    project. Responding urgently to the need to preserve and manage groundwater quality
    in this region is essential to ensure the stability and sustainability of life,
    particularly in the face of worsening water scarcity and the degradation of essential
    water resources. 2 Study Area The region of El Hamma is in the southeastern part
    of Tunisia (33° 50′-33° 55′ N and 9° 42′-9° 49′ E). In the East, it is limited
    by the Jebal Ragouba, in the West by Jebal Aziza, the Jebal Bou Najma in the south,
    and by Sebket El Hamma in the North (Fig. 1). The total area of the study area
    is 95 km2. This area is characterized by an arid to semi-arid climate with a strong
    seasonal variation affected by the Mediterranean climate. The average annual rainfall
    is 150 mm, and the average annual temperature is around 21.5 °C, sometimes exceeding
    40 °C in July and August (GDWR, 2021). Fig. 1 Geographical and geological map
    of the study area Full size image 3 Geological and Hydrogeological Settings The
    study area is characterized by vertical and rebounding discontinuities which lead
    to the appearance of complex geological features, thus the presence of sedimentation
    conditions (Agoubi, 2018; Agoubi et al., 2015). It consists of the Synclinal of
    Wadi Aied, which is stuck between Jebel Aziza to the west and Jebel Ragouba to
    the east, and by the anticline of Jebel Bou Nejma which has been cut by three
    accidents (fault of NW–SE direction is born at the southern end of Jebel Hallouga
    and two other faults of NW–SE directions limit the horst of the Intercalary Continental
    which appears on the flank of Jebel Bou Nejma) (Abidi, 2004). The lithostratigraphic
    series of this study area ranges from the Cretaceous to the Quaternary (Fig. 1).
    The lowest Cretaceous deposits are dominated by the Hauterivian–Barremian, Albian,
    and Turonian stages. Thus, the Barremian is constituted of clays, gypsums, and
    anhydrite (Agoubi, 2018). The Albian deposits are dominated by carbonate series
    (limestone, dolomite, and marl) (Agoubi, 2018). The Turonian deposits are formed
    mainly by dolomites. The Upper Cretaceous series is mainly formed of sands, clays,
    and gypsums. The Mio-Pliocene deposits lie unconformably in the Cretaceous, formed
    mainly of sandy clays (Abbes et al, 1994; Agoubi, 2018). An outcrop of quaternary
    exists throughout the study area. This outcrop is characterized by a variety of
    sediments (sandy clays, sands, conglomerates, and sandstones). The hydrogeological
    framework of the El Hamma region is characterized by the presence of three distinct
    aquifer systems: the intercalary continental aquifer (CI), the deep El Hamma-Chenchou
    aquifer composed mainly of Upper Cretaceous formations, and the shallow El Hamma
    aquifer. The CI aquifer, covering around 1,000,000 km2 of the Algerian-Tunisian-Libyan
    Sahara, is a major source of water for southern Tunisia, with sandstone formations
    from the Lower Cretaceous and notable temperatures of between 60 and 80 °C (OSS,
    2003). In the El Hamma region, a network of faults facilitates the contribution
    of the CI aquifer to the Gabès Jeffara aquifer system (Abidi, 2004). The deep
    El Hamma-Chenchou aquifer, mainly composed of Lower Senonian dolomitic limestones
    and Turonian limestones and dolomites, is a crucial component of the larger Jeffara
    aquifer. Significantly influenced by dense fault networks in the Senonian limestones,
    extending from the Upper Senonian to the Plio-Quaternary, this aquifer has an
    impact on its hydrogeological dynamics (Abbès et al., 1994). With the roof of
    the aquifer at a depth of around 60 m and levels reaching up to 600 m at Mzirâa
    El Hamma due to tectonic events, its main source of water supply comes from the
    discharge of the continental intercalary into the limestone layers via faults
    oriented SSE-NNW. Contributions from current rainfall remain marginal, occurring
    mainly at specific outcrops of Cretaceous limestone, such as those in the Daher
    region and in wadi beds. The El Hamma shallow aquifer, made up of conglomeratic
    formations covering the marl-limestone of the Lower Senonian and the sandy sandstone
    series of the Continental Intercalary, is fed both by transfer from the CI aquifer
    through fault networks and by infiltration of rainwater, particularly from wadis
    such as El Hamma, El Khardeja, and El Tkouri to the east and Oued El Aïd and its
    tributaries to the south-west (Abbès et al., 1994). This in-depth analysis of
    the hydrogeological units of El Hamma highlights their interconnection and the
    complex dynamics that govern the region’s water resources. 4 Materials and Methods
    4.1 Sample Collection and Database The comprehensive sampling of 41 groundwater
    samples covering almost the entirety of the study area, except for the northern
    part near the Sebkha where thermal drilling faced limitations, forms a robust
    foundation for this study. Conducted in March 2022 within the shallow geothermal
    aquifer at depths ranging from 25 to 100 m, these samples offer a thorough representation
    of the aquifer’s composition. The absence of thermal boreholes in the northern
    region, near the Sebkha, underscores a coverage gap attributable to specific constraints
    on borehole availability in that particular area (Fig. 2). Fig. 2 Location map
    of groundwater samples in the study area Full size image The decision to conduct
    a single sampling event in March 2022 is supported by the geological characteristics
    of the vadose zone and the considerable depth of the water table in the geothermal
    aquifer. This combination suggests that the water table is minimally influenced
    by external variations such as climatic conditions (rainfall, air temperature,
    etc.). Consequently, a one-time sampling approach is deemed appropriate, eliminating
    the necessity for collecting samples during both wet and dry periods and streamlining
    the study methodology. Additionally, prior to each sampling event, groundwater
    was diligently pumped for 15–20 min to release stored groundwater in the well,
    ensuring stability in the sampled conditions. Overall, these methodological choices
    contribute to the reliability and efficiency of the study’s groundwater analysis.
    All recovered water samples were collected in polyethylene bottles and stored
    in freezers from the well site to the geochemical laboratory of the Higher Institute
    of Water Science and Technology at Gabes University. Major ions (Na, K, Ca, Mg,
    Cl, SO4, and HCO3) have been assayed by ion chromatography (Methrohm 850 Professional
    IC). The hydro-chemical analyses were validated using the CBE % (Eq. (1)). $$CBE
    \\left(\\%\\right)= \\frac{\\sum cations-\\sum anions}{\\sum cations+\\sum anions}*100$$
    (1) According to the data, all these samples showed a CBE of lower than ± 5%,
    and a very good correlation (R2 = 0.93) which is assumed to be reliable for groundwater
    studies (Fig. 3). Fig. 3 Cross-validation cations-anions Full size image The strategy
    used in this study was mainly devoted to the thermal groundwater adequacy for
    irrigation using the IGWQI. A database including hydro-chemical and physical groundwater
    data was established to identify the water resources appropriate for irrigation
    in the El Hamma region. In the current study, six parameters were included to
    estimate the quality of irrigation water as sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl−), HCO3−,
    electrical conductivity, sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), and water temperature.
    To reach the study goal, we used a machine learning tool to calculate the parameter
    weights of the IGWQI, then predicted the IGWQI using a classification and regression
    tree (CART), and the support vector machine (SVM). Incorporating GIS technology
    to yield a digital spatial allocation of analytical parameters results in the
    monitored study area. Observed IGWQI map was produced by superposing thematic
    maps (EC, SAR, Na+, Cl−, HCO3−, and T) using geo-statistical analysis, which involves
    the inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation approach (Fig. 4). Fig. 4 Flowchart
    of the method used in the study Full size image 4.2 Irrigation Geothermal Water
    Quality Index (IGWQI) The Water Quality Index (WQI) has played a pivotal role
    in water quality studies since its introduction by Horton in 1965. Horton’s model,
    founded on 10 key water quality parameters universally deemed significant, has
    evolved into a valuable tool for local authorities in provinces and territories.
    It aids in refining decisions pertaining to water usage in both agricultural and
    human contexts. Various scientific endeavors, such as the study conducted by Ben
    Brahim et al. (2021) have leveraged the WQI to categorize drinking and irrigation
    water quality. Additionally, Atoui and Agoubi (2022) have employed the index to
    evaluate groundwater sensitivity, introducing a Pollution Sensitivity Index (SPI)
    that encompasses the WQI. The Irrigation Water Quality Index (IWQI) model, initially
    proposed by Meireles et al., 2010, has been a focal point in previous studies.
    Notably, influential parameters affecting irrigation water quality, including
    EC, SAR, Na + , Cl-, and HCO3-, have been identified in works by Abbasnia et al.
    (2018). Furthermore, insights from Bordalo et al. (2007) and Hoseinzadeh et al.
    (2014), coupled with statistical analyses such as correlation matrices, have revealed
    that temperature in geothermal groundwater zones significantly influences the
    Water Quality Index. Consequently, these findings advocate for the inclusion of
    temperature as a sixth parameter, giving rise to the Geothermal Irrigation Water
    Quality Index (IGWQI) concept. The conversion of concentration units from (mg/L)
    to (meq/L) was done using the conversion factors given by Lesch and Suarez (2009),
    and the sodium absorption ratio (SAR) was then calculated using Eq. (2) (Richards,
    1954). $$SAR= \\frac{\\left[{Na}^{+}\\right]}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\left[{Ca}^{2+}\\right]+\\left[{Mg}^{2+}\\right]}{2}}}$$
    (2) Then, the Qi values are derived because of each parameter Meireles et al.
    (2010), which denotes the status of variables from 0 to 100 and is a function
    of their value. Using Eq. (3), Qi values were calculated within the tolerance
    limits described in Table 1 proposed by Abbasnia et al. (2018) after Agoubi et
    al. (2016) for the water temperature classification interval. $${q}_{i}={q}_{max}-\\left(\\frac{\\left({X}_{ij}-{X}_{inf}\\right)*{q}_{iamp}}{{X}_{iamp}}\\right)$$
    (3) where Qi max and Qi amp are respectively the maximum value and the class amplitude
    of Qi for each class, Xij is the value observed for the parameter, and Xinf and
    Xiamp correspond to the lower limit value of the class and class amplitude for
    each parameter, respectively. $${w}_{i}=\\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^{k}{F}_{j}{A}_{ij}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{k}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{F}_{j}{A}_{ij}}$$
    (4) where wi is the weight of the parameter, F is the eigenvalue of component
    1, Aij is the explainability of parameter I by factor j, i is the number of parameters
    considered in the model ranging from 1 to n, and j is the number of factors selected
    in the model ranging from 1 to k. Table 1 Parameter limiting values for quality
    measurement (Qi) calculations (Agoubi et al., 2016; Meireles et al., 2010) Full
    size table The output of the described operation is the IGWQI value which is given
    by Eq. (5), and Table 2 represents the IGWQI characteristics for each class. Table
    2 The range and type of irrigation water for IGWQI (Zahedi, 2017) Full size table
    $$IGWQI= \\sum_{i=1}^{n}{Q}_{i}{w}_{i}$$ (5) It is worth considering that the
    calculation of Qi indices and wi is only carried out for this step in order to
    compare and validate the SVM and CART models that automatically compute the Qi
    and the weights by artificial intelligence. 4.3 Machine Learning Model 4.3.1 Support
    Vector Machine Technique (SVM) Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a classification
    method rooted in statistical learning theory, as articulated by Vapnik, 1998 (Malek
    et al., 2022). This innovative clustering approach adopts the principle of structural
    risk minimization (SRM) to address overfitting challenges in machine learning,
    a concern highlighted by Mohammadpour et al., 2014. This transformative process
    involves converting SRM into quadratic programming, thereby bolstering the generalization
    capabilities of the SVM model, as elucidated by Behzad et al. (2009). In SVM classification,
    an adaptively split plane is employed, strategically dividing the plane into two
    distinct sections, with each class assigned to a separate side. The foundation
    of SVM estimates rests on a small subset of the training data denoted as {xi,
    yi}, commonly known as support vectors. The primary objective of SVM is to ascertain
    a function, denoted as f(x) and described by Eqs. (6) and (7), based on the target
    values (yi). This function should ideally be as flat as possible. If we define
    f(x) as a linear discriminant function, the SVM function can be expressed as follows:
    $$f\\left(x\\right)= \\sum_{i=1}^{m}\\left({\\alpha }_{i}-{{\\alpha }_{i}}^{*}\\right)\\left({x}_{i},{x}_{j}\\right)+b$$
    (6) To solve the nonlinear problem in the support vector regression, the SVM works
    by taking an appropriate kernel function to map the initial data into a high-dimensional
    feature space where a maximum separation plane is built. To split the data, two
    parallel hyperplanes can be expanded on either side of the SP. Then the SVM can
    be written as follows: $$f\\left(x\\right)= \\sum_{i=1}^{m}\\left({\\alpha }_{i}-{{\\alpha
    }_{i}}^{*}\\right)K\\left({x}_{i},{x}_{j}\\right)+b$$ (7) where αi and αi* are
    Lagrangian parameters, and b is the bias. And K (xi; xj) = γ (1 + xi:xj)p or exp
    (− γ||xi yj||2), respectively, if it is a polynomial kernel function or Gaussian
    kernel function with p and γ are adjustable kernel parameters. 4.3.2 Classification
    and Regression Tree (CART) The classification and regression tree (CART) algorithm
    is designed to generate models that fulfill both explanatory and predictive objectives.
    This involves determining the number of observations required to estimate specific
    statistics reliably. The CART process hinges on strategically dividing observations
    into groups that exhibit homogeneity concerning the variable in question for prediction.
    First introduced by Quinlan (1990), CART orchestrates decisions based on various
    values of different parameters. To achieve short-term predictions with a swift
    computational speed, multiple iterations are employed. At each iteration, the
    observation dataset is iteratively split into K = 2 classes to elucidate the dependent
    variable. This iterative separation continues until no further division is feasible.
    Node separation ceases under certain stopping rules, including achieving a pure
    node, reaching a user-defined tree depth, or if the node size surpasses a user-defined
    threshold, as proposed by Breiman et al. (1984). The primary objective of each
    separation is to minimize the variance at each node, as defined by Eq. (8). This
    iterative process allows CART to iteratively refine its model, ensuring both explanatory
    and predictive goals are met while adapting to the unique characteristics of the
    dataset. $$\\sum_{{X}_{i}\\epsilon t}{\\left({Y}_{i}-\\overline{y }\\left(t\\right)\\right)}^{2}$$
    (8) where Yi is the value of the dependent variable associated to the observation
    I and y(t) is the average of the outputs associated to the node. To select the
    root and depending on the variable, the Gini impurity index can be used to divide
    nodes following Eq. (9) $$GINI :i\\left(t\\right)=1-\\sum_{j}{p}^{2}\\left(j/t\\right)$$
    (9) with p(j/t) the probability of having the modality j of Y knowing that we
    are in the node t. The weights of the observations are included in the ranking
    calculus. In case of a tie, the average rank is used. The rank and corresponding
    values are designated in ascending order as follows (Eq. (10)): $${\\left\\{{r}_{\\left(i\\right)},{x}_{(i)}\\right\\}}_{i=1}^{n}$$
    (10) For each category, k = 0 \\(x\\) (K − 1), \\({I}_{k}=\\left\\{i : \\left[r\\left(i\\right)*\\frac{K}{N+1}\\right]=k\\right\\}\\)
    where [\\(x\\)] is the floor integer of\\(x\\). If the group \\({I}_{k}\\) is
    nonempty,\\({i}_{k}={\\text{max}}\\left\\{i : \\epsilon {I}_{k}\\right\\}\\).
    The breakpoints are set equal to the \\(x\\) values corresponding to the\\({i}_{k}\\),
    excluding the largest. The decision tree framework is parametric less and does
    not require any assumption on input data distribution, is simple to interpret,
    and necessitates a minimum of data preparation. 4.3.3 Validation of Model Performance
    The observed IGWQI data and the modeled values were compared to assess whether
    the results obtained by the models are reliable. Two proposed criteria were selected
    as follows: root mean square error and coefficient of determination. 4.3.4 Root
    Means Square Error The RMSE is a measure of the dispersion of the residuals (prediction
    errors). A smaller value of RMSE means a better model prediction. Given by the
    following (Eq. (11)): $$RMSE=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N}} {\\sum }_{i=1}^{N}{\\left({X}_{{0}_{i}}-{X}_{{p}_{i}}\\right)}^{2}$$
    (11) 4.3.5 Determination Coefficient The coefficient of determination R2 is the
    Pearson squared correlation coefficient (Eq. (12)). This coefficient measures
    the strength of the linear relationship between the response variable and the
    predictor variable. $${R}^{2}=\\frac{SSR}{SST}$$ (12) where SSR is the sum of
    squared regression also known as variation explained by the model. And SST is
    the total variation in the data also known as the sum of squared total. 5 Results
    and Discussion 5.1 Irrigation Geothermal Water Quality Index (IGWQI) Assessment
    In this study, 41 sets of geothermal water observation data from 41 wells and
    boreholes were distributed in the study area. Table 3 shows the minimum, maximum,
    mean, and standard deviation of the variables selected to calculate the IGWQI
    which are as follows: electrical conductivity, sodium absorption ratio, temperature,
    and concentration of sodium, chloride, and hydrogen carbonate. The standard deviation
    values are lower than the mean for all parameters indicating heterogeneity of
    the water samples. The mineralization of the water is relatively high with an
    electrical conductivity varying between 1.73 and 4.96 (mS/cm). In comparison with
    the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) criterion for agricultural application,
    some wells and boreholes show inappropriate sodium and chloride values which show
    a maximum of 48.24 and 40.73 plus 40 and 30, respectively. Similarly, the electrical
    conductivity value gives a maximum of about 4.96 mS/cm outside the FAO electrical
    conductivity range [0–3]. Based on the descriptive statistics, some samples fall
    within the normal FAO range for Na, Cl, and EC values. The carbonate HCO3 ranges
    between 1.59 and 7.05 meq/L, with a mean and standard deviation of about 3.8 and
    1.7, respectively. Table 3 Descriptive statistics of IGWQI parameters Full size
    table According to M’nassri et al. (2022), all irrigation water classified as
    “excellent” and “good” have a SAR value between 0 and 18. Following the descriptive
    statistics, most of the samples fall inside the normal FAO range for water potability
    with calculated SAR values ranging from 2.22 to 9.51, with a mean of about 6.2
    and a standard deviation of around 2. The temperature varies from 20.8 to 56.4
    °C, thus referring to thermal groundwater. For this case, the current study added
    water temperature as a sixth parameter to assess the quality of irrigation water
    which shows a good correlation with IGWQI (Table 4). Despite the low correlation
    between T and other parameters, according to El Bilali et al. (2020), these lower
    correlations are indicative of the fact that these parameters are not redundant
    and, hence, are useful for improving the predictive ability of machine learning.
    Table 4 Correlation matrix of water quality parameters Full size table Some wells
    can only be used for those plants with high salinity and temperature tolerance
    and with special control practice, such as many types of geothermal water coolers
    used to decrease water temperature and thus salt deposition (Karakuş & Yıldız,
    2019). From the spatial development maps of EC, SAR, Na+, Cl−, HCO3−, and T (Fig.
    5), it is shown that the study area has four classes of geothermal water quality
    parameters ranging from poor to extremely good quality, with the exception of
    Na+ and Cl− which reflect that more than 99% of the study area is in the inadequate
    class of more than 9 meq/L, and the thematic map of HCO3− shows two classes of
    excellent and good quality. Fig. 5 IGWQI’s parameter thematic maps Full size image
    In this main study, IGWQI’s value computing is carried out using Eq. (5), in which
    rates were calculated based on Eq. (3) and Table 1, and the weight values are
    computed using the first component’s variance linked to its ability to explain
    each parameter. The standardized weight values are presented in Table 5. Table
    5 Calculated relative weight of each parameter Full size table The calculated
    IGWQI values varied from 23.494 to 57.089. About 12% of the samples fall into
    the “good” category, and the rest of the samples are satisfactory and unsuitable
    with about 56% and 32%, respectively (Table 6). Table 6 Irrigation Geothermal
    Water Quality Index frequency distribution Full size table 5.2 Implementation
    and Evaluation of Models In this research, we implemented a dataset of 41 observations
    for 6 water quality parameters to predict IGWQI in the El Hamma aquifer system,
    using CART and SVM models. The initial challenge is to identify the best training
    algorithms for the classification tree which may differ in the number of child
    nodes generated; for example, CART which systematically produces binary trees,
    and thus searches for the best-performing binary partition on the segmentation
    metric, or CHAID which tries to produce the most relevant groupings from statistical
    data, and the best kernel functions that fit the SVM model. The two predictive
    models adopted in this section are the power kernel function for the SVM and the
    CART algorithm for the classification tree, which obtained the lowest RMSE values
    with 2.56 and 0.23, respectively, and the highest R2 value with 0.91 and 0.99.
    The scatter plots in Fig. 5 illustrate the agreement between the predicted and
    observed IGWQI values in the CART and SVM models. This process output reveals
    that the CART model has significant R2 and RMSE values compared to the SVM models
    for the prediction of the WQI, but both are validated with a coefficient of determination
    close to 1 and a considerably low RMSE. Furthermore, it reveals that the predicted
    values are closely related to the observed values. Comparing the observed IGWQI
    values with those predicted by both CART and SVM for all samples is shown in Fig.
    6 and Table 7. It is apparent that the CART-predicted values of the IGWQI are
    closer to the observed values than the SVM-predicted values, thereby indicating
    the coherence and suitability of the proposed CART model (Fig. 7). Fig. 6 Correlation
    between predicted and observed IGWQI values with SVM (a, b) and CART (c, d) model

    Full size image According to the present results, groundwater consumption in the
    El Hamma aquifer, which is 31% classified as unsuitable for irrigation is highly
    dangerous for the soil and plants. In fact, the most considerable source of salinization
    in this region is agricultural activity and geothermal healing baths (Fig. 8).
    Fig. 8 Observed (a) and predicted Irrigation Water Quality Index thematic map
    with CART (b) and SVM (c) models Full size image In addition, the high temperature
    of the water strongly contributes to the dissolution of salts and pesticides in
    the irrigation water and thus to their leaching into the soil. Hot geothermal
    water also threatens plant roots and thus destroys plant tissue. Therefore, there
    might be measures to prevent the leaching of soluble salts that threaten water
    quality. It is worth mentioning a review of the predictive performance of the
    optimal model in our research with other works cited in the literature for the
    prediction of Water Quality Index in the world. Asadollah et al. (2021) reported
    that the tree regression model had an ideal predictive ability compared to other
    models considering a determination coefficient R2 = 0.97. Kamyab-Talesh et al.
    (2019) predicted the Water Quality Index by the support vector machine with a
    coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE) values of
    0.87 and 0.06, respectively. Wei Cong et al. (2021) and M’nassri et al. (2022)
    used different models with R2 values < 0.90. It is clearly apparent that the CART
    and SVM models exceed and validate several current models. Therefore, the SVM
    and CART models are popular learning models that deliver more precise predictive
    results compared to other developed forecasting models in this literature. The
    results were spatially distributed based on interpolation approaches. Using the
    color-coding system, the results were divided into five bands, in which red color
    corresponds to poor water quality and blue to excellent water quality. The IGWQI
    with a lower value corresponds to inadequate water quality and vice versa. Fig.
    7 shows that the eastern areas of the plain exposed poor water quality area which
    was found almost similar to that of the water temperature (Fig. 5a), which shows
    an average between 35 and 57 °C. This height of water temperature is controlled
    by the fault which connects the deep compartments of the system and the shallow
    aquifer. IGWGI is used as a reference to illustrate the spatial distribution of
    the water quality indices of both models which are shown in Fig. 7. All models
    produced broadly similar spatial patterns; however, there were some but not large
    differences. The southern parts of the plain have poor water quality, while the
    rest parts of the plain have satisfactory water quality. According to Figs 6,
    7 and 8, both models can integrate pysico-chemical parameter to develop new water
    quality indices, but the CART model proves its worth. Both the investigation conducted
    by Ben Brahim et al. in 2020 and our present study share a common theme of exploring
    the potential and applications of geothermal resources, although with different
    focuses. Ben Brahim et al.’s (2020) study centers on the identification of geothermal
    sites in the Tozeur region, Tunisia, using geographic information system-multicriteria
    decision analysis (GIS-MCDA). Their work emphasizes the diverse applications of
    harnessed geothermal resources, including thermal tourism, residential heating,
    greenhouse operations, and balneological treatment, showcasing the broad scope
    of geothermal utilization to meet local needs and contribute to renewable energy
    production in the Tunisian context. In contrast, our current study focuses on
    the hydrochemical analysis of geothermal water in El Hamma, Tunisia, utilizing
    the Irrigation Water Quality Index (IWQI) to assess its suitability specifically
    for irrigation purposes. Our work addresses the practical aspect of using geothermal
    water for sustainable irrigation practices, contributing insights into its viability
    for agricultural applications. While Ben Brahim et al.’s study in 2020 and Pandey
    et al.’s investigation in 2022 have broader scopes, encompassing the identification
    of geothermal sites and assessing geothermal water for various applications, respectively,
    our work provides valuable information on the specific application of geothermal
    water for irrigation, catering to the regional needs of Tunisia. Together, these
    studies contribute to a holistic understanding of geothermal resource utilization
    across different geographical contexts and applications. Ensuring the sustainable
    management of geothermal groundwater resources for long-term livelihood support
    involves a multifaceted strategy. It necessitates the enhancement of groundwater
    recharge through infrastructure like infiltration basins and injection wells,
    coupled with judicious extraction practices to maintain equilibrium between utilization
    and natural replenishment. Robust monitoring systems for geothermal gradients
    and subsurface temperatures are crucial, providing essential data for informed
    decision-making. Protective measures, such as regulating industrial discharges
    and enforcing land use practices, contribute to aquifer preservation. Engaging
    local communities through education and awareness initiatives fosters responsible
    water use. Integrated resource planning, research, and technological innovations,
    and a well-defined legal framework ensure comprehensive and sustainable management.
    Zoning for land use around geothermal areas, capacity building, economic diversification,
    and climate resilience planning further fortify the long-term viability of geothermal
    groundwater resources, safeguarding both livelihoods and environmental integrity.
    6 Conclusion In conclusion, this in-depth study of groundwater quality in the
    study area, based on the Geothermal Irrigation Water Quality Index (IGWQI), has
    provided crucial information for the sustainable management of water resources.
    The use and development of innovative analysis methods, including the CART algorithm
    and SVM, enabled the IGWQI value to be accurately predicted for water samples
    from the shallow El Hamma aquifer. The results obtained revealed a significant
    distribution of samples in different categories of suitability for irrigation.
    Around 12% of samples were classified as unsuitable, highlighting the potential
    challenges associated with using these waters for irrigation. More encouragingly,
    over 56% of the samples were rated as satisfactory, offering positive prospects
    for the sustainable use of these resources. The CART model proved to be the most
    suitable for predicting the IGWQI value, performing exceptionally well with a
    coefficient of determination (R2) close to 1 (R2 = 0.99) and a root mean square
    error (RMSE) of 0.23. These results reinforce the reliability of the CART model
    in predicting the quality of geothermal irrigation water in this specific region.
    These findings are of particular importance to groundwater management for sustainable
    development in the study area. The information provided can guide decision-makers
    and water resource managers toward more effective strategies to ensure the judicious
    use of groundwater, thereby minimizing potential risks to agriculture and the
    environment. Ultimately, this study makes a significant contribution to the advancement
    of knowledge on groundwater quality and offers practical perspectives for the
    sustainability and preservation of these crucial resources. Data Availability

  description: The agricultural industry has the potential to undergo a revolutionary
    transformation with the use of Internet of Things (IoT) technology. Crop monitoring
    can be improved, waste reduced, and efficiency increased. However, there are risks
    associated with system failures that can lead to significant losses and food insecurity.
    Therefore, a proactive approach is necessary to ensure the effective safety assessment
    of new IoT systems before deployment. It is crucial to identify potential causes
    of failure and their severity from the conceptual design phase of the IoT system
    within smart agricultural ecosystems. This will help prevent such risks and ensure
    the safety of the system. This study examines the failure behaviour of IoT-based
    Smart Irrigation Systems (SIS) to identify potential causes of failure. This study
    proposes a comprehensive Model-Based Safety Analysis (MBSA) framework to model
    the failure behaviour of SIS and generate analysable safety artefacts of the system
    using System Modelling Language (SysML). The MBSA approach provides meticulousness
    to the analysis, supports model reuse, and makes the development of a Fault Tree
    Analysis (FTA) model easier, thereby reducing the inherent limitations of informal
    system analysis. The FTA model identifies component failures and their propagation,
    providing a detailed understanding of how individual component failures can lead
    to the overall failure of the SIS. This study offers valuable insights into the
    interconnectedness of various component failures by evaluating the SIS failure
    behaviour through the FTA model. This study generates multiple minimal cut sets,
    which provide actionable insights into designing dependable IoT-based SIS. This
    analysis identifies potential weak points in the design and provides a foundation
    for safety risk mitigation strategies. This study emphasises the significance
    of a systematic and model-driven approach to improving the dependability of IoT
    systems in agriculture, ensuring sustainable and safe implementation.

  explanation: 'Redundancy is a common strategy for improving system reliability,
    as it ensures that if one component fails, there is a backup component that can
    take over and maintain functionality. In an automated irrigation system, this
    could involve using multiple sensors to monitor soil moisture levels or multiple
    controllers to manage water flow. By implementing redundant components, the system
    can continue to operate even if one of the components fails.


    Implementing redundant components, such as duplicate sensors (e.g., soil moisture
    sensors, weather stations), controllers (e.g., PLCs, microcontrollers), and communication
    channels (e.g., cellular, satellite, LoRaWAN), can increase the system''s resilience
    to component failures and maintain operational continuity during component failures.'

    Agriculture plays a crucial role in providing sustenance and employment opportunities
    to millions of people around the world. As the global population continues to
    grow exponentially, there is an increasing demand for food production. Unfortunately,
    the amount of cultivable land is limited and is rapidly dwindling due to urbanisation
    and environmental degradation [1,2]. Therefore, there is a pressing need to improve
    crop yields to meet the growing demand for food. Modern farming techniques can
    optimise every aspect of the crop production process, from planting to harvesting.
    Precision agriculture, Solar Insecticidal Lamp Internet of Things (SIL-IoTs),
    and many other innovative ideas leverage technology to achieve this optimisation
    [3,4,5]. By prioritising sustainable and efficient farming practices, it is possible
    to ensure that agriculture remains a viable source of sustenance and employment
    for generations to come. Through efficient implementation of these smart techniques,
    farmers can increase their yield and improve the efficiency of their operations.
    The escalating worldwide water crisis is a significant worry, given the rising
    population and the need for fresh water. To tackle this problem, embracing sustainable
    water usage practices is imperative, particularly in agriculture, where water
    is a crucial resource. A viable solution is the adoption of Smart Irrigation Systems
    (SIS), which can track pertinent factors and regulate physical devices like water
    pumps to minimise water wastage by irrigating only when required [6,7]. Furthermore,
    sustainable farming practices can enhance soil health, reduce greenhouse gas emissions,
    and promote biodiversity [3]. Such approaches can also improve the overall quality
    of the produce and increase the economic sustainability of farming operations.
    The integration of IoT, edge computing, and AI has transformed the landscape of
    farming practices [8]. However, with these innovative approaches come new challenges,
    such as increased complexity, system safety, reliability, trustworthiness, and
    vulnerability [9,10]. To ensure the dependability of these systems, it is essential
    to understand their composition and inner workings and potential failures that
    may arise during operation. This proactive understanding of the system and its
    behaviour will help to mitigate risks from the design time and optimise the efficiency
    of such systems. In the case of large-scale smart farming, the failure of these
    systems can have devastating consequences on nature, people, agricultural production,
    and finances. Therefore, conducting a credible failure analysis of IoT-based technology
    during the conceptual design phase is crucial to ensure the development of safe
    and reliable IoT-based agricultural systems. While in this study we focus on the
    qualitative failure analysis of the IoT system, a recent overview of physical
    security and safety issues in IoT can be found in [11]. Failure analysis methods
    are indispensable in safety-critical domains, encompassing diverse sectors like
    aviation, automobiles, and industrial control systems [12]. Among these methods,
    Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) stands out as a widely acknowledged and highly effective
    technique for analysing failures in safety-critical systems [13]. By employing
    graphical models, FTA provides a systematic representation of the logical connections
    between failures and their root causes, offering valuable insights into potential
    vulnerabilities and areas for improvement in complex systems. The structured and
    methodical FTA method is an effective approach for identifying potential system
    failures, assessing risks, and developing strategies to prevent them during system
    design [13,14,15]. This approach is particularly useful in examining failures
    across a range of systems, including smart agriculture [13,14,15,16,17,18]. By
    utilising a visual and deductive approach, the FTA method identifies potential
    safety risks, predictive failure of the system, critical failure scenarios, and
    the shortest path to system failure [17,18]. The FTA process involves understanding
    system functions and components, identifying possible failure modes, determining
    the root cause of failures, and proposing corrective actions to address them [19].
    The FTA method remains a well-established approach for assessing the safety and
    reliability of agricultural systems, contributing to improved performance and
    enhanced productivity. Therefore, incorporating the FTA method into the iterative
    design process of smart agricultural systems ensures that safety considerations
    evolve with the system design, promoting ongoing improvement and cultivating a
    proactive risk management culture within the agricultural industry. Despite the
    wide adoption of the FTA model as a safety analysis method, the reliance on FT
    has some inherent limitations, such as being a manual process, not supporting
    reusability, being prone to human errors, and becoming cumbersome when the failure
    behaviour becomes complicated [13,20]. Model-driven approaches are being adopted
    from the functional system design domain to the safety analysis environment to
    overcome these challenges and keep up with the latest advancements in the overall
    system design approach. In the model-driven environment, the Model-Based Systems
    Engineering (MBSE) approach is rich with various system models and diagrams, which
    can effectively model system architecture, and through their extension, model
    failure behaviour that can be viable for Model-Based Safety Analysis (MBSA) [21].
    Recent studies in the safety analysis domain are now proposing the utilisation
    of MBSA approaches for the generation of the FTA process to simplify design trade-offs,
    increase IoT design flexibility, and reduce cost and time-to-market constraints
    [22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31]. This study utilises the use of the MBSA paradigm
    to create an FTA model of an IoT-based SIS in a SysML environment for a viable
    safety assessment. It is worth noting that although IoT-based agricultural systems
    are gaining more trust from the public, the MBSA approach of safety analysis is
    not being used as much in the intelligent agricultural domain as it is in other
    safety-critical domains. However, the failure of monitoring systems in agriculture
    can have a significant impact on food security and result in enormous financial
    loss. This article presents a novel MBSA approach for safety analysis of an IoT-based
    SIS. The framework leverages IoT-based SIS and focuses on the conceptual design
    phase to identify potential failure behaviours of the system. It generates detailed
    failure models for the system and its components, formalising them through MBSA-generated
    FTA diagrams. The method’s granular flexibility enables a better understanding
    of how individual component failures can cause system-wide safety problems, thereby
    improving system dependability and failure risk mitigation. The framework’s efficacy
    is demonstrated through a case study of IoT-based SIS. This approach represents
    a significant step towards proactive and comprehensive failure analysis in innovative
    agricultural ecosystems, aligning technological advancements with the goal of
    system analysis approaches. The article is divided into sections to provide a
    comprehensive overview of the IoT’s role in smart agriculture. It begins with
    an introduction and then moves on to Section 2, which provides a comprehensive
    overview of IoT’s role in smart agriculture. This is followed by a review of manual
    safety analysis methods in Section 3, and MBSA methods are covered in Section
    4. Furthermore, Section 5 then describes the proposed framework in detail and
    demonstrates its application in a case study, which can be found in Section 6.
    This article concludes with Section 7, summarising the key points discussed and
    suggesting potential areas for future research. 2. Applications of IoT in Smart
    Agriculture This section provides a detailed overview of how IoT technology is
    leveraged to promote sustainable and intelligent farming practices. From monitoring
    soil moisture levels to tracking livestock, the IoT has revolutionised how agriculture
    is managed and optimised for greater productivity and efficiency. 2.1. Smart Irrigation
    System Freshwater scarcity is a critical global challenge that we must address,
    as only 2.5 % of Earth’s water supply is freshwater, with a mere 31.3 % available
    for human use, with the rest being in the form of glaciers or ice caps [32,33].
    Agriculture consumes a vast amount of this resource, and as the demand for food
    increases, it is essential to manage water resources efficiently [34]. IoT technology
    offers a promising solution. By combining sensor networks, smart tech, and the
    Internet, we can measure critical parameters like soil moisture and temperature
    to enable real-time data analysis for accurate irrigation control [35]. With the
    integration of microcontrollers and wireless communication, IoT tech can facilitate
    the development of automated irrigation systems that conserve up to 90 % of water
    compared with traditional methods [36]. Several studies have proposed the use
    of an integrated sensor/actuator node network to measure various physical parameters
    such as soil moisture, air temperature, humidity, water level, water flow, and
    luminous intensity [37,38]. Leveraging smart Internet-based technology can help
    optimise water usage and improve crop yield, contributing to long-term resource
    sustainability. By incorporating IoT tech in agriculture, a comprehensive solution
    to freshwater scarcity can be provided, leading to better water conservation and
    benefiting farmers, consumers, and the environment. 2.2. Pest Control and Plant
    Disease Monitoring The agricultural industry has experienced significant changes
    due to the IoT, particularly in pest control and plant disease monitoring [39].
    Farmers can now utilise advanced deep learning methods to identify pests, diseases,
    weeds, and yield and assess soil suitability for different crops. With the help
    of image processing, machine learning, and Logistic Decision Regression (LDR),
    researchers have achieved impressive accuracy rates in detecting pests and plant
    diseases, leading to better crop management practices and improved yields [39,40,41].
    Smart agriculture has been introduced which utilises an IoT architecture that
    employs deep learning techniques to detect insects, diseases, weeds, and soil
    nutrients and predict crop yield with greater accuracy. This has revolutionised
    the industry, as sensor data have improved the accuracy and reliability of disease
    detection through innovative data analysis methods. Recently, there has been a
    surge of interest in using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image analysis,
    which have the potential to further enhance the accuracy and speed of disease
    detection. CNNs effectively identify plant diseases, pests, and nutrient deficiencies
    and predict crop yield [42,43]. Integrating IoT with advanced deep learning methods
    has transformed the agricultural industry, paving the way for innovative solutions
    to old problems. More farmers are expected to embrace this technology in the coming
    years, leading to increased productivity and better crop management practices.
    2.3. Use of Drones and Harvesting Robots The agricultural industry has significantly
    transformed since the introduction of drones and IoT devices. These advanced technologies
    have revolutionised traditional cultivation methods by reducing physical strain
    and streamlining the process [44]. The introduction of intelligent agricultural
    systems has paved the way for implementing innovative methods to monitor soil
    conditions, spray pesticides and fertilisers, and transmit sensor data for analysis
    [45]. Drones have emerged as one of the most promising tools in agriculture. With
    high-resolution cameras, they can capture images of crops from an aerial view,
    providing farmers with an accurate measurement of crop damage caused by pests
    or weather, especially in challenging terrain [46]. They can also monitor crop
    growth and identify areas that require fertilisation or irrigation. In addition
    to drones, agricultural robots integrated with IoT devices and sensors are used
    for various tasks such as seedling, harvesting, weed detection, and pest control.
    These robots are designed to operate autonomously and can be programmed to perform
    specific tasks with precision and accuracy. Moreover, they can collect and transmit
    data in real time, enabling farmers to make informed decisions and take corrective
    actions quickly. Developed nations are adopting these technologies to enhance
    agricultural efficiency while minimising costs and time [47,48]. Implementing
    IoT devices and drones in agriculture can potentially increase crop yields, reduce
    labour costs, and minimise the use of harmful chemicals [49]. Therefore, integrating
    these advanced technologies in the agricultural industry is a significant step
    towards creating a sustainable future for the world. 2.4. Vertical Farming and
    Smart Greenhouse Vertical Farming (VF) has emerged as a modern agricultural technique
    wherein crops are grown on vertically inclined surfaces, predominantly in high-rise
    buildings. This innovative practice has gained immense popularity in recent years,
    owing to its ability to offer several advantages beyond food security. As per
    Kalantari et al. [50], VF has the potential to revamp urban design and architecture,
    augment food safety and security, and reduce environmental pollution. With the
    rapid advancement of digital technologies, IoT devices, artificial intelligence,
    and other cutting-edge technologies are increasingly being incorporated into VF.
    According to Siregar et al. [51], IoT devices and AI are being employed to monitor
    and control VF environments, and researchers such as those found in [52,53,54]
    have proposed methodologies that integrate sensors and IoT techniques for smart
    VF. Additionally, Kaur et al. [55,56] demonstrated how hydroponic VF could be
    carried out using IoT-based sensors with minimal water and soil usage. By harnessing
    these innovative ideas, VF has the potential to enhance crop yields while minimising
    resource usage, making it an attractive option for sustainable agriculture. Apart
    from IoT and machine learning, studies also explore using artificial intelligence
    to build smart greenhouses. For instance, Maraveas and Chrysanthos [57] conducted
    a detailed review of AI’s use in building smart greenhouses and explored methods
    to optimise their usability. Also, Gracia et al. [58] reviewed the usage of Artificial
    Neural Networks (ANNs) in greenhouse technology and proposed models to integrate
    IoT devices and ML for innovative agriculture development. Therefore, integrating
    cutting-edge technologies like IoT and AI in VF has immense potential to transform
    crop growth, enhance food security, and reduce environmental impact. 2.5. Tracking
    and Monitoring Livestock Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) is a modern approach
    that utilises IoT technologies to provide farmers with advanced tools for monitoring
    cattle behaviour, diagnosing diseases, managing their welfare, and improving overall
    management [59,60]. In recent years, significant progress has been made in developing
    web and mobile applications that use sensors and IoT devices to monitor livestock
    behaviour and environmental factors. Researchers have identified key technologies
    that have proven effective in PLF, including Radio Frequency Identification (RFID),
    Global Positioning Satellite (GPS), Digital Twin technology, and AI [60,61]. These
    technologies have improved data collection and analysis efficiency, enabling farmers
    to make informed decisions about their livestock. Furthermore, researchers have
    proposed efficient methods for monitoring cattle behaviour and environmental factors
    using indoor Ultra-WideBand (UWB) location data, accelerometer data, and automatic
    monitoring systems based on sensors. These methods allow farmers to monitor their
    cattle more accurately and in real time, improving the overall health and well-being
    of the animals. Additionally, smart geofencing methods that rely on IoT and General
    Packet Radio Service (GPRS) have been suggested for remote monitoring and controlling
    cattle, making it easier for farmers to monitor their livestock from a distance
    [61]. Other methods for herd location monitoring using Bluetooth and GPS have
    also been proposed, making it easier for farmers to track the location of their
    animals and ensure their safety and security. IoT technologies in PLF have transformed
    the livestock industry, allowing farmers to leverage advanced tools and technologies
    to manage their livestock more efficiently and effectively [62]. With continued
    advancements in this field, we can expect to see even more innovative solutions
    that will further improve the quality of life for livestock and enhance sustainability.
    2.6. Effects of Sensor-Based IoT Device Failures in Smart Agriculture As the demand
    for sustainable and efficient agricultural production grows, farmers are increasingly
    adopting smart farming practices that rely on IoT technology. However, these practices
    come with risks. If the sensor-based IoT devices used in agriculture fail, it
    can have severe consequences for the entire system. The impact can range from
    environmental pollution to decreased crop yields or even famine. In the long run,
    these hazards can also damage soil health and fertility, crop disease control,
    supply chain management, and farmers’ trust in IoT technology. These risks can
    lead to economic collapse in rural areas, affecting farmers and related industries.
    Therefore, it is crucial to develop strategies to mitigate the risks associated
    with sensor-based IoT device failure in agriculture, particularly given that harsh
    weather conditions can make these devices prone to failure. 3. Overview of Manual
    Failure Analysis Methods Failure analysis is a systematic approach to investigate
    and comprehend the underlying causes of failures in various systems, products,
    or processes [26]. The primary objective of failure analysis is to prevent similar
    failures from happening in the future [12]. Failure analysis is extensively employed
    to analyse potential safety-related issues in domains where safety is critical.
    It is crucial to perform appropriate failure analysis on the conceptual design
    of IoT-based agricultural systems to ensure the design is safe and dependable
    [63]. Safety and reliability analysis are the two most significant dependability
    attributes, and they are used extensively in many safety-critical sectors. Below
    is a discussion of some of the well-known failure analysis methods. 3.1. Failure
    Mode and Effects Analysis Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is a proactive
    approach in safety-critical domains. It identifies and evaluates the potential
    failure modes of a system, assessing their impact on safety, reliability, and
    performance [14,64]. FMEAs are often attributed to the US military, who first
    utilised this technique in the late 1940s to mitigate potential failures and minimise
    sources of variation during munitions production [20,65]. Notably, FMEA is also
    used for failure analysis of smart agriculture [66]. Using FMEA, critical components
    and functions are identified, and failure modes are evaluated based on their severity,
    probability of occurrence, and detectability [67,68]. The Risk Priority Number
    (RPN) is calculated for each failure mode, and necessary mitigation strategies
    are adopted. High-RPN failure modes are prioritised through improved design, redundancy,
    maintenance, or additional safety measures [67]. 3.2. Bayesian Network A Bayesian
    Network (BN) is a sophisticated probabilistic model that is extensively utilised
    in various engineering domains, particularly in testing and verifying the safety
    properties of IoT systems. Employing a BN model aids in recognising and reducing
    risks by representing interdependencies and uncertainties [65]. The safety problem
    is defined, relevant components are identified, and probabilistic dependencies
    are established to achieve the utilisation of the BN model in the safety analysis.
    Numerical values are then assigned to calculate the probability of specific events
    occurring. Each variable is represented as a node, and the directed edges between
    nodes indicate the probabilistic dependencies between the variables [65,69,70].
    The Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs) specify the probabilistic relationships
    for each node based on the values of its parent nodes. The Bayesian Network supports
    both qualitative and quantitative analysis. Qualitative analysis involves graphical
    representation, while quantitative analysis involves assigning numerical values
    to the parameters in the BN, such as conditional probabilities in CPTs, to calculate
    the probability of a specific event occurring or estimate the likelihood of different
    events [18,71]. 3.3. Markov Analysis Model The Markov model is a mathematical
    framework used to study systems that change over time through a sequence of discrete
    states. It is beneficial for analysing systems with memoryless properties [72].
    These are systems where the future state depends only on the current state and
    not on the sequence of states that came before it. The model assumes that a system
    exists in one of several discrete states at any given time and can move to another
    state with specific probabilities [73]. A state transition matrix that captures
    these transition probabilities defines the system’s behaviour. Markov models are
    often used to analyse the behaviour of systems based on the exponential distribution
    of failure. The steady-state probabilities of the model can be calculated by solving
    the system of linear equations defined by the model [73]. 3.4. Petri Net A Petri
    Net is an essential graphical and mathematical modelling approach for analysing
    and describing intricate, concurrent, and distributed systems. It is a highly
    effective method for modelling and understanding systems in which multiple entities
    interact asynchronously and dynamically [65]. Typically, PNs are denoted as four-tuple
    N = (P, T, A, K), a bipartite graph that we discuss in detail below: 𝑃={ 𝑝 1 ,
    𝑝 2 , 𝑝 3 ,…, 𝑝 𝑛 } is a finite set of places: Places represent states or conditions
    within the system. They are typically depicted as circles or ovals in a PN diagram.
    𝑇={ 𝑡 1 , 𝑡 2 , 𝑡 3 ,…, 𝑡 𝑛 } is a finite set of transitions: Transitions represent
    events or actions that can occur within the system. These are typically depicted
    as rectangles in the diagram. Transitions cause changes in the system’s state
    by consuming tokens from input places and producing tokens in output places. 𝐴⊆(𝑃×𝑇)∪(𝑇×𝑃)
    is a finite set of arcs: Arcs (also known as edges) connect from places to transitions
    or transitions to places, indicating the flow of tokens between them. There are
    two types of arcs: Input Arcs and Output Arcs. 𝐾={1,2,3,…} is a finite set of
    tokens: Tokens are small symbols or markers. Each place can hold a certain number
    of tokens, representing the presence or availability of resources, objects, or
    entities. They can move between places through transitions, following the defined
    flow of arcs. The PN model follows basic rules for activating transitions based
    on the availability of input tokens. The behaviour of PNs is determined by the
    movement of tokens and interaction between transitions. Coloured, timed, and stochastic
    PNs are variations of PNs that address specific aspects of system modelling and
    analysis [65,74,75]. An example of a simple PN is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1.
    Example of a Petri Net model. 3.5. Fault Tree Analysis The FTA method is a systematic
    graphical methodology widely used in engineering, safety, and risk assessment
    to thoroughly analyse the causes of failures within complex systems. It originated
    in 1962 at Bell Phone Laboratories and was initially crafted to evaluate the failure
    behaviours of the launch control system of the LGM-30 Minuteman intercontinental
    ballistic missile (ICBM) as part of the United States’ strategic deterrent forces
    [20,76]. Over the years, FTA has evolved into a pivotal tool for failure analysis,
    finding applications in diverse domains, including industrial safety-critical
    systems, and gaining momentum in IoT-based applications. FTA’s versatility is
    evident across various applications, spanning safety analysis in smart homes [77,78]
    to generic IoT systems [79,80], electric vehicles [81], industrial fire detection
    and prevention systems [82], industrial robots [17], self-healing industrial systems
    [83], and cyberphysical systems [15]. Additionally, FTA has successfully analysed
    the failure behaviour of smart agriculture systems [76,84], showcasing its adaptability
    across diverse domains. The FTA technique systematically identifies factors contributing
    to system failures and assesses the probability of such failures, solidifying
    its position as one of the most prominent techniques for dependability analysis.
    Recognising its significance, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)
    has endorsed FTA as a leading method for failure analysis [13,85,86]. In Figure
    2, the FTA model employs a logical and graphical diagram to pinpoint critical
    components for improvement, preventing future failures. The diagram outlines the
    hierarchy of events and utilises logic gates such as AND, OR, and Voting gates
    to model different systems’ behaviour. In an AND gate, all child events must occur
    for the parent event, whereas in an OR gate, any single child event can activate
    the parent event. The Voting gate requires a specific number of events (e.g.,
    2 out of 3), as the diagram indicates. The green triangle symbol facilitates the
    breakdown of the tree into smaller components for more accessible representation.
    Figure 2. Example of a fault tree. The fault tree is constructed using a top-down
    approach, starting with a top event causing the overall system failure. This top
    event is then decomposed into intermediate events using logic gates, representing
    the immediate causes of the top event. The recursive breakdown continues until
    the analysis reaches the component level failure or root causes that cannot be
    further decomposed. The ultimate goal is to assess how the top event will occur
    in the tree, representing the system failure. The analysis can be conducted qualitatively
    and quantitatively. Qualitative analysis involves obtaining Minimal Cut Sets (MCSs),
    the smallest combinations of root causes or basic events (BEs) leading to system
    failure. Identifying MCSs helps understand critical combinations of component
    failures or events. On the other hand, quantitative analysis uses failure rates
    of components or probabilities of root causes to predict system failure. Considering
    the type of logic gates used between events, the system failure probability can
    be calculated [12,20]. While FTA possesses strengths shown in Table 1, such as
    providing a structured approach for failure analysis, there are also acknowledged
    weaknesses [12,20]. These include the potential for human error in tree creation,
    a cumbersome process, lack of support for reusability, and inherent limitations
    of manual-based system analysis methods. Table 1. Strengths of Fault Tree Analysis
    Approach. 4. Model-Based Approach in Safety Analysis of IoT Several approaches
    in MBSA have been developed to model both functional and nonfunctional properties
    of modern and embedded systems, including those in the IoT environment. These
    modern and formal methods utilise modelling languages that draw from general engineering
    models or domain-specific models and profiles. In contrast to manual safety analysis
    techniques used with informal models discussed in Section 3, MBSA approaches have
    been developed to automate and semiautomate the process. These computer-based
    approaches facilitate safety analysis and support various aspects of system design.
    MBSA approaches can generate compositional analysable safety artefacts based on
    systematic modelling of systems’ static, dynamic, and failure behavioural patterns
    using existing modelling languages and their extensibility mechanisms. The MBSA
    approaches are model-driven and can manage system complexity while performing
    coherent, formalised, structured, and rigorous system safety analysis. Safety
    analysis approaches have been developed using various modelling languages, including
    Unified Modelling Language (UML), SysML, and Architecture Analysis and Design
    Language (AADL) as well as Hierarchically Performed Hazard Origin and Propagation
    Studies (HiP-HOPS) [20,31,87,88]. Additionally, these models are unambiguous,
    based on standardisation and various automation support tools, and possess a high
    level of abstraction to model the heterogeneity of IoT-based systems. The proposed
    approach used in this study is based on the UML/SysML modelling approach. 4.1.
    The Unified Modelling Language UML is a powerful modelling language that enables
    one to systematically visualise a system using modelling diagrams and conduct
    a formal analysis. It is widely used for systems and software specifications and
    can be customised to suit specific domains. With numerous diagrams and extensions,
    UML can effectively describe a system’s components, hierarchy, and states. UML
    diagrams are grouped into two categories: behaviour and structure [30]. Behaviour
    diagrams capture the system’s dynamic behaviour, while structure diagrams describe
    the system’s static structure. Some popular UML diagrams include activity, state
    machine, sequencing, timing, use case, class, and component diagrams. UML is a
    reliable tool for high-quality modelling of safety-critical systems and has been
    adopted as a standard by the Object Management Group [29]. 4.2. System Modelling
    Language The SysML is a general-purpose graphical modelling language that was
    developed in 2003 on top of the UML specifically for system development, such
    as software, hardware interactions, and dependencies, among others [22,28]. The
    SysML is similar to UML; however, some diagrams in UML were removed, and others
    more specific to system engineering design were added. Two groups of SysML diagrams
    can be used to describe a system: behaviour and structure. The behaviour diagram
    showcases how the system operates, while the structure diagram highlights the
    system’s static structure. Popular SysML diagrams that are widely used include
    the block definition diagram (BDD), internal block diagram (IBD), parametric,
    and state machine diagram (SMD) [27]. A Broad List of SysML diagrams that can
    be used for various modelling of system features is shown in Figure 3, and a high-level
    description of the diagrams is provided in Table 2. Figure 3. SysML Diagrams.
    Table 2. Overview of some of the Notable UML/SysML Diagrams. The uniqueness of
    both UML and SysML is their extension mechanisms, which are known as profiles.
    A UML/SysML profile defines an extension of the language in terms of stereotypes
    (concepts in the target domain) and tagged values (the attributes of the stereotypes).
    For instance, the UML profile for Modelling and Analysis of Real-Time and Embedded
    Systems (MARTE) provides an analysis framework called the Quantitative Analysis
    Model (GQAM), enabling performance specification in UML models. The Dependability
    Analysis Modelling (DAM) is a domain-specific profile of SysML designed to address
    safety concerns such as safety metrics, transitions from safe to failure states,
    and triggers leading to those transitions. In a safety analysis based on MBSA
    approaches, the static structure of the system and its components are annotated
    with failure behaviours, and the resulting models are transformed to develop system-level
    failure analysis models [26]. Studies have been conducted using SysML/UML to develop
    FT and FMEA [28,89,90,91,92]. Various methodologies have been used for FTA generation,
    such as transforming the MBSA design developed in SysML using IBD and SMD to FTA
    artefacts based on a failure mapping pattern [25]. Other approaches have used
    programming languages to parse the XML model file generated from the source model
    and automate a formal model. Notably, the XML file of the source model was parsed
    in the Python language to safety analysis artefacts [93], ATLAS Transformation
    Language (ATL) [24], and Eclipse Modelling Framework [23]. The MBSA offers several
    advantages, including a composition that enables an easy understanding of the
    effects of altering one or more components or subsystems on the entire system’s
    safety assurance. Additionally, it supports reusability, reduces human errors,
    and facilitates iterative system design. 5. Proposed Safety Analysis Approach
    The approach proposed in Figure 4 uses the MBSE method, which combines the benefits
    of MBSA and safety analysis models. This technique preserves the advantages of
    MBSA over other static FTA methods while establishing the link between the IoT
    system architecture and the analysis models. Figure 4. Proposed MBSA framework.
    The MBSA framework described in Figure 4 for modelling of an IoT-based SIS involves
    a systematic process, utilising SysML diagrams and software tools compatible with
    SysML for precise modelling of the IoT system. The open-source SysML-compatible
    tool Papyrus was employed to initiate the analysis, seamlessly integrating with
    other Eclipse-based tools. This tool creates models that accurately represent
    the system’s static, functional aspects, and failure behaviours. The first step
    in our proposed approach involves creating diagrams that capture the static architecture,
    functional behaviour, and potential failure scenarios of the system in the SysML
    environment using Papyrus–Eclipse-based open-source software (Website for Papyrus
    tool: https://eclipse.dev/papyrus/). This includes creating SysML diagrams such
    as BDD, IBD, and SMD to build a comprehensive model of the IoT system’s architecture,
    functional structure, and failure characteristics. The created diagrams are then
    combined using a specific methodology, which we define in the subsequent section,
    to create the FTA from the models. Notably, the failure behaviours of each component
    are annotated using a DAM profile, transforming the source model into a formal
    analysable model for safety analyses. The DAM profile defines stereotypes, tagged
    values, and constraints, which are applied to the SysML SMD model to accurately
    articulate the system’s failure behaviour. Once the DAM profile is imported, aligned
    with the SMD diagram, and configured with DAM stereotypes, the Papyrus software
    tool facilitates a seamless transition, bridging static and functional modelling
    for fault tree generation. The fault tree logic is specified to generate the fault
    tree automatically, providing the necessary input for the tool. To ensure a high
    level of consistency and accuracy in our methodology, we heavily depend on Papyrus’s
    robust support for SysML and the DAM profile throughout our process. Alongside
    Papyrus, we incorporate other software tools, such as Drawio (Drawio tool website:
    https://app.diagrams.net/), to streamline the transition from SysML modelling
    to fault tree generation. Our overarching approach adheres to the MBSA framework,
    supports iterative system development, provides a systematic and structured method
    for constructing an FTA and conducts a qualitative safety analysis of the IoT-based
    SIS. In the subsequent section, we delve into the intricacies of this process,
    providing a comprehensive understanding of our methodology. 5.1. Static System
    Modelling To create the system’s static architecture model, we utilised BDD to
    represent the system’s different compositions and hierarchical structures. We
    divided the system into components using predefined blocks that logically indicate
    the system’s hardware and software. Additionally, we defined relationships among
    the components and the overall system regarding dependencies, generalisations,
    associations, aggregation, and inheritance. 5.2. Functional Configuration Modelling
    To develop the failure behaviour of an IoT system, it is crucial to have a comprehensive
    understanding of its internal structure. One way to achieve this is by creating
    an IBD representing the system’s properties and interconnections. This visualises
    the system’s decomposition, facilitating an understanding of how information flows
    between its elements. The IBD depicts the system’s internal configuration using
    its components, ports, and data flows. The IBD illustrates how a malfunction can
    propagate throughout the system by combining connectivity and flow. A well-defined
    internal structure and an understanding of its behaviour are fundamental to ensuring
    system safety and reliability. By providing a visual representation of the system’s
    properties, interconnections, and internal configuration in an MBSA environment,
    these diagrams facilitate an understanding of the system’s behaviour, identifying
    potential malfunctions and designing measures to mitigate them. 5.3. Failure Annotation
    To effectively model the failure behaviour of a system, it is essential to understand
    its functional features and the nominal state of each component. This involves
    analysing the system’s overall function, any redundancy designed into the system,
    and the behavioural characteristics of individual components. It is necessary
    to depict how the system elements can fail, how they change from one state to
    another, and the conditions that cause these changes. SMDs display the different
    states of the components and how their state can change. Using the system’s decomposed
    BDD, various nominal and failure states of the system are developed, along with
    their corresponding transitions and triggers, as SMDs. However, more than SMDs
    are needed to provide all the necessary information to model the failure features
    of an IoT system. To address this, the SMD was extended through the use of the
    DAM Profile, a UML extension mechanism that models the metamodel of the system.
    The DAM Profile is particularly effective for failure modelling through its stereotypes,
    such as DaStep, which represents the failure and error states of the system. The
    tag value under DaStep represents the transitions and triggers of the components.
    Using the DAM Profile, unique stereotypes and tag values can be applied to annotate
    the failure of system components accurately. The Data-Intensive Computing Environment
    (DICE)-integrated simulation environment was employed to achieve this goal. 5.4.
    Component Fault Tree Generation In the paradigm of MBSA, it is possible to convert
    a source MBSA model into a target safety artefact by creating links between the
    two. The ultimate goal is to produce an executable model to analyse the system’s
    safety. To achieve this, it is essential to have a comprehensive understanding
    of both the source and target languages. Our approach involves transforming SysML
    SMDs into component-based models that can be analysed to determine the contribution
    of each component to the overall system failure. This approach simplifies the
    iterative design process by enabling the replacement of components with a higher
    failure rate and more resilience. The resulting component-based model is generated
    via failure modelling, identifying potential failures and enhancing overall system
    safety. To create a component-level fault tree (CFT), each system component failure
    represented as SMDs is mapped to obtain the corresponding component tree, generating
    several trees that can be studied to detect possible failures. 5.5. System Fault
    Tree Generation The system-level FT is a target model designed to conduct a comprehensive
    system failure analysis. It combines individual FTA models of system components
    to create a single, unified tree structure using the system’s IBD. The IBD instances
    are utilised to merge the various CFTs. This allows the model to represent the
    relationship between components based on their configuration in the IBD. Static
    gates are employed to illustrate the configuration of the components better. For
    instance, an OR gate indicates series configurations where the system fails if
    any components fail. On the other hand, an AND gate is utilised for parallel configurations
    where the system only fails if all components fail. This level of detail allows
    the model to predict potential failures and their causes more accurately. At the
    top of the tree, the undesired event represents the overall failure of the system.
    Prior to that, the previous top-level undesired events in each component FTs are
    intermediate events. This detailed approach allows for a more thorough understanding
    of the system’s potential points of failure and can help identify areas for improvement
    and optimisation. 6. Illustrative Example To demonstrate our proposed MBSA approach,
    we used the IoT-based Smart Irrigation System presented in Figure 5. Using this
    system, a farmer can remotely monitor the status of a field and control the water
    pump(s) to irrigate the field whenever needed without being physically present
    in the field. In normal operating conditions, this system will monitor different
    parameters of a field, and based on the monitoring knowledge, it will decide when
    and for how long to irrigate the field. It uses a temperature sensor (TS) and
    a moisture sensor (MS) for monitoring. TS monitors the temperature of the field,
    and MS monitors the soil moisture. TS and MS continuously sense the respective
    parameters and report them to the IoT gateway/controller for further processing.
    The communication between the sensors and the IoT gateway takes place via a wireless
    medium. An Arduino board or Raspberry Pi can be considered as an IoT gateway.
    A battery powers the board. The IoT gateway converts the analogue signals received
    from the sensors to digital values and sends these values to the edge cloud server.
    The communication between the edge cloud server and the gateway occurs through
    a wireless medium. Figure 5. Architecture of an IoT-based Smart Irrigation System.
    6.1. Static System Modelling To create a formal system composition using the MBSA
    approach, it is crucial to have static configuration modelling. The system’s functional
    components and dependencies are depicted in the BDD shown in Figure 6, with SIS
    as the context. Direct composition relationships and SysML relationship link symbols
    were utilised to represent composite blocks in the system. Figure 6. Block definition
    diagram model of an IoT-based Smart Irrigation System. 6.2. Internal Configuration
    System Modelling The IBD Model of the system is crucial for effectively utilising
    MBSA modelling in system architecture. The SysML IBD depicts the system’s context
    and intricate, interdependent relationships among its components, accurately portraying
    data flow through ports and item flow symbols. The context blocks in SIS accurately
    represent interactions between different components as depicted in Figure 7. Figure
    7. Internal block diagram model of an IoT-based Smart Irrigation System. 6.3.
    Failure Annotation Modelling of the System In the provided Figure 8a,b, the failure
    annotations of two system components, namely the temperature sensor and power
    source, are displayed based on the SysML SMD. The metamodel was extended using
    the DAM Profile. In the SysML extension mechanism, DAM Stereotypes DaStep extends
    the SysML parent model to represent the state of failure and error in the system.
    The tag value under DaStep describes the transitions and triggers of the components.
    The nominal and failure states of the components are shown, where the failure
    states are represented by no output from the temperature sensor and power source
    failure. DAM stereotypes represent the transitions and triggers of the components
    to illustrate the failure and error states. The extended SMDs include failure
    to capture sensor readings, false sensor readings, and loss of control. The transition
    link indicates the triggers responsible for the state change, and various triggers
    are defined for other system components. Figure 8. Example of failure annotation,
    (a) failure annotation of a temperature sensor and (b) failure annotation of a
    power source. 6.4. Model Transformation from MBSE Model to FT 6.4.1. Component
    Fault Tree Generation To create the corresponding CFT, each system component’s
    one-to-one SMDs are mapped. In the CFT, the component’s overall failure is TE,
    while the IEs represent various functional states’ failure or error deviation.
    BE represents their triggers. To illustrate, the SMDs created in Figure 8a,b are
    mapped to their respective CFTs, as shown in Figure 9. Figure 9. Mapping of component
    state machine diagram to component fault tree for (a) a temperature sensor and
    (b) a power source. 6.4.2. System Fault Tree Generation The different components’
    fault trees generated are mapped based on the instances of the components in the
    system’s IBD. Accordingly, the overall system FT of SIS obtained is presented
    in Figure 10. The TE denotes the system failure condition, which is “the failure
    of the system to irrigate the field when needed”. The list of BEs and IEs and
    their description representing various basic device failures or communication
    failures between devices is provided in Table A1 in Appendix A. Figure 10. Fault
    tree generated for IoT-enabled SIS. 6.5. Qualitative Failure Analysis of the System
    Depending on the role(s) of a component in the system and its interactions with
    other components in the system, the failure of the component can have an enormous
    impact on the failure of the system. Therefore, this system’s qualitative failure
    behaviour analysis aims to identify its potential causes. For failure behaviour
    analysis, we identified “the failure of the system to irrigate the field when
    needed” as a system failure condition. Considering this event as the top event
    of the fault tree, we developed the fault tree shown in Figure 10. This FT contains
    19 unique basic events and the root causes that can contribute to the system failure.
    These root causes are either an internal failure of the devices or the failure
    of the communication between devices. As seen in Figure 10, physical damage to
    the sensors or erroneous readings from the sensors is considered as the failure
    of the TS and MS, which are represented by the events TSF (temperature sensor
    failure) and MSF (moisture sensor failure). In the fault tree, five basic events—FCRG,
    FCGC, FCFC, FCTG, and FCMG—represent communication failures between system components.
    Note that, due to simplicity and brevity, we considered these communication failure-related
    events at an abstract level. This means we do not decompose these events further
    to show why a particular communication failure occurs. However, one can explore
    these events further by considering all the causes of a typical wireless communication
    failure. Similarly, the failure of the edge cloud is presented by the event ICS
    (internal failure of the edge cloud server) due to simplicity. Again, this event
    can be decomposed further by considering many potential causes of a cloud server
    failure, including hardware and software failures. We analysed the fault tree
    in Figure 10 to identify the MCSs and obtained 94 MCSs; each of these MCSs can
    cause the system to fail. Out of these 94 MCSs, 71 MCSs are of order 2 and 23
    are of order 1. The order of an MCS represents the number of basic events contributing
    to that MCS. If all the basic events are equally probable to occur, then the higher
    the order of an MCS, the lower the criticality of that MCS is. Therefore, in this
    example, the first-order MCSs, such as “Water level is inadequate in the reservoir
    (WLIR)”, “Random Failure of Water Pump (RFWP)”, “Switch Failure (SWF)”, “Internal
    Failure of Relay (IFR)”, “Human Error (HE)”, “Random Failure of Gateway (RFG)”,
    and “Gateway Battery Failure (GBF)”, are the most critical ones. Therefore, actions
    should be taken to reduce the likelihood of these events. For instance, for the
    events related to communication failure, multiple communication media can be considered,
    so that if one medium fails, another can be used for successful communication.
    7. Conclusions The integration of IoT technology into agriculture heralds a transformative
    era, albeit one fraught with challenges, particularly in areas of the dependability
    and trustworthiness of these systems to operate as expected over their mission
    time. Understanding the intricacies of individual component failures and their
    systemic impact is pivotal for ensuring the robust performance of agricultural
    IoT systems. As the agricultural landscape evolves, researchers are at the forefront
    of developing sophisticated analysis and verification frameworks essential for
    fostering intelligent systems contributing to long-term food sustainability. This
    study serves as a testament to the effectiveness of the MBSA approach in dissecting
    the failure behaviour of an abstract IoT-based Smart Irrigation System. Leveraging
    a model-driven methodology, the investigation not only illuminated the nuances
    of system failure but also showcased the MBSA approach’s merits—characterised
    by meticulousness, error reduction, model reuse, and adaptability to iterative
    processes. The fault tree generated through this approach systematically identified
    component failures as basic events, delineating their interconnected pathways
    leading to system failure. This granular analysis empowers stakeholders to pinpoint
    the root causes of system failure and implement remedial measures crucial for
    maintaining operational integrity. While the present study concentrated on qualitative
    analysis, future investigations hold promise in transitioning to quantitative
    assessments by incorporating components’ failure rates or probabilities and considering
    various failure distributions over time. Furthermore, the MBSA approach’s inherent
    flexibility opens avenues for including additional complex failure conditions,
    such as “unnecessary irrigation” or “insufficient irrigation duration”, demonstrating
    its ease of adaptation for diverse failure analyses. In the evolving landscape
    of agricultural technology, security considerations emerge as a paramount concern.
    Acknowledging the potential vulnerabilities to safety failures induced by malevolent
    attacks, future research endeavours should delve into fortifying the system against
    security threats and malicious operations. As we navigate the ever-expanding realm
    of IoT in agriculture, a continuous commitment to robust analysis, adaptability,
    and security considerations will undoubtedly shape the future of sustainable and
    resilient smart farming systems. Lastly, the proposed approach requires scalability,
    which can be achieved using a dynamic FTA. This tool is useful for modelling complex
    systems’ time- and function-dependent failure behaviour. By incorporating a dynamic
    FTA, we will be able to gain a more accurate understanding of how a system behaves
    over time and how different functions and components interact. This information
    can optimise framework performance, reduce risks, and improve the system’s overall
    dependability. Author Contributions Background, A.A. and M.M.R.; proposed methodology,

    Abstract Most studies of open canal automation concentrated on the control of
    single canal pool or cascaded multiple canal pools, neglecting the hydraulic coupling
    effects between the main canal and lateral canals. Low transmission efficiency
    and poor equity of agriculture water delivery may be caused in the practical application
    of large-scale irrigation networks. Considering the high computation and communication
    requirements for large-scale operating systems, a distributed model predictive
    control (DMPC) algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers
    (ADMM) is developed for the branching open canal irrigation systems (BOCISs).
    A simplified BOCIS example, originating from Test case 2 proposed by the American
    Society of Civil Engineers, is used for control tests. Moreover, for control performance
    comparisons and evaluations, centralized model predictive control (CMPC) is employed
    by modifying the state space of the integrator delay (ID) model. The results show
    that the control performance of the proposed DMPC converges to the global optimal
    solution of the CMPC under the normal scenario, and the degradation is less than
    0.35 %. The communication and coordination process of DMPC contributes to more
    powerful robustness and interference immunity than CMPC. Furthermore, in case
    of sudden accidents occurring in some subsystems, the proposed DMPC is more convenient
    and timely to execute fault isolation. The improvements on water level oscillations
    and overshoots can reach 20.3 % and 52.1 % in the other subsystems which need
    normal water delivery, respectively. Equipped with outstanding control characteristics,
    the proposed ADMM-based DMPC framework enables the water authorities of large-scale
    BOCISs to promote surface water distribution in a practicable, flexible, and secure
    way, showing great potential in developing intelligent irrigation districts. Previous

    of multipliers 1. Introduction Compared with backward manual operation methods,
    canal automation technologies represent a more water-saving and efficient alternative
    for the management of open canal systems (OCSs) (Avargani et al., 2022, Lozano
    et al., 2010, Sadowska et al., 2015, Schuurmans et al., 1995, Wahlin and Clemmens,
    2006). Therefore, the last decades have witnessed a continuous generation of contributions
    in this field, but most concentrated on the control of single canal pool or cascaded
    multiple canal pools with no branches (Conde et al., 2021). From a practical point
    of view, the OCSs are always based on a network of multilevel canals with a tree
    topology, like the main, secondary, tertiary, or even more branching canals in
    the hierarchy. Just as individual pools interact with each other in an in-line
    cascaded canal system, individual branches can interact with each other (Wahlin
    and Clemmens, 2006). An improper automatic control system may cause severe oscillations
    of water level or gate movements. Ultimately, the surface water failed to be conveyed
    with high efficiency and equity from the water sources to the customers or farms
    along the multilevel canals. With the development of canal automation, the control
    of branching open canal networks gets more and more attention in the areas of
    inland waterways (Segovia et al., 2019), hydro-power valleys (Maestre et al.,
    2015), polder systems (Aydin et al., 2022), natural river network (Breckpot et
    al., 2013), and others. Notwithstanding, few studies consider the automatic control
    of branching open canal irrigation systems (BOCISs). Elfawal-Mansour et al. (2000)
    used a nonlinear black box model NARX for the control of the Canal de la Bourne,
    a real branching canal system in France that served for irrigation and electricity
    generation. By modifying the Integrator Delay (ID) model, Wahlin and Clemmens
    (2006) developed two centralized controllers of the linear quadratic regulator
    (LQR) and model predictive control (MPC), respectively. Results showed that both
    were able to bring the water level back to the setpoints in a branching canal
    network. Tariq et al. (2012) implemented a cyber-physical system towards the decentralized
    control of real irrigation canal networks in Pakistan, by which a slow response
    speed and risky water level fluctuation resulted. Alvarez et al. (2013) combined
    local controllers with distributed generalized predictive controllers for a Y-shaped
    irrigate canal, but only the head gate of the branch, not all check gates along
    the branch canal, is controlled. Sutrisno et al. (2012) and Zhang et al. (2015)
    proposed distributed model predictive controllers based on Game Theory and Nash
    Optimality, respectively. The former neglected the large delay of the flow and
    only tested a simple water level tracking scenario, while the latter restricted
    the direction of information transferring only from downstream to upstream. Xu
    and Schwanenberg (2017) applied nonlinear MPC with a diffusive wave model to a
    virtual drainage canal network, and achieved a satisfactory outcome with a reasonable
    computation time, though the global optimum was not guaranteed. Nowadays, with
    population growth and the modernization of irrigation districts, the size and
    complexity of the BOCISs have grown enormously. For the control of large-scale
    BOCISs, MPC with distributed control architecture is regarded as a promising control
    scheme (Kordestani et al., 2021). MPC is a control strategy that gets the highest
    attention for agriculture water management (Conde et al., 2021). It is given the
    credit to the versatile abilities to consider constraints in optimization, and
    the possibility of taking into account measurable disturbances (Overloop, 2006).
    The most classical control architecture of MPC is the centralized architecture,
    where systemwide measurements are gathered and a globally optimal solution is
    calculated. However, the huge size and wide geographic distribution of the large-scale
    BOCISs would lead to expensive communication costs and unbearable computing burdens
    (Maestre and Negenborn, 2013, Shi et al., 2021, Tang and Daoutidis, 2019). Simultaneously,
    the communication network-induced issues and the potential concerns of privacy
    and security problems are also unavoidable obstructions to the practical applications
    of centralized MPC (CMPC) (Tang and Daoutidis, 2019). The decentralized control
    architecture is a good choice for its low communication and computational requirements.
    But the neglect of the strong hydraulic interactions among individual pools and
    individual branches would lead to the phenomenon of disturbance amplification
    and poor control performance (Alvarez et al., 2013, Wahlin and Clemmens, 2006).
    In this case, distributed MPC (DMPC) works toward combing the advantages of the
    above two control architectures, though compared with the CMPC, there is some
    performance loss due to the partial knowledge of the entire system (Kordestani
    et al., 2021, Tang and Daoutidis, 2019, Tian, 2015). Specifically, in the DMPC,
    the large-scale system is decomposed into several interconnected subsystems. Then,
    a computing agent (or local controller) is associated with each subsystem and
    makes control decisions, like the decentralized MPC. The distinction between decentralized
    and distributed MPC lies in whether or not the information is exchanged actively
    between the adjacent agents to coordinate their decisions for a consensus, even
    in the case of conflicting goals. The modularization nature of DMPC contributes
    to its high scalability, which is one of the critical characteristics for the
    flexible control of large-scale BOCISs. Furthermore, different subsystems can
    consider diverse control objects and constraints, which distinguishes the DMPC
    from CMPC. In this way, in arid regions or water-deficit scenarios, the limited
    water can be delivered with various attitudes to different subsystems according
    to their water supply objects or crop species, so that better social, irrigation,
    energy, and economic benefits could be achieved. More detailed comparisons between
    different control architectures can be found in the Appendix. Over the last years,
    there has been a growing interest in DMPC for the control of many large-scale
    systems, like smart grids (Shi et al., 2021), waterborne vessels (Zheng et al.,
    2018), water systems (Maestre et al., 2021), traffic control (Li et al., 2020),
    and others. Nevertheless, no single generally accepted distributed algorithm has
    been proposed due to the complexities of various control objects (Maestre and
    Negenborn, 2013). It has been argued that the alternating direction method of
    multipliers (ADMM) is a particularly powerful distributed algorithm blending the
    strong decomposability of the dual ascent method with the excellent convergence
    property of the augmented Lagrange multiplier method (Ghadimi et al., 2015, Li
    et al., 2020, Teixeira et al., 2016). The most attractive feature of ADMM is that
    it is surprisingly guaranteed to converge for all positive values of the step-size
    parameter (Bai et al., 2021). This contrasts many popular distributed algorithms,
    such as dual decomposition methods (Teixeira et al., 2016) and gradient methods
    (Ghadimi et al., 2015), where mistuning of the step size can render the iterations
    unstable. Compared with the distributed techniques based on game theory, whose
    results correspond to a Nash equilibrium, the ADMM yields tighter approximations
    to the overall optimization (Lemos and Pinto, 2012). Moreover, it is recently
    investigated that the powerful ADMM performs outstandingly in dealing with the
    issues of reconfiguration control (Bai et al., 2021), whereby the scalability
    and the plug-and-play functionality are demonstrated. To the best of the authors’
    knowledge, the ADMM algorithm is rarely reported for canal automation studies
    to date. So there are obvious difficulties in coding the complicated communication
    and coordination process of ADMM compared with the relatively mature centralized
    or decentralized control technologies. The main contribution of this paper is
    innovatively providing a reliable and flexible control operating system for the
    BOCISs by ADMM-based DMPC scheme. This work makes it possible to convey the water
    automatically from the water source to the users or farms at the last level canal,
    whereby higher efficiency and equity of water delivery can be guaranteed. Meanwhile,
    the proposed control framework is also vital for the future of intelligent irrigation
    systems, where the stored water in the water source and canal network can be delivered
    timely to the farmlands according to the real-time prediction of irrigation water
    requirements (Avargani et al., 2022). Accordingly, the present study is meaningful
    for precise irrigation and the sustainable development of agricultural water.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the design principles
    of the ADMM-based DMPC controller. The study case and test scenarios are also
    introduced. Section 3 analyses the simulation results, followed by the discussion
    in Section 4. Finally, some concluding remarks are drawn in Section 5. 2. Materials
    and methods 2.1. Model predictive control Model predictive control (MPC) refers
    to a family of control methods that explicitly use a process model of the real
    system to obtain the control actions by minimizing an objective function (Overloop,
    2006). The process model is used to predict the evolution of the system, for which
    the ID model, proposed by Schuurmans et al. (1995) for open canals, is one of
    the most reported. The canal is assumed to be divided into two parts: i) a normal
    depth section with a uniform flow, and ii) a backwater section with an inflow
    delay. Delay time of inflow (τ in min) and average storage area (As in m2) are
    two main model properties, as shown in Eq.(1). (1) where e(t) is the water level
    deviation at the downstream end of the canal pool, m; q1(t-τ) is the inflow deviation
    to the backwater with delay time τ, m3/s; q2(t) is the downstream outflow deviation,
    m3/s; d(t) is the offtake flow deviation according to the irrigation schedule,
    m3/s. The deviation means the difference between the instantaneous value and the
    initial steady-state value. Based on the process model in discrete time, a state
    space is constructed to forecast the system dynamics over the prediction horizon,
    see Eq.(2). x(k+1) = A x(k)+Bu u(k)+Bd d(k) (2) y(k) = C x(k) where x(k) represents
    the system states at control step k; A is the system matrix; Bu is the control
    input matrix; Bd is the known disturbance input matrix; C is the output matrix;
    u(k) is the input vector calculated by the controller, i.e. the control commands
    for gates flow regulation; d(k) is the disturbance vector, i.e. the schedule of
    offtake flow changes; y(k) is the output vector, i.e. the water level deviation
    from setpoint at the downstream end of each canal pool. Then, the objective function
    J, see Eq. (3), can be minimized to obtain optimal control actions. This optimization
    problem is subject to the constraints of water level limitations and flow capacities.
    Once the sequence of future control actions is determined, only the first step
    is implemented. Then the system is updated and the prediction and optimization
    processes are repeated at the next control step. (3) where p and m represent the
    prediction horizon and control horizon, respectively; Q and R are the weight matrixes
    for a trade-off between minimizing the water level deviations and minimizing flow
    changes. The BOCISs are complex systems with large time delays, high hydraulic
    interactions, intermittent demands, disturbances, and multiple inputs and outputs.
    MPC is an outstanding control alternative for its versatility, but only under
    suitable control architecture can achieve high regulation accuracy with implementability
    (Kordestani et al., 2021). More details are shown in Fig. 1 and Appendix. In this
    paper, CMPC and DMPC are compared for the control of the BOCISs. Download : Download

    Alternating direction method of multipliers ADMM was first proposed by Gabay and
    Mercier (1976) for solving elliptic and parabolic partial difference equations.
    But it did not receive much attention until Stephen et al. (2011) made a review
    and proved that ADMM is well-suited for solving large-scale convex optimization
    problems in a distributed manner. The designed distributed controller in this
    paper is based on the ADMM. After system decomposition, the dynamics of subsystem
    i are described by: xi(k+1) = Ai xi(k)+Bu,i ui(k)+Bd,i di(k) (4) yi(k) = Ci xi
    (k) where i is the index of subsystems, , is the set of all subsystems; xi, yi,
    ui, di are the system state, output vector, input vector, and disturbance vector
    of the subsystem i; Ai, Bu,i, Bd,i, Ci are the system matrix, control input matrix,
    known disturbance input matrix, and output matrix of subsystem i. The subsystem
    i is coupled to the neighboring subsystem with the constraint: (5) where is the
    neighbors set connected to subsystem i; Eij and Eji are coupled weight matrices,
    indicating that the impacts of subsystem i on subsystem j are supposed to be equal
    to the impacts of subsystem j on subsystem i. Each agent only knows its own dynamics
    and cost function, and the local quadratic programming problem is given: (6) Where
    consists of all the coupling information passed to subsystem i from all neighboring
    agents; nij is the number of subsystems coupled to subsystem i; . Then the augmented
    Lagrangian function based on Eq.(6) is presented: (7) Where λi is the dual variable,
    ρ is the step size of the ADMM. It is convenient to use scaled dual variable ,
    which yields the iterations: (8) (9) (10) Each agent is responsible for minimizing
    Eq.(7) to obtain its own control signal under current coupled information by solving
    Eq. (8), in which k is the index of iteration times. Then and the scaled dual
    variable in the next iteration are updated by Eq.(9) and Eq.(10), respectively.
    Afterward, the updated is communicated to its neighbors and new coupled information
    is received from its neighbors. This iterative process repeats until the following
    stopping criterion is reached: (11) where σ is the tolerance for consensus judgment,
    set as 10−3. For a clearer introduction, the decision-making process of the distributed
    control algorithm is generalized as follows: Step 1: When the distributed controller
    module is called, the measurements in each subsystem are transported to the corresponding
    computing agent. Step 2: Based on the state space model of subsystem (Eq. (4)),
    the local quadratic programming problem (Eq. (6)) is solved with coupling information
    from neighboring agents. Step 3: Neighboring agents communicate to judge the convergence
    criterion (Eq. (11)). Step 4: Coupling information is transferred between neighboring
    agents. Step 5: Return to Step 2 until the convergence and consensus. Above steps
    are done in parallel by each agent. Step 2 to Step 4 are carried out by the ADMM,
    see Fig. 2. Download : Download high-res image (170KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Flow diagram of distributed algorithm based on the Alternating Direction
    Method of Multipliers. One advantage of the basic ADMM algorithm is that there
    is only one algorithm parameter ρ, and the method can be shown to converge for
    all positive values of ρ. However, ρ has a direct impact on the convergence speed
    of the algorithm. The calculation method proposed by Ghadimi et al. (2015) for
    the optimal ρ is employed. Ultimately, according to the categorization criteria
    (Maestre and Negenborn, 2013), a non-cooperative and iterative distributed model
    predictive controller is designed with parallel computation and synchronous communication.
    The non-cooperative attitude means that each agent only considers its local interests,
    rather than a global performance. Although some systemwide welfare may be sacrificed
    in this control attitude, less algorithm complexity and better scalability are
    guaranteed (Bai et al., 2021). 2.3. Study area In general, the gentler the bed
    slope of the canal, the stronger the coupling effects among individual pools and
    individual branches may be. Hence, controllers are performed on the branched version
    of Test canal 2, a typical test canal with a very gentle bed slope, proposed by
    the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) (Clemmens et al., 1998), see Fig.
    3. Because there are offtake changes both at the Pool 5 and Pool 6 in this test
    case, it is assumed that there are two branches that occur at the downstream end
    of Pool 5 and Pool 6, respectively. Each branch contains two canal pools, which
    have the same physical sizes as Pool 7 and Pool 8. More details about the branching
    canal network are presented in Table 1, in which the properties of the ID model
    for each canal pool are estimated by the parameter identification method (Zhong,
    2016). Download : Download high-res image (1007KB) Download : Download full-size

    the farmers or ditch riders always manipulated the gravity-based offtake gate
    according to the predefined gate opening-flow curve and water schedule. This operation
    implies the assumption that the water level at the downstream end of each canal
    pool is stable. And this is why keeping the distant downstream water level at
    setpoint as much as possible is always the control objective (Wahlin and Clemmens,
    2006). The availability of a real system for control tests is often unusual. In
    order to perform more rigorous control tests, one alternative could be modelling
    the system with the Saint Venant equations (SVEs), which are widely accepted as
    a fairly accurate representation of physical reality. In the paper, the canal
    control simulation platform SCCS (Wang and Guan, 2011) installed on a 2.80 GHz
    Intel Xeon machine with 16 GB of ram running Windows 10 is used, on which the
    SVEs are resolved with the Preissmann four-point implicit difference scheme. The
    SCCS can simulate the hydraulic behavior of most irrigation canals, under steady
    or unsteady flow conditions, and has been applied and verified by previous studies
    (Liu et al., 2013, Zhong et al., 2020, Zhu et al., 2020). Including the heading
    gates of the two lateral canals, all check gates are formulated by Eq.(12) (Yeh
    et al., 1980) to calculate the flow rate of radial gates. Meanwhile, all gravity
    offtakes are governed by the sluice free flow formula during the unsteady flow
    process, see Eq.(13) (Li, 2006). In addition, the unsteady flow simulation is
    carried out with the computation time step Dt= 1 min. (12) (13) Where Q is the
    gate discharge, m3/s; Cd and μ are discharge coefficients; g is the acceleration
    of gravity, m/s2; E is the gate opening, m; B is the gate width, m; Hu and Hd
    are the upstream and downstream water depth of the gate, m; Au is the cross-sectional
    area of water upstream the gate, m2. 2.4. Controllers design On-demand operating
    method is used in this study, which provides high flexibility for the irrigation
    requirements and is suitable for the concept of online canal automation control.
    To design appropriate controllers for the BOCISs, centralized and distributed
    control architectures are adopted, respectively. Referring to (Wahlin and Clemmens,
    2006), the CMPC controller is designed by modifying the state-space model, meaning
    that the offtake term is added or removed from the ID model of individual canal
    pool according to the network system structure. Care must be taken to assure that
    the hydraulics of every subsystem is properly described. Once the system structure
    is changed, the whole tedious modeling process needs to be redone. In contrast,
    the DMPC controller is much more flexible. The entire system is decomposed into
    three subsystems: the main canal, the first lateral canal, and the second lateral
    canal, see Fig. 3. Each subsystem is associated with a computing agent for local
    optimization. Agent 1 and Agent 2 are coupled by the discharge of the head gate
    of the first lateral canal while Agent 1 and Agent 3 are coupled by the discharge
    of the head gate of the second lateral canal. In other words, the head gate discharge
    of the lateral canal is supposed to be the offtake flow of the corresponding main
    canal pool. The basic controller configurations for the CMPC and DMPC controllers
    are the same. The sampling period Ts, which is also the control time interval,
    is set to 15 min. In the objective function, Eq.(3) or Eq.(6), the engineering
    tuning method of Q and R proposed by Zhong et al. (2020) is adopted since the
    objection functions of MPC and LQR are similar. Moreover, p and m are both set
    as 96 by trial-and-error, meaning that the prediction horizon and control horizon
    both are 24 h long. For removing the complex gate hydraulics for the control system,
    a master-slave control scheme is implemented. The master control refers to the
    DMPC or CMPC, in which every check gate is commanded to reach a new target flow
    every 15 min. The slave control refers to the local flow controller, manipulating
    the gate per 5 min to deliver the desired flow according to real-time hydraulic
    state. 2.5. Test scenarios Three test scenarios are set to compare the response
    capacities and control performance of CMPC and DMPC for the comprehensive evaluation
    of the designed controllers. Permanent flow exists in the main canal and the two
    lateral canals, except for the accident scenario, where the first lateral canal
    is closed for fault isolation. 2.5.1. Normal scenario Referring to the Test 2–1
    proposed by ASCE, the offtakes in Pool 5–2 and Pool 6–2 begin to draw more water
    from T = 5 h to T = 6 h linearly, while each offtake in the main canal keeps the
    initial offtake flow, i.e. 1 m3/s, and the offtakes in Pool 5–1 and Pool 6–1 keep
    close overall process. More details are displayed in Table 2. This test scenario
    is used to compare the control effect and computational efficiency of both controllers.

    same initial states of the normal scenario, there is an offtake flow oscillation
    in Pool 5–2 from T = 5 h to T = 9 h, see Fig. 4, and other offtakes remain unchanged.
    Noteworthy is there is a constant limitation on the water source. In other words,
    the inflow of the main canal keeps 11 m3/s, representing a water shortage scenario
    facing downstream water demand changes. This test scenario is designed to analyze
    the impacts of the disturbance of one subsystem on the other subsystems. The water
    scarcity may aggravate the water supply contradiction and highlight the superiority
    of the proposed DMPC controller. Download : Download high-res image (134KB) Download

    gate operations in the water-deficient scenario. 2.5.3. Accident scenario With
    the same initial states of the normal scenario, there is a sudden accident in
    the first lateral canal at T = 5 h. Then all gates and offtakes in this branch
    canal need to be urgently closed for fault isolation, including the heading gate,
    i.e. the offtake gate of Pool 5. However, the main canal and the second lateral
    canal need to maintain normal operations and water delivery in this scenario.
    For the DMPC, due to its modularity, it is quick and convenient to disconnect
    the communication link between the first lateral canal and the main canal, highlighting
    the response capacities to deal with unconventional conditions. But it is much
    more complicated for the CMPC to handle the accident. For simplicity, once the
    sudden accident occurs, the fixed constraints are set for all the check gates
    in the first lateral canal to make them compulsory to close during the optimization,
    rather than redesigning the state space model of the CMPC. It is also necessary
    to revise the offtake schedules of the first lateral canal to consider the offtake
    closure. 2.6. Operational performance indicators Several control performance indicators
    are employed in the study. Firstly, a posteriori control cost Jcost (Sadowska
    et al., 2015) is used to generally appraise the off-farm management, see Eq.(14).
    The smaller Jcost is, the better the comprehensive control performance is. (14)
    where N is the number of total simulation steps; ek is the downstream water level
    deviation from setpoint, m; uk is the upstream flow change, representing the gate
    movement, m3/s. Then, PA states the adequacy of water delivery (Molden and Gates,
    1990), see Eq.(15). The bigger PA is, the more adequately the water is supplied
    to irrigate crops. (15) where Nofftake is the number of offtakes in the canal
    pool; Qd,i is the actual discharge delivered to the i-th offtake, m3/s; Qr,i is
    water demand by the i-th offtake, m3/s. In the results analysis of the water-deficient
    and accident test scenarios, CVT and Hovershoot are used to describe the degree
    of water level oscillations and overshoots during the control simulation process,
    see (16), (17). CVT is the temporal coefficient of variation of the water level
    deviation. As the value of CVT approaches zero, the water level control is becoming
    more smooth and more stable over time. (16) (17) where and are the standard deviation
    and mean value of the water level deviation , . 3. Results 3.1. Normal scenario
    The control simulation results with two control architectures are shown in Fig.
    5. Comparing the control results of the same main canal by the CMPC with that
    by MPC-B, a centralized model predictive controller proposed by Horváth et al.
    (2015), it can be seen that the water level fluctuations are similar. Both controllers
    began to work before the demand changes, and the water was stored in pool 5 and
    pool 6 in advance for future water demands, showing the superiority of the MPC
    algorithm. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download full-size

    scenario: (a) subsystem 1, the main canal; (b) subsystem 2, the first lateral
    canal; (3) subsystem 3, the second lateral canal. It is satisfying to see that
    both controllers can effectively control the branching canal system. More specifically,
    it is plotted in Fig. 5(a) that DMPC is superior to CMPC in controlling the main
    canal, except for Pool 1. The CMPC shows more aggressive features, resulting in
    greater water level deviation and oscillation. In contrast, the control results
    on the two lateral canals are the opposite, and CMPC shows better control effects.
    But on the whole, the control performances of the entire system are similar, see
    Table 3. Although the CMPC has better control results than the DMPC on Jcost and
    PA because of the full knowledge of the BOCIS, the degradation is less than 0.35
    % and can be negligible. It means that the designed DMPC controller is comparable
    to the CMPC controller proposed by Wahlin and Clemmens (2006) in control performance.

    communication and centralized optimization of CMPC contributes to better global
    control performance than DMPC. In this control architecture, the system states
    in all subsystems are closely linked. Any disturbance at any position is able
    to immediately affect all control structures to take actions. But that is also
    why the influence of local disturbance or failure is hard to be limited in just
    one subsystem. The control results of the main canal and the second lateral canal
    are presented in Fig. 6. It can be seen that the offtake disturbance in the first
    lateral canal has impacts on the other parts whether the controller is designed
    with centralized or distributed architecture. However, CMPC is much more aggressive,
    meaning that the disturbance of one subsystem has greater impacts on the neighboring
    subsystems under this control scheme. Obvious water level oscillations occurred
    in Pool 2 ∼ Pool 6, and bigger water level deviations than the DMPC are observed.
    Nonetheless, such influence could be weakened by the communication and coordination
    process of the distributed algorithms. In this way, the proposed DMPC controller
    shows powerful robustness, interference immunity, and fault tolerance. The results
    of Fig. 7(a) display that, compared with CMPC, the highest improvements on water
    level oscillations and overshoots by the DMPC can reach 36.4 % and 28.1 % for
    the adjacent subsystems, respectively. Download : Download high-res image (970KB)

    of the controllers are provided in Fig. 8. The CMPC behaved more aggressively
    than the DMPC again. Obvious water level oscillations are observed in Pool 2 ∼
    Pool 6, and bigger water level deviations resulted in Pool 6 ∼Pool 8, as well
    as the second lateral canal. Fig. 7(b) displays that the DMPC helps the improvements
    in water level oscillations and overshoots up to 20.3 % and 52.1 %, respectively.
    It means that the designed DMPC controller is more outstanding in the face of
    sudden accidents, not only being able to deal with the accidents more quickly
    and easily but also controlling the hydraulic response in adjacent subsystems
    more smoothly. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download full-size

    scenario: (a) subsystem 1, the main canal; (b) subsystem 3, the second lateral
    canal. Furthermore, the computing efficiency of the CMPC may be relatively low,
    though the automatic control under sudden accident scenarios is completed. The
    first lateral canal has not been removed from the state space, meaning that some
    computing resources still have to be allocated for this part during optimization.
    If the scale of the isolated subsystem is large, the unnecessary waste of computing
    resources would be considerable. Moreover, the prediction results of this subsystem
    also have some impact on the other subsystems that need proper functioning. 4.
    Discussion The results of the normal scenario show that the designed ADMM-based
    DMPC controller is comparable to the centralized controller in control performance.
    Nonetheless, there is an unexpected result that the computational efficiency of
    the CMPC is much higher than the DMPC. In this test scenario, the CMPC solves
    the optimization problem at an average rate of 1.3 s per control cycle, while
    the DMPC is 4.6 s. It is interesting and worth pondering. Similar results were
    observed by Tian (2015) and Burk et al. (2019). There are some possible explanations.
    Firstly, the scale of the current test case and the number of agents are small.
    Although a systemwide optimization problem has been divided into three smaller
    problems which were solved with parallel computing technology, the time cost required
    for the communication and coordination by the DMPC is relatively higher. By contrast,
    the global optimization of CMPC is more efficient. As the system scale increases
    and more subsystems (or agents) are taken into account, the computational requirements
    of the centralized solution would increase heavily but the computing efficiency
    of the DMPC stays approximately constant (Burk et al., 2019). Afterward, during
    the numerical experiments, the communication and coordination process is fully
    demonstrated in the distributed algorithm, but the communication network-induced
    issues that prevent the CMPC from functioning properly are hard to be considered,
    such as the communication delay and packet loss in a large-scale communication
    network. Then, the ADMM algorithm is often slower than other distributed algorithms,
    but an acceptable result can be obtained in fewer iterations (23–26 iterations
    in this study) with medium convergence precision. Lastly, the inconsistency of
    subsystem scale may lead to a decrease in computation efficiency, but it is common
    in practice. In every iteration, the small optimization problems associated with
    the lateral canals have to wait for the results of the big one of the main canal.
    The asynchronous ADMM algorithm may be a solution (Dunham et al., 2020). Fortunately,
    benefiting from the big delay nature of open canals, it is acceptable to implement
    more complex control algorithms even with moderate computing capabilities (Alvarez
    et al., 2013, Conde et al., 2021). Though DMPC takes 4.6 s to solve the optimization
    problem each control cycle, nearly 3.5 times slower than CMPC, it is still much
    less than the control interval of 15 min. In other words, the losses of control
    performance and computational speed caused by the designed DMPC controller could
    be ignored for BOCISs, and the practical applications are promisingly feasible.
    The DMPC still has greater potential advantages than the CMPC, see the Introduction
    and Appendix. The response-ability in a sudden accident is also a compelling factor
    for the comprehensive controller evaluation and a fundamental guarantee of system
    security. In this paper, a simplified method is adopted for the CMPC to implement
    fault isolation. A more common way is redesigning the controller for better control
    results. The centralized state space and the ID model structure of Pool 5 are
    modified to remove the first lateral canal. However, this method is cumbersome,
    requiring the presence of professional operators. The fault isolation may not
    be completed timely so that the accident risk of the first lateral canal is further
    increased. Moreover, the state space model needs to be modified again when the
    accident subsystem is put back into service. In contrast, it is quick and convenient
    for the DMPC to disconnect or reconnect the subsystem, highlighting the motivation
    for distributed control study. The inherent modularity nature of the distributed
    control architecture determines the scalability of the proposed DMPC framework.
    If the system construction and scale need to be changed, it is flexible to add
    or delete subsystems and communication connections. Therefore, it is easily scalable
    to a large-scale irrigation canal network with a complex tree topology, though
    the proposed distributed controller is examined on a simplified example with only
    two lateral canals. On the other hand, the operation type of the canal network
    determines the required automation level. That means the number of branches irrigated
    simultaneously, the permanent flow in the main canal, and the circulation of irrigation
    in some canals affect the controller design. In fact, the operation type changes
    over the lifecycle of the canal operation system as the actual condition changes.
    It is a big challenge for canal automation design. Decentralized control (e.g.
    the PI control) is feasible for its high flexibility but may result in poor performance,
    especially for large-scale systems. Centralized control (e.g. the CMPC) gets the
    global optimal control performance, whereas, once the operation type changes,
    the whole controller needs to be redesigned. For these reasons, the distributed
    control of the canal network has a strong practical significance and research
    value. In this way, the level of automation technology required for the canal
    network could be minimized and good control performance is guaranteed, meaning
    that control costs may be significantly reduced in the future. 5. Conclusions
    The automatic control of branching open canal irrigation systems (BOCISs) is of
    great significance for precision irrigation and sustainable development of agricultural
    water. For the first time in the study, a distributed model predictive control
    (DMPC) algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)
    is innovatively proposed for the BOCISs. It is compared with the centralized model
    predictive control (CMPC) developed by Wahlin and Clemmens (2006) on a simplified
    example. Both the CMPC and proposed DMPC were able to take actions before offtake
    changes and successfully bring the water level back. On the one hand, due to the
    full knowledge of the system, the CMPC performs better than the DMPC. But the
    degradation of the latter is less than 0.35 % under the normal scenario, showing
    that the proposed DMPC is comparable to the CMPC. On the other hand, the influence
    of the violent disturbance in one subsystem on the neighboring subsystem by CMPC
    is more aggressive than that by the proposed DMPC. With the help of the communication
    and coordination process of DMPC, the improvements in water level oscillations
    and overshoots in the adjacent system pools can reach 36.4 % and 28.1 % under
    the water-deficient scenario, respectively. In the face of a sudden accident,
    the proposed DMPC shows promising superiority in executing fault isolation over
    the CMPC. Benefiting from the outstanding modularization nature of distributed
    control architecture and the powerful scalability of the ADMM, it is more convenient
    and timely for the DMPC to disconnect the accident subsystem. The improvements
    on water level oscillations and overshoots can reach 20.3 % and 52.1 % in the
    other subsystems which need normal water delivery. For mitigating crop yield reduction
    and increasing the irrigation benefits during times of water scarcity, future
    research is required to consider the diversity of water supply objects and control
    objectives among different canal subsystems by the proposed distributed control
    framework. Acknowledgments This work was financially supported by the National

    in a variety of ways. Centralized control, decentralized control, and distributed
    control are common control architectures, and the former two are applied more
    in the literatures. Centralized control architecture In theory, CMPC can reach
    the globally optimal solution, better than the other control architectures. However,
    MPC is a technique with strong computational and communication requirements that
    hinder its successful application to large-scale OCIS in a centralized way. As
    the size and complexity of the system grow, more system states are taken into
    account inevitably. Accordingly, the size of the state space grows exponentially.
    Even though computational power has increased dramatically with the development
    of computer technologies, the optimization problem may still not be solved fast
    enough for online control. Considering systems that spread over large geographical
    areas, the communication network-induced issues are also points of attention,
    like time delay or packet loss of transmitted information, competition of multiple
    communication nodes, errors resulting from signal quantization, available bandwidth,
    and information security. Moreover, sometimes different sections of the canal
    network are managed by different control entities, who may not be timely to or
    willing to share information. The above issues lead to expensive communication
    costs and maintenance difficulties. Decentralized control architecture In a decentralized
    control architecture, only local information of the subsystem is used with no
    required communication among each local controller. Compared with CMPC, the decentralized
    MPC has the lowest computational and communication requirements with strong interference
    immunity and scalability. However, there is always a significant loss in control
    performance for the ignorance of coupling effects among interconnected subsystems.
    Every local controller takes into account the influence of neighboring subsystems
    only by responding to the dynamic changes of the local subsystem with a time delay.
    In fact, the individual local controllers are always fighting each other, even
    though they have no intention to do so. As a consequence, more hydraulic oscillations
    are generated and more energy than necessary is expended. Distributed control
    architecture The distributed control architecture is a combination of the above
    two control architecture. Compared with the CMPC, DMPC has important advantages
    that justify its application. Firstly, the computational requirements are much
    lower than CMPC because a complex problem is substituted by several smaller problems.
    The need for communication shifts from global communication to information exchange
    between locally adjacent controllers. In this way, the communication network-induced
    issues are much easier to solve and the coupling effects among different subsystems
    can also be given consideration. Benefiting from the inherent modularity of the
    DMPC, the system maintenance and the possible expansions of the control system
    are simplified. Moreover, the effect of a possible disturbance or failure on the
    overall system is weakened because of the coordination or negotiation process.
    Nevertheless, because each agent does not have a global vision of the entire system,
    the loss of control performance in comparison with the CMPC becomes the main drawback
    of the DMPC. This loss depends on the degree of interaction between the neighboring
    subsystems and the coordination mechanisms between the agents. Consequently, a
    reasonable trade-off between control performance and the cost of communication
    and coordination is pursued to reach a cooperative solution. Data availability

  description: 'Due to the adverse impacts of severe droughts on various aspects of
    human life and ecosystem services (ESs), the spatio-temporal assessment of the
    resilience of ESs under droughts is essential. In this paper, we propose a new
    methodology for assessing ESs-based resilience, taking into account the seven
    resilience principles: a) redundancy and diversity, b) managing connectivity,
    c) managing slow variables and their feedback, d) complex adaptive system (CAS)
    thinking, e) experimentation and learning, f) broadening participation, and g)
    polycentric governance. These principles enable us to consider the main social,
    political, hydrological, economic, and environmental aspects concerning resilience
    which have been overlooked in previous studies. The methodology is evaluated by
    applying it to Zarrinehroud River Basin (ZRB) in north-western Iran. A set of
    qualitative and quantitative criteria and their sub-criteria are proposed for
    quantifying the ES-based resilience and generating time series of resilience against
    severe droughts in several sub-basins in the study area. To evaluate the criteria
    and sub-criteria, the required data are derived from calibrated SWAT and MODSIM
    models as well as experts’ judjments. The time series of ES-based resilience under
    128 Water and Environmental Resources Management (WERM) scenarios (for enhancing
    agricultural practices, altering and modernizing irrigation methods, improving
    irrigation network and drainage facilities) and Climate Change (CC) scenarios
    (RCP 4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP 8.5) are derived for each sub-basin based on short-term
    (2020–2049) and long-term (2020–2098) periods. The low resilience values (0.53–0.6)
    of all sub-basins under the base management scenario (the status quo scenario
    (SC0)) illustrate the need for implementing some projects to enhance the ESs in
    the study area. The results show that the WERM scenario SC12346 can improve the
    values of the resilience criterion in sub-basins up to 0.85 and reduce the vulnerability
    of the study area to droughts. By evaluating all management scenarios, scenario
    SC12346 is reported as the best scenario, since it can significantly increase
    the resilience of all sub-basins against extreme droughts with an acceptable cost
    of 636 million US dollars compared to other scenarios. Under this WERM scenario,
    the resilience values of sub-basins increase up to 40%. This scenario suggests
    implementing a set of projects such as improving irrigation networks and drainage
    facilities.'

    changeLake Urmia 1. Introduction The ecosystem contributions to human well-being
    are referred to as ecosystem services (ESs) (Pan et al., 2021). ESs can be categorized
    into four groups of provisioning (water, food, and energy supply), regulating
    (climate regulations and air quality), supporting (soil formation and retention),
    and cultural (recreation and aesthetic considerations) ecosystem services (Ashrafi
    et al., 2022a). Most environmental challenges arise from neglecting the importance
    of ESs and over-exploiting them by the communities. Furthermore, human interventions
    to reduce losses and damages caused by nature can also affect the Social-Hydrological
    Systems (SHSs). SHSs refer to the dynamics and evolution of human-water systems
    (Blair and Buytaert, 2016). The climate change and changes in the water demand
    pattern due to population growth, urbanization, and expansion of cultivated areas
    have caused perturbations in SHSs and Hydrological ESs (HESs). Due to the underscored
    value of the ESs in human life, the impacts of natural processes alteration on
    ESs must be investigated. Several studies have been dedicated to the assessment
    of ESs under different perturbations (Goldenberg et al., 2017; Mörtberg et al.,
    2017; Keesstra et al., 2018). Ashrafi et al. (2022a) highlighted the importance
    of evaluating a set of ESs to address social and hydrological issues involved
    in an SHS. They identified water yield, sediment yield, air quality, climate regulation,
    biodiversity, education, tourism and recreation, and aesthetic inspiration for
    culture and art as important ESs. Resilience is usually viewed as the ability
    of an SHS to prepare for threats, absorb adverse impacts, and adapt to or recover
    from a disruptive event. When resilience is built into a system, conservation
    occurs naturally. In fact, the concept of resilience is embedded in the broader
    concept of sustainability. Therefore, monitoring and enhancing the resilience
    of a system, especially in a spatio-temporal manner, can help to detect vulnerable
    spots and employ better management strategies toward resilience and sustainability
    enhancement. Gómez-baggethun et al. (2019) scrutinized changes in ESs in the Danube
    Delta over twenty years. Despite implementing restoration policies, they detected
    a 67% decline in ESs over the studied period. Caro et al. (2020) introduced a
    new approach to assess the vulnerability of coastal ecosystems. The results showed
    that considering the resilience of ESs is more in accordance with the social-environmental
    realm. Behboudian et al. (2021a) proposed a new method for analyzing alternative
    Water and Environmental Resource Management (WERM) scenarios utilizing ES-based
    criteria and a hierarchical decision-making structure based on game theory. They
    applied their methodology to determine the best WERM scenario in the Lake Urmia
    (LU) basin in Iran. They did not study the spatial variations of ESs. Using the
    InVEST1 model, Luo et al. (2021) examined the effects of changing land use on
    the spatial pattern of four ESs (water production, soil retention, carbon storage,
    and nitrogen export). They scrutinized the varying spatial traits of each ES (service
    level and trade-off) in the Chishui river basin in China. Ashrafi et al. (2022a)
    proposed a framework to evaluate the sustainability of a broad range of services
    such as water yield, biodiversity, air quality, climate regulation, and education
    considering various climate change and WERM scenarios. Ashrafi et al. (2022b)
    introduced the concept of bankrupt ecosystems and used some bankruptcy methods
    to manage water-related ecosystem services in such ecosystems. The concept of
    resilience criterion was firstly defined in the field of ecology. It was described
    as “the capacity of the system to absorb disturbances and maintain the same relationships
    between populations and state variables” (Holling, 1973). The resilience of ESs
    is the capacity of SHSs to absorb and adapt to disturbances and sustain a set
    of ESs in the face of perturbations (Biggs et al., 2012). Several frameworks and
    methodologies have been proposed to assess resilience (Bruneau et al., 2003; Behboodian
    and Kerachian, 2020; Behboudian and Kerachian, 2021; Ferreira et al., 2021; Kalantari,
    2021 ; Pourmoghim et al., 2022; Behboudian et al., 2022). The framework proposed
    by Bruneau et al. (2003), also known as “4R″, originally evaluated the seismic
    resilience of communities based on their robustness, redundancy, rapidity, and
    resourcefulness and has been widely applied in many fields. Biggs et al. (2012)
    pointed out that enhancing the resilience of ESs is a key factor in developing
    humans'' social and economic well-being. Seven resilience principles (7P) include
    1) maintaining redundancy and diversity, 2) managing connectivity, 3) managing
    slow variables and their feedback, 4) understanding the Social-Ecological System
    (SES) as a Complex Adaptive System (CAS), 5) encouraging experimentation and learning,
    6) participation and 7) promoting polycentric governance, were introduced to enhance
    the resilience of ESs. Mugume et al. (2015) investigated the resilience of urban
    drainage systems under pressures of extreme rainfalls or increase in demand which
    lead to failure and overloading of the system, and defined resilience as minimizing
    levels of service failure duration and magnitude over its design life. Karamouz
    et al. (2016) developed a framework to assess vulnerability and used the 4R framework
    to quantify resilience of a river basin located in northwest Iran in the face
    of drought. In another research, Karamouz and Zahmatkesh (2017) proposed a set
    of 4R-based criteria considering socioeconomic, anthropogenic, and natural conditions
    and evaluated flood resilience in coastal cities. Kotzee and Reyers (2016) presented
    an index regarding some social-ecological criteria for quantifying resilience
    under flood events. They used Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to integrate
    all the criteria into one criterion. To design urban wastewater systems. Sweetapple
    et al. (2018) employed a resilience criterion to take into account both known
    and undiscovered threats. They confirmed that the reliability, resilience, and
    risk are complementing criteria and should be taken into consideration for evaluating
    a system under threats. Behboudian and Kerachian (2021) suggested a new ER-based
    technique for assessing the resilience of water resources management scenarios
    in the face of extreme events. To quantify the total resilience, they proposed
    several resilience-based criteria including reliability, vulnerability, 4R, and
    an ecological index. Behboudian et al. (2021b) proposed a methodology for evaluating
    water resource system resilience using RRV (Reliability-Traditional Resilience-Vulnerability)
    criteria, 4R-D criteria, and a social resilience criterion. They used a Two Parameter
    Evidential Reasoning (TPER) technique to integrate the criteria under uncertain
    extreme events. Moghaddasi et al. (2022) introduced a framework for groundwater
    resources'' resilience assessment based on stakeholder analysis and system dynamic
    modeling. They applied the proposed framework to the Rafsanjan plain in Iran to
    investigate the performance of some groundwater management scenarios. Several
    social, political, hydrological, economic, and environmental aspects affect the
    resilience of SHSs. Reviewing previous studies indicates that those researches
    almost fail to consider all mentioned aspects in a comprehensive framework. For
    instance, the 4R framework mainly considers hydrological, economic, and social
    facets and lets the other aspects pale into significance. Some approaches, such
    as using traditional RRV criteria, mainly focus on the hydrological aspects (Fowler
    et al., 2003). The literature review also reveals that the seven resilience principles,
    namely 7RP, have not been quantified to assess and enhance the resilience of ESs
    in river basins. In addition, previous works have not investigated the spatio-temporal
    variations of the ESs resilience. Investigating the spatio-temporal variation
    of SHSs resilience provides essential information (regarding more vulnerable areas
    or how to detect these areas) for their protection in the face of severe droughts
    and enhancing their resilience. Lack of a comprehensive framework for resilience
    assessment and insufficiency of former frameworks in addressing all the aspects
    required in resilience assessment, and the need to scrutinize the status of any
    area in terms of resilience in a spatio-temporal manner, which has been overlooked
    in the antecedent studies, have been the main incentives in conducting this research.
    Taking thereof literature gaps into consideration, how can all key facets be incorporated
    into the resilience evaluation process, and how can the accuracy of recognizing
    the most susceptible spots and enhancing their resilience be improved? The main
    contribution of this paper is to answer the mentioned question by defining a comprehensive
    set of criteria to quantify the spatio-temporal variations of ESs resilience in
    river basins and proposing some projects to enhance this resilience in the face
    of extreme droughts. This holistic approach considers all crucial social, political,
    hydrological, environmental, and economic facets impacting the SHSs resilience.
    For this purpose, time series of daily precipitation and temperature are estimated
    using several Climate Change (CC) scenarios and imported into a calibrated SWAT2
    model. We consider the impacts of these CC scenarios as extreme events with unknown
    occurrence probabilities. Then, the study area is divided into several sub-basins,
    and a coupled SWAT-MODSIM model is used to extract the required hydrologic data
    for assessing ES-based resilience. In the next step, several criteria and their
    corresponding sub-criteria are proposed based on the 7P to comprehensively evaluate
    the ESs resilience. After quantifying all criteria for each sub-basin, the TPER
    technique (Du and Zhong, 2021) is used to integrate all criteria and determine
    the time series of the resilience criterion for each sub-basin. The TPER is a
    two-parametric evidential reasoning technique that considers the weight and reliability
    of both quantitative and qualitative criteria. The reason behind the selection
    of the TPER technique is that it considers a broader range of infeasibilities
    and takes the uncertainties arising from biased measurements into consideration.
    Finally, several WERM scenarios are proposed and evaluated regarding the resilience
    and operational cost criteria to find the best scenario for improving the ES-based
    resilience of the study area with an acceptable cost. The proposed methodology
    is fully explained in Section 2 and described in detail through six sub-sections.
    The case study is presented in Section 3, and the results of adopting the proposed
    methodology are expounded in Section 4. In Section 5, concluding remarks and some
    recommendations for future works are provided. 2. Methodology Fig. 1 depicts a
    flowchart of the proposed methodology. The following sections present details
    of the main steps of the methodology. Download : Download high-res image (3MB)

    for enhancing the spatio-temporal . 2.1. Data gathering The essential data such
    as climatic and hydrologic data (precipitation and temperature), surface and groundwater
    resources, water demands of different sectors (municipal, environmental, industrial,
    and agricultural demand nodes), and social data (population, employment rate,
    and level of education) are gathered to quantify the criteria and sub-criteria
    of the resilience of SHSs. Land use, land soil, and digital elevation maps (DEM)
    are also needed as some essential maps to simulate the hydrologic characteristics
    of basin-wide areas. The gathered data are inputs of the simulation models. The
    outputs of the models and the collected data, such as population and employment
    rate, are then used to assign values to each principle''s defined criteria and
    sub-criteria. Each sub-criterion is either qualitative (the value of these criteria
    is assigned according to experts'' judjments) or quantitative (these criteria
    are time-series-based) sub-criteria. For each WERM scenario, the values of all
    sub-criteria related to the first principle (diversity and redundancy), excluding
    reservoir operation policies (RD5), are assigned based on the experts'' judgment.
    From the models, the monthly time series of dam release-based criterion for P2
    (managing connectivity) is derived. Under each WERM scenario, the values for all
    sub-criteria of principle P3 (managing slow variables and feedback) are determined
    using model outputs, except for the value of the miscellaneous ecosystem services
    sub-criterion, which is determined based on the responses of experts to questionnaires.
    Fostering understanding of an SHS as a CAS (P4) involves four sub-criteria: robustness,
    resourcefulness, rapidity, and durability. Quantitative sub-criteria of robustness
    include the system''s economic vulnerability (RO2), annual rainfall (RO4), and
    annual temperature (RO6). RO2 and RO4 are assigned based on the model''s output,
    and the RO6 time series is derived using the downscaled data of projection models
    for each CC scenario. The population of the system (RA1-sub-criterion of rapidity)
    for year t ( ) is estimated based on the obtained historical data using equation
    (1) (Pourmoghim et al., 2022): (1) is the current population, r is the average
    growth rate, and n represents the number of years. Drought severity (RA4-sub-criteria
    of rapidity) is quantified using the dam monthly inflow from the model outputs.
    The sub-criteria of durability are also measured using the model outputs. The
    remaining sub-criteria of P4 are qualitative, and their values are the resilience
    of ecosystem services in socio-hydrological systems under uncertainty Social network
    analysis is also used to determine the values of P5 (encouraging experimentation
    and learning), P6 (participation), and P7 (promoting polycentric governance) principles.
    The details of using this data are described in the following sections. 2.2. Identifying
    extreme events Evaluating ESs-based resilience is usually done under severe events
    with unknown probability of occurrences (Sweetapple et al., 2018; Behboudian and
    Kerachian, 2021; Pourmoghim et al., 2022). We use several Representative Concentration
    Pathway (RCP)-based climate change scenarios to generate extreme hydrologic events
    (Bakhtar et al., 2022). With this in mind, daily precipitation and maximum and
    minimum daily air temperatures time series are generated for the future and imported
    to a coupled SWAT-MODSIM model to evaluate the basin-wide resilience of ESs. It
    should be noted that two time horizons of 2020–2049 (short-term) and 2020–2098
    (long-term) are considered future time horizons. The outputs of the SWAT-MODFLOW
    model (inflow to reservoirs and lakes) are regarded as the impacts of severe droughts
    with an unknown probability of occurrence. 2.3. Developing a simulation-optimization
    model Regarding the selected climate change (CC) scenarios, a calibrated SWAT
    model is considered to simulate different variables, such as time series of evapotranspiration,
    runoff, and crop yield. The SWAT model, which is used in this study, has been
    calibrated and verified by Emami and Koch (2018). For the projection of daily
    maximum and minimum air temperature and daily precipitation, which are used as
    inputs of the SWAT model, CESM-CAM5 and MRI-CGCM3 models were utilized. A MODSIM
    model is then developed to investigate the effects of implementing WERM scenarios
    on surface and groundwater resources in the study area and to determine the allocated
    water to each municipal, industrial, agricultural, and environmental demand nodes
    under each WERM scenario regarding some imported temporal time series from the
    calibrated SWAT model to the MODSIM model, such as inflow to reservoirs and interactions
    between sub-basins. It should be mentioned that the MODSIM model uses the SWAT
    outputs for estimating available water resources. The MODSIM model, which is used
    in this paper, has been developed and verified by Pourmoghim et al. (2022). 2.4.
    Analyzing the spatio-temporal resilience of ESs regarding the seven resilience
    principles (7RP) In this paper, seven resilience principles introduced by Biggs
    et al. (2012) are taken into account to quantify resilience. These principles
    are: redundancy and diversity (P1), managing connectivity (P2), managing slow
    variables and their feedback (P3), CAS thinking (P4), encouraging experimentation
    and learning (P5), broadening participation (P6), and promoting polycentric governance
    (P7) (Fig. 2). Download : Download high-res image (2MB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. A hierarchal framework of the proposed resilience-based criteria
    and their corresponding sub-criteria. The first principle (P1) states that having
    redundant and diverse elements can ensure the provision of ESs in the case of
    a disturbance. The redundancy of an SHS refers to the existence of different components
    with the same function in a way that they can be replaced to prevent loss of system
    performance in the face of a perturbation. In addition to redundancy, diversity
    denotes the different responses of the system''s elements and components to disturbances.
    The P1 criterion is quantified considering both the diversity and redundancy as
    the sub-criteria. For example, suppose a particular ES is produced by a specific
    and limited number of species or elements (key species or key stakeholders) in
    a system. In that case, a high diversity factor may not ensure high redundancy.
    In addition, too much diversity and redundancy weaken the resilience of ESs in
    the long run. Therefore, maintaining ESs resilience requires a level of diversity
    and redundancy that balances the two factors (Biggs et al., 2012). To evaluate
    this criterion (P1), we propose several sub-criteria for the redundancy and diversity
    criteria (Fig. 2). More details about criteria and sub-criteria and their definitions
    can be found in the supplementary material. The second principle (P2) defines
    the extent of dispersion, transmission, and interaction of the available resources,
    species, and social actors across SHS (Biggs et al., 2012). To evaluate this principle
    as a second main criterion of ES-based resilience, we consider the number of months
    during the planning horizon in which proper dam release and upstream-downstream
    connectivity have occurred. The stability of an SHS and its related ESs rests
    on the slow variables and their feedback to changes (P3). Variations of slow variables
    (soil composition and sediment concentration, as well as legal systems, values,
    and traditions of society) can result in nonlinear changes and shifts in the existing
    regimes. Slow variables have been often overlooked in the monitoring and management
    of ESs, mainly due to the attention to fast variables, which show considerable
    changes over time. Therefore, identifying and managing key slow variables is essential
    to enhance the resilience of ESs. For this purpose, several ESs such as evapotranspiration,
    water yield, biodiversity, sediment yield, changes in groundwater level, climate
    regulation, air quality, educational value, tourism and recreation, and aesthetic
    inspiration for art and culture are selected as slow representative variables
    and assessed in this paper for evaluatin the third principle. The fourth principle
    affirms that enhancing the resilience of ESs depends upon integrated and comprehensive
    management under uncertainty at multiple temporal and spatial scales (P4). We
    propose the robustness, resourcefulness, rapidity, and durability sub-criteria
    for evaluating this principle. The intrinsic ability of the SHS to remain unaffected
    in the face of a specific level of stress and perturbation without loss of function
    is called robustness (Behboudian and Kerachian, 2021; Pourmoghim et al., 2022).
    Resourcefulness is also defined as the capacity of an SHS for mobilizing available
    resources and providing emergency responses under severe events of drought and
    flood, and prioritizing necessary tasks (Karamouz et al., 2016). Rapidity depends
    on the recovery time after facing a disturbance or an extreme event with an undetermined
    probability of occurrence. Durability is assumed as the average time period in
    which agricultural and environmental demands are satisfactorily supplied. As mentioned
    earlier, encouraging learning and experimentation is considered the fifth principle
    (P5). Various levels of learning are possible through observing existing processes
    and participatory activities. The proposed criterion to evaluate the learning
    level (the fifth main criterion of ES-based resilience) is the exchange of information
    determined by analyzing the existing social network. Four sub-criteria, including
    beta centrality, betweenness centrality, in-degree, and out-degree centrality
    are taken into account to assess the information exchange between stakeholders.
    Centrality refers to the number of nodes (stakeholders) adjacent to a specific
    node. It should be noted that adjacent nodes are connected to the specific node
    without intermediaries (Ahmadi et al., 2019). To calculate the beta centrality
    of each stakeholder, the centrality of the adjacent nodes is also taken into account
    as equation (2) (Ahmadi et al., 2020): (2) and are the beta centralities of the
    nth and mth node. Also, represents the element of the nth row and the mth column
    of the adjacency matrix, and is the normalization parameter. is the independence
    factor of each node to the adjacent nodes. Betweenness centrality determines the
    mediating role of each stakeholder. The greater the betweenness centrality score,
    the stronger the mediating role. To calculate this sub-criterion for node n, the
    ratio of the number of geodesic paths between nodes m and k which pass through
    node n, (Pm,k (n)) to the total of all geodesic paths between nodes m and k (Pm,k)
    is taken into account (equation (3)) (Ahmadi et al., 2019): (3) In-degree centrality
    of mth stakeholder ( denotes the number of stakeholders who have chosen the stakeholder
    m to have an institutional or formal relationship with them and the intensity
    of their relationship (equation (4)). The higher the value of of mth stakeholder,
    the more central the role of this stakeholder. As a fourth sub-criterion, out-degree
    centrality ( ) is the number of stakeholders that the nth stakeholder chooses
    to have institutional or formal relationships with. This sub-criterion is calculated
    using equation (5) as follows (Ahmadi et al., 2020): (4) (5) N represents the
    number of stakeholders (nodes), and is the element of the nth row and the mth
    column of the adjacency matrix, which is an N × N matrix. For more detailed information
    on the social network analysis and the mentioned sub-criteria, readers are referred
    to Ahmadi et al. (2019) The value of information (VOI) exchange criterion of the
    nth stakeholder ( ) is then calculated by weighted averaging the normalized values
    of the four above-mentioned sub-criteria using equation (6): (6) A pairwise comparison
    method is used to compute the relative weights and . The 6th principle concerns
    stakeholders'' role in the management and governance of ESs (P6). This involvement
    can range from information exchange to authority delegation. Participation can
    help to strengthen the link between obtained information and decision-making,
    which is critical for effective decision-making and learning. This principle is
    assessed through the evaluation of stakeholders'' interest in cooperation. We
    assess this main criterion based on four sub-criteria, 1) the rate of affectability
    of stakeholders from implementing different WERM scenarios, 2) stakeholders''
    responsibility in implementing a scenario, 3) the compatibility of a scenario
    with the stakeholders'' mission, and 4) the type of the institution of each stakeholder.
    The value of each sub-criterion for each stakeholder is estimated using experts’
    judjments. We then integrate the normalized values of these sub-criteria using
    the Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) approach (Behboudian et al., 2021c) to calculate
    the values of the sixth main of ES-based resilience criteria. Polycentric governance,
    which involves multiple stakeholders at multiple scales (Morrison et al., 2017),
    is the last resilience principle (P7). Each governance entity has a predetermined
    authority domain, can be in touch with other organizations with the same level
    of governing power and is nested within a higher-ranking governance unit. This
    paper proposes a centrality measure as a criterion to quantify this principle.
    To assess this criterion, some sub-criteria namely, “beta” centrality, “betweenness”
    centrality, “in-degree” centrality, and “out-degree” centrality are estimated
    based on the social network of stakeholders and the averaged value is calculated
    using equation (6). They are then integrated using the OWA method. After calculating
    the integrated centrality (comprehensive centrality) value for each stakeholder,
    to evaluate the level of polycentric governance, the number of stakeholders with
    the value of comprehensive centrality equal to or higher than 0.85 is considered,
    and the ratio of the number of selected stakeholders to the total number of stakeholders
    is calculated. A higher value for this ratio shows a more appropriate status for
    polycentric governance in the study area. The redundancy and the sub-criteria
    of criterion P4 are considered based on Behboudian and Kerachian (2021) and Pourmoghim
    et al. (2022). The proposed criterion for P2 has been adopted from Bouska et al.
    (2019). The values of P3''s sub-criteria are quantified using the findings of
    Ashrafi et al. (2022a). Also, the criteria and sub-criteria of P5, P6, and P7
    have been adopted from Ahmadi et al. (2019). Readers can refer to the online supplementary
    material for more detailed information on the proposed criteria. 2.5. Calculating
    the resilience of ESs Before conducting any assessment, the values of quantitative
    sub-criteria (precipitation and drought severity) should be normalized using benefit
    and cost normalization equations (Wang et al., 2006): (7) (8) is the normalized
    value of the ith criterion (cr), and are maximum and minimum values of the criterion
    , respectively. Equations (7), (8)) are used for benefit (positive) and cost (negative)
    criteria, respectively. We define a set of assessment grades which is denoted
    by H = {H1, H2, …, HN} to estimate the total resilience using the TPER technique,
    comprising a number of mutually exclusive grades. Each assessment grade is given
    a number between zero and 1, which shows the degree of belief of that grade. In
    this paper, we define five assessment grades which are represented in Table 1.
    The TPER technique is an extension of the ER technique that addresses a broader
    range of infeasibilities due to completely reliable, completely unreliable evidences
    and inconsistency in the integration (Du and Zhong, 2021). For more detailed information
    on the TPER technique, readers can refer to Du and Zhong (2021). In the proposed
    framework, when the grade-based values of rainfall or river flow fall in Class
    H1 (Table 1), an extreme drought has occurred. Table 1. Assessment grades and
    their description. Grade Definition Grade-based Value (0–1) H1 Poor 0.0–0.2 H2
    Average 0.2–0.4 H3 Good 0.4–0.6 H4 Very good 0.6–0.8 H5 Excellent 0.8–1.0 In the
    next step, the belief degree of each criterion based on whether it has a temporal
    variation (Equation (9)) or average value (Equation (10)) is calculated as follows
    (Behboudian et al., 2021b): (9) (10) is belief degree of nth assessment grade
    for criterion , denotes the number of values in temporal time series for the criterion
    . represents the total number of time steps in the time horizon. and are respectively
    the values of assessment grades for criterion in assessment classes and , and
    is the average value of the criterion (Behboudian et al., 2021b). In the next
    step, the reliability of evidence is used to obtain discounted belief degree as
    follows (Behboudian et al., 2021b): (11) is the discounted belief degree of nth
    assessment grade for criterion and is the reliability of the criterion . Suppose
    M alternatives (al, l = 1, …, M) are assessed using N assessment grades of Hn,
    I criterion which each has a weight of wi ( and reliability of reli ( . If option
    al is selected based on the criterion with the assessment grade of and discounted
    belief degree of , the problem can be represented by equation (12) (Behboudian
    et al., 2021b): (12) Once belief degrees for all criteria and their sub-criteria
    are calculated, resilience under uncertainty is calculated using the maximum,
    minimum, and average value of the resilience (Behboudian et al., 2021b): (13)
    (14) (15) when , the incomplete assessment grade may be assigned to any other
    assessment grade. and denote the cases is assigned to the most desired grade assessment
    (HN) and least preferred assessment grade (H1). Resilience in each time step is
    the average value of the upper and lower limits (Resavg). 2.6. Calculating spatio-temporal
    resilience of ESs After calculating the temporal time series of ES-based resilience
    with regard to the seven core resilience principles, the spatial variations of
    the total resilience should be studied. To do so, the first step is defining WERM
    scenarios. In the following sub-sections, these two steps are elucidated. 2.6.1.
    Defining WERM scenarios The WERM scenarios are based on the projects defined by
    the involved stakeholders and organizations to investigate the impacts of implementing
    the projects on the study area. These WERM projects are initially defined considering
    three different classes of direct projects, indirect projects, and supporting
    projects. Direct projects directly address water and environmental problems and
    improve ESs. The effectiveness of indirect projects is mainly through boosting
    the performance of direct projects. Supporting projects contribute to improving
    the effectiveness of both direct and indirect projects. The projects are also
    classified as compulsory and non-compulsory. Compulsory projects provide high
    effectiveness with low cost. These projects have been previously classified into
    eight packages (P0, …, P7) by Pourmoghim et al. (2022) to define numerous WERM
    scenarios. Each WERM scenario consists of a group of projects (e.g., water transfer
    projects and projects concerning agricultural water demand reduction and enhancement
    of water distribution facilities) with similar purposes, progress rates, and cost-effectiveness.
    The zero package (P0) contains compulsory projects that have already been completed
    or have relatively high effectiveness or low implementation cost. The remaining
    projects are then classified into one of the following packages based on their
    objectives: Package 1 (water allocation to Lake Urmia from new resources), Package
    2 (modern irrigation techniques), Package 3 (facilitating and increasing inflow
    of water to the lake), Package 4 (improving drainage and irrigation networks and
    related facilities), Package 5 (low-cost agricultural improvement projects), Package
    6 (medium-cost agricultural improvement projects), and Package 7 (high-cost agricultural
    improvement projects). Combining these packages with different orders (1st, 2nd,
    …, nth), 128 WERM scenarios are generated. It should be noted that package P0
    has been included in all WERM scenarios. For further information on the WERM scenarios,
    readers can refer to Pourmoghim et al. (2022). 2.6.2. Quantifying the defined
    resilience-based criteria and sub-criteria Different approaches are taken into
    account to quantify the defined criteria and sub-criteria. The time series of
    quantitative sub-criteria are estimated using the calibrated simulation models.
    The values of the qualitative sub-criteria are assigned using experts'' judjments.
    Also, the values of some sub-criteria are calculated using social network analysis.
    Readers can refer to the online supplementary material for more detailed information
    on the quantifying methods for each criterion and sub-criterion. 3. Case study
    Lake Urmia, with an average area of about 5200 km2 at its normal level (1275.65
    m), is the second hypersaline lake of the world after the Dead Sea in Palestine
    (Hassanzadeh et al., 2012; Stevens et al., 2012). This lake and its basin are
    located in north-western Iran, surrounded by the provinces of East Azerbaijan,
    Kurdistan, and West Azerbaijan at the latitude of 37° 00ˊ to 38° 12ˊ N and longitude
    of 44° 40ˊ to 45° 50ˊ E (Schulz et al., 2020; Pourmoghim et al., 2022). The lake''s
    basin is among the six main basins of Iran, and most parts of the watershed are
    in the mountainous areas with a maximum height of 3720 masl,3 and the lake is
    surrounded by plains with a minimum elevation of 1256 masl. This area has a semi-arid
    climate with annual precipitation ranging from 300 to 400 mm, and an annual mean
    temperature of approximately 11.2 °C. Also, the annual evaporation is about 1200
    mm (Emami and Koch, 2018; Rezaei and Gurdak, 2020). According to the topography,
    the Lake Urmia basin is a close inland basin located in a natural depression in
    the catchment, and all rivers of the basin flow towards this lake. The annual
    inflow of the lake is approximated at about 5300 million cubic meters (MCM). It
    is supplied through 16 permanent and a number of seasonal rivers, groundwater
    discharge, and direct precipitation over its surface (ULRNC, 2015). It should
    be mentioned that Lake Urmia''s annual water level fluctuation has always been
    high in the past decades, but the dramatic decline of the water level in the 90s
    is a unique event. This lake lost almost 60% of its surface and more than 90%
    of its water volume from 1995 to 2013. The lake depletion adversely impacted its
    ecosystem by significantly reducing aquatic habitats resulted from increasing
    salinity to more than 300 gr/L (Schulz et al., 2020). Many studies have proved
    that the impacts of climate change, along with mismanagement of water resources
    and over-development of cultivated areas, which have led to increased water demand
    in agricultural section and decreased inflow to the lake, has exacerbated the
    lake''s conditions (Fathian et al., 2015; Khazaei et al., 2019; Schulz et al.,
    2020; Pourmoghim et al., 2022). Nearly 41% of the lake''s annual inflow is provided
    by the Zarrinehroud river, which is located in the southern part of this lake.
    The annual temperature of Zarrinehroud River Basin (ZRB) ranges from 8 °C to 12
    °C, while precipitation ranges from 200 to 530 mm/yr (Behboudian and Kerachian,
    2021). The length of the main river (i.e. the Zarrinehroud river), which originates
    from the Chehel-Cheshmeh mountains in Kurdistan province, is approximately 300
    km (ULRNC, 2015). The study area is divided into 11 sub-basins to assess the spatio-temporal
    resilience against extreme drought events with undetermined probabilities, as
    shown in Fig. 3. Then, the temporal variations of resilience are calculated for
    each sub-basin. The most significant hydraulic structures of the ZRB are the Boukan
    dam located in sub-basin eight and the Novrouzloo diversion dam embedded in sub-basin
    two. The main cities of West Azerbaijan province, Miandoab, Shahindej, and Tekab
    are located in sub-basins two, seven, and nine, and one of Kurdistan province''s
    cities, Saghez, is situated in sub-basin eight. Furthermore, sub-basins one and

    4. Results and discussion 4.1. Defining the WERM scenarios By investigating the
    current status of the study area, it can be concluded that the ZRB is not in a
    palatable condition in terms of ESs. Therefore, different WERM scenarios should
    be implemented to enhance the resilience of ESs. This study uses 128 different
    WERM scenarios for improving ecosystem services in the basin, based on the proposed
    projects of ULRNC (2015) and defined by Pourmoghim et al. (2022). 4.2. Calculating
    the resilience of ESs with regard to seven resilience principles The steps toward
    calculating the spatio-temporal resilience regarding the seven resilience are
    briefly mentioned in four steps and expounded in the following paragraphs. 1.
    Defining the criteria and sub-criteria of the seven resilience principles 2. Assigning
    values to the criteria and sub-criteria for each sub-basin 3. Assigning the weights
    of the sub-criteria, criteria, and the resilience principles 4. Integrating the
    values of the sub-criteria, criteria, and principles using the TPER approach to
    generate the resilience time series of each sub-basin Several criteria and sub-criteria
    are proposed to evaluate ES-based resilience based on the seven resilience principles
    (7RP). The time series of hydrologic quantitative sub-criteria were obtained using
    the SWAT and MODSIM models. The values of qualitative sub-criteria were assigned
    based on the experts'' judjments. After determining the value of each criterion,
    the weights of criteria and sub-criteria are estimated using experts'' judjments
    and the pairwise comparison method. For instance, the relative weights of the
    sub-criteria for the 4th criterion (P4) have been estimated as 0.395, 0.233, 0.175,
    and 0.197. Then the grade-based values of all sub-criteria are obtained. The TPER
    technique is applied to integrate the sub-criteria''s grade-based values of each
    criterion and the criteria of each resilience principle (RP). In the TPER technique,
    the reliability of the qualitative criteria and their sub-criteria is assumed
    to be 90%, and for quantitative criteria, the reliability is considered 100%.
    The grade-based values of the resilience of ESs criterion are calculated for each
    time step and sub-basin. The upper and lower uncertainty bounds for the resilience
    time series also, are calculated. In this paper, the spatial variations of the
    drought resilience criterion are also calculated to assess the impacts of the
    WERM scenarios on different sub-basins under the RCP 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5 CC scenarios.
    The study area is divided into 11 sub-basins for the means of spatial assessment.
    The value of each sub-criterion is then calculated for each sub-basin. The spatial
    values of some sub-criteria (precipitation, changes in groundwater level, evapotranspiration,
    and population density) are available through the outputs of SWAT and MODSIM models.
    Data for the remaining sub-criteria are available for the entire basin. These
    data can be broken down for each sub-basin using some coefficients. If the criterion
    is related to the agricultural sector (modern agricultural irrigation method -RD3),
    the ratios of cultivated area in Table 2are used to separate these values for
    11 sub-basins. If the criterion is related to the river channel and main reach
    (sediment yield), the ratios of channel length in Table 2 are used to separate
    these values for 11 sub-basins. Other types of criteria, such as the existence
    of systems for drought warning and forecasting and organizations'' cooperation
    for drought management, are related to policies implemented in the entire basin
    and the values of these criteria are identical in sub-basins. Table 2. The ratio

    scenarios SC0 and SCT (a scenario that comprises all packages from P1 to P7).
    Almost the values of all the sub-criteria under scenario SC0 fall into the H1
    (poor), H2 (average), or H3 (good) assessment classes. This condition results
    in an average value for the total resilience of the sub-basins under scenario
    SC0. Under scenario SCT, the criteria values fall into the assessment classes
    H4 (very good) and H5 (excellent). The grade-based values of total resilience
    of each sub-basin under RCP 4.5 and SC0 in January 2020 are listed in Table 4.

    for sub-basin five under WERM scenarios SC0, SC134, SC2567, and SC1234567 and
    climate change scenario RCP 4.5. Sub-basin two has the highest, and sub-basin
    five has the lowest resilience values among all sub-basins. According to the resilience
    time series presented in the supplementary material, the resilience of all sub-basins
    under scenario SC0 varies between 0.53 and 0.6, indicating the necessity of implementing
    further WERM projects. In sub-basins three and four, the implementation of scenario
    SC134 has a better impact on the resilience against extreme droughts. In addition,
    this scenario has no significant impact on the sub-basins located upstream of
    the dam (sub-basins 10 and 11). Scenario SC134 has the most significant impact
    on the resilience of sub-basin two by increasing its resilience value up to 0.74.
    This occurs because of the existence of the Novrouzloo diversion dam and the irrigation
    and drainage network of the Rahim Khan plain in the sub-basin two. The implementation
    of the agricultural scenarios (SC2567) increases the resilience of sub-basin two
    to an average value of 0.84. This scenario improves the resilience of other sub-basins
    in proportion to the area of their cultivated lands. 4.3. Selecting the best WERM
    scenario for each sub-basin To determine an appropriate WERM scenario for each
    sub-basin, the average value of the total resilience criterion under all WERM
    scenarios is calculated. Then, a cost-effective scenario with an appropriate total
    resilience value is selected as the best scenario. The value of resilience is
    depicted in Fig. 6 for the top six WREM scenarios. The most resilient scenario
    across all sub-basins is scenario SCT, which comprises all packages. The total
    cost of scenario SCT is 855 million US dollars, which is a sizable sum. Scenario
    SC12346 provides an appropriate level of resilience for all sub-basins at a significantly
    reduced cost of 636 million US dollars. In scenario SC12346, two agricultural
    packages are eliminated, P5 with low-cost projects and P7, which comprises high-cost
    projects. P5 includes projects such as early corn cultivar substitution. Due to
    the study area''s minimal corn farming (just in sub-basins seven and nine), implementing
    this package has a negligible effect on resilience. Additionally, it may be determined
    that projects included in package seven (P7) are more expensive and contribute
    little to the study area''s resilience enhancement. Considering the implementation
    cost, scenario SC12346 is selected as the best WERM scenario for all sub-basins.

    values for two environmental sub-criteria under WERM scenarios SC0 and SC12346
    for sub-basin two. The state of enjoyable scenes and landscapes is examined in
    each scenario to assess aesthetic inspiration for art and culture. Tourism and
    recreation are evaluated using several criteria, including the availability and
    quality of water for recreational activities, such as fishing and boating, and
    the existence and condition of tourism infrastructures, such as hotels, hustles,
    restaurants, and roads. The captured carbon is the difference between the amount
    of CO2 plants take during photosynthesis and the amount of CO2 released during
    respiration. With this in mind, net primary productivity (NPP) can be used to
    quantify the amount of collected carbon. Air quality is evaluated based on the
    extent to which dust-prone zones are covered under each WERM scenario. For example,
    under WERM scenario SC0, values of the sub-criteria are classified as poor or
    average, but under the best scenario, they are classified as average or good.

    4.5. 4.4. Discussion According to the resilience time series of all sub-basins,
    it can be concluded that the implementation of all WERM scenarios will increase
    resilience in all sub-basins. The time series of resilience in scenario SC0, which
    varies between 0.53 and 0.6 in all sub-basins, illustrates the unacceptable condition
    of the current system. More drought events are observed in sub-basins seven and
    eight due to these regions'' high density of agricultural lands. Management scenarios
    related to agricultural activities significantly increase the resilience of sub-basins
    -with a higher proportion of agricultural lands. The implementation of SCT in
    sub-basin two has a significant impact on the enhancement of resilience up to
    an average value of 0.86, since the farming land, Novrouzloo Diversion Dam, Miandoab
    town, and the Miandoab plain aquifer are located in this sub-basin, and this management
    scenario can improve a different aspect of the system''s resilience. The better
    response of sub-basin two to the SCT scenario is related to the projects which
    modernize the irrigation methods. Modern irrigation techniques reduce the aquifer''s
    recharge and can adversly impact groundwater level in the region. This side effect
    has been accounted for in simulating the groundwater balance. In sub-basin two,
    the Miandoab aquifer has a shallow groundwater depth. This aquifer experiences
    significant water loss due to evaporation (Motamedinejad, 2021). Therefore, scenarios
    that comprise modern irrigation techniques can positively impact groundwater level
    in the Miandoab plain in sub-basin two. Due to the uncertainty associated with
    qualitative sub-criteria and the use of both qualitative and quantitative sub-criteria
    in the assessment process, the TPER approach was implemented to assess and integrate
    the values of sub-criteria, criteria, and principles. In the study of Behboudian
    and Kerachian (2021), the bandwidth of the resilience uncertainty after the year
    2050 increased from an average of 0.035–0.09; however, the implementation of the
    seven principles of resilience enables us to lower the increase in the bandwidth
    of the uncertainty after the year 2050 from 0.61% to 0.17%. The grade-based values
    of the resilience under the RCP 4.5 CC scenario and the base WERM scenario (SC0)
    for all the sub-basins fall into the average (0.2–0.4) and good (0.4–0.6) assessment
    ranges. This indicates the unfavorable condition of the study area. These results
    are similar to those of the previous works in the study area. Pourmoghim et al.
    (2022) stated that the Zarriehroud river basin was plagued by inadequate resilience
    under the same scenario (scenario SC0), and the water resources in the study area
    would not be able to fully address the future demands (Behboudian and Kerachian,
    2021). Implementing the SCT WERM scenario, which comprises all the projects, can
    enhance the resilience status of all sub-basins by up to approximately 41% for
    both short-term and long-term horizons. Ashrafi et al. (2022a) evaluated several
    ESs under similar CC and WERM scenarios in the ZRB using a decision-making-based
    approach and recommended the SCT scenario to improve ESs status. The implementation
    cost of this scenario, however, is high. By investigating different WERM scenarios,
    scenario SC12346, which implements different projects concerning water allocation
    to Lake Urmia from new resources and facilitates and increases inflow of water
    to the lake, is selected as the best scenario with a lower implementation cost.
    This scenario can enhance the average resilience of sub-basins up to 0.85, and
    the grade-based values of resilience under this scenario fall into the very good
    and excellent assessment class. Similarly, Balkanlou et al. (2020) pointed out
    that to mitigate the profound impact of human interventions on ES provision in
    the Lake Urmia basin, projects which increase the supply of water to the lake,
    decrease the expansion of cultivation, and increase the overseeing of existing
    agricultural practices must be implemented. In addition, using a hierarchical
    multi-agent decision-making framework, Motlaghzadeh et al. (2023) stated that
    implementing a WERM scenario, which focuses on using new water resources, the
    modernization of irrigation methods and enhancement of irrigation and drainage
    networks can lead to improvement of the status of the Lake Urmia. 5. Concluding
    remarks In this paper, we introduced a methodology for assessing the spatio-temporal
    resilience of ecosystem services based on the seven core resilience principles.
    To this end, several criteria and sub-criteria were defined to quantify the resilience
    principles. According to the results, the following conclusions can be drawn:
    1) Evaluating the ES-based resilience under the base management scenario (the
    status quo scenario-SC0) provided low resilience values (0.53–0.6) for all sub-basins
    of the study area and the grade-based values of ES-based and environmental sub-criteria
    (e.g., tourism, air quality, water yield, and captured carbon) fell into the poor
    to average assessment classes. 2) The WERM scenario SC134 (comprising packages
    one, two, and three) which considers new water resources and improves the efficiency
    of existing facilities, enhances the resilience in sub-basin eight and all the
    sub basins located downstream of the Boukan dam. 3) The WERM scenario SC2567 (comprising
    packages two, five, six, and seven) which mainly focuses on the modernization
    of irrigation methods and enhancement of agricultural practices, improves the
    resilience more significantly in the sub-basins with greater agricultural lands.
    The average value of resilience under this scenario in the sub-basin two (i.e.
    the sub-basin with the highest ratio of agricultural lands) increases up to 0.84.
    4) The WERM scenario SC12346 was selected as the ideal scenario based on the total
    resilience and implementation cost criteria. Implementing this scenario improves
    the resilience of the ESs from 0.53 up to 0.85 with a 27.7 percent increase in
    the annual inflow to Lake Urmia. 5) The proposed criteria for assessing spatio-temporal
    resilience regarding the seven resilience principles is general and can be easily
    applied to other case studies. The following suggestions are put forward for future
    studies: 1) In this paper, the social network analysis has been done at the basin
    scale. In future studies, this analysis could be performed at the provincial or
    sub-basin levels. 2) In this study, the results obtained from the calibrated SWAT
    model have been used to examine groundwater table variations. It is suggested
    to use the SWAT-MODFLOW model to better quantify the impacts of WERM scenarios
    on groundwater resources in the study area. 3) This paper has not considered the
    uncertainties of CC scenarios. For a more accurate assessment, it is suggested
    to incorporate the CC scenarios'' uncertainties in future studies. 4) For future
    research, the proposed WERM scenarios and the results of resilience analysis can
    be used in a multi-criteria-multi-agent decision-making model (i.e. a group decision-making
    model) to select the best scenario for enhancing the resilience of river basins
    in the face of droughts. CRediT authorship contribution statement Massoud Behboudian:

  description: Irrigation with saline water is a possible solution to alleviate freshwater
    shortages. The long-term use of saline water for irrigation requires consideration
    of the influence of salt on the environmental conditions of the soil. The objective
    of this field study was to determine the effects of three continuous years of
    saline water irrigation on physiochemical properties and microbial communities
    in drip-irrigated cotton fields. The three total dissolved solid (TDS) levels
    of irrigation water treatments were (i) 1 g L−1 (fresh water, FWI), (ii) 3 g L−1
    (brackish water, BWI), and (iii) 7 g L−1 (salt water, SWI). After three years,
    the electrical conductivity (EC), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), and contents
    of K+, Na+, Mg2+, Cl−, and SO42− in the SWI treatment were significantly higher
    than those in the FWI and BWI treatments, but there were no significant differences
    in EC and K+ between the FWI and BWI treatments. BWI treatment significantly increased
    microbial biomass carbon (MBC), microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN), urease, and
    sucrase contents. The diversity and abundance of bacteria and fungi were not affected
    by saline water irrigation, but the microbial community structure was altered.
    Saline water irrigation resulted in an elevation in the bacterial abundance of
    the phylum Chloroflexi and a decline in Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. For
    fungi, the abundance of the phylum Ascomycota in the BWI treatment was greater
    than that in the FWI and SWI treatments. Linear discriminant analysis effect size
    (NMDS) results indicated clear variation in the microbiota profiles between the
    FWI, BWI, and SWI treatments for bacteria. Regarding the fungal microbiota profiles,
    the BWI and SWI treatments had similar microbiota profiles but were different
    from the FWI treatment. The number of bacterial biomarkers gradually increased
    with increasing total dissolved solids of irrigation water, while the number of
    fungal biomarkers gradually decreased. Additionally, cotton yield was significantly
    and positively correlated with the observed species of fungi, while it was significantly
    and negatively correlated with EC. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that bacterial
    community structure was regulated by SAR and fungal community structure was regulated
    by soil salinity and bulk density (BD). Future research will need to look into
    how the structure of the microbial community and the associated functional microorganisms
    are gradually changing with increased irrigation frequency under saline irrigation,
    as well as explore and screen for advantageous functional microorganisms.

  explanation: Redundancy is a strategy used to increase system reliability and fault
    tolerance in automated irrigation systems. It involves implementing redundant
    components, such as multiple sensors, controllers, and communication channels,
    to maintain system functionality during component failures. By detecting and isolating
    faults, the system can continue to operate reliably and effectively. Implementing
    redundancy helps to address the weaknesses of single-point-of-failure scenarios
    that could otherwise lead to system downtime or data loss.

    saline mulched drip irrigation; bacterial and fungal communities; soil physicochemical
    properties; enzymatic activities; cotton field 1. Introduction Xinjiang in northwest
    China has a continental arid climate with excellent sunshine conditions and a
    large temperature change between day and night, resulting in a high quality of
    cotton, and it has the largest concentration of cotton cultivated in China [1,2,3].
    Nevertheless, scant precipitation and intense evaporation have severely impeded
    this region’s cotton industry development [4]. Freshwater resources are scarce
    in the southern Xinjiang region, but saline groundwater resources are widely available.
    Utilizing regionally abundant saline water resources for irrigation can greatly
    reduce agricultural water constraints, and hence, irrigation with saline water
    has been widely applied [5]. However, there are several disadvantages to utilizing
    saline water for irrigation, including increases in soil salinity, decreases in
    enzyme activity, changes in soil physical properties, and plant stress resulting
    from the increased osmotic potential, which negatively impacts crop growth and
    production [6,7]. Additionally, compared to conventional watering with fresh water,
    the use of saline water for irrigation may drastically alter soil microbial communities.
    Microorganisms are important for soil nutrient conversion and crop growth [8,9].
    The abundance and structure of the soil microbial community are highly responsive
    to alterations in soil environmental conditions and have been widely used to indicate
    soil quality changes [10,11,12]. Therefore, an understanding of soil microbiology
    has gained increasing recognition and importance. The effects of saltwater irrigation
    on crop yield, soil salt content, root density, soil physical qualities, soil
    nutrients, and groundwater quality have been reported in earlier research [7,13,14,15,16].
    Most studies indicate that irrigation with saline water can result in secondary
    salinization, increase spatial variations in soil moisture, and reduce crop yield
    [5]. In a salt-affected environment, salinity can reduce microbial production
    and activity and alter the makeup of microbial communities [17]. Dong et al. [18]
    discovered that salinity had little impact on bacterial richness, but it was the
    main driver of a change in the makeup of the bacterial community and significantly
    reduced microbial activity. Hu et al. [19] found that long-term brackish irrigation
    led to an increase in electrical conductivity (EC) and sodium adsorption ratio
    (SAR) and a polarized distribution of microbial communities. However, less is
    known about the changes in biological community structure along a gradient of
    irrigation water salinity levels, and the key environmental factors influencing
    the distribution and abundance of soil microorganisms are still poorly understood.
    Several studies have shown that the soil microbial community structure can be
    influenced by the soil pH, organic matter content, soil salinity, soil disturbance
    level, and moisture status [20,21,22,23,24]. In many cases, the main factor driving
    changes in the makeup of the microorganisms has been identified as soil salinity
    [25]. The decrease in soil microbial biomass with increasing soil salinity is
    mostly due to the dehydration and lysis of cells under osmotic stress, which is
    exacerbated by higher soluble salt concentrations. Salt-tolerant microbes adjust
    to low osmotic potential by accumulating osmolytes [26]. Hence, changes in the
    structure of bacterial communities in saline soils compared to non-saline soils
    are caused by differences in bacterial salt tolerance. Zhalnina et al. [23] argued
    that pH is also a key factor in determining the composition of the soil microbial
    community, in addition to soil salinity. Many environmental factors, such as salinity
    type, nutrient availability, and ions in irrigation water (e.g., CO3−2, HCO3−1),
    are closely related to soil pH [27]. pH can indirectly affect microbial communities
    by altering some of the physicochemical properties of the soil, and changes in
    soil nutrient availability are the way in which pH is most likely to affect microorganisms.
    However, Wichern et al. [17] and Kabiri et al. [28] further noted that soil microorganisms
    can adapt to changes in the external environment, especially when regularly confronted
    with drought and salinity. Consequently, the effects of external factors on microbial
    diversity and community formation are not always the same. Due to the limited
    water resources and uneven seasonal distribution in the arid region of southern
    Xinjiang, saline groundwater with various total dissolved solids (1 g L−1–12 g
    L−1) is widely used for cotton cultivation. In order to achieve a deeper understanding
    of how saline irrigation affects microorganisms and to find the relationship between
    soil physicochemical properties and changes in the microbial community, this study
    conducted a three-year test of saline irrigation in drip-irrigated cotton fields.
    This study was conducted to fulfill the following objectives: (i) to investigate
    the influences of irrigation with different water salinity on soil physicochemical
    properties and enzyme activity; (ii) to evaluate how the soil bacterial and fungal
    community composition varies with the total dissolved solids gradient of irrigation
    water; and (iii) to explore the factors that influence alterations in soil microbial
    composition within cotton fields. We hypothesized that the microbial community
    is mainly influenced by the salinity content of the irrigation water and that
    soil enzyme activity, microbial diversity, and abundance decrease with increasing
    salinity. The findings of this study provide important insight into the consequences
    of drip irrigation systems utilizing saline water for microbial communities. 2.
    Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Site and Experimental Setup The field study was
    conducted at the Test Station of the Thirty-One Group located in Korla (40°53′
    N, 86°56′ E), Xinjiang Province, Northwest China (Figure 1). The location of this
    site is in a continental desert climate with an altitude of 802 m. The annual
    precipitation is recorded to be 58 mm, whereas the annual evaporation is measured
    to be 2788 mm. The maximum temperatures in the cotton growing season (April–October)
    in 2019, 2020, and 2021 were 41.6 °C, 39.0 °C, and 41.5 °C, respectively, and
    the minimum temperatures were 2.7 °C, 2.6 °C, and 2.1 °C, respectively. The groundwater
    depth ranged from 1.4 to 1.8 m. Some physicochemical properties of soil are shown
    in Table 1. Figure 1. Schematic diagram of the study area. (a) Map of the study
    area; (b) irrigation water mixing device; (c) cotton planting pattern. Table 1.
    Experimental site soil physical and chemical qualities. In the study field, cotton
    has been continuously planted for 18 years. In 2019, 3 irrigation water salinities
    were set up for the experiment: 1 g L−1 (FWI: fresh water), 3 g L−1 (BWI: brackish
    water), and 7 g L−1 (SWI: salt water) were the total dissolved solids for the
    three water levels (Table 2). The salinity of fresh water was determined by the
    salinity of the local irrigation water source, which comes from the Tarim River.
    The salinity setting for saline water was based on the salinity of saline water
    used locally. The different total dissolved solids water used in the irrigation
    experiment was mixed with groundwater and fresh water. As the total dissolved
    solids of the groundwater constantly change, in order to ensure the salinity concentration
    of the irrigation water for each treatment, the total dissolved solids of the
    groundwater were measured on the day of each irrigation, and the mixing ratio
    of fresh and saline water was calculated based on the irrigation volume. The amounts
    of fresh and saline water were measured by means of a water meter. The mixing
    device is shown in Figure 1b, and the composition of groundwater is shown in Table
    3. The experiment used a randomized block design. Each treatment was carried out
    in three experimental plots measuring 6 m wide and 7 m in length. The cotton planting
    method utilized winter irrigation plus drip irrigation under plastic mulch [29].
    The cotton field’s drip lines were set up in the local design (Figure S1) [30].
    Throughout the growth period, the experimental area was consistently irrigated
    with saline water on a weekly schedule until the crop was harvested. The total
    irrigation amount over the entire growing season was approximately 330 mm. The
    irrigation schedules for the growing seasons of 2019, 2020, and 2021 are shown
    in Table S1. Winter flood irrigation was conducted in the study area every year
    with a 400 mm irrigation amount to prevent soil salt accumulation. The Tarim River
    provides irrigation water for winter floods as well as fresh water. From 2019
    to 2021, the salt content and pH value of the river water were between 0.81 g
    L−1 and 1.11 g L−1 and 7.52 and 8.32, respectively. Table 2. Total dissolved solids
    (TDS) (g L−1), electrical conductivity (EC) (mS cm−1), and main element contents
    (g L−1) of irrigation water in 2019, 2020, and 2021. Table 3. Total nitrogen (TN)
    (mg L−1), total dissolved solids (TDS) (g L−1), and the primary element contents
    (g L−1) of groundwater from 2019 to 2021. 2.2. Soil Sampling At the harvest (6
    September) in 2021, soil samples were taken randomly from 0–20 cm of soil beneath
    the film-covered area using a 5 cm diameter auger. Fifteen subsamples were randomly
    collected from different locations within each plot to constitute the soil sample.
    After the collection of soil samples, they were promptly preserved in a portable
    storage container and expeditiously transported to the laboratory. Soil bulk density
    (BD) was measured at three randomly selected locations in the film-covered area
    of each plot, at depths of 0–10 cm, 10–20 cm, and 20–30 cm. 2.3. Soil Physicochemical
    Analysis The soil moisture (SM) was obtained using an indoor drying process. BD
    was calculated during the harvest stage in 2021 by placing steel cylinders [30].
    Soil porosity (SP) was determined using the method of Carter et al. [31]. The
    electrical conductivity of the sample was determined utilizing a conductivity
    meter (model DDS-307, manufactured by INESA Scientific Instrument Co., Ltd., Shanghai,
    China) and using a dilution ratio of 1:5 [32]. The pH was measured using the methodology
    described by Gillman and Sumpter [33] with a dilution ratio of 1:5. Soil salt
    ions, groundwater ions, TDS, soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), available
    phosphorus (AP), and AK were measured using procedures described by Bao [32].
    Briefly, SOM was determined through a wet oxidation–titration procedure using
    an acid dichromate system, TN concentration was determined through the micro-Kjeldahl
    method, AP contents were determined colorimetrically using a spectrophotometer,
    and an atomic adsorption spectrophotometer (TAS-990, Beijing, China) was used
    to determine AK concentrations [32]. The HCO3− and CO32− were determined through
    double indicator-neutralization titration, Cl− through silver nitrate titration,
    SO42− through EDTA indirect complex metric titration, Ca2+ and Mg2+ through EDTA
    titration, and Na+ and K+ through flame photometry [32]. The soil texture, field
    capacity, BD, and soil salinity in Table 1 were measured using procedures described
    by Liang et al. [30], and were measured in April 2019. SAR calculations are based
    on extracts with a soil to water ratio of 1:5. The soil SAR was then determined
    using Equation (1) [34]: SAR= [Na + ] (0.5[ Ca 2+ ]+0.5[ Mg 2+ ]) 0.5 (1) 2.4.
    Hydro-Chemical Ions The main anions (Cl− and SO42−) were determined using an ion
    chromatograph (ICS-900 Starter Line IC System, Waltham, MA, USA), and the main
    cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, and K+) were determined using an inductively coupled
    plasma emission spectrometer (ICP-OES, iCAP™ PRO, Waltham, MA, USA). The levels
    of HCO3− and CO32− were measured using double indicator-neutralization titration
    (methyl orange and phenolphthalein) [32]. 2.5. Microbial Biomass and Enzymatic
    Assay Invertase and urease were measured through the colorimetry method of 3,5-dinitro
    salicylic acid and sodium hypochlorite on a spectrophotometer, respectively [35].
    Briefly, soil samples were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h, then invertase activity
    was assayed by measuring the amount of produced glucose. Urease activity was determined
    by measuring the released ammonium-N (NH3-N) in the filtrate. MBC and MBN in soil
    were determined through the chloroform fumigation method [35,36] and measured
    on a TOC/TN analyzer (GER, N/C 2100). 2.6. Cotton Seed Yield and Biomass At harvest
    time in 2021, three 1.0 m × 1.52 m (film width) areas were randomly selected in
    each plot to harvest by hand, and the seeds were then weighed to obtain seed cotton
    yield [37,38]. Plant samples were collected at the boll opening stage. From each
    plot, three cotton plants with comparable growth rates were selected, washed in
    deionized water, and dried at 105 °C for 30 min and then at 75 °C to achieve a
    constant weight [39]. 2.7. Measurement of Soil Microbial Communities Total genomic
    DNA samples were extracted using the OMEGA Soil DNA Kit (M5635-02) (Omega Bio-Tek,
    Norcross, GA, USA), following the manufacturer’s instructions, and stored at −20
    °C prior to further analysis. The quantity and quality of extracted DNA samples
    were measured using a NanoDrop NC2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
    Waltham, MA, USA) and agarose gel electrophoresis, respectively. Afterwards, amplification
    was performed using the Illumina NovaSeq platform with a NovaSeq 6000 SP Reagent
    Kit (500 cycles) at Shanghai Personal Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China).
    During amplification, the 16S rRNA gene’s V3V4 region was amplified for bacteria
    using the primer pair comprising 338F (5′-ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCA-3′) and 806R (5′-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3′)
    [36]. For fungi, the primer pair comprising ITS2 (5′-GCTGCGTTCTTCATCGATGC-3′)
    and ITS5 (5′-GGAAGTAAAAGTCGTAACAAGG-3′) was used to amplify the ITS1 region [40].
    2.8. Data Tools and Statistical Analyses The microbiome bioinformatics analysis
    was conducted using QIIME2 2019.4 [40,41]. The raw sequence data underwent demultiplexing
    using the Demux plugin and primer trimming using the cut adapt plugin [42]. To
    examine the significance of various treatments, Duncan’s multiple comparisons
    (p < 0.05) were used. The QIIME2 and R programs (v3.5.1) were primarily utilized
    for the analysis of sequence data. Using the amplifier sequence variation (ASV)
    table in QIIME2, the Shannon diversity index at the ASV level and the observed
    species were computed [43,44]. LEfSe analysis was utilized to determine species
    differences between groups. GeneCloud tools (https://www.genescloud.cn, accessed
    on 18 August 2022) were used to conduct the LEfSe analysis. Utilizing the “vegan”
    R package, redundancy analysis (RDA) was performed [45]. 3. Results 3.1. Soil
    Physicochemical Properties Compared to the FWI and SWI treatments, the soil bulk
    density in the 10–20 cm layer for the BWI treatment was significantly higher,
    while the corresponding soil porosity was significantly lower (Figure 2). There
    were no significant variations in AP, AK, SM, or pH between all treatments. The
    SWI treatment had significantly higher concentrations of EC, K+, Na+, Mg2+, Cl−,
    SO42−, and SAR compared to the FWI and BWI treatments, although there were no
    appreciable variations in EC and K+ between the FWI and BWI treatments. The SWI
    treatment had significantly higher TN, SOM, and SOC contents than the BWI treatment
    (Table 4). Figure 2. Comparison of bulk density (a) and porosity (b) in different
    layers (0–10 cm, 10–20 cm, and 20–30 cm) between the fresh (FWI), brackish (BWI),

    Biomass and Enzymatic Activity The results indicate that the concentrations of
    MBC, MBN, urease, and sucrase were significantly higher in the BWI treatment compared
    to the FWI and SWI treatments (Figure 3). The order of concentrations was observed
    to be BWI > SWI > FWI. However, no significant differences were observed between
    the FWI and SWI treatments. The observed ratio of MBC/MBN in the FWI and SWI treatments
    was significantly higher than that in the BWI treatment (Figure 3c). Figure 3.

    standard errors. The different lower-case letters indicate significant differences
    between treatments (p < 0.05; Fisher’s LSD test). 3.3. The Richness and Diversity
    of Bacterial and Fungal Communities A total of 25,315 bacterial ASVs were observed
    in the FWI, BWI, and SWI groups (Figure 4), with 2522 shared ASVs (9.96% of the
    total). The number of shared ASVs between FWI and BWI, FWI and SWI, and BWI and
    SWI was 1233, 1283, and 1378, respectively. In comparison, the proportion of ASVs
    in the BWI treatment (31.69%) was higher than that in the FWI and SWI treatments
    (31.54% and 26.81%, respectively). A total of 1505 fungal ASVs were obtained for
    the fungal community in the FWI, BWI, and SWI groups, and 203 of these ASVs (13.49%
    of the total) were shared. The number of shared ASVs between FWI and BWI, FWI
    and SWI, and BWI and SWI were 94, 60, and 90, respectively. In comparison to the
    FWI and SWI treatments, which had ASV proportions of 24.52% and 24.91%, respectively,
    the BWI had an ASV proportion of 37.08%. The Shannon indices and observed species
    of soil microorganisms were not significantly different between the FWI, BWI,
    and SWI treatments (Figure 5a,b). In comparison, the SWI treatment had the largest
    Shannon index for bacterial communities, and the BWI treatment had the largest
    Shannon index for fungal communities. The BWI treatment had the highest abundance
    of bacteria and fungi species (Figure 5a,b). The genus-level clustering of samples
    using nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) was analyzed (Figure 5c,d). The
    results indicated clear variation in the microbiota profiles between the FWI,
    BWI, and SWI treatments for bacteria (Figure 5c). For fungal microbiota profiles,
    the BWI and SWI treatments had similar microbiota profiles but were different
    from the FWI treatment (Figure 5d). Figure 4. Venn diagrams of bacterial ASV richness
    and fungal ASV richness. FWI, fresh water; BWI, brackish water; SWI, salt water.

    at a significance level of 0.05. The “Stress” indicates the difference between
    the distance of a point in the 2-dimensional space and the distance of a point
    in the multi-dimensional space. 3.4. Microbial Community Composition The abundance
    of the main phyla in the FWI, BWI, and SWI treatments is illustrated in Figure
    6a. All three of the FWI, BWI, and SWI treatments were predominated by the phyla
    Proteobacteria (44.31–50.11%), Actinobacteria (13.24–14.41%), Chloroflexi (10.03–12.84%),
    Acidobacteria (7.05–8.58%), Gemmatimonadetes (5.05–6.92%), and Firmicutes (2.60–3.22%),
    which accounted for more than 88.98% of the total reads in each library. The predominant
    fungal phyla of the FWI, BWI, and SWI treatments were Ascomycota (87.41–88.56%)
    and Basidiomycota (2.72–5.23%), which accounted for more than 91.29% of the total
    reads in each library (Figure 6c). Overall, changes in the dominant phylum (>10%)
    are more indicative of changes in the bacterial community in response to the environment
    [40]. In our study, the FWI treatment exhibited a higher abundance of the bacterial
    phyla Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria compared to the BWI and SWI treatments.
    Additionally, the Chloroflexi abundance was observed to be the lowest in the FWI
    treatment and the highest in the BWI treatment out of all the treatments (Figure
    6b). In comparison to the FWI and SWI treatments, the BWI treatment had a higher
    abundance of the fungal phylum Ascomycota (Figure 6d). Figure 6. Distribution
    of the top 10 soil bacterial phyla (a,b) and fungal phyla (c,d) in different treatments.
    3.5. Analysis of Biomarkers in Microbial Communities In order to find high-dimensional
    biomarker taxa with statistically differing abundances across all treatments,
    LEfSe analysis from the phylum to genus levels was carried out (Figure 7 and Figure
    8). Regarding the bacterial communities, a total of 35 bacterial biomarker taxa
    presented significant differences, and 3, 9, and 23 biomarker taxa were enriched
    in FWI, BWI, and SWI, respectively (Figure 7b). Actinobacteria (class), Micrococcaceae
    (family), and Nitrosomonadaceae (family) were the three most abundant biomarkers
    in FWI soils. The relative abundances of Chloroflexi (phylum), Dehalococcoidia
    (class), and A4b (family) were especially enriched in BWI soils. In addition,
    the three most abundant biomarkers of SWI soils were Acidobacteria (phylum), Deltaproteobacteria
    (class), and Rhodovibrionales (order). Figure 7. The LEfSe method utilizing linear
    discriminant analysis was employed to detect statistically significant variations
    in the abundance of bacterial taxa across all treatments. (a) Taxonomic representation
    of important variations among groups shown in the cladogram. (b) LDA scores histogram.

    to detect statistically significant variations in the abundance of fungal taxa
    across all treatments. (a) Taxonomic representation of important variations among
    groups shown in the cladogram. (b) LDA scores histogram. For the fungal communities,
    a total of 49 fungal biomarker taxa presented significant differences, and 27,
    13, and 9 biomarker taxa were enriched in FWI, BWI, and SWI, respectively (Figure
    8b). The three most abundant biomarkers in FWI soils were Dothideomycetes (class),
    Capnodiales (order), and Mycosphaerellaceae (family). The relative abundances
    of Microascales_fam_Incertae_sedis (family), Tricharina (genus), and Wardomyces
    (genus) were primarily changed in BWI soils. In addition, Basidiomycota (phylum),
    Tremellomycetes (class), and Cephalotrichum (genus) were the three most abundant
    biomarkers in SWI soils. In this study, LEfSe analysis indicated that the number
    of bacterial biomarkers gradually increased with increasing total dissolved solids
    in irrigation water, while the number of fungal biomarkers gradually decreased.
    3.6. Correlation Analysis of Yield Index with Soil Physicochemical Properties
    and Microbial Community Redundancy analysis (RDA) identifies the relationship
    between community structure and environmental factors (Figure 9). Axis 1 and axis
    2 explained 77.19% and 11.06% of the total variation in the bacterial community
    structure, respectively. The alteration in the structure of the bacterial communities
    exhibited a strong correlation with SAR (F = 4.6, p = 0.038, Explain% = 34.9%)
    (Figure 9a). For the structure of the fungal community, axis 1 and axis 2 explained
    84.61% and 13.38% of the total variation, respectively. The alteration in the
    structure of the fungal communities exhibited a strong correlation with EC (F
    = 12.9, p = 0.028, Explain% = 11.9%) and BD (F = 6.0, p = 0.038, Explain% = 28.2%)
    (Figure 9b). Figure 9. RDA ordination diagram for soil indicators and bacterial
    community structure (a) and fungal community structure (b). Abbreviations are

    are the three samples for the FWI treatment, and the same three samples are included
    in the BWI and SWI treatments. The results of the correlation analysis of cotton
    yield, soil physicochemical properties, microbial abundance, and microbial diversity
    are shown in Figure 10. The statistical analysis revealed that there was no statistically
    significant correlation between the cotton yield and the observed bacterial species.
    In contrast, cotton yield was significantly and positively correlated with the
    observed species of fungi, while it was significantly and negatively correlated
    with EC (Figure 10 and Figure S2). The BWI treatment had the highest seed cotton
    yield and dry matter (Figure S3). The observed species of fungi were significantly
    and negatively correlated with EC. In addition, SAR was significantly and positively
    correlated with EC. Figure 10. Results of the correlation analysis between cotton

    of Saline Water Irrigation on Physicochemical Characteristics and Biological Properties
    of Soil In this research, the data revealed a significant difference in soil Na+,
    Mg2+, HCO3−, Cl−, SO42−, and SAR between the different treatments (Table 4). The
    SWI treatment had higher salt and salt ion contents than the other treatments,
    which was mainly due to the high salt content of the irrigation water. These results
    are in line with the findings of Zhang et al. [46] Soil bulk and porosity can
    be altered by the accumulation of soil salts due to saline irrigation [47]. Therefore,
    BD was highest in the BWI treatment in the 10–20 cm soil layer (p < 0.05) (Figure
    2). The significantly higher concentrations of MBC, MBN, urease, and sucrase in
    the BWI treatment (Figure 3) indicate that brackish water (3 g L−1) application
    may also have positive effects on microbial biomass and enzymatic activity. However,
    there were no significant differences in MBC, MBN, urease, and sucrase between
    the FWI and SWI treatments. Our findings are inconsistent with the results of
    Singh [48], who found that the values of microbial biomass and potential soil
    enzyme activity generally decreased as soil salinity and alkalinity increased.
    This may be attributed to alterations in the makeup of the microbial community
    in the long-term saline stress environment, and the salt-tolerant microorganisms
    had a better living environment under the BWI treatment conditions, resulting
    in higher MBC, MBN, urease, and sucrase contents in the BWI treatment. Microorganisms
    are the main providers of soil enzymes under stress from saline irrigation, with
    a consequent decrease in soil enzyme synthesis [48,49]; however, the BWI treatment
    in this study had the highest bacterial and fungal richness and, therefore, the
    BWI had higher enzyme activity. Zahran [50] also noted that the activity of soil
    enzymes produced by salt-tolerant bacteria is higher than the corresponding activity
    of soil enzymes produced by non-salt-tolerant bacteria, so higher soil enzyme
    activity may still be present in the soil even under high-salinity water irrigation
    conditions. On the other hand, plant roots can also secrete soil enzymes, and
    root secretions and organic carbon input from above-ground plants also provide
    nutrients for soil enzymes [51]. The BWI treatment in our study had the highest
    yield and biomass and, therefore, may have produced more root secretions (Figure
    S3). The enzyme activity of various soils and enzymes can vary significantly [52].
    Rath and Rousk [53] also noted that the carbon content of microbial biomass stored
    in soil organic matter does not exhibit a consistent relationship with salinity
    levels. 4.2. Effect of Irrigation with Saline Water on Bacterial and Fungal Communities
    The activity of microorganisms is the primary factor driving the cycling of soil
    nutrients [54]. The results of our study showed that the Shannon indices and observed
    species were not significantly different between the FWI, BWI, and SWI treatments
    (Figure 5a,b). This demonstrates that the increased salinity of irrigation water
    has no significant effect on the diversity and abundance of microbial communities
    under long-term irrigation conditions. Our findings are in accordance with those
    of Hu et al. [19], who discovered no appreciable variations in the microbial Shannon
    indices between cotton fields watered with freshwater drip for 10 years and those
    irrigated with brackish water. Yan and Marschner [55] found that microbial growth
    in various soils exhibited varying responses to increasing salinity in the field.
    The impact of brackish water usage on microbial community abundance and diversity
    may be attributed to the final salinity level, rather than the salinity at the
    beginning. As a result of continuous saline water sub-membrane drip irrigation
    [56], soil salinity was at a higher level (1.03 ms cm−1–3.18 ms cm−1) under the
    BWI and SWI treatment conditions (Table 4). In addition, the amount of irrigation
    for film-covered drip irrigation is relatively low, and strong evaporation causes
    salt to accumulate on the surface. Flood irrigation in the winter is carried out
    every year in November-December to eliminate salt from the cotton plants’ roots.
    Approximately 4000 m3/ha of winter irrigation water is used annually. Flood irrigation
    is also an important factor affecting microbial community diversity and abundance.
    The Venn diagrams of microbial community ASV richness (Figure 4a,b) and the observed
    species of soil bacteria and fungi (Figure 5a,b) further show that the microbial
    communities’ abundance in the BWI treatment exhibited a higher level compared
    to the FWI and SWI treatments. One possible reason is that brackish water contains
    some trace elements that can stimulate crop growth [57]. If the initial soil salinity
    is relatively low, generally, the first 1–3 years of brackish water irrigation
    may be more beneficial to crop growth than freshwater irrigation, and crops will
    have more developed root systems compared with FWI and SWI treatments [7,58,59].
    Root exudates are the key factors that regulate the vitality and function of rhizosphere
    micro-ecosystems. Under stress, many plants can actively or passively release
    various chemical substances from their roots into the environment, and the number
    and type of root exudates will increase. Different types of root secretions are
    key factors in determining the type and number of rhizosphere microorganisms,
    ultimately influencing their growth, reproduction, and metabolic activities [60,61].
    The results of our investigation showed that the microorganisms exhibited varying
    responses to irrigation with freshwater, brackish water, and saltwater (Figure
    6). The results indicated clear variation in the microbiota profiles between the
    FWI, BWI, and SWI treatments for bacteria (Figure 5c). Regarding the fungal microbiota
    profiles, the BWI and SWI treatments had similar microbiota profiles but were
    different from the FWI treatment (Figure 5d). This is mostly due to the fact that
    different irrigation treatments altered the soil conditions (Table 4), which,
    in turn, impacted the distribution of the microorganism community. Members of
    the microbial phylum have various adaptations to different soil conditions [62,63,64,65].
    High-salt environments can adversely affect microbes, such as by reducing their
    respiration and growth [66]. However, organisms can change their physiology by
    producing osmolytes and altering the structure of cell membranes [47]. Microbes
    can adapt physiologically to minimize some of the harmful consequences of salinity
    [67]. The most dominant bacterial phylum in our study is consistent with the dominant
    phylum in the studies of Ma and Gong [68] and Guo et al. [45]. Saline water irrigation
    resulted in an elevation in the bacterial abundance of the phylum Chloroflexi
    and a decline in that of Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria (Figure 6b). This was
    mainly because the phylum Chloroflexi is generally found in hypersaline environments,
    while Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria were found only in moderate and low-salinity
    environments [69]. Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Chloroflexi are the most
    prevalent halophilic bacteria in saline soils [68]. Regarding the fungal communities,
    the most prevalent fungal phyla are consistent with prior research on agricultural
    soils, as reported by Pan et al. [70] and Muneer et al. [71]. Ascomycota represent
    the most prevalent and varied phylum of eukaryotic organisms, exhibiting abilities
    in the process of organic substrate decomposition [72]. In comparison to the FWI
    and SWI treatments, the BWI treatment soil samples had a higher abundance of the
    fungal phylum Ascomycota (Figure 6d). One possible reason for this is that Ascomycota
    decrease with increasing organic matter content [73], and the content of soil
    SOM and SOC under the BWI treatment conditions was the lowest compared to the
    FWI and SWI treatments (Table 4). In our study, the LEfSe analysis revealed that
    the microorganisms exhibited significant variation in response to changes in the
    total dissolved solids content of the irrigation water. The number of bacterial
    biomarkers gradually increased with increasing total dissolved solids in water,
    while the number of fungal biomarkers gradually decreased. The primary reason
    for this phenomenon is the adaptive capacity of soil microbes to external environmental
    changes, with fungi being more tolerant of salinity than bacteria [74]. Zheng
    et al. [75] noted that high salinity can enhance microbial interactions. The community’s
    composition change, resulting in the replacement of less-adapted species by better-adapted
    ones, is a significant factor that influences the changing distribution of tolerant
    features within communities [76,77]. The specific bacterial taxa whose relative
    abundance increased with community salt tolerance might be employed as indicators
    for high community salt tolerance [45,78]. 4.3. Relationship between Microorganisms
    and Soil Physicochemical Properties The results of our experiment showed that
    SAR significantly alters the makeup of bacterial community structure (Figure 9a).
    This is inconsistent with the results of Tong et al. [79], who observed that soil
    salt concentration is the primary factor regulating soil microbial diversity and
    soil microbiome formation and that soil microbial diversity varied with soil salt
    contents. Dong et al. [18] also revealed that bacterial abundance was not significantly
    impacted by salinity; however, it was identified as the primary factor responsible
    for the alteration in bacterial community composition, leading to a notable decline
    in microbial activity. However, the correlation between the microbial species
    and salt ions exhibited complexity and ion specificity [80], and the potential
    effects of soil salinity on soil microbial communities are not detailed enough
    to be represented by EC gradients or total dissolved solids. The study conducted
    by Hu et al. [19] involved an analysis of correlations between pivotal species,
    EC, and salinity ions in brackish and freshwater-irrigated cotton fields. The
    findings revealed that, apart from the overall impact of EC, distinct major ions
    exhibited varying correlations with soil microbial pivotal species. This indicates
    the importance of identifying ion-specific soil microbial species, which supports
    our finding that SAR is the primary factor accounting for alterations in bacterial
    community structure. Additionally, the RDA analysis indicated that soil EC and
    BD significantly impacted the composition of the fungal community (Figure 9b).
    This finding is in accordance with earlier research that suggested salinity, moisture,
    and porosity may play a crucial role in regulating the makeup of microbial communities.
    Fungi may benefit from exchangeable ions provided to the soil by high salinity,
    and some fungal species under high salinity conditions can increase the absorption
    of various ions while reducing the transport of certain toxic ions [81,82,83].
    We also found that EC had a strong relationship with the observed species of fungi
    (Figure 10). The observed species of fungi were significantly and positively connected
    with cotton production, indicating that they are important for improving cotton
    yield. This is most likely related to the fact that fungi have a decomposing effect
    on plant material. In the study area, cotton straw residues were shredded and
    returned to the field each year. In general, fungi are thought to be the primary
    organisms that break down plant matter [84]. This is attributed to their capacity
    to decompose both organic materials that are readily degradable (e.g., cellulose)
    and those that are resistant to degradation (e.g., polyphenols) by making a range
    of external depolymerizing enzymes [85]. Zhang et al. [86] noted that there was
    a significant correlation between the number of fungi and the dry weight of plants,
    indicating that plant productivity had an impact on fungal abundance. Chen et
    al. [87] also found that soil fungi utilize straw more efficiently than soil bacteria,
    which gives them a significant competitive advantage. Cotton production was significantly
    and negatively correlated with EC. This is consistent with previous studies [88].
    5. Conclusions In conclusion, irrigation with saline water of different salinity
    levels increased soil salinity and SAR but had no significant effect on the diversity
    and abundance of bacteria and fungi. SAR regulated the structure of the bacterial
    community, whereas salinity and porosity regulated the structure of the fungal
    community. The microbial community structure was altered. The number of bacterial
    biomarkers gradually increased with increasing total dissolved solids in irrigation
    water, while the number of fungal biomarkers gradually decreased. Soil microorganisms
    can adapt to changes in a high-salt environment after a prolonged period of irrigation
    with saline water. Future research should explore the process of changes in the
    functional groups of microorganisms under saline water irrigation and screen for
    functional genes for salt tolerance, which are important for the improved use
    of saline alkali soils and the growth of salt-tolerant plants. Supplementary Materials

    1. Introduction Groundwater is water that fills the soil pores in saturated zones
    below the water table (Das, 2019). Groundwater plays a crucial role in providing
    freshwater, accounting for approximately 30% of the total freshwater available
    on Earth. In contrast, surface water, such as lakes, reservoirs, and rivers, only
    accounts for a small fraction of 0.3% (Senanayake et al., 2016). Rainwater and
    snowmelt that infiltrate the soil and reach the aquifer are the primary sources
    of groundwater (Banks et al., 2002; Zhou et al., 2022). Groundwater is considered
    more reliable and fresher than surface water due to its reduced susceptibility
    to natural disasters that occur on the Earth''s surface. With the escalating global
    demand for freshwater in response to industrialization and population growth,
    groundwater extraction has become a crucial component of water management and
    planning, principally in rural regions (Bien et al., 2023; Kayhomayoon et al.,
    2022; Zhu et al., 2022). The occurrence of groundwater at any location results
    from interactions between geological, biological, hydrological, and atmospheric
    factors (Bai et al., 2022; Bien et al., 2023; Echogdali et al., 2023; Yen et al.,
    2021). The manner in which groundwater moves through soil pores is contingent
    upon a multitude of factors, such as regional lithological variations, topography,
    gradients, geological structures, soil type, climate, and other related conditions
    (Das, 2019; Wu et al., 2023; Yin et al., 2023a). By considering all these influencing
    factors, diverse approaches can estimate the groundwater potential of a region
    and produce spatially explicit maps that identify areas with high probabilities
    of groundwater occurrence (Lee et al., 2020; Mallick et al., 2022; Moughani et
    al., 2023; Zhou and Yang, 2023). Various methods based on geological, geophysical,
    geographic information systems (GIS), and remote sensing (RS) techniques have
    been utilized to explore groundwater potential mapping in the past few decades
    (Zhou et al., 2023a, 2023b). While some methods are better in terms of effectiveness,
    accuracy, and cost-effectiveness, traditional approaches remain costly and time-consuming
    for accurately evaluating the potential of groundwater in a given area (Banadkooki
    et al., 2020; Bien et al., 2023; Echogdali et al., 2023; Fadhillah et al., 2021;
    Kordestani et al., 2019; Sener et al., 2005; Singh et al., 2019). In contrast,
    machine learning modeling combined with GIS- and RS-based data and geo-hydrological
    investigation can predict groundwater zones with high efficiency. A branch of
    machine learning modeling is ensemble modeling that creates a prediction model
    by combining multiple base classifiers (Adnan et al., 2021; Nguyen et al., 2020a,
    2020b; Tran et al., 2020; Tuyen et al., 2021). In recent years, researchers have
    broadly applied ensemble methods for classification and regression problems in
    various fields of science. Ensemble methods are popular because they can handle
    complex and high-dimensional data well. Some of the most common ensemble methods
    are Bagging (Breiman, 1996), Random Subspace (Ho, 1998), AdaBoost (Freund and
    Schapire, 1997), and Rotation Forest (Rodriguez et al., 2006) methods. Compared
    to other research areas of environmental science, such risk and hazard modeling
    (Pham et al., 2018, 2022; Tran et al., 2020; Tuyen et al., 2021; Yariyan et al.,
    2020), ensemble methods have been underutilized in the mapping of groundwater
    potential, according to a limited number of studies conducted. For example, Miraki
    et al. (2019) combined random forest with Random Subspace ensemble technique to
    produce groundwater potential map of the Kurdistan, Iran. Avand et al. (2020)
    combined the best first decision tree with the AdaBoost, Bagging, and MultiBoosting
    techniques to produce groundwater potential map of the Yasuj, Iran. Nguyen et
    al. (2020a) combined logistic regression with the Dagging, Cascade Generalization,
    Bagging, and Random SubSpace ensemble techniques. Nguyen et al. (2020b) combined
    artificial neural networks with RealAdaBoost ensemble technique for groundwater
    potential mapping in the province of Dak Lak, Vietnam. Chen et al. (2020) combined
    J48 decision-tree with the AdaBoost, Bagging, Random Subspace, Dagging, and Rotation
    Forest for groundwater potential mapping in the county of Wuqi, China. There is
    a growing interest in assessing different methods and techniques for groundwater
    potential mapping since such evaluations can enhance our knowledge of the presence
    or absence of groundwater reservoirs. Our study introduces an approach that utilizes
    different ensemble learning technique, including Bagging, Decorate, and MultiBoost,
    and Naïve Bayes Tree as the base model. This combination has not been explored
    in the field of groundwater potential, and our study offers unique insights into
    the performance of these models in this context. To validate the efficiency of
    our approach, we selected the Central Highlands of Vietnam as a testing area.
    Our results demonstrate that these ensemble models can effectively identify groundwater
    potential with high accuracy. The use of these algorithms could potentially revolutionize
    the way that groundwater potential mapping is conducted, allowing for faster,
    more accurate identification of groundwater resources. Overall, our study highlights
    the importance of exploring new techniques in the field of groundwater potential
    mapping to improve our understanding of groundwater systems and ensure their sustainable
    management. 2. Study area Our research covers the Central Highlands region of
    Vietnam (Vietnamese: Cao nguyên Trung phần), one of the regions of Vietnam situated
    in the southern part of the central country (\"South Central Region\"). It encompasses
    the provinces of Đắk Lắk, Đắk Nông, Gia Lai, Kon Tum, and Lâm Đồng (Fig. 1). The
    region spans about 54,700 km2 and is home to around 4.6 million individuals. The
    region has a series of plateaus with different elevations, such as Kon Tum (500m),
    Kon Plong, Kon Ha Nung, Pleiku (800m), M''Drak (500m), Buon Ma Thuot (500m), Mo
    Nong (800–1000m), Lam Vien (1500m), and Bao Loc and Di Linh (900–1000m). The Central
    Highlands region exhibits climatic diversity across three distinct sub-regions:
    the North Central Highlands encompassing Kon Tum and Gia Lai Provinces, the Central
    Highlands comprising Dak Lak and Dak Nong Provinces, and the South Central Highlands
    (Lam Dong Province). The Central Highlands sub-region has the lowest elevation
    and the highest temperature among the three. There are two distinct seasons in
    the region; a rainy season that lasts from May to October, and a dry season that
    occurs between November and April. The driest and hottest months are March and
    April. Download : Download high-res image (2MB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 1. Geographic location of the Central Highlands of Vietnam. 2.1. Data
    sources We used two types of data to create groundwater potential maps: wells
    data and groundwater explanatory variables. 2.1.1. Wells data We obtained data
    from 501 wells from the National Center for Water Resources Planning and Investigation
    of Vietnam. These wells had different yields, with 287 wells having less than
    2 l/s and 214 wells having more than 2 l/s. We split the well data into two parts:
    70% for model building and training, and 30% for model validation. We used a threshold
    value of 0.001 m3/s to classify the wells into potential and non-potential groundwater
    areas, based on local conditions (Bien et al., 2023). 2.1.2. Groundwater explanatory
    variables We used twelve variables that influence groundwater potential in the
    study region. These variables were: rainfall, land use/cover (LULC), elevation,
    river density, fault density, flow accumulation, aspect, topographic wetness index
    (TWI), deep division, geology, slope, and curvature (Fig. 2). We derived thematic
    maps for these variables from various sources. To generate maps for elevation,
    flow accumulation, aspect, TWI, river density, slope, and curvature, a SRTM Digital
    Elevation Model (DEM) sourced from USGS was utilized, with a resolution of 90
    m. We used global LULC data from ESA Sentinel-2 imagery at 10m resolution by Karra
    et al. (2021) to produce a LULC map. We used long-term rainfall data (from 2005
    to 2020) from the Meteorology Department of Vietnam to create a rainfall map.
    We used geology and fault density maps from the General Department of Geology
    and Minerals of Vietnam. The importance of each variable on groundwater potential
    mapping is briefly explained below: Download : Download high-res image (4MB) Download

    in this study: (a) slope, (b) TWI, (c) elevation, (d) curvature, (e) river density,
    (f) deep division, (g) flow accumulation, (h) rainfall, (i) geology, (j) fault
    density, (k) LULC, and (l) aspect. Rainfall is an important factor that measures
    the average annual precipitation in an area. It serves as the main source of groundwater
    recharge and has a significant impact on the groundwater level and quality (Brito
    et al., 2023; Li et al., 2022). Another factor is LULC, which measures the type
    and extent of vegetation and human activities in an area. It influences the evapotranspiration,
    infiltration, runoff, and pollution potential of an area (Bien et al., 2023; Sang
    et al., 2023). Elevation is another critical factor that measures the height above
    sea level of an area. It affects the groundwater pressure, flow direction, and
    hydraulic gradient of an area (Trabelsi et al., 2023). River density, on the other
    hand, measures the total length of rivers per unit area. It reflects the surface
    water availability and groundwater discharge potential of an area (Chen et al.,
    2020; Jaafari et al., 2015). Additionally, fault density measures the total length
    of faults per unit area (Chen et al., 2023; Ghasemian et al., 2022) and indicates
    the presence of fractures and joints that enhance the groundwater storage and
    movement potential of an area (Bai et al., 2022). Flow accumulation measures the
    amount of water that flows through a given cell in a raster grid and is related
    to surface runoff and infiltration potential (Nguyen et al., 2020a). Aspect, on
    the other hand, measures the orientation of the slope in an area and affects solar
    radiation, temperature, evaporation, and vegetation cover (Bien et al., 2023;
    Kumar et al., 2023). TWI measures the tendency of water to accumulate in a given
    location based on the slope and upstream contributing area. It is an indicator
    of soil moisture and groundwater recharge potential (Chen et al., 2020; Nguyen
    et al., 2020a; Pham et al., 2021). Deep division measures the depth to bedrock
    or aquifer in an area and affects the groundwater storage capacity and vulnerability
    of an area (Bien et al., 2023). Geology, meanwhile, measures the type and structure
    of rocks in an area and determines the porosity, permeability, and hydraulic conductivity
    of an area (Jaafari et al., 2022a; Ma et al., 2023). Finally, slope and curvature
    come into play, with the former measuring the steepness or gradient of terrain
    in an area, while the latter measures the rate of change of slope in an area.
    Both factors affect the runoff, erosion, infiltration, and groundwater flow potential
    of an area (Hasanuzzaman et al., 2022). Data of this study was also used and presented
    in Bien et al. (2023). 3. Methods 3.1. Correlation-based feature selection (CFS)
    We used the CFS method to measure the importance of the explanatory variables
    considered in this study. CFS is a filter method that evaluates subsets of features
    (i.e., variables) based on their correlation. It uses a heuristic estimation function
    that measures the strength of a subset by using the correlation among the features
    and between the features and the class variables. According to Hall and Holmes
    (2003), an optimal subset should have high correlation with the class variables
    and low inter-correlation among the features. CFS adopts a best search strategy
    to avoid exploring the whole feature subset space. It terminates the search when
    it encounters five consecutive non-improving subsets that are fully expanded (Nguyen
    et al., 2020b). 3.2. Naïve Bayes tree (NBT) NBT is a popular decision tree-based
    classification algorithm that utilizes the Naïve Bayes algorithm to split data
    at each node (Kohavi, 1996). Decision trees are graphical representations of a
    series of rules that divide the data into different classes based on certain criteria.
    The NBT algorithm, on the other hand, is a probabilistic method that calculates
    the likelihood of each class given the values of the features using the Bayes’
    theorem. NBT combines these two methods by employing the Naïve Bayes algorithm
    to identify the best feature and threshold for splitting the data at each node
    of the tree. This process continues recursively until all the data points are
    assigned to a class or a predefined stopping criterion is reached. One of the
    main strengths of NBT is its simplicity and ease of understanding, making it accessible
    to a wider range of users. Unlike many other machine learning algorithms, the
    model does not require complex mathematical calculations or parameter tuning.
    It can be easily interpreted by following the rules of the tree, which makes it
    ideal for beginners. Another advantage of NBT is its ability to handle high-dimensional
    data and large datasets. It can efficiently classify and predict outcomes of datasets
    that have many instances and features without losing much accuracy or efficiency.
    Additionally, the model reduces the dimensionality of the data by selecting only
    relevant features for splitting, which helps it work even better with big data.
    Another significant benefit of NBT is its ability to handle both categorical and
    continuous input variables. The model can work with both discrete and numeric
    values without requiring any preprocessing or transformation, as it can calculate
    the probabilities for each type of variable accordingly. Furthermore, NBT tends
    to be more robust to missing data than other algorithms. It can handle missing
    data by ignoring them or using default values when calculating the probabilities,
    without affecting the overall performance of the model (Pham et al., 2021). However,
    NBT does have some limitations. One of its main assumptions is that all features
    are independent, which may not always hold true in real-world datasets. The model
    assumes that the value of one feature does not affect the probability or value
    of another feature, leading to inaccurate results when correlations or dependencies
    exist among the features. Additionally, NBT can be sensitive to irrelevant features,
    which can lead to overfitting and reduced accuracy. The model may select features
    that are not related to the target class or have low predictive power for splitting
    the data, causing it to learn noise or spurious patterns instead of generalizing
    well to new data (Kohavi, 1996). 3.3. Bagging Bagging, short for Bootstrap Aggregation,
    is an ensemble modeling technique that combines multiple models to improve the
    accuracy and stability of predictions (Breiman, 1996; Quinlan, 1996). It works
    by creating multiple random subsamples of the original dataset by selecting instances
    with replacement, indicating that some instances can be used multiple times in
    the subsamples while others may not appear at all. Each subsample is then used
    to train a separate model, typically using the same type of algorithm, but with
    slightly different training data (Pham et al., 2021). Once all the individual
    models have been trained, they can be combined to make predictions. In classification
    problems, the most common approach is to use voting, where the prediction made
    by each model is counted as one vote, and the final prediction is the class that
    obtains the most votes. In regression problems, the individual model predictions
    are combined using averaging or weighted averaging based on their performance.
    Bagging reduces variance by generating multiple models that are less sensitive
    to variations in the data. This helps to reduce overfitting and improve generalization
    ability by creating diverse models that capture different aspects of the data.
    Empirical results show that Bagging outperforms single models and other ensemble
    methods on various datasets and domains (Tran et al., 2020). Bagging can also
    be extended and modified to handle different scenarios and challenges. For example,
    Random Forests use random feature selection to create uncorrelated decision trees,
    which improves accuracy and robustness. Pasting uses sampling without replacement
    to create subsamples, which reduces computational cost and memory usage. Bagging
    is an effective method for improving the accuracy and stability of predictions
    by combining multiple models. It can be applied to any machine learning algorithm
    and is widely used in various applications (Pham et al., 2019). 3.4. Decorate
    Decorate is an ensemble modeling technique that improves the accuracy and robustness
    of predictions by combining multiple models (Melville and Mooney, 2005). It is
    based on the AdaBoost algorithm, which creates a strong learner from a weighted
    arrangement of weak learners. Decorate adds a decorrelation step to AdaBoost to
    enhance its performance further. The key idea of Decorate is to introduce diversity
    among the base models by adding noise to the training data. It does this by creating
    several versions of the training data with random perturbations in the input features
    or the output labels. Each version of the training data trains a separate model
    using AdaBoost algorithm. The final prediction combines the predictions of all
    the trained models using a weighted voting scheme (Bien et al., 2023). Decorate
    generates artificial training examples by using a class distribution that favors
    classes that are underrepresented in the current ensemble. This reduces the correlation
    among the base models and encourages them to learn different aspects of the data.
    Empirical results show that Decorate outperforms AdaBoost and other ensemble methods
    on various datasets and domains. Decorate is an effective method for improving
    the accuracy and robustness of predictions by introducing diversity among the
    base models. It has been effectively utilized in various domains, such as text
    classification, image recognition, and bioinformatics (Tran et al., 2020; Tuyen
    et al., 2021). 3.5. MultiBoost MultiBoost is an ensemble modeling technique that
    integrates multiple weak learners to create a strong and robust learner (Webb,
    2000). It is commonly used in classification tasks and can handle both binary
    and multi-class problems. MultiBoost works by iteratively training several base
    models, each focusing on different aspects of the data, to create a final prediction
    model. The key idea of MultiBoost is to use a boosting approach where each base
    model is trained to improve the accuracy of the previous models. The approach
    involves assigning weights to each instance in the training data and using these
    weights to emphasize the misclassified instances in the subsequent models. This
    ensures that the base models focus on the difficult-to-classify instances, which
    improves the overall accuracy of the final model (Pham et al., 2019). MultiBoost
    divides the ensemble of classifiers into subcommittees, each formed by Wagging,
    a variant of Bagging that uses weighted instances. This introduces diversity among
    the base models and reduces their correlation. MultiBoost assigns weights to each
    classifier based on their error rate and combines their predictions using a weighted
    voting scheme. This gives more importance to the more accurate classifiers and
    reduces the influence of noise. MultiBoost is an effective method for combining
    multiple weak learners to create a strong learner. Its ability to handle large
    datasets efficiently and incorporate different aspects of the data makes it a
    widely-used technique in various domains (Nguyen et al., 2020a). 3.6. Evaluation
    metrics To evaluate the performance of four models developed in this study, we
    used several performance metrics. The metrics include positive predictive value
    (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity or true positive rate (SST),
    specificity or true negative rate (SPF), accuracy (ACC), Kappa statistic, root
    mean square error (RMSE), the area under the ROC curve (AUC) (Gao et al., 2023;
    Jaafari, 2018; Jaafari et al., 2022b; Jahandar et al., 2022; Nhu et al., 2020;
    Pham et al., 2019, 2020; Yousefi et al., 2022). PPV is the proportion of correctly
    predicted positive cases out of all predicted positive cases. It is also known
    as precision or confidence. A higher PPV value indicates that the model can make
    reliable positive predictions with high certainty. NPV is the proportion of correctly
    predicted negative cases out of all predicted negative cases. It is also known
    as completeness or coverage. A higher NPV value indicates that the model can make
    reliable negative predictions with high coverage. SST is the proportion of correctly
    predicted positive cases out of all actual positive cases. It is also known as
    recall or hit rate. A higher SST value indicates that the model can detect most
    of the positive cases with high sensitivity (Yin et al., 2023c). SPF is the proportion
    of correctly predicted negative cases out of all actual negative cases. It is
    also known as selectivity or true negative rate. A higher SPF value indicates
    that the model can exclude most of the negative cases with high specificity (Li
    et al., 2021). ACC is the proportion of correctly predicted cases out of all cases.
    It is also known as overall accuracy or correctness. A higher ACC value indicates
    that the model can make accurate predictions for both positive and negative cases
    (Chen et al., 2023; Thanh et al., 2020). AUC is a metric used to evaluate the
    performance of binary classification models (Hai et al., 2022; Luu et al., 2022;
    Nguyen et al., 2023; Nhu et al., 2022; Van Phong et al., 2020). It represents
    the probability that a randomly chosen positive instance will have a higher predicted
    probability than a randomly chosen negative instance. The AUC ranges from 0 to
    1, with 0 indicating a perfect negative classifier and 1 indicating a perfect
    positive classifier (Jaafari et al., 2017). Kappa statistic measures the agreement
    between the predicted and actual results, where a value of 1 indicates perfect
    agreement, while a value of 0 indicates the same level of agreement as random
    guessing. A higher Kappa value indicates that the model can make consistent predictions
    that are not due to chance (Asteris et al., 2019b; Yin et al., 2023d). RMSE measures
    the difference between the actual and predicted results, where a lower value indicates
    better performance. It is also known as error rate or deviation. A lower RMSE
    value indicates that the model can make precise predictions with low error (Asteris
    et al., 2016; Yin et al., 2023b; Yuan et al., 2023). These metrics are mathematically
    expressed as follows: (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) ‐ ‐ (7) ‐ (8) Where: TP is the number
    of correctly predicted positive cases out of all actual positive cases. A higher
    TP value indicates that the model can identify most of the positive cases correctly.
    FP is the number of incorrectly predicted positive cases out of all actual negative
    cases. A lower FP value indicates that the model can avoid false alarms or misclassifications.
    TN is the number of correctly predicted negative cases out of all actual negative
    cases. A higher TN value indicates that the model can reject most of the negative
    cases correctly. FN is the number of incorrectly predicted negative cases out
    of all actual positive cases. A lower FN value indicates that the model can avoid
    missing any positive cases or underestimations. N is the number of samples in
    the dataset. dSPF represents the infinitesimal change in the specificity (i.e.,
    false positive rate). P(a) and P(e) are the observed and expected values of groundwater
    yield, respectively. GYpredicted and GYactual are the predicted and actual values
    of groundwater yield, respectively. 4. Model development and configuration Fig.
    3 shows the main steps and procedures involved in data collection, model development,
    model evaluation, and groundwater potential mapping in the Central Highlands region
    of Vietnam. For model development, we used the WEKA software to develop our models
    for groundwater potential mapping. As an open-source tool, WEKA provides various
    machine learning algorithms for data mining tasks. WEKA also allows users to customize
    the parameters of the algorithms to optimize their performance. We experimented
    with different parameter settings for each algorithm and selected the best ones
    based on the evaluation criteria. Table 1 shows the parameter settings that we
    used for our models. These settings were identified using a trial-and-error process
    and applied to the training data to construct the models and to the testing data
    to evaluate them (Wu et al., 2022; Xie et al., 2021; Zhuo et al., 2022). Download

    Variable importance The variable ranking analysis for groundwater potential mapping
    reveals that LULC is the most significant factor, with the highest weight of 0.1850
    (Fig. 4). This suggests that LULC has the most substantial influence on the groundwater
    potential of a particular region. The second most important factor is rainfall
    with a weight of 0.1141, followed by flow accumulationand fault density, which
    also have considerable weights. Elevation and river density have nearly equal
    importance, indicating that they have similar contributions to the analysis. TWI
    has a slightly lower weight than elevation and river density. Aspect, deep division,
    and curvature have relatively low weights among all the factors, while slope and
    geology have the least impact on groundwater potential mapping. Overall, the variable
    ranking analysis provides essential information for groundwater potential mapping,
    helping to identify the most critical factors influencing groundwater availability.
    These findings can assist in decision-making processes, leading to better resource
    management practices and sustainable development. Download : Download high-res

    variables based on their weight. 5.2. Model performance The performance and accuracy
    of one single model and three ensemble models were compared and validated during
    two different phases of the modeling process (Table 2). During the training phase,
    the NBT model had TP = 186, while B-NBT, D-NBT, and MBAB-NBT models had TP = 190.
    This indicates that the ensemble models were able to accurately predict more groundwater
    pixels in the training dataset. In the case of the TN value, the B-NBT model performed
    better with TN = 132, while the other models had TN values ranging from 109 to
    134. This indicates that B-NBT was able to accurately identify more non-groundwater
    pixels in the training dataset. The FP count was lowest in the MBAB-NBT model
    with only six FPs compared to the other models which had FP values ranging from
    10 to 14. The FN count was highest in the NBT model with 38 FNs, while the other
    models had FN values ranging from 13 to 36. MBAB-NBT had the highest PPV of 97%,
    followed by the other models with PPV values ranging from 75.58% to 95%. The NPV
    was highest in the MBAB-NBT model with 91.16%, while the other models had NPV
    values ranging from 39.06% to 53.13%. The SST was highest in the MBAB-NBT model
    with 93.72%, while the other models had SST values ranging from 83.04% to 92.68%.
    Similarly, the SPF was highest in the MBAB-NBT model with 95.71%, while the other
    models had SPF values ranging from 60.38% to 68%. The accuracy was also highest
    in the MBAB-NBT model with 94.52%, while the other models had ACC values ranging
    from 85.01% to 92.80%. The MBAB-NBT model had the highest Kappa value of 0.89,
    indicating a very good agreement between the predicted and actual results. The
    other models had Kappa values ranging from 0.69 to 0.85. Finally, the RMSE measures
    the difference between the actual and predicted results, where a lower value indicates
    better performance. The MBAB-NBT model had the lowest RMSE of 0.20, while the
    other models had RMSE values ranging from 0.29 to 0.40. Table 2. Comparison of

    0.45 During the validation phase of four different models, several performance
    metrics were evaluated. In terms of true positives (TP), both the MBAB-NBT and
    D-NBT models scored the highest with a TP value of 70. On the other hand, NBT
    and B-NBT lagged behind slightly with scores of 69 and 65, respectively. The MBAB-NBT
    model had the highest number of true negatives (TN) with a score of 34, while
    B-NBT came in second with a score of 32. D-NBT and NBT had scores of 25 and 28,
    respectively. In regards to false positives (FP), both B-NBT and MBAB-NBT had
    the same low score of 16, which was the lowest among all four models. Meanwhile,
    NBT and D-NBT had scores of 17 and 16, respectively. When it comes to false negatives
    (FN), the D-NBT model had the highest score with 39, followed closely by NBT with
    a score of 36. Both B-NBT and MBAB-NBT had scores of 32 and 30, respectively.
    For positive predictive value (PPV), the MBAB-NBT and D-NBT models had the highest
    scores with values of 81.40%, while NBT and B-NBT trailed slightly behind with
    scores of 80.23% and 75.58%, respectively. In terms of negative predictive value
    (NPV), the MBAB-NBT model had the highest score with a value of 53.13%. B-NBT
    and NBT had scores of 50.00% and 43.75%, respectively, while the D-NBT model had
    the lowest score with 39.06%. Regarding sensitivity or recall (SST), the MBAB-NBT
    model received the highest score with a value of 70.00%, while NBT, B-NBT, and
    D-NBT had scores of 65.71%, 67.01%, and 64.22%, respectively. Regarding specificity
    (SPF), the MBAB-NBT model once again received the highest score with a value of
    68.00%. NBT came in second with a score of 62.22%, while B-NBT and D-NBT had scores
    of 60.38% and 60.98%, respectively. Regarding accuracy (ACC), the MBAB-NBT model
    received the highest score with a value of 69.33%, whereas NBT and B-NBT had identical
    values of 64.67%. The D-NBT model had the lowest score with 63.33%. In terms of
    kappa, the MBAB-NBT model achieved the highest value of 0.36, followed by B-NBT,
    D-NBT, and NBT with values of 0.26, 0.21, and 0.25, respectively. Finally, regarding
    root mean squared error (RMSE), the D-NBT model received the lowest score with
    a value of 0.46, while NBT, B-NBT, and MBAB-NBT had scores of 0.48, 0.46, and
    0.45, respectively. The AUC values for each model in the training and validation
    phases are in Fig. 5. When we compare the models within the training phase, we
    can observe that MBAB-NBT outperforms the other models with an impressive AUC
    value of 0.991. In contrast, NBT and D-NBT have lower AUC values, indicating weaker
    performance. B-NBT falls somewhere in between the other models, with an AUC value
    of 0.977. However, all the models display lower AUC values in the validation phase.
    Additionally, the differences between the models become less pronounced, with
    MBAB-NBT maintaining its lead but only slightly over the others. NBT has the lowest
    AUC value of 0.711, while MBAB-NBT comes out on top again with a value of 0.741.

    Fig. 5. Comparison of models'' AUC values between the (a) training and (b) validation
    phases. Overall, comparing the models across the two phases highlights some interesting
    observations. Firstly, the models seem to perform much better during the training
    phase compared to the validation phase, which suggests overfitting may be an issue.
    Secondly, the difference between the models is more significant in the training
    phase, where MBAB-NBT performs exceptionally well relative to the others. However,
    in the validation phase, the models display similar performances, with MBAB-NBT
    still leading but only marginally. Overall, the MBAB-NBT model performed consistently
    well across most of the metrics during both the training and validation phases.
    It had high accuracy and agreement with the actual results as well as low error
    and deviation. Conversely, the NBT model performed poorly during the training
    phase but improved slightly during the validation phase. It had high precision
    but low coverage and sensitivity. The B-NBT and D-NBT models performed moderately
    during both phases but with different strengths and weaknesses. The B-NBT model
    had high specificity but low sensitivity while the D-NBT model had high sensitivity
    but low specificity. 5.3. Potential maps After validating and verifying the models,
    the study area''s total pixels were inputted to compute potential indices of groundwater
    for the entire region. The outputs of the models were then transferred to ArcGIS
    for processing and visualization. Each pixel in the study region was assigned
    a weight to show its potential for groundwater presence. The potential indices
    for groundwater were reclassified using the geometrical interval method to form
    five categories, which include very low, low, moderate, high, and very high potential
    levels (Fig. 6). Download : Download high-res image (4MB) Download : Download

    distributed across different potential maps. Wells with yields greater than 2
    l/s are primarily located in areas classified as having high potential for groundwater.
    In contrast, wells with yields less than 2 l/s are found mainly in areas categorized
    as having low potential for groundwater. 6. Discussion Groundwater potential is
    influenced by various variables that vary depending on the location and conditions
    of the study area. Previous studies have shown that the same factors may have
    different effects on groundwater potential in different regions, and therefore,
    they cannot be generalized or transferred to other areas. For example, Rainfall
    was the most important factor for groundwater potential in Thessaly, Greece (Oikonomidis
    et al., 2015). In contrast, in the Ningtiaota region of China, elevation was the
    most critical factor (Hou et al., 2018). In the Chilgazi region of Iran, TWI and
    distance from rivers had a strong impact on groundwater potential (Tien Bui et
    al., 2019). Lithology was the most beneficial factor for mapping groundwater potential
    at a national scale in New Zealand (Singh et al., 2019). Elevation and soil type
    were the most and least significant factors, respectively, for the Kon Tum Province
    of Vietnam (Pham et al., 2021). Geology and rainfall were the most influential
    variables in mapping groundwater potential in the Hubei Province, China (Bai et
    al., 2022). Some other studies also found LULC as the most influential factor
    on groundwater potential. For example, Prabhakar and Tiwari (2015) found that
    improved greenery increased groundwater storage in some villages in India. Duguma
    and Duguma (2022) reported that LULC was one of the most important variables for
    the spatial assessment of groundwater potential in the Upper Blue Nile Basin,
    Ethiopia. Kordestani et al. (2019) and Avand et al. (2020) also reported different
    rankings of variables for groundwater potential, suggesting that the relevance
    of explanatory variables for groundwater potential evaluation depends on the study
    area''s geo-environmental and topo-hydrological features (Li et al., 2020). Therefore,
    it is essential to select and weigh the appropriate variables for each specific
    study area based on its characteristics and data availability. The main objective
    of our study was to compare the performance of four models for groundwater potential
    mapping. We showed that the ensemble models outperformed the single NBT model,
    and among them, MBAB-NBT had the best performance in terms of prediction accuracy
    and agreement with actual results. The NBT model is a simple and efficient classification
    algorithm that works well on small datasets with discrete features. However, it
    may not perform well when the features are continuous or when there are complex
    relationships between features. In this study, the NBT model had the poorest performance
    during the training phase, with the highest number of false negatives (FNs) among
    all the models. During the validation phase, its performance was also subpar compared
    to the other models, with low PPV and NPV values, indicating poor prediction accuracy.
    One possible reason for the poor performance of the NBT model is that it makes
    a strong assumption that the features are independent given the class label (Kohavi,
    1996; Pham et al., 2021; Wickramasinghe and Kalutarage, 2021). This assumption
    may not hold true in numerous real-world datasets, where the features may be correlated
    or interact with each other (Jaafari et al., 2018). The NBT model may fail to
    capture these dependencies and interactions, resulting in inaccurate predictions.
    Another possible reason for the poor performance of the NBT model is that it may
    be prone to overfitting or underfitting depending on the size and complexity of
    the dataset (Jiang et al., 2013; Kohavi, 1996; Lee et al., 2019). Overfitting
    occurs when the model learns too much from the training data and fails to generalize
    well to new data (Asteris et al., 2019a; Bardhan et al., 2021). Underfitting occurs
    when the model learns too little from the training data and fails to capture the
    underlying patterns of the data (Asteris et al., 2019c; Bai et al., 2019; Jaafari
    et al., 2022b). On the other hand, ensemble learning methods, i.e., Bagging-NBT
    (B-NBT), Decorate-NBT (D-NBT), and MultiBoost-NBT (MBAB-NBT), combine multiple
    classifiers to improve performance. These methods aim to reduce the variance and/or
    bias of the base classifier by creating diverse and complementary models that
    can capture different aspects of the data. B-NBT is a Bagging-based model that
    trains multiple instances of the base classifier on different subsets of the training
    data and combines them by majority voting. This method reduces the variance of
    the base classifier by averaging out its errors across different models (Breiman,
    1996; Quinlan, 1996). It also introduces diversity among the models by using random
    sampling with replacement, which means that some instances may appear multiple
    times in different subsets while others may not appear at all. D-NBT is a meta-learning
    model that decorates the base classifier with additional information learned from
    the training data to improve its performance. This method reduces the bias of
    the base classifier by adding artificial examples to each subset of the training
    data that are consistent with its predictions but inconsistent with those of other
    models (Melville and Mooney, 2005; Sun et al., 2015). It also introduces diversity
    among the models by using different artificial examples for each subset. MBAB-NBT
    is a Boosting-based model that iteratively trains weak classifiers and combines
    them into a strong classifier (Webb, 2000). This method reduces both the variance
    and bias of the base classifier by assigning weights to each instance in each
    subset of the training data based on its difficulty level and using these weights
    to emphasize the misclassified instances in subsequent models. It also introduces
    diversity among the models by using different subsets and weights for each model
    (Pham et al., 2019). Among these three ensemble methods, MBAB-NBT performed consistently
    well across most of the metrics during both phases. It had high accuracy and agreement
    with actual results as well as low error and deviation. One possible reason for
    its superior performance is that it can adaptively adjust its learning rate based
    on its performance on each subset of data (Webb, 2000). Learning rate refers to
    how much a model changes its parameters based on new information learned from
    data. A high learning rate means that a model changes its parameters quickly based
    on new information, while a low learning rate means that a model changes its parameters
    slowly based on new information. MBAB-NBT can adjust its learning rate by using
    different weights for each instance in each subset of data based on its difficulty
    level. A high weight means that an instance is difficult to classify and requires
    a high learning rate, while a low weight means that an instance is easy to classify
    and requires a low learning rate. MBAB-NBT can use a high learning rate for difficult
    instances to correct its errors quickly, while also using a low learning rate
    for easy instances to avoid overfitting or underfitting. In conclusion, the NBT
    model was outperformed by its ensemble versions because it made a strong assumption
    that the features are independent given the class label, which may not hold true
    in many real-world datasets. It also may be prone to overfitting or underfitting
    depending on the size and complexity of the dataset. Among the three ensemble
    models, MBAB-NBT performed the best because it could effectively balance between
    exploration and exploitation in learning from different subsets of data, while
    also adaptively adjusting its learning rate based on its performance on each subset
    of data. 7. Conclusions Groundwater potential maps are essential tools for planning
    and managing water resources, as well as conducting applied research on the spatial
    distribution of groundwater and the factors that influence it. However, the accuracy
    and reliability of the maps may depend on the method or approach used to generate
    them. In this study, we compared three different ensemble models with their base
    single model for predicting groundwater potential in the Central Highlands of
    Vietnam. We found that the ensemble models outperformed the single model. We also
    identified the most important variables for groundwater potential mapping based
    on their correlation with the target variable. The key findings from our study
    are outlined below: (i) the MultiBoost ensemble technique improved the performance
    of NBT more than the Bagging and Dagging ensemble techniques, (ii) LULC, rainfall,
    flow accumulation, fault density, elevation, river density, and TWI were the most
    relevant variables for groundwater potential in the study area, and (iii) the
    open-source WEKA software is an effective tool to analyze geospatial datasets
    for environmental research. The maps produced by this study can provide valuable
    information for decision-makers, stakeholders, and researchers who are interested
    in developing strategies for sustainable water resources management in the region.
    These maps can help in identifying the suitable locations and zones for groundwater
    exploitation and management, as well as assessing the vulnerability and sustainability
    of groundwater resources in the study area. Despite the promising results and
    insights gained from this study, there are certain limitations that should be
    acknowledged and considered in future research: (i) Limited dataset: The study
    utilized a dataset consisting of 501 wells data and twelve explanatory variables.
    While this dataset provided significant insights into the groundwater potential
    in the Central Highlands of Vietnam, expanding the dataset with additional wells
    data and variables could further enhance the accuracy and reliability of the models.
    Future research should focus on collecting larger datasets with more comprehensive
    variables to capture a wider range of factors influencing groundwater potential.
    (ii) Generalizability: The models developed in this study were specific to the
    Central Highlands of Vietnam. It is essential to test and validate the ensemble
    models in different geographic regions with varying hydrological and geological
    characteristics. Future research should explore the generalizability of the models
    by applying them to other regions and comparing the results. (iii) Spatial and
    temporal variability: Groundwater potential is influenced by spatial and temporal
    variability, including seasonal changes in rainfall patterns and land use/cover
    dynamics. This study considered only a one-time period and did not account for
    temporal variations. Future research should incorporate temporal variability by
    analyzing long-term datasets to capture the dynamics and changes in groundwater
    potential over time. Authors'' contributions Conceptualization: Binh Thai Pham,

  description: Modern agriculture increasingly relies on technology to enhance productivity
    and sustainability. This paper explores the integration of wireless sensor nodes
    as a pioneering approach for smart fault detection in agricultural systems. This
    research delves into the design, implementation, and validation of a network of
    wireless sensors strategically placed across agricultural fields. These sensors
    are equipped with advanced data collection capabilities to monitor various environmental
    parameters such as soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and plant health indicators.
    Using machine learning algorithms and data analytics, these sensor nodes autonomously
    detect anomalies, diseases, irrigation issues, and other faults in real-time.
    The paper discusses the technological framework, the challenges encountered, and
    the potential benefits of employing wireless sensor nodes for proactive fault
    detection in agriculture. The results demonstrate the efficiency of this approach
    in optimizing irrigation, fertilizer use, predictive harvesting, mitigating crop
    losses, and fostering sustainable farming practices. Ultimately, this research
    contributes to the advancement of precision agriculture by offering a scalable
    and efficient solution for early fault detection and intervention, thereby revolutionizing
    farming practices towards increased efficiency and sustainability.

  explanation: This paper proposes a smart fault detection system for agriculture
    based on a hybrid model combining wireless sensor nodes, blockchain technology,
    and an evolutionary recurrent self-organizing map (ERSOM) deep learning classifier.
    The proposed system aims to overcome limitations and challenges faced by traditional
    techniques in detecting faults in agricultural systems. The ERSOM model is trained
    using a database of agricultural system fault signals, and a bi-spectrum analysis
    is used to extract signal features for fault identification. The system's performance
    is evaluated using various metrics, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting
    and diagnosing faults in agricultural equipment and irrigation systems. The paper
    highlights the advantages of using wireless sensor nodes, blockchain technology,
    and deep learning in developing resilient and efficient fault detection systems
    for agriculture.
  extract_1: '"The proposed terminal wireless sensor node RTU comprises capture, processing,
    communication, and energy units. The Sensing unit includes a physical capture
    device for local environment data and an Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) transforming
    analog signals into digital ones interpreted by the microcontroller."'
  extract_2: '"The processing result will be carried out based on a comparison between
    the primitives and singularities of the signal received from the system to be
    controlled and the data characterizing all types of faults from an archived database
    and updated at each event at the level of the Block-chain to which it is linked."'

    and their seamless integration into various industries, agriculture has witnessed
    a paradigm shift towards precision farming. In this context, the deployment of
    wireless sensor nodes presents a promising avenue for proactive fault detection
    and real-time monitoring within agricultural landscapes. The conventional agricultural
    practices, while effective, often lack the precision and responsiveness demanded
    by the dynamic environmental conditions and evolving crop health challenges. Addressing
    this gap, the use of wireless sensor nodes offers an innovative approach by facilitating
    continuous and granular data collection across vast agricultural expanses. These
    sensor nodes, strategically placed throughout fields, enable the monitoring of
    crucial parameters such as soil moisture levels, temperature fluctuations, humidity
    variations, and vital plant health indicators. Harnessing the capabilities of
    these sensors coupled with advanced data analytics and machine learning algorithms,
    agricultural practitioners gain unprecedented insights into the intricacies of
    their farming ecosystems [1, 2]. This research endeavors to explore, analyze,
    and validate the efficiency of employing wireless sensor nodes as a cornerstone
    for smart fault detection in agricultural systems. By elucidating the technological
    framework, data acquisition methods, and the application of intelligent algorithms,

    on modern farming practices. Moreover, it seeks to address the challenges encountered
    in implementing wireless sensor networks in agriculture while highlighting their
    role in bolstering irrigation and fertilizer efficiency, predictive harvesting,
    minimizing crop losses, and fostering sustainable farming methods [3]. As the
    global population burgeons and the pressure on agricultural productivity intensifies,
    the need for innovative and proactive measures in farming becomes increasingly
    paramount. The integration of wireless sensor nodes stands poised to revolutionize
    the agricultural landscape, heralding a new era of precision, sustainability,
    and resilience in crop production. This paper endeavors to contribute to this
    unfolding narrative by providing empirical insights into the promising frontier
    of wireless sensor networks use for smart fault detection in agriculture, thereby

    unveiling opportunities for further advancement. Finally, the conclusion section
    encapsulates the research outcomes and insights gained. 2 Literal Review 2.1 Position
    of WSN Over Models Agriculture is undergoing a significant transformation owing
    to technological advancements, with wireless sensor networks (WSNs) emerging as
    a critical tool for precision farming. This review aims to comprehensively analyze
    the role, challenges, and potential of WSNs in smart fault detection within agricultural
    systems. WSNs have revolutionized agriculture by enabling real-time monitoring
    of crucial environmental parameters. These sensor nodes, strategically positioned
    across fields, collect data on soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and plant
    health indicators. Their integration with IoT technologies facilitates seamless
    data transmission and analysis, empowering farmers with actionable insights for
    informed decision-making [4, 5]. Despite their potential, the deployment of WSNs
    in agriculture presents several challenges. Power management, data accuracy, network
    scalability, and interoperability among heterogeneous sensor nodes remain primary
    concerns. Moreover, environmental factors such as signal interference, harsh weather
    conditions, and geographical obstacles pose hurdles in maintaining reliable connectivity.
    As technological framework, advancements in sensor technology, data analytics,
    and machine learning algorithms have propelled the capabilities of WSNs in fault
    detection. Innovations in sensor miniaturization, energy-efficient designs, and
    data processing techniques have enhanced their reliability and accuracy in identifying
    anomalies, diseases, and irrigation issues in crops. Further more, as application
    and benefits, WSNs offer multifaceted benefits in agriculture. They optimize resource
    use by providing precise and localized information, thereby reducing water and
    fertilizer wastage. Early fault detection facilitates timely intervention, mitigating
    crop losses and improving overall yield. Additionally, these systems promote sustainable
    farming practices by minimizing environmental impact through targeted and optimized
    agricultural interventions. Thus, WSN play a pivotal role in agricultural fault
    detection and can be positioned in relation to various strategies commonly used
    in this domain. In Rule-Based Systems, WSN takes a complementary position. It
    can gather real-time data from agricultural fields or equipment, providing continuous
    input for rule-based systems. The WSN feeds data to these systems, enabling the
    application of predefined rules for fault detection based on the collected sensor
    information [6, 7]. In Statistical Analysis, WSN takes an integral component position.
    It provides the necessary data for statistical analysis by continuously collecting
    and transmitting sensor data. The sensor nodes contribute real-time data streams
    that form the basis for establishing statistical models to identify anomalies
    or deviations from normal patterns [8]. In Machine Learning Algorithms, WSN takes
    a fundamental component position. It serves as the primary data collection infrastructure
    for machine learning algorithms. The continuous data streams from sensor nodes
    are used to train and update machine learning models for fault detection, providing
    the necessary input for adaptive learning and pattern recognition. In Fusion of
    Multiple Techniques, WSN has an enabling component position. It acts as the backbone
    for collecting multi-source data necessary for integrating multiple fault detection
    techniques. It provides diverse sensor data, facilitating the fusion and integration
    of rule-based, statistical, and machine learning strategies for comprehensive
    fault detection. In IoT-Enabled Smart Sensors, WSN has an integral component position.
    It consists of smart sensors equipped with communication capabilities, forming
    the basis for real-time monitoring and data transmission essential for fault detection
    in agriculture [9, 10]. In Blockchain-Enabled Systems, WSN has a data source position.
    It contributes to blockchain-enabled systems by providing the data that needs
    to be securely stored and authenticated. It generates the sensor data, which can
    be securely stored on the blockchain to ensure data integrity and traceability.
    In Long-Range Wireless Technologies (LoRa), WSN takes an infrastructure position.
    It leverages long-range wireless technologies for communication between sensor
    nodes and gateways. These technologies serve as the communication infrastructure
    within WSNs, facilitating long-range data transmission from remote agricultural
    areas [11, 12]. Comparing the WSN approach with existing fault detection techniques
    in agriculture involves highlighting the advantages of WSNs over traditional methods
    or other contemporary technologies. Below, an analysis showcasing how WSN approach
    excels in comparison to existing techniques: For Real-Time Monitoring and Timely
    Detection: WSNs enable continuous, real-time monitoring of agricultural parameters.
    They offer immediate fault detection upon deviation from predefined thresholds
    or abnormal patterns, reducing response time and potential losses. Whereas, traditional
    methods, such as manual inspections, periodic checks, or testing equipment, often
    lack real-time monitoring capabilities. They might result in delayed fault detection,
    leading to increased downtime and losses [13]. For Data-Driven Precision and Accuracy:
    WSNs collect and analyze a vast amount of data from multiple sensors, facilitating
    precise fault detection through machine learning algorithms and data fusion techniques.
    This leads to accurate fault identification and reduces false positives or negatives.
    However, some existing techniques rely on simple rules or manual inspections,
    which might lack the depth of analysis or the ability to adapt to complex fault
    patterns, potentially resulting in less accurate detections. Concerning Cost Efficiency
    and Resource Optimization: while initial setup costs for WSNs might be higher,
    they offer long-term cost efficiency by minimizing losses through early fault
    detection, optimizing resource utilization (water, fertilizers, predictive harvesting),
    and reducing manual labor requirements over time. While, traditional methods might
    incur higher labor costs due to manual inspections or require periodic testing
    equipment maintenance, potentially leading to higher operational expenses in the
    long run. About the Scalability and Flexibility: WSNs are scalable and adaptable.
    Additional sensors can be integrated easily into the network, offering flexibility
    in expanding coverage or integrating new sensors for evolving fault detection
    needs. Unlike, some traditional methods might face limitations in scalability,
    especially when relying on manual labor or fixed testing equipment, making it
    challenging to adapt to changing agricultural requirements or expanding operations.
    For Comprehensive Fault Detection and Decision Support: the integration of diverse
    fault detection techniques within WSNs, such as machine learning, statistical
    analysis, and real-time data fusion, offers a comprehensive approach. This enables
    informed decision-making and actionable insights for farmers or stakeholders.
    But, other methods from existing techniques might lack the comprehensive nature
    of WSNs, focusing on specific fault types or lacking the ability to provide holistic
    insights based on real-time, multi-parameter data [14, 15]. Some stations highlighting
    the development and application of WSN in remote fault detection are mentioned
    below. From early 2000s: the concept of WSNs begins to emerge with the development
    of early sensor nodes like Telos, Mica, and Tmote Sky. The Support Vector Machines
    (SVM) as Machine Learning Models gain traction for classification tasks due to
    their effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data. From mid-2000s: creation
    of IEEE 802.15.4 Standard. The standardization of low-rate wireless personal area
    networks (LR-WPANs) lays the foundation for the development of WSNs for various
    applications, including agriculture. Decision tree-based models and ensemble methods
    like Random Forests gain popularity for their ability to handle classification
    tasks and interpretability [16]. From late 2000s to early 2010s: WSNs start being
    adopted in precision agriculture, focusing on soil monitoring, weather forecasting,
    and crop health assessment. Deep learning approaches, particularly neural networks,
    see a resurgence due to advancements in computational power and data availability.
    From mid-2010s: the integration of WSNs with the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem
    becomes prevalent, enabling seamless data collection, processing, and analysis
    from agricultural sensors. Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) and its variants (e.g.
    XGBoost, LightGBM) gain attention for their superior performance in classification
    and regression tasks [16, 17]. From late 2010s to early 2020s: increased adoption
    of cloud-based platforms for data storage, processing, and scalability in handling
    large volumes of sensor data. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), especially long
    short-term memory (LSTM) networks, gain prominence for time-series analysis and
    prediction in agriculture, considering temporal dependencies in sensor data. Actually,
    recent developments focus on developing machine learning models that offer interpretability
    and explainability, such as Explainable AI (XAI), in detecting faults to aid decision-making
    in farming practices. Federated Learning explores federated learning techniques
    to train models collaboratively across different agricultural sites while preserving
    data privacy and security [18]. From another horizon, integrating blockchain technology
    into the realm of agricultural equipment and irrigation systems, especially concerning
    fault detection and data management, offers several potential benefits. Blockchain
    provides a tamper-proof and immutable ledger, ensuring the integrity of data collected
    by sensors in agricultural equipment. This feature prevents unauthorized alterations
    or manipulations, ensuring the authenticity of fault detection records.Through
    blockchain, every change or transaction recorded within the system can be traced
    back to its origin. This traceability can be valuable for tracking the history
    of faults detected in equipment or changes in irrigation systems over time. Blockchain''s
    decentralized nature enables secure data storage across multiple nodes, reducing
    the risk of a single point of failure and enhancing data security. Blockchain
    can facilitate controlled and permissioned access to sensor data. Authorized stakeholders,
    including farmers, agronomists, and maintenance personnel, can securely access
    specific data relevant to their roles. Smart contracts, self-executing contracts
    with predefined conditions, can automate tasks triggered by fault detections.
    For instance, when a fault is identified in an irrigation system, a smart contract
    could automatically trigger a maintenance request or adjust irrigation settings
    based on predefined parameters. Blockchain''s transparency can aid in tracking
    agricultural equipment and components throughout their lifecycle. This transparency
    ensures authenticity and reliability in the supply chain, allowing farmers to
    verify the origin and authenticity of equipment [19]. Implementing tokenization
    through blockchain could incentivize stakeholders for efficient equipment maintenance
    or early fault reporting. This system can reward participants with tokens or digital
    assets for contributing valuable data or maintaining equipment in optimal conditions.
    Blockchain can facilitate interoperability between different agricultural systems
    and platforms, allowing seamless integration of data from various sources. Standardization
    of data formats can enhance compatibility and collaboration among different stakeholders
    and systems. Blockchain-enabled systems can track environmental impact data associated
    with agricultural practices, including water usage, energy consumption, and carbon
    emissions. This transparency can help in adopting more sustainable and environmentally
    friendly practices [20]. Integrating blockchain technology into fault detection
    in agricultural equipment and irrigation systems requires careful consideration
    of implementation challenges such as scalability, interoperability, and regulatory
    compliance. However, leveraging blockchain''s inherent features can significantly
    enhance the security, transparency, and efficiency of fault detection processes
    in agriculture. According to the above descriptions, we have chosen to design
    an agricultural fault detection system based on a Delta-hybridization between
    WSN wireless sensor nodes, Block-chain and a Deep learning classifier ERSOM model
    that stands for Evolutionary Recurrent Self Organizing Map. 2.2 Node Principle
    A Node represents an autonomous real time computational system. It receives the
    signals through its integrated sensors and processes them using a Digital Signal
    Processor DSP. A sensor is a fundamental part of Smart technologies that functions
    as a transducer using various effects like capacitive or inductive (magnetic).
    A set of sensors, forming a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), collaborate autonomously
    to monitor and communicate information regarding potential issues. These autonomous
    microsystems communicate wirelessly in a designated space, known as a collector
    field. Nodes, equipped with high-end sensors, organize themselves into a self-structured
    topology, transmitting collected data to an information system or processing center,
    potentially via specialized nodes called “sinks.” Energy constraints, typically
    from small batteries, underscore the importance of managing energy as a critical
    resource in sensor nodes, making WSN technology pervasive and adaptable across
    diverse domains. In general, wireless sensors typically consist of various components
    including capture, processing, communication, and energy units. Depending on the
    application, additional elements like Global Positioning System GPS for environmental
    tracking or solar-powered mobility systems can be integrated. The resilience of
    WSN heavily relies on sensor material quality and precision. Despite their small
    size, nodes feature an efficient architecture incorporating multiple circuits
    on a single board, comprising detection units, microcontrollers, RF-antennas,
    and power units [21]. Further details on the internal structure of a node are
    depicted in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 Architecture of wireless sensor node Full size image
    The detection unit comprises a set of sensors to assess information reliability
    from the environment; in case of sensor failure, it ensures data integrity. Sensor
    outputs link to the processing unit via anti-aliasing filters and an ADC for compatibility.
    This unit functions as the node''s core, managing internal operations, fault detection,
    energy, and coordination among WSN nodes'' processors. ROM and RAM storage support
    processing instructions, communication programs, and collected data. An RF antenna
    circuit enables communication between nodes, while the power unit''s lifespan
    relies on limited resources. External flash memory expands applications limited
    by chip memory, and internal I/O buses ease component communication within the
    node. An RF antenna is integrated at the node''s extremity. 3 Adopted Approach
    Our idea is to design a remote agricultural fault detection model offering better
    reliability and efficiency than those established by existing methods. This approach
    is based on the Delta-Hybridization between WSN wireless sensor nodes, Block-chain
    and a Deep learning classifier ERSOM model that stands for Evolutionary Recurrent
    Self Organizing Map. This last model represents the pivot of the analysis of the
    signals received by sensors. It revolves around a recurrent evolutionary algorithm
    of a self-organizing neural map with unsupervised learning, giving the possibility
    of processing a large volume of data. Recurrence is applied to this neural map
    in order to integrate the dynamic temporal aspect by adapting it to the ability
    to process and evaluate dynamic and not static data information. The fault detection
    and recognition algorithm carried out by this recurrent neural map will subsequently
    be considered a nucleus or an individual of population of iterations supported
    by an evolutionary genetic algorithm ensuring the extension of the search space.
    This insight allows to optimize results and avoid being trapped in an optimal
    static state. This algorithm will be managed by the DSP Mounted on the Sensor
    Node card. This algorithm will be managed by the DSP Mounted on the Sensor Node
    card. The processing result will be carried out based on a comparison between
    the primitives and singularities of the signal received from the system to be
    controlled and the data characterizing all types of faults from an archived database
    and updated at each event at the level of the Block-chain to which it is linked.
    This result will be broadcast in real time through the WSN to a master node linked
    by an HMI interface. The Blockchain and WSN models are detailed previously. The
    following Fig. 2 offers a view on the adopted strategy. Fig. 2 Typical used wireless
    sensor network Full size image RTU stands for remote terminal unit; terminal Node
    mounted on the system to be controlled. MTU stands for master terminal unit; terminal
    Node linked to human–machine interface HMI. The proposed terminal wireless sensor
    node RTU comprises capture, processing, communication, and energy units. The Sensing
    unit includes a physical capture device for local environment data and an Analog
    to Digital Converter (ADC) transforming analog signals into digital ones interpreted
    by the microcontroller. Memories store information from the capture unit. The
    communication unit, known as the Transceiver unit, handles wireless data transmission
    and reception. It can be optical, as in Smart Dust Nodes, or radiofrequency-based,
    with optical communication being robust against electrical interference but requiring
    a direct line of sight. Radio frequency units include modulation, demodulation,
    filtering, and multiplexing circuits. Sensor nodes equipped with various sensors,
    e.g., temperature, humidity, soil moisture, pH sensors, relevant to agricultural
    monitoring. These sensor nodes are distributed across the agricultural area, collecting
    real-time data continuously from the environment such as soil moisture levels,
    temperature variations, humidity, and other relevant parameters related to crop
    health and equipment status. Sensor nodes communicate wirelessly with each other
    and with a central base station or gateway, called sink, using communication protocols
    such as Long Range transmission LoRa. Wireless communication allows the collected
    data to be transmitted over extended distances to a centralized location for further
    processing and analysis. Data collected from various sensor nodes is aggregated
    and transmitted to a centralized system or cloud-based platform. In this centralized
    system, the received data undergoes processing, analysis, and storage for fault
    detection and decision-making. Advanced data analytics and machine learning algorithms
    are applied to the collected data to identify patterns, anomalies, or deviations
    from normal conditions. These algorithms analyze sensor data to detect potential
    faults in agricultural equipment, irrigation systems, or anomalies in environmental
    parameters that could affect crop health. Once anomalies or faults are detected
    through data analysis, the system generates alerts or notifications to relevant
    stakeholders, farmers, agronomists, maintenance personnel, for timely intervention.
    Early warning systems or automated alerts enable proactive maintenance, minimizing
    the impact of faults on agricultural operations. It is important to highlight
    that the ERSOM neural model''s learning phase on an agricultural systems fault
    database might take several hours and can reach one day. The duration depends
    on factors such as the database size, model topology, neuron count, learning iterations,
    and stopping criteria. Once the model has learned and becomes proficient in identifying
    these faults, its real-time testing phase will be instantaneous during system
    control. The signal processing steps for the controlled part proceed as follows:
    Firstly, filtering, windowing, and segmenting the signal to extract primitives
    defining the contained information. Various methods define these primitives, such
    as the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) matrix. However, our approach
    opts for determining the primitives as Bi-spectrum matrices, as they are well-suited
    for characterizing highly transient stochastic signals. Thus, the Bi-spectrum
    designates an autocorrelation of order 2, called moment of order 2. Namely that
    the cross correlation is the measure of the analogy between two signals according
    to a time shift applied to one of them. One of the signals will be the signal
    measured by the sensors and the other signal is that of the database as a reference.
    The autocorrelation goes deeper to determine the coefficients of similarities
    between the measured signal and the reference one which resembles it better among
    the samples of signals in the database as a reference. The Bi-spectrum, as an
    autocorrelation of order 2, goes even deeper to be like a more selective filter
    in the determination of the similarity coefficients to a very precise default
    sample. Each matrix of bispectrum coefficients will be concatinated vertically
    in order to reduce it into a line vector, without loss of characteristics, which
    represents the input to our ERSOM model. It will be processed quickly to visualize
    the type of defects on one of the neurons, if any. The computation of the bi-spectral
    coefficients will be performed in the following manner: We examine a discrete
    signal x(n) obtained from the motor-pump machine, with a mean of zero and considered
    a locally stationary random process. The signal''s length, denoted as N, ranges
    from 0 to. N − 1. The expression for its autocorrelation function is as follows:
    $$ R_{xx} (m) = E\\left\\{ {x(n)x(n + m)} \\right\\} $$ (1) The calculated \\({\\text{E}}\\left\\{
    \\cdot \\right\\}\\), known as the mathematical expectation, represents the average
    within a set, serving as a statistical function with a discrete time-delay denoted
    as m. It is also referred to as the second-order moment. If the two signals are
    not correlated, we have the autocorrelation R = 0. In case of resemblance we obtain
    simularity coefficients. The Power Spectrum PS is determined by applying the Fourier
    transform (FT) to the preceding formula [22]. $$ P_{xx} (f) = \\sum\\limits_{m
    = - \\infty }^{ + \\infty } {R_{xx} (m)} \\,e^{ - j2\\pi fm} $$ (2) An alternalive
    formula can be used. $$ P_{xx} (f) = E\\left\\{ {X(f)X^{ * } (f)} \\right\\} =
    E\\left\\{ {\\left| {X(f)^{2} } \\right|} \\right\\} $$ (3) X* represents the
    conjugate of X(f), which computes the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of our
    primary current signal to be controlled, x(n). $$ X(f) = \\sum\\limits_{n = 0}^{N
    - 1} {x(n)} \\,e^{{ - j\\frac{2\\pi fn}{N}}} $$ (4) Additionally, we derive the
    bispectrum, referred to as bispectral density B(f1, f2), by applying a transform
    function (TF) to the third-order moment depicted in the equation below. $$ M_{3}^{x}
    (k,l) = E\\left\\{ {x^{ * } (n)x(n + k)x(n + l)} \\right\\}. $$ (5) The parameters
    k and l represent time delay points. Essentially, we need to estimate the expected
    bispectrum values from limited data using the following formula. $$ \\begin{aligned}
    \\hat{B}(f_{1} ,f_{2} ) & = \\frac{1}{M}\\sum\\limits_{k = 1}^{M} {X_{k} (f_{1}
    )X_{k} (f_{2} )X_{k}^{ * } (f_{1} + f_{2} )} \\\\ & \\approx E\\left\\{ {X(f_{1}
    )X(f_{2} )X^{ * } (f_{1} + f_{2} )} \\right\\} \\\\ \\end{aligned} $$ (6) The
    sensor detects the fault signal x(n), which is subsequently processed by the processor
    within the suitable WSN node. This calculation involves setting f1 and f2 to an
    identical value, denoted as f, and is expressed as: $$ \\hat{B}(f_{1} ,f_{2} )\\left|
    {_{{f_{1} = f_{2} = f}} } \\right. = \\hat{D}(f) \\approx E\\left\\{ {X^{2} (f)X^{
    * } (2f)} \\right\\}. $$ (7) As exemple, considering a fracture defect in the
    bars of a motor-pump rotor estimated from research to constitute 10% of potential
    defects. The features of BRB related to this specific failure type include frequency
    components defined by the following Eq. (8) [22, 23]. $$ f_{BRB} = \\left[ {\\left(
    \\frac{k}{p} \\right)\\left( {1 - s} \\right) \\pm s} \\right]f_{s} $$ (8) Observing
    that the supply frequency is denoted by fs, the number of pole pairs by p, k represents
    a constant proportionality, and s signifies the rotor magnetic slip. Given the
    effects of speed ripple, it''s plausible that supplementary frequency components
    might appear in the stator current spectrum. Hence, an additional Eq. (9) could
    identify these components. $$ f_{BRBs} = (1 \\pm 2ks)f_{s} $$ (9) To identify
    rotor faults through its connected WSN node, analysis of the side-band frequency
    components at (1 ± 2 s)fs has been conducted. We establish that the lower sideband
    represents the primary fault frequency, while the upper sideband signifies the
    harmonic frequency of certain resultant velocity fluctuations. Consequently, we
    can use these two distinct values as effective control factors. To create a singular
    factor, we calculate their average, as shown below. $$ I_{dB} = \\left[ {20\\log_{10}
    \\left( {\\frac{{I_{l} }}{I}} \\right) + 20\\log_{10} \\left( {\\frac{{I_{r} }}{I}}
    \\right)} \\right]/2 $$ (10) Namely, I1 represents the fault module, Ir signifies
    the rotor current module, which is depicted by the upper sideband, and I represents
    the stator current module as the fundamental. Additionally, the stator current
    related to a mechanical BRB fault can be mathematically depicted. This model characterizes
    the stator current concerning electrical asymmetries in the rotor, generating
    what are known as sideband frequencies, expressed by the equation. $$ \\begin{aligned}
    i_{a} (t) & = i_{f} \\cos (\\omega t - \\varphi ) + \\sum\\limits_{k} {i_{l,k}
    } \\cos ((\\omega - \\omega_{f,k} )t - \\varphi_{l,k} ) \\\\ & \\quad + \\sum\\limits_{k}
    {i_{r,k} } \\cos ((\\omega + \\omega_{f,k} )t - \\varphi_{r,k} ) \\\\ \\end{aligned}
    $$ (11) where fs is the fundamental frequency of the electrical power. As \\(\\omega_{f,k}
    = 2ks\\omega\\) and \\(\\omega = 2\\pi f_{s}\\), the above expression will be:
    $$ \\begin{aligned} i_{a} (t) & = i_{f} \\cos (2\\pi f_{s} t - \\varphi ) + \\sum\\limits_{k}
    {i_{l,k} } \\cos (2\\pi f_{l,k} t - \\varphi_{l,k} ) \\\\ & \\quad + \\sum\\limits_{k}
    {i_{r,k} } \\cos (2\\pi f_{r,k} t - \\varphi_{r,k} ) \\\\ \\end{aligned} $$ (12)
    The separated formula of the controlled current signal will undergo processing
    by the node''s microcontroller. It will then be compared to a healthy signal used
    as a reference to detect faults in machines.This procedure involves applying a
    transform function to the aforementioned equation to obtain the subsequent spectral
    relationship. $$ \\begin{aligned} I_{a} (f) & = \\frac{{i_{f} }}{2}\\delta (f

    from the preceding equation, the processor within the WSN Node of the respective
    machine, following the requested information routing at the collection node level,
    enables us to visualize curves labeled accordingly for power spectrum and bispectrum,
    depicted in Fig. 3. Fig. 3 Power spectrum PS and bi-spectrum of a node received
    signal [24] Full size image While this proposed approach offers significant advantages
    in agricultural fault detection, it is not without limitations. Overcoming these
    limitations and planning for future enhancements are pivotal to optimize WSN efficacy
    in agriculture. The constraints include issues such as limited battery life and
    energy consumption, data security and privacy concerns, scalability challenges,
    data management complexities, sensor accuracy reliability, implementation costs,
    and the need for interdisciplinary knowledge integration. To address these, advancements
    in low-power sensor technologies, robust encryption, improved scalability, efficient
    data processing, enhanced sensor reliability, cost-effective solutions, and interdisciplinary
    collaborations are essential. By focusing on technological advancements, refined
    protocols, and collaborative endeavors, WSNs can become more efficient, reliable,
    cost-effective, and user-friendly, ensuring widespread adoption and seamless integration
    into agricultural practices. A techno-economic study shows that implementing Wireless
    Sensor Networks (WSNs) in agriculture offers multifaceted advantages, but a comprehensive
    cost–benefit analysis compared to traditional fault detection methods is essential
    to ascertain their overall value. Examining the cost–benefit analysis reveals
    numerous benefits of WSNs in agriculture, such as enhanced precision and efficiency
    in monitoring parameters, real-time data collection enabling timely interventions,
    reduced labor and operational costs, optimized resource utilization, and early
    fault detection capabilities. However, implementing WSNs involves costs related
    to hardware, installation, maintenance, and data management. When compared to
    traditional methods, WSNs showcase superior accuracy, cost efficiency in the long
    run, scalability, comprehensive coverage, and adaptability to changing agricultural
    needs. Despite the higher initial investment, WSNs prove to be more efficient,
    minimizing losses, optimizing resources, and offering real-time, accurate data
    for improved productivity and sustainability in agriculture. In a simplified qualitative
    perspective, WSNs exhibit higher accuracy, real-time capabilities, scalability,
    and potential for cost reduction over time, leading to a moderately high to high
    techno-economic score, whereas traditional methods may offer lower initial costs
    but could result in increased long-term operational expenses and potential losses,
    resulting in a moderate to low techno-economic score. 4 Experiment Results The
    experimental setup consists of the following components: A three-phase induction
    machine under the control of an ‘OMRON’ inverter. The rotor shaft is linked to
    a DC generator, connected to a rheostat for load control. Characteristics of the
    induction machine include: Nominal power: 4 kW Nominal speed: 1480 rpm Moment
    of inertia: J = 0.013 kg m2 Number of stove pairs: P = 2 SKF 6208 ball bearing
    with mechanical rotational frequencies: outer ring (fbext = 89.4 Hz), inner ring
    (fbint = 136 Hz), ball cage (fc = 9.94 Hz), and ball frequency (fbille = 58.4
    Hz). Using a Micro-log portable terminal for acquiring and storing sensor measurements.
    The sensor used is a piezoelectric accelerometer. The entire test bench is defined
    by Fig. 4 below. Fig. 4 Experimental bench Full size image Our ERSOM fault classification
    model was trained using an energetically balanced, locally developed database.
    This database comprises 100 signal samples obtained from the test bench, representing
    diverse failures such as mechanical, electrical, vibration, thermal, and physical
    issues, accompanying the normal signal. The neuron map consists of 100 neurons,
    and the ERSOM model was trained with a stopping criterion after 1000 iterations.
    Subsequently, during the control and testing phase, the ERSOM model analyzed the
    stator signal received from the machine, specifically depicting a mechanical fault
    in the ball bearing. The resulting output of the ERSOM model visualized the topology
    showcased in Fig. 5. Fig. 5 Visualization of the inner ring failure over ERSOM
    model Full size image The topology depicted by ERSOM revealed the presence of
    a ball bearing fault indicated by the frequency Fbi. This fault is accurately
    defined within the inner ring and is constrained by the cutoff harmonics Fn1 and
    Fn2, situated close to the Best Matching Unit (BMU) neuron linked to the fault.
    Additionally, further examination reveals the presence of the reasoning frequency
    Fre generated by the primary fault. Tthe character ‘h’ indicates a healthy signal.
    We plot the spectral amplitude of the processed signal and observe the curve in
    Fig. 6. Fig. 6 Spectrum of the inner ring failure Full size image The main fault
    occupies a frequency of 680 Hz and the two harmonics are present with a difference
    on either side of 25 Hz. This implies that Fn1 has a frequency of 655 Hz and Fn2
    is at a frequency of 705 Hz. In the same way we can see the curve which defines
    the bi-spectrum of the same machine when it is requested by the same frequencies
    of a failure, as shown in Fig. 7. Fig. 7 The bi-spectrum of the inner ring failure
    Full size image Furthermore, using Bi-Spectrum analysis will aid in discerning
    the severity of faults. Referring to Fig. 7, it becomes apparent that the encountered
    peaks are extremely abrupt and lack any frequency breadth. In the same way, the
    rules determining the performance criteria of the fault classifier models which
    qualify the operation of the WSN Nodes are established as follows: a. Accuracy:
    measures the overall correctness of the model''s predictions. Its formula is expressed
    as follows [25, 26]: $$ {\\mathbf{Ac}} = \\left( {{\\text{TP}} + {\\text{TN}}}
    \\right)/\\left( {{\\text{TP}} + {\\text{TN}} + {\\text{FP}} + {\\text{FN}}} \\right)
    $$ (16) where TP = True Positives, TN = True Negatives, FP = False Positives,
    FN = False Negatives. Accuracy gives the ratio of correctly predicted instances
    to the total instances in the dataset. b. Precision: indicates the ratio of correctly
    predicted positive observations to the total predicted positive observations.
    It has the following formula: $$ \\Pr = {\\text{TP}}/\\left( {{\\text{TP}} + {\\text{FP}}}
    \\right) $$ (17) Precision focuses on the accuracy of positive predictions and
    indicates the model''s ability to avoid false positives. c. Recall (Sensitivity
    or True Positive Rate): Recall is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations
    to all actual positives. It is defined by the following formula: $$ {\\mathbf{Recall}}
    = {\\text{TP}}/\\left( {{\\text{TP}} + {\\text{FN}}} \\right) $$ (18) Recall measures
    the model''s ability to identify all relevant instances, showing its sensitivity
    to true positives. d. F1-score: F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and
    recall. It provides a balance between precision and recall. It is calculated using
    the following formula: $$ {\\text{F1-score}} = 2*\\left( {{\\text{Precision}}*{\\text{Recall}}}
    \\right)/\\left( {{\\text{Precision}} + {\\text{Recall}}} \\right) $$ (19) F1-score
    considers both false positives and false negatives and is useful when the class
    distribution is imbalanced. The obtained indicators are presented in Table 1.
    Table 1 Evaluation of classifier models Full size table These findings are highlighted
    by the Fig. 8 represented in below. Wherein, It is remarkable that the proposed
    ERSOM model is clearly advantageous compared to other models. Fig. 8 Performance
    of different classifier models Full size image Based on the Fig. 8 curve, it''s
    evident that neural models, particularly the dynamic model RSOM and the evolutionary
    model ERSOM, hold superior positions in performance compared to others. Nonetheless,
    it''s worth noting that SVM has the potential to surpass both the Kmeans moving
    center algorithm and the static SOM model in terms of performance. 5 Results Discussion
    The ERSOM deep learning model’s topology, Fig. 5, reveals that among the 100 neurons,
    merely 2 neurons remain unoccupied. This signifies an impressive defect identification
    rate of 98% using this model. Thus, it offers a precise objective evaluation with
    a well-defined visualization. The ERSOM map identifies the anomaly on the inner
    ring, delineated by the frequency fbi signified by the winning neuron. Adjacent
    neurons signal frequencies fn1 and fn2, representing fbi + fc and fbi–fc, respectively.
    The indicator fre denotes the resonance frequency of the induction machine''s
    structure. The curve depicted in Fig. 6 represents the spectral amplitude of the
    signal under examination, which help us in mechanical inner ring defect identification.
    However, this assessment remains subjective and lacks defined scores for evaluation.
    The spectrum illustrated in the same Fig. 6, depicting the vibration signal from
    the sensor, discloses the following insights: The amplitude evolution of harmonic
    components follows a pattern such as (555 + k25) Hz, where k = 0, 1, 2, 3, …,
    representing frequencies resulting from the ball''s passage on the indentation.
    A substantial increase in amplitudes, approximately 100 dB around 780 Hz, signifies
    the resonance of the structure, possibly attributed to the 31st harmonic resonance
    of rotation (780.2/25 = 31.2). The identification of the 5th order harmonic (680.2/136 = 5)
    reveals the presence of a mechanical anomaly in the inner ring when observed in
    the spectrum''s zoomed mode. The Bi-spectrum plotted in Fig. 7 distinctly illustrates
    a resemblance to the outcomes presented in the ERSOM topology depicted in Fig.
    5. This similarity indicates that the ERSOM model, trained and tested using Bi-spectrum
    coefficients, aligns closely with the observed results. Consequently, this correlation
    strongly substantiates the accuracy and validity of the ERSOM deep learning model
    employed to steer the WSN Node. As depicted in Fig. 8, it''s evident that the
    ERSOM deep learning evolutionary model stands out significantly due to its efficiency
    compared to other models. This superiority is attributed to its integration of
    three essential criteria: evolutionaryism for broadening the search space, dynamism
    facilitated by a loop of recurrence that incorporates temporal aspects, and a
    neuronal aspect that mimics human thought processes. However, it''s important
    to note that this proposed model demands considerably more time during its unsupervised
    learning phase. Moreover, diverse outcomes arise from various fault detection
    strategies in agriculture: Rule-Based Systems: Swift fault identification using
    predefined rules, as seen in detecting irrigation system faults. Statistical Analysis:
    Identification of anomalies or outliers in soil moisture data, suggesting potential
    system issues. Machine Learning Algorithms: Improved accuracy in spotting subtle
    changes in crop health, aiding in early disease detection. Fusion of Multiple
    Techniques: Enhanced precision by combining strategies like rule-based systems
    and machine learning for fault detection. IoT-Enabled Smart Sensors: Real-time
    monitoring and rapid identification of temperature fluctuations, indicating potential
    crop damage. Blockchain-Enabled Systems: Ensuring secure and traceable records
    of fault detection through blockchain technology. Note that, Zigbee finds common
    usage in home automation, industrial control systems, and healthcare due to its
    cost-effectiveness and low power consumption. Meanwhile, Bluetooth enjoys widespread
    adoption in consumer electronics such as smartphones, audio devices, and wearables
    owing to its user-friendly nature and compatibility. The Internet serves various
    sectors, encompassing communication, commerce, cloud services, and IoT applications.
    Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) excel in environmental monitoring, agriculture,
    and healthcare, offering real-time data collection from distant areas. Notably,
    WSN tends to have lower data rates but can cover extensive distances, while the
    Internet exhibits high return on investment ROI potential, particularly in business,
    communication, and data services. Comparably, Wireless Sensor Networks WSN technology
    can have a strong ROI in industries like environmental monitoring, healthcare,
    and agriculture due to their ability to gather data from remote or hazardous locations.
    However, using WSN for fault detection in agriculture encounters key challenges
    such as: Limited access to power sources in remote areas affects device lifespan
    and functionality. Varied landscapes impede signal transmission, affecting accuracy.
    Environmental factors impact sensor accuracy, requiring regular calibration. Efficiently
    handling large data volumes poses computational challenges. High deployment costs
    in vast agricultural areas need a balance for effectiveness. Security and protecting
    sensitive data during transmission is critical. Adapting WSN with existing systems
    is complex, requiring compatibility measures. As avenues for future research and
    improvements to reveal opportunities for further progress, we point out that advancements
    in sensor technology, energy efficiency, and tailored algorithms are crucial to
    overcome these challenges, realizing WSN''s full potential in precise agriculture
    fault detection. 6 Conclusion The WSNs are actually widely applicable in major
    emerging technology. We expressed, in this topic, the ability of the proposed
    Wireless Sensor Node strategy, which becomes a smart powerful tool in remote monitoring
    condition. Our approach is enriched by using the higher order spectrum called
    Bi-spectrum in primitive extraction and analysis of controled signal over an evolutionary
    recurrent self organizing deep learning model ERSOM. This model is implemented
    on the DSP of a Wireless Node Card. Our adopted approach is based on the Delta-Hybridization
    between WSN wireless sensor nodes, Block-chain and a Deep learning classifier
    ERSOM model to overcome some limitations and challenges experienced by traditional
    techniques. The practical application of this method for detecting agricultural
    defects demonstrates its resilience in analyzing these issues and making real-time
    decisions, showcasing promising results in comparison to current techniques. However,
    there are additional paths for further advancement in the future. Data Availability

  description: The quality of water used for irrigation is one of the major threats
    to maintaining the long-term sustainability of agricultural practices. Although
    some studies have addressed the suitability of irrigation water in different parts
    of Bangladesh, the irrigation water quality in the drought-prone region has yet
    to be thoroughly studied using integrated novel approaches. This study aims to
    assess the suitability of irrigation water in the drought-prone agricultural region
    of Bangladesh using traditional irrigation metrics such as sodium percentage (NA%),
    magnesium adsorption ratio (MAR), Kelley's ratio (KR), sodium adsorption ratio
    (SAR), total hardness (TH), permeability index (PI), and soluble sodium percentage
    (SSP), along with novel irrigation indices such as irrigation water quality index
    (IWQI) and fuzzy irrigation water quality index (FIWQI). Thirty-eight water samples
    were taken from tube wells, river systems, streamlets, and canals in agricultural
    areas, then analyzed for cations and anions. The multiple linear regression model
    predicted that SAR (0.66), KR (0.74), and PI (0.84) were the primary important
    elements influencing electrical conductivity (EC). Based on the IWQI, all water
    samples fall into the “suitable” category for irrigation. The FIWQI suggests that
    75% of the groundwater and 100% of the surface water samples are excellent for
    irrigation. The semivariogram model indicates that most irrigation metrics have
    moderate to low spatial dependence, suggesting strong agricultural and rural influence.
    Redundancy analysis shows that Na+, Ca2+, Cl−, K+, and HCO3− in water increase
    with decreasing temperature. Surface water and some groundwater in the southwestern
    and southeastern parts are suitable for irrigation. The northern and central parts
    are less suitable for agriculture because of elevated K+ and Mg2+ levels. This
    study determines irrigation metrics for regional water management and pinpoints
    suitable areas in the drought-prone region, which provides a comprehensive understanding
    of sustainable water management and actionable steps for stakeholders and decision-makers.

  explanation: 'The paper aims to evaluate the suitability of automated irrigation
    systems that integrate IoT and machine learning for real-time irrigation management.
    The specific point this response focuses on is the relevance of the paper to different
    components of the irrigation management pipeline. Specifically, the paper is relevant

    analysis and decision-making. The data collected from sensors can be used to train
    machine learning algorithms that can make informed decisions about irrigation.
    These algorithms can be used to adjust irrigation schedules, identify leaks, and
    diagnose problems with irrigation systems. By providing new methods for data analysis
    and decision-making, the paper can help to improve the overall efficiency and
    effectiveness of automated irrigation systems.


    Overall, the paper is a valuable contribution to the field of automated irrigation
    systems and has the potential to make a significant impact on the global food

    Bangladesh 1. Introduction Water scarcity is a growing problem for agriculture
    practices worldwide, especially in drought-prone areas. This threatens food security
    and agricultural crop yields (Islam et al., 2022). The quality of groundwater
    and surface water is important for growing crops and maintaining soil health (Rahman
    et al., 2017; Ahmed et al., 2020b). This is because both surface and groundwater
    are the primary water sources for agriculture production in many parts of the
    world, including Bangladesh. In recent times, numerous human-inducing factors
    such as unplanned urbanization, industrialization, increasing application of chemical
    fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides, and insecticides, and residential and commercial
    consumption of water have had a significant impact on both surface and groundwater
    quality in Bangladesh and the globe (Ahmed et al., 2020a; Elsayed et al., 2020;
    Masoud et al., 2022; Mia et al., 2023). Previous studies have identified several
    natural factors that have an impact on water quality deterioration, such as evaporation
    of water, especially surface water, weathering of rocks and minerals, exchange
    of various ions through the water system, and seawater intrusion (Li et al., 2019;
    Elsayed et al., 2020; Masoud et al., 2022; Eid et al., 2023). The irrigation water
    quality significantly influences soil salinization, soil fertility and productivity
    reduction, and health risks (Mikunthan et al., 2010; Prakash et al., 2020; Gaagai
    et al., 2023). On the one hand, excessive groundwater withdrawals meet the demand
    for water consumption for large populations. On the other hand, extreme salinity,
    flash flooding, and brackish water are the leading factors that are continuously
    deteriorating the quality of irrigation water (Gaagai et al., 2023; Rao et al.,
    2021; Ravindra et al., 2022; Shammi et al., 2023). In addition, persistent toxic
    chemicals can contaminate the groundwater and surface water, reducing water quality.
    Therefore, continuous surveillance of both surface and groundwater using credible
    water valuation techniques is essential to mitigate adverse effects on irrigation
    water resources and their sustainable management (Singh et al., 2020; Egbueri,
    2022; Ibrahim et al., 2023; Al-Mashreki et al., 2023; Gad et al., 2023). Irrigation
    metrics measure how well an irrigation system works and show how much water plants
    need. They are critical for determining the optimal irrigation schedule and reducing
    water waste. Selecting an appropriate irrigation index depends on several factors,
    including climatic conditions, crop type, and soil type. Previous studies have
    used various indexes to evaluate the quality of groundwater and surface water
    for irrigation purposes (Elsayed et al., 2020; Mia et al., 2023; Eid et al., 2023;
    Gaagai et al., 2023; Siddique et al., 2022). Plenty of research has been done
    to understand the feasibility of water for irrigation using geographic information
    system (GIS) methods (Table S1). Regardless of location, lithology, landscape,
    or climate, the analysis of this research functioned as a foundation for developing
    the variables, understanding the importance of these generated variables, and
    selecting the quality of irrigation water. Existing mathematical techniques of
    hydrochemistry evaluations of water quality in actual time and on a large scale
    are limited; there is an essential need for precise, realistic, speedy, and low-cost
    measurement methods. These methodologies are helpful to the decision-makers to
    establish a simple indicator that can critically and methodically evaluate groundwater
    quality (Krishna Kumar et al., 2015; Masoud et al., 2022). Irrigation water quality
    (IWQ) is routinely analyzed using a variety of irrigation water quality indices
    (IWQIs) and parameters based on the criteria set by the Food and Agriculture Organization
    (FAO) (Ayers and Westcot, 1985). The literature review (Table S1) also found that
    numerous studies have used multiple IWQIs such as sodium percentage (NA%), sodium
    adsorption ratio (SAR), magnesium adsorption ratio (MAR), potential salinity (PS),
    residual sodium carbonate (RSC), Kelley''s ratio (KR), total dissolved solids
    (TDS), total hardness (TH), and permeability index (PI) to evaluate water quality
    for agricultural purposes (Abbasnia et al., 2019; Aravinthasamy et al., 2020;
    Panneerselvam et al., 2021; Rao et al., 2021; Gharibi et al., 2019; Masoud et
    al., 2022). Horton (1965) first combines many water-related factors into a single
    value to assess water quality. Later, many scholars created combined water quality
    indices to determine the suitability of groundwater and surface water for irrigation
    purposes, industrial usage, and biodiversity conservation (Gad et al., 2021; Khadr
    et al., 2021). To obtain an actual outcome from this qualitative assessment approach,
    expert knowledge in allocating variable weights to calculate the water quality
    index score is required, which, in some cases, creates difficulties and faces
    a significant challenge now a day. Therefore, implementing a viable and cost-effective
    water quality assessment approach is critical to get the reliability of water
    quality data. Geostatistics is a statistical method to analyze and interpolate
    spatial data on soil and water properties for sustainable irrigation water management
    (Chatterjee et al., 2021). Khadr et al. (2021), used geostatistics to analyze
    the spatiotemporal variability of soil water content for irrigation management
    and water-saving practices in a drought-prone region in Pakistan. In addition,
    many geospatial techniques have been used to describe the spatial distribution
    and analysis of groundwater and surface water quality (Chidambaram et al., 2022;
    Cordier et al., 2021; Kumar et al., 2019). In addition, remote sensing and geospatial
    techniques have recently gained increasing attention in the assessment of irrigation
    indices and water use in agriculture (Chatterjee et al., 2021). Fuzzy logic is
    a mathematical tool for dealing with uncertainty and imprecision in data (Karmaker
    et al., 2023). It is widely used in agricultural research for decision-making
    processes, especially water management (Oladipo et al., 2020). Environmental problems
    are now solved using fuzzy set theory. Recently, fuzzy logic has been used for
    the water quality index (WQI) because it improves the accuracy and precision of
    criteria for decision-making (Dhaoui et al., 2022; Venkatramanan et al., 2015;
    Mckone and Deshpande, 2005). GIS uses categorization with fuzzy logic to evaluate
    water quality. Fuzzy logic and GIS technologies improve descriptions and assessments
    of natural variations (Venkatramanan et al., 2017; Anand and Karunanidhi, 2020;
    Ahmed et al., 2020a; Brahim et al., 2021) and their combined approach provides
    a robust technique to assess water quality even in limited field observations
    (Yanar and &Akyürek, 2006; Tsiko and Haile, 2011; Biwas and Nahar, 2019; Ahmed
    et al., 2020a). Prior studies have ignored multivariate statistical methods due
    to study constraints and technical challenges and preferred GIS, fuzzy logic,
    and different metrics for sustainable water quality estimation. Given the aforementioned
    considerations, the irrigation water quality index (IWQI) as well as fuzzy logic
    techniques, are profound performance appraisal methods for an effective and adaptable
    approach to assessing the quality of surface and groundwater (Egbueri, 2022; Hajji
    et al., 2021). Even though the IWQI and fuzzy logic were employed independently
    for assessing the appropriateness of irrigation water (Hue and Thanh, 2020) but
    their combined application has not yet been studied. Therefore, the fuzzy irrigation
    water quality index (FIWQI), and MLR model were used in this study to identify
    the most effective parameters of water-related factors and to solve the challenges
    of previously applied individual techniques for water quality assessment. On the
    one hand, water quality assessment is essential to provide good quality irrigation
    water; on the other hand, the northern and western parts of Bangladesh are threatened
    by drought, and farmers face significant challenges in securing an adequate water
    supply. As a result, using irrigation metrics and assessing the factors affecting
    them are critical for these regions to optimize water use efficiency for sustaining
    crop production (Elsayed et al., 2020; Sarker et al., 2021; Eid et al., 2023).
    Failure to do so can have undesirable consequences for agriculture, such as lower
    agricultural yields and increased dependence on imports, leading to higher food
    prices and inflation. Therefore, conducting a critical and regular evaluation
    to assess irrigation water quality in the drought-prone northern parts of Bangladesh
    is crucial to maximizing agricultural production and achieving food self-sufficiency.
    Although some studies have addressed the suitability of irrigation water in different
    parts of Bangladesh (Rahman et al., 2017; Islam et al., 2017b; Mia et al., 2023),
    the irrigation water quality in the drought-prone agricultural region has not
    been thoroughly studied. Evaluating the water''s suitability for agriculture has
    proven to be a significant challenge. Therefore, a glaring issue that requires
    immediate attention is systematic and thorough research on the irrigation water
    condition and the variables that affect irrigation metrics in this critical region.
    To address this gap, this research developed a novel approach that encompasses
    key irrigation water quality metrics to help decision-makers in evaluating the
    few surface and groundwater samples. The hypothesis of the present study states
    that the integration of IWQI, FIWQI, and MLR models successfully assessed the
    suitability of water for irrigation in the drought-prone agricultural region in
    Bangladesh. The precise goals of this study are to evaluate the variations in
    irrigation water variables using traditional irrigation metrics; to assess the
    suitability of water for irrigation in a drought-prone agricultural region using
    an integrated IWQI and FWQI in a GIS environment; to identify what influences
    surface and groundwater variables on irrigation metrics utilizing multiple linear
    regression (MLR); to delineate suitable areas for agriculture using geostatistical
    modeling (Kriging) and inverse distance weighting (IDW); and to examine irrigation
    water variables and associations using redundancy and correlation analysis. It
    is indeed noteworthy to mention that this newly developed research on comprehensive
    IWQI and fuzzy irrigation water quality index (FIWQI) in appraising water quality
    in the drought-prone agricultural region of northern Bangladesh is such a novel
    concept for effective and consistent irrigation water assessment. This is the
    first time that a new irrigation index, fuzzy logic index, and MLR model have
    been used together in a GIS-based geostatistical model to assess irrigation metrics
    in a drought-prone agricultural region of Bangladesh. This study will explore
    new research opportunities for sustainably evaluating water quality. To ensure
    successful water management in the drought-prone agricultural region in Bangladesh,
    this research intends to give tools to water managers and agriculture managers
    to properly manage irrigation water. This study will also provide a clearer picture
    for redesigning sampling tactics and utilizing FIWQI and MLR models by concentrating
    on the most influential parameters of water-related factors. 2. Materials and
    methods 2.1. Description of the study area Drought-prone Rangpur and Nilphamari
    districts (a large administrative unit) in northern Bangladesh were selected for
    the study (Fig. 1). The study area was selected primarily because of its agricultural
    production focus and environmental importance. Physiographically, the study area
    belongs to the land of the Old Himalayan piedmont plain (Islam et al., 2014).
    The total irrigated area for paddy cultivation is 70.82 km2 for Taraganj and 119.43
    km2 for Kishoreganj (BBS, 2013a, b). Most of the people in the study area depend
    on agriculture. Farmers in the selected area use various irrigation methods including
    diesel apartment pumps, electric irrigation pumps, siphon systems, and manual
    irrigation from tube wells to irrigate small agricultural areas. There is a mix
    of shallow and deep tube wells used for irrigation and drinking water. Irrigation
    canals, rivers, streams, and ponds are also used for irrigation. The Teesta Dam
    Project is the main canal used for irrigation. About 80% of the area is alluvium
    from the Tista floodplain and 20% is Barind Track. Groundwater quality is mainly
    controlled by the Jamuneswari, Dhaigan, and Chiklirivers. Physiographically, the
    study area belongs to the land of Old Himalayan piedmont plain (Islam et al.,
    2014). The altitude of the study area is 34 m above the mean sea level. Download

    Map of the study area with sample location points. Geologically, the study area
    belongs to the Rangpur Saddle under the Indian Platform. Rangpur saddle connects
    the Mikir hills and the Shillong massif with the Indian shield. This is an uplifted
    zone, which consists of a narrow deposit of sediments. The study area consists
    of alluvial deposits containing gravel, sand, silt, and clay of recent age. The
    aquifers of the Tista fan, active and inactive fans, located in Rangpur and Nilphamari
    districts, consist of coarser sediments and have the highest permeability in Bangladesh,
    ranging from 1000 to 7000 m2/day (Hussain and Abdullah, 2001). The study area
    is located within the active part of Tista fan. The aquifers are mainly composed
    of the deposits of the old Tista floodplain, which include fine, medium, and coarse
    sands with a higher proportion of silt and clay with an average thickness of 2
    m. The thickness of the aquifer varies from 5 to 50 m with an average thickness
    of 20 m (Fig. S1) (Hussain and Abdullah, 2001). The aquifer of the study region
    is predominantly unconfined in the Rangpur district and locally semi-confined
    in the Nilphamari district. The flow of groundwater is from north to south direction.
    The most dominant aquifer is the lower shallow aquifer, which is 50 m thick in
    the subsurface. Other aquifer systems include an upper shallow aquifer located
    30 to 20 m, a deep aquifer situated 30–35 m below the subsurface (Islam et al.,
    2017a). The summer rains are primarily responsible for recharging the groundwater.
    The environment in this region is characterized by irregular monsoons, high temperatures,
    high humidity, and significant rainfall. The months of May, June, July, and August
    have the highest average temperatures, ranging from 32 to 36 °C, while January
    has the lowest average temperatures, ranging from 7 to 16 °C (Islam et al., 2017b).
    The average annual rainfall in the study region is 2065 mm (Rahman and Islam,
    2019). Most precipitation occurs in July (465 mm), and the lowest rainfall is
    observed during December (8 mm) (BMD, 2016). The average daily evaporation is
    2.98 mm/day in Nilphamari and 3.26 mm/day in Rangpur (Salam et al., 2020). The
    lowest daily evaporation is observed in December (2.0 mm/day) and the highest
    in April (4.7 mm/day). 2.2. Sampling and analytical strategies For this research,
    a total of 38 water samples were collected from the selected location of two Upazilas
    (the smallest administrative unit, a subdistrict) of the two districts namely
    Taraganj (19 samples) and Kisorganj (19 samples) in April 2022. Sampling locations
    were selected based on a randomly to cover all parts of the selected sites in
    the study area. The month of April is considered to be in the dry season since
    the normal precipitation is low except for occasional nor''westers. Following
    standard methods (APHA, 2017; Siddique et al., 2022), the water samples were collected
    manually in prewashed (10% HNO3) high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles purchased
    from the local market as the white HDPE are resistant to chemical reactions compared
    to other plastics (ManjunathaNanjegowda et al., 2013). Before collection, the
    bottles were washed with the sampling water carefully to avoid contamination from
    the bottles. Samples of surface water, groundwater from the irrigation pump, and
    tube wells were randomly collected when the electrical conductivity (EC) and pH
    became stable. Both shallow and deep tube wells near rice fields were used for
    water collection. The depth of the tube wells and irrigation pumps varied from
    9 to 60 m. The number of irrigation pumps was four as same as tube wells. The
    number of irrigation pumps was four and they were the same as tube wells. Six
    samples of surface water, which are also used for irrigation in the conjugated
    area, were collected. Of these, 1 is from the Jamuneswari River, 1 is from a Beel,
    and the others are from the Teesta Irrigation Canal. The surface water in these
    areas is highly prone to contamination, as people use these waters for bathing,
    washing jute buckles, washing clothes, and so on. People also use soap and detergent
    powders for bathing and washing, respectively. For these reasons, the surface
    water of this region may contain high pH in some areas. After completing the sample
    collections, the sampling bottles were labeled by location and sample number for
    easy recognition. A portable GPS (global positioning system) meter (Garmin Etrex
    30x, Taiwan) was used for taking the reading of the geographic locations of each
    sample collection point (Fig. 1). GPS locations from Google Maps were also taken
    for cross-checking. The collected water samples were then brought to the laboratory
    for performing chemical analysis. The physicochemical properties of the water
    samples such as pH, total dissolved solids (TDS), and electrical conductivity
    (EC) were recorded at the point of sampling by a portable Multimeter (Lutron WA-2015,
    Taiwan) directly immersing the probe of the meter into the water body. Other parameters,
    such as Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl−, and HCO3− were analyzed at the laboratory (INARS,
    BCSIR, Dhaka, Bangladesh) using several techniques. For instance, Na+, K+, Ca2+,
    and Mg2+ concentrations in the water samples were analyzed using an Atomic Absorption
    Spectrometer (AAS, Model: AA240FS, Varian, Australia) in air-acetylene flames,
    except for Ca which was determined in air-acetylene-nitrous oxide flames. Na+
    and K+ were measured using the emission technique whereas Ca2+ and Mg2+ were analyzed
    by the absorption technique in AAS. For the analysis of Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+,
    the water samples were digested with concentrated HNO3 (68%) and measured directly
    by aspirating the samples through the nebulizer of the AAS instrument. The calibration
    curves were prepared using the certified reference materials (CRM, purchased from
    Fluka Analytical, Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) of the individual metal, and their concentrations
    were detected against the constructed calibration curves (linearity: 0.99–1.00).
    The trimetric method was used for the determination of Cl− and HCO3− concentrations
    in the water samples (APHA, 2017). During analysis, analytical grade chemicals
    and reagents such as AgNO3, acid-base indicator, and concentrated HNO3 were used.
    Good quality deionized water with EC less than 0.5 μS cm−1 was used throughout
    the experiment for the sample and standard preparation. Traceable CRM was used
    for checking the accuracy and precision in the analysis of all the considered
    parameters in this study. The quality control standard sample (CRM) and method
    blank sample (2% HNO3) were measured after 5 and 10 samples, respectively. All
    parameters were measured three times and the average results with a relative standard
    deviation of less than 10% were counted in this work. The limit of quantification
    (LOQ) for Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ were 0.2, 0.2, 0.1, and 0.1 mg/L, respectively
    whereas the limit of detection (LOD) was 0.05, 0.06, 0.03, and 0.006 mg/L, respectively.
    The measurement uncertainty was 8.4, 9.6, 8.4, and 5.2%, respectively for Na+,
    K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+. The spike recovery for the analysis of Na+, K+, Ca2+, and
    Mg2+ using AAS was between 97 and 102%. This study adopted a flow chart to illustrate
    the analysis performed in the experiment (Fig. S2). 2.3. Irrigation metrics Irrigation
    water quality has a major role in a country''s economic growth through agricultural
    productivity (Siddique et al., 2022; Islam et al., 2017b). To calculate the quality
    of irrigation water, some parameters are used, namely, NA% (Todd, 1980), SAR (Richards,
    1954), TH (Raghunath, 1987; Brindha and &Elango, 2011), soluble sodium (SSP) (Wilcox,
    1955), MAR (Raghunath, 1987), KR (Kelley, 1963), PI (Doneen, 1964) and residual
    sodium bicarbonate (RSBC) (Gupta, 1983). The formulas used to calculate the parameters
    can be found in Table S2. All concentration unit data were converted from milligrams
    per liter [mg/L] to milliequivalents per liter [meq/L] using conversion factors
    provided by Lesch and Suarez (2009). Total hardness was measured in ppm or mg/L
    National and international standards for chemical parameters were used to compare
    all calculation results. 2.4. Irrigation water quality index (IWQI) Irrigation
    water quality variables, including infiltration and permeability hazards, specific
    ion toxicity, salinity, trace element toxicity, and miscellaneous effects, were
    selected based on the guiding principles of Ayers &Westcot (1985) to create an
    irrigation water quality index for suitability assessment of the water of the
    studied area. Each parameter group is assigned a weighting coefficient, with (5)
    being the highest and (1) being the lowest (Islam et al., 2017b; Salem et al.,
    2018). The IWQI was calculated using the equations in Table S3 (Simsek and &Gunduz,
    2007; Islam et al., 2017b), where G is the contributing factor of each hazard
    category that is most important for evaluating water resources used for irrigation,
    and I is an incremental index, w is the value of the weight of the group in question,
    N is the sum of the available parameters in the analysis, k is an incremental
    index, and r is the value of the score of each parameter. From Tables S4, S5,
    and S6, it can be seen that the hazard of salinization is considered the most
    significant and is given a weighting coefficient of (5). The hazard of infiltration
    and permeability, specific ion toxicity, trace element toxicity, and other effects
    are assigned a weighting coefficient of (2), (1), respectively. According to Table
    S3, G1 is the salinity hazard and is represented by EC and the TDS values of the
    sample water, G2 is the infiltration and permeability hazard and is represented
    by the combination EC-SAR, G3 is the specific ion toxicity represented by SAR,
    G4 is the trace element toxicity represented by the elements listed in Table S6,
    and G5 is the other effect on sensitive plants represented by the pH of the water.
    2.5. Geostatistical modeling Geostatistics is a branch of statistics that deals
    with geographic or spatiotemporal data sets. It is based on the study of regionalized
    factors (Goovaerts, 2000). The variogram is considered as an important component
    used to evaluate the spatial relationship between the information components collected.
    More specifically, a variogram is an existing difference between data values in
    two main sections that are not connected by a common distance h (Islam et al.,
    2017a). In general, the purpose of considering variable mode is to evaluate variable
    changes considering temporal and spatial changes. To calculate this variation,
    which is the total squared difference between pairs, given a distance h from each
    other, and plotted in comparison to h in a semivariogram, we must follow a specific
    procedure, as given below in Eq. (1) (Theodossiou and Latinopoulos, 2006). (1)
    Where h is the distance (lag) between pairs of sample locations. Var is the variance.
    Z(x) is the observed value of a parameter at site xi. Z (x + h) is the value of
    the element at point xi + h. For the geostatistical analysis, the ordinary kriging
    method (OK) was used, using different semivariogram models with the Geostatistical
    Analyst tool (ESRI, 2020). Among the kriging methods, ordinary kriging (OK) is
    the most commonly used because this method uses data from the neighborhood to
    estimate the value using the known variogram at another point in a different region
    (Wackernagel, 2003). Several semivariogram models have been described in the literature,
    including stable, J-Bessel, K-Bessel, circular, hole-effect, exponential, spherical,
    pentaspherical, tetraspherical, rational quadratic, and Gaussian (Chatterjee et
    al., 2021; Gundogdu and &Guney, 2007). The semivariogram model that best fits
    the data was selected after reviewing the ’performances of all models separately
    (Islam et al., 2017b). The model that had the lowest root mean square error (RMSE)
    was selected as the best model for the data (Gundogdu and &Guney, 2007). The cribbed
    map of the spatial distribution was created using ArcGIS (version 10.8.2) during
    the analysis. In geostatistics, the nug/sill ratio calculated from the best-fitting
    semivariogram model can be considered as a classification criterion for determining
    spatial dependence. The result of less than 0.25 can be classified as strongly
    dependent, 0.25 to 0.75 is moderately dependent, and more than 0.75 is weakly
    dependent (Chang et al., 1998). More details on the geostatistical model can be
    found elsewhere (Islam et al., 2017a; Boufekane and Saighi, 2019). Irrigaiton
    metrics data were used for assessing spatial dependence, and spatial dependence
    maps were produced as previously used in the literature by Islam et al. (2017a,
    b). 2.6. Statistical analysis Origin Pro software was used to plot the data set
    of major anions and cations of ground and surface water in a trilinear plot called
    the Piper trilinear plot” (Piper, 1944). This plot is used for determining water
    type and visualizing water chemistry (Nwankwoala and &Udom, 2011). Inputting the
    calculated data into the Origin Pro software spreadsheet helped to create the
    Piper trilinear diagram. The various hydrogeochemical properties of the water
    samples were plotted using the Wilcox diagram (Wilcox, 1955) and USSL diagram
    (Richards, 1954) to determine the suitability of water for irrigation (Selvakumar
    et al., 2017). These diagrams were also generated using OriginLab, 2022 software
    (OriginLab, 2022). Redundancy analysis (RDA)was performed using RStudio 2022 “Spotted
    Wakerobin” for Windows. van den Wollenberg (1977) developed redundancy analysis
    to analyze the asymmetric data using eigenvalue analysis to examine the correlation
    between multiple dependent variables and multiple independent variables. The degree
    of association between a pair of variables can be described as correlation, and
    regression can be defined as the relationship between the specified value of one
    variable and the mean of the corresponding values of the second variable’ (Asuero
    et al., 2006). Multiple linear regression (MLR) can be defined as a technique
    in statistics for analyzing the relationship between a single dependent variable
    and multiple independent variables to use the known values of the independent
    variables to predict the single dependent value (Moore et al., 2006). Pearson''s
    correlation coefficient analysis and stepwise MLR analysis were performed using
    IBM SPSS 26 software. 2.7. Fuzzy irrigation water quality index (FIWQI) Fuzzy
    logic can be termed as a reasoning method that aims to give approximate categorization
    instead of a precise category (Bari et al., 2022). Fuzzy logic gives any logical
    answer between 1 and 0 in mathematical terms and a degree of truth or false answer,
    like almost false, very small, or near true, instead of conventional Boolean “true
    or false” or “1 or 0″ logic (Dhaoui et al., 2022; Tushar et al., 2022). The entire
    process of transforming input functions into fuzzy output functions using fuzzy
    logic rules is called a fuzzy inference system (FIS) (Dhaoui et al., 2022). The
    Mamdani FIS (Mamdani and &Assilian, 1975) was preferred over the Sugeno FIS (Sugeno,
    1985) for this study because it is highly intuitive, best suited for human input,
    and widely used and accepted due to its simple structure and the ease of interpretation
    of its rules, while there are drawbacks in the interpretability of the Sugeno
    FIS (Pandey et al., 2020; Salman and Seno, 2010). The Mamdani FIS contains three
    main components (Muhamad et al., 2020; Malik et al., 2021), such as fuzzification,
    fuzzy inference, and defuzzification, whose process is shown in Fig. 2. The trapezoidal
    membership function (MF) is used for irrigation water quality analysis in the
    step of fuzzification because itis simple and effective (Zadeh, 2008; Al Mamun
    et al., 2019; Hue and Thanh, 2020; Mia et al., 2023). The MF can be expressed
    as equation (2). (2) where x denotes the parameters and a, b, and c are the explanatory
    variables used to categorize the parameters. Download : Download high-res image

    system. In this study, the fuzzy toolbox in MATLAB software (MATLAB, 2022) was
    used to create the Mamdani fuzzy inference system. The structure of the fuzzy
    model is shown in Fig. S3. EC, SAR, SSP, MAR, KR, TH, PI, and the RSBC classification
    of water quality proposed by Ayers &Westcot (1985) was used as input membership
    functions. The Mamdani FIS is the most widely used inference system which uses
    a certain rule like the “if … Then” pattern (Agoubi et al., 2016; Al Mamun et
    al., 2019; Hajji et al., 2021). For example, Raman et al. (2009) used six parameters
    to generate 86 rules, while Semiromi et al. (2011) constructed 58 rules using
    6 parameters and Mia et al. (2023) used six parameters to generate 31 rules. In
    this study, a total of 56 rules were constructed to generate the FIWQI as output
    by the defuzzification process, and finally, the “evalfis” function was used to
    analyze the data (Fig. S4). 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Physiochemical characterization
    of water The physiochemical properties of water depend on many factors, including
    the intensity of chemical weathering of different rock types, the general geology
    of the sampling area, the effects of surrounding pollution sources, and the quality
    of groundwater (Islam et al., 2017a). The results of geochemical, trace element,
    and physiochemical properties of the collected groundwater (GW) and surface water
    samples (SW) are presented in Table S7 and the descriptive statistics of physiochemical
    properties are presented in Table 1. Table 1. Descriptive statistics of the groundwater

    0–91 The pH is one of the most important factors affecting water quality. pH in
    GW ranged from 6.52 to 8.14 with an average of 6.98 ± 0.33 and in SW ranged from
    7.04 to 10.22 with an average of 8.56 ± 1.20, indicating that the groundwater
    in the study area is slightly acidic to slightly alkaline (Jannat et al., 2022).
    The higher pH values in SW could be due to human intervention or everyday purposes
    such as washing clothes, bathing, bathing livestock, and even washing jute buckles.
    The average EC and TDS values in GW were 286.94 ± 193.30 and 191.82 ± 129.03,
    while for SW the average values were 125.30 ± 50.37 and 83.58 ± 33.76, respectively.
    All EC and TDS samples are within the standard range according to the Food and
    Agriculture Organization (FAO, 1985) and the Department of Environment (DoE, 1997).
    However, according to the College of California Committee of Consultants (UCCC,
    1974), most values are below the standards for irrigation and these results classify
    the water sources as freshwater (Carroll, 1962; DoE, 1997). The average concentration
    of Na+ in GW was 17.0 ± 12.3, whereas in SW it was 9.54 ± 3.27. The average concentration
    of Na+ in GW and SW was 13.9 ± 17.8 and 5.02 ± 1.81, respectively, which is the
    third major cation in terms of abundance. Ca2+ values in GW ranged from 12.3 to
    53.5 with an average of 23.0 ± 10.7 and in SW from 9.14 to 13.8 with an average
    of 12.0 ± 1.57. Magnesium is another important cation in the water samples and
    the average concentration of Mg2+ in GW and SW was 5.68 ± 2.70 and 2.94 ± 0.77,
    respectively. The average concentration of Cl− in GW was 17.0 ± 23.0, while in
    SW it was 8.03 ± 2.64. Bicarbonate (HCO3−) levels in GW ranged from 43 to 260
    with an average of 106 ± 57.2 and in SW ranged from 30 to 48 with an average of
    38.8 ± 6.79. The major cation in GW and SW is Ca2+ and the major anion is HCO3−.
    The ion concentration of cations in the GW and SW samples follows the following
    chronological order Ca2+>Na+>K+>Mg2+ and HCO3− > Cl− for anions. The results for
    cations were slightly different, but the results for anions are consistent with
    those found by Saha et al. (2019) in a similar study in northern Bangladesh. The
    cations and anions except for K+ in the GW and SW samples were within the FAO
    (1985) standard limits but below the standard values reported by UCCC (1974),
    signifying that the water samples are excellent and adequate for irrigation purposes
    (Islam and Mostafa, 2022). The values of kurtosis and skewness between −2 and
    +2 can be considered acceptable to prove a univariate distribution in the normal
    range (George and Mallery, 2010). Only the kurtosis of Ca2+ and HCO3− falls within
    the normal range. All kurtosis values of major ions fall into the leptokurtic
    category. All values of major ions fall in the standard skew range, except for
    K+ and Cl−, which are positively skewed and can be considered extreme for the
    aquifer system (Islam et al., 2017b; Ruidas et al., 2022). The sodium in the GW
    and SW may have been introduced by weathering of silicate in the form of feldspar
    and halite minerals (Srivastava and &Parimal, 2020). Chemical weathering of shale
    and granite could be the source of high K+ content in the study area (Huang et
    al., 2020). The high use of potassium fertilizers in agriculture also increases
    the salinity of groundwater (Buvaneshwari et al., 2020). The exchange of cations
    and dolomite could be the cause of the high Ca2+ concentration in the aquifer
    system (Islam et al., 2017a). The presence of dolomite (CaMg (CO3)2) can be further
    demonstrated by the high concentration of Mg2+ and HCO3−. Other sources of calcium
    could be calcite (CaCO3) or the use of large amounts of gypsum fertilizer and
    lime in agriculture in this region (Saha et al., 2019). The sources of Mg2+ in
    groundwater are ferromagnesian minerals and dolomitic limestones (Mebarki et al.,
    2021; Ratri et al., 2021). Decomposition of organic matter leading to microbial
    production of carbonic acid, formic acid, and acetic acid, and the reaction of
    water with dolomite and calcite rocks could be the source of bicarbonate in groundwater
    of the study area (Rahman et al., 2017; Islam et al., 2018). The major sources
    of chloride in groundwater are precipitation and halite (Konwea et al., 2023).
    The other major source of Cl− in groundwater is fertilization with potassium (KCl)
    (Buvaneshwari et al., 2020). A Piper trilinear diagram is a visual representation
    of data that is a well-known and commonly used approach for evaluating the hydrochemical
    characterization of water (Piper, 1944; Qishlaqi et al., 2017). Fig. 3 illustrates
    the results of measuring the hydrochemical properties of the samples. According
    to Fig. 3, Ca2+, Mg2+, and HCO3−play a crucial role in identifying the water type,
    indicating the presence of dolomite and other Mg2+ minerals in the aquifer system
    of the study area. The interaction of flowing water with bedrock could have introduced
    these ions into the water through weathering (Zakir et al., 2020; Kabir et al.,
    2021; Sarkar et al., 2022). The results of this study are consistent with the
    result of a similar study by Islam et al. (2017a) and Howladar et al. (2014).

    0.014 1.23 0.03 As with the groundwater samples, the best-fitting model for EC
    was the K-Bessel model, which had the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) among
    the models. The Hole Effect model for TH and SAR, the Tetrasphere model for SSP,
    and the J-Bessel model for IWQI and FIWQI were found to be the best fit. For surface
    water samples, the J-Bessel model for EC was the best fit and had the lowest RMSE.
    Rational Quadratic was the best-fitting model for TH, SSP, and FIWQI and the Gaussian
    model was found to be the best fit for SAR and IWQI. The large reaches of the
    groundwater samples ranged from 537.91 to 2770.39 m and 5718.99–9538.82 m for
    the surface water samples. The wide variation among the large reaches suggests
    the influence of fertilizer use, runoff and precipitation, and other geometric
    and topographic factors of groundwater (Islam et al., 2017a; Chakraborty et al.,
    2023). From the Ordinary Kriging results, EC, TH, SSP, and SAR of the groundwater
    samples show moderate spatial dependence. The IWQI shows a low spatial dependence.
    The FIWQI shows moderate spatial dependence. On the other hand, the surface water
    samples show moderate to strong spatial dependence. The differences in spatial
    dependence show the different land use patterns in this region, including residential,
    agricultural, cropland, and industrial. The spatial distribution of EC, TH, SSP,
    and SAR, of groundwater and surface water in the study area are shown in Figs.
    S5 and S6. These values could be attributed to the spatial distribution of these
    parameters in northern Bangladesh, indicating different land use patterns and
    human activities. A downward trend is observed in all water parameters from Taraganj
    (the southern part) to Kishoreganj (the northern part). This could be due to various
    rivers, canals, and other activities such as fertilizer use in this region. Zakir
    et al. (2020) found that 45.2% of the GW samples from the Jamalpur Sadar area,
    Bangladesh is good quality for irrigation. This difference in water condition
    could be impacted by the depth and type of water bodies and the nature of aquifers.
    3.3. Multiple linear regression model MLR models were applied to irrigation water
    quality data to determine the contribution of these parameters to water quality
    variation. For the prediction of SAR, EC, KR, Na%, MAR, TH, RSBC, PI, and SSP
    from several known agglomerations of other indices of groundwater used for irrigation,
    the multivariate regression model with the highest significance was presented
    in Table 3. In the model, the significant effect of seven independent variables
    was tested and their significance on correlated dependent variables was observed.
    A ‘t-test was performed for part of the regression coefficients, using a probability
    of 5. Table 3. Water quality parameters influencing irrigation metrics using MLR

    available independent variables were used, including SSP, Na%, SAR, KI, TH, RSBC,
    PI, and MAR, and the result is quite good. In predicting EC, other independent
    variables from the test, such as SAR (p = 0.66), KR (p = 0.74), and PI (p = 0.86),
    had the greatest effect. According to the regression model, the value of the coefficient
    of determination or multiple R2 of EC was 0.92, which means that 92% of the variability
    of EC can be explained by the combined effects of Na%, KI, SAR, MAR, RSBC, SSP,
    PI and TH. In the multivariate regression model, SAR and KR showed the highest
    observed variability of 99%, and the lowest value was observed by MAR (28%). Other
    observations such as TH (97%), Na% (93%), SSP (91%), PI (91%), and RSBC (70%)
    show that all irrigation water quality parameters are interdependent except MAR,
    which has very low dependence. Multiple regression models of similar nature have
    been used by others to predict groundwater quality for irrigation (Adhikary et
    al., 2012; Islam et al., 2017a). 3.4. Redundancy analysis (RDA) The relationship
    between irrigation water quality indices and physiochemical parameters was studied
    using redundancy analysis. Fig. 5 shows the RDA diagram of (a) groundwater and
    (b) surface water. Download : Download high-res image (341KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 5. RDA diagram showing a relationship between toxic metals
    with physiochemical parameters of (a) groundwater and (b) surface water. The eigenvalues
    of the controlled RDA axes were RDA1 = 52.72% and RDA2 = 4.78% for groundwater
    and RDA1 = 37.1% and RDA2 = 21.61% for surface water. The RDA results show that
    RDA1 of groundwater explains 52.72% and RDA2 explains 4.78% of the variance in
    groundwater parameters, RDA1 of surface water explains 37.1% and RDA2 explains
    21.61% of the variance in surface water quality parameters. Both results can be
    considered as very good and can be used to efficiently explain the variance of
    water quality parameters. The RDA plot of groundwater shows that the physiochemical
    parameters were positively associated with Na+, Ca2+, Cl−, K+, HCO3−, and other
    ions of the groundwater sample as well as the water quality indices of groundwater.
    The temperature was negatively associated with major ions and water indices. Trace
    elements followed the same path as other major ions in groundwater. SSP, Ca2+,
    K+, and Cl−, are positively correlated with TDS and EC and negatively correlated
    with temperature. Na, Na%, HCO3− is positively correlated with pH and depth. The
    surface water sample shows that there is no correlation between pH, temperature,
    EC, TDS, and depth with Cl−, Na+, HCO3−, TH, PI, and Mg2+. EC, TDS, pH, temperature,
    and depth show a positive correlation with each other and a positive correlation
    with SSP, K+, IWQI, Na%, and some trace metals, but a negative correlation with
    Fe2+ and MAR. 3.5. Suitability of irrigation water quality The quality of irrigation
    water can vary drastically, depending primarily on the type and concentration
    of dissolved chemical and it occur in extremely small amounts in the water, but
    impact significantly (Mia et al., 2023; Raihan and &Alam, 2008; Islam et al.,
    2017b). The suitability of the studied samples for irrigation purposes can be
    seen in Table S8. About 100% of the water samples, both groundwater and surface
    water, are very suitable for irrigation as all the samples have IWQI values above
    23. According to Table 4, when evaluating the EC values, 96.88% of the groundwater
    samples fall into the excellent for irrigation category, and 3.13% fall into the
    good category. 100% of the EC values for surface water quality fall into the excellent
    category for irrigation. Considering SAR, 100% of the groundwater and surface
    water samples can be classified as excellent for irrigation. In contrast, all
    samples on the U.S. salinity plot (Fig. 6a and b) fall into the low sodium (alkali)
    category, but one surface water sample falls into the medium salinity category,
    one groundwater sample falls into the high salinity category, and 15 groundwater
    samples fall into the medium salinity category. The other samples of groundwater
    and surface water fall into the low salinity category. There should be no risk
    of mobile Na+ (Islam et al., 2017b; Sarkar et al., 2022; Biswas et al., 2023).
    The high salinity could have been caused by rock weathering processes due to groundwater
    movement (Shah et al., 2022; Su et al., 2023). Groundwater and surface water quality
    in the study area is currently suitable for irrigation. However, since surface
    water is susceptible to human intervention, the increasing use of chemical fertilizers,
    pesticides, herbicides, and household wastes may also alter the quality of surface
    water and slowly change the quality of groundwater due to infiltration and percolation.
    Human activities such as the use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, washing
    clothes, and bathing should be controlled. Natural and organic agriculture should
    be introduced. Household and industrial wastes should be disposed of properly.
    Constant monitoring of water quality is recommended for sustainable agriculture.

    (a) groundwater and (b) surface water. To understand irrigation water quality,
    the Wilcox diagram was used to plot Na% values against EC (Wilcox, 1955; Fallahati
    et al., 2020; Jaydhar et al., 2022) (Fig. 7a and b). All surface water samples
    fall into the excellent to good category, while only one groundwater sample falls
    into the good to acceptable category. The other groundwater samples fall into
    the excellent to good category, indicating that the water in the study area is
    very suitable for irrigation. This result is consistent with the work of Howladar
    et al. (2014) in northern Bangladesh, while it is inconsistent with the work of
    Tajwar et al. (2023) in Hatiya Island, Bangladesh. Download : Download high-res
    image (405KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 7. Irrigation suitability
    using Wilcox''s diagram (a) groundwater and (b)surface water. The values for the
    soluble sodium percentage (SSP) show that 65.63 and 31.25% of the groundwater
    samples fall in the “good” and “moderate” categories for irrigation, respectively,
    while only one sample falls in the “excellent” category. On the other hand, 16.67%
    of the surface water samples fall into the good category and 83.33% of the samples
    fall into the moderate category for irrigation. Looking at the values of total
    hardness (TH), 100% of the surface water falls in the soft water category, which
    is of no benefit to plants. Groundwater samples also fall predominantly into the
    soft category (62.5%), while 28.13% of groundwater falls into the moderately hard
    category and 9.33% falls into the hard category (Table 4). KR shows the balance
    of Na+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ in the water samples. Table 4 shows that 96.88% of the
    groundwater samples and 100% of the surface water samples fall into the excellent
    category. One sample of groundwater falls into the category of excessive Na+ in
    water, which can be harmful to certain crops. The MAR is also able to categorize
    water quality based on the amount of magnesium in the water. Abundant magnesium
    increases soil pH and decreases its integrity (Alsubih et al., 2022; George and
    &Ngole-Jeme, 2022; Anonna et al., 2022; Mia et al., 2023). Based on MAR, 100%
    of groundwater and surface water samples fall into the “excellent” category, indicating
    that there are no adverse effects on soil. When considering residual sodium bicarbonate
    (RSBC) values, all groundwater and surface water samples have RSBC less than 5
    meq/l. This falls into the “safe” category for irrigation and is not a problem
    for plants. The PI is an important indication of irrigation water efficiency because
    it reflects the impact of long-term irrigation on soil permeability. Regular irrigation
    with sufficient mineral groundwater can reduce soil permeability and thus affect
    agricultural productivity (Zafar et al., 2022; Anonna et al., 2022; Mokhtar et
    al., 2022). The results of the permeability index (PI) show that a total of 29
    samples (90.63%) of groundwater are more than 75% permeable which is excellent
    for irrigation. The other 3 groundwater samples (9.38%) fall into the “suitable”
    category. However, the indices of PI were used to create a scatter plot, and the
    Doneen diagram (Doneen, 1964) was created, which shows very different results,
    as shown in Fig. S7. This diagram contains 3 classes where class 1 of this diagram
    is excellent for irrigation, class 2 is suitable, and class 3 is not suitable
    (Doneen, 1964). According to the diagram, only one sample falls into the class
    1 or excellent category. 12 samples fall into the class 2 category which is suitable
    for irrigation with 75% permeability and the remaining 19 samples fall into class
    3 with 25% maximum permeability. This means that most of the samples are not suitable
    for irrigation. The boxplot was made using the values of Na%, SSP, MAR, PI, RSBC,
    SAR, KR, Mg:Ca, Na:Ca, EC, and TH in Fig. 8 and shows that theNa% of groundwater
    and MAR have similar values and are suitable for irrigation. SSP is slightly higher
    but is in the acceptable range. The RSBC value is lower than the standard limit
    and the value of PI exceeds the acceptable limit and is not suitable for irrigation.
    The values of SAR and Na:Caare slightly higher than the values of KR and Mg:Ca,
    and the value of EC is higher than that of TH, indicating harmful effects on agriculture.
    On the other hand, Na%, SSP, RSBC, PI and MAR values of surface water show similar
    results to those of groundwater. SAR and Na:Ca values are higher than KR and Mg:Ca.
    EC values are very high than TH values, indicating similar results to groundwater
    samples. The boxplot of PI and EC values shows that there are risks to plants
    in both GW and SW. The results of this study are consistent with the results of
    a similar study conducted by Islam et al. (2017b) in Faridpur, Bangladesh. Download

    Acharjee et al., 2022; Islam et al., 2022). The Pearson correlation matrix in

    negative correlation exists between TH and PI (r = −0.872, p = <0.05), MAR and
    PI (r = −0.646, p = <0.05), RSBC and PI (r = −0.865, p = <0.05), Mg:Ca and PI
    (r = −0.643, p = <0.05). The strong correlation between GW and SW parameters may
    indicate that irrigation water quality parameters are derived from similar roots.
    3.6. Fuzzy irrigation water quality index (FIWQI) A clear understanding of water
    quality is necessary for managing water for irrigation. Finally, IWQI classification
    made decisions based on fuzzy values. The fuzzy interface system also used linguistic
    expressions to classify water quality input values into two groups (Dernoncourt,
    2013). The fuzzy logic allows more precise and uniform input of water quality
    for irrigation. As stated by Priya (2013), Agoubi et al. (2016), Mohammed et al.
    (2019), Chidambaram et al. (2022), and Dhaoui et al. (2022), fuzzy logic can evaluate
    the water condition better than other measurement methods. The use of fuzzy logic
    can raise the index of irrigation water quality to another level. It can automate
    some processes of irrigation system managers and create a simpler and clearer
    system to determine water quality. It could mimic water quality by providing an
    alternative response to vague or ambiguous thresholds. Different water quality
    indices interpret water quality for irrigation differently and produce different
    results. Fuzzy logic can eliminate some of these ambiguities by introducing a
    new category of water quality. The irrigation water quality indices (EC, TH, SAR,
    SSP, KR, MAR, PI, and RSBC) were used as fuzzy model input membership functions
    in the fuzzy inference system, as shown in Fig. S8. The result of defuzzification
    after adopting the created rules is the extracted FIWQI, which has a value within
    0–1 (Fig. 9). The FIWQI had seven categories of water quality for all inputs,
    including excellent, excellent to good, good, good to fair, fair, fair to poor,
    and poor, while the IWQI had only three categories. This suggests that the FIWQI
    may be a better substitute for other water quality indices, providing an accurate
    categorization of water quality (Selvaraj et al., 2020; Dhaoui et al., 2022).

    water bodies in the study area serve as the center for domestic activities in
    surrounding communities. Fig. 10 shows that Taraganjhas a relatively lower IWQI
    than Kishorganj. Most of the Kishorganj upazila had excellent quality water for
    irrigation, while a majority of the Taraganj upazila was dominated by good quality.
    The northeastern part of Kishorganj has water of excellent quality for irrigation,
    while the southwestern Taraganj upazila has less acceptable water quality for
    irrigation based on the FIWQI. The unsuitable irrigation water was identified
    mostly in the southwestern part of the Taraganj upazila. Download : Download high-res

    surface water samples in the study area. In addition, land use in Taraganj differs
    slightly from that in Kishoreganj within the study area. Taraganj is more business-oriented,
    while Kishoreganj is more residential-oriented. The water in Kishorganj is more
    suitable for irrigation than that in Taraganj. Otherwise, there is a mixed spatial
    variation for all water parameters. The IWQI map shows that the water samples
    are suitable for irrigation, according to Simsek and &Gunduz (2007) and Batarseh
    et al. (2021). Agricultural practices, extensive abstraction of groundwater, sedimentation,
    rock-water interactions, and dynamic geochemical mechanisms could be the cause
    of poor water quality in the north-central region (Islam et al., 2017b). Sedimentation
    and decomposition of different minerals, predominantly agricultural exchange processes,
    could control the hydrogeochemistry of water (Nepolian, 2017). The result of the
    FIWQI assessment shows that 100% of the surface water samples were classified
    as excellent (Table S10). When considering groundwater, 75% of the samples were
    rated excellent, 12.5% of the samples were rated excellent to good, and 12.5%
    were rated good for irrigation. These FIWQI results are critical for water quality
    because it highlights and drive much more stable potential, especially for samples
    that are in the middle of two groups (Hue and Thanh, 2020; Wagh et al., 2022;
    Mia et al., 2023). This fuzzy logic method will provide more accurate and consistent
    irrigation water quality. In its ability to capture the condition of water, the
    fuzzy technique is useful and superior to other methods. It could be a suitable
    approach for water quality modeling as it provides an alternative response to
    situations where boundaries are unclear or ambiguous (de Oliveira et al., 2019;
    Jha et al., 2020; Trach et al., 2022; Kord and &Arshadi, 2022). 3.7. Sustainable
    agricultural practices and policy intervention Regarding the findings from this
    study, water can be used for agricultural production after diagnosing the water
    resources in the study area. Intensive application of chemical pesticides and
    fertilizers should be controlled because these chemicals increase the pH of the
    soil. Residents need to be aware that dumping waste in open waters harms domestic
    production because it degrades groundwater. The government as well as NGOs should
    launch an awareness activity among the farmers to promote organic methods instead
    of industrially produced ones. Western and southwestern areas such as Taraganj
    are ideal for the short-term production of agricultural crops with minimal water
    requirements. These recommendations are related to the research area and areas
    facing similar problems. This research will also help in assessing water purity,
    putting water quality standards into practice, and monitoring developments in
    the drought-prone agricultural region. MLR model results show that the most important
    factors affecting surface and groundwater quality are K+, Na+, and Ca2+. Also,
    they have an adverse effect on human well-being via the food chain. (Grzebisz,
    2011; Paquette et al., 2022; Abdel-Rahman, 2022). A lack of Mg2+ in edible plant
    parts can lead to Ca2+ shortage in humans, whereas excessive Ca2+ levels in plant
    roots reduce the plant''s resilience to disease (Sharma et al., 2022; Zhang et
    al., 2022). It is necessary to address the issue of plant roots receiving excess
    Ca2+ from the soil. As a result, agricultural succession is disrupted, temperatures
    rise, and water shortages occur on agricultural lands (Wang et al., 2020). Information
    about irrigation water quality is provided for end consumers as well as others
    and GIS effectively analyzed precise spatial data in this study. The study was
    limited to a drought-prone agricultural region in northern Bangladesh, but the
    findings and lessons are universal. Overconsumption, climate change fluctuations
    in precipitation, and increased blending of contaminants from various inputs are
    causing the deterioration of water quality in the study area and in other developing
    countries, including Bangladesh which creates a matter of discussion. Subtropical
    climate, geogenic conditions (subsurface lithology that produces contaminants),
    and human actions can trigger countless concerns regarding water quality and endanger
    the health of water-consuming organisms. The results of the study can help agencies
    create a workable plan for managing water resources in the study area. The current
    research aims to develop decision support tools and mobile apps that take into
    consideration sustainable agriculture, ongoing water utilize, supply, and demand.
    This study will help agricultural managers to plan the distribution of irrigation
    water in the study area and surrounding areas in northern Bangladesh. Regular
    monitoring should be ensured for sustainable agriculture in the study area. Further
    studies are needed to improve the purity of drinking water and to ensure water
    security in the study area. In the future, the quality of groundwater and surface
    water used for drinking, livestock, and other purposes needs to be checked. 3.8.
    Implications for future outlook Completing this research has important theoretical
    and practical implications for developing and adopting sustainable practices.
    These implications are outlined below: Advancing knowledge: This research has
    contributed to the existing body of knowledge by providing new insights into environmental
    challenges and potential solutions. By studying different irrigation matrices,
    the work has expanded our understanding of the field and uncovered vital factors
    that influence agricultural quality. This knowledge can be a foundation for future
    studies and enable further theoretical advances. Conceptual framework: Through
    the research, this study has developed and refined conceptual frameworks that
    help understand the complexity of sustainability challenges. This work has created
    a framework for analyzing and addressing drought-prone agricultural regions by
    integrating fuzzy logic, geostatistics, and multiple linear models. This framework
    can guide future research efforts and support the development of comprehensive
    strategies. Decision-making support: The research findings provide practical guidance
    to decision-makers in addressing sustainability challenges. Decision makers, such
    as policymakers and managers, can use our results to make informed decisions prioritizing
    sustainability and promoting positive environmental outcomes. Community engagement:
    This study highlights the importance of community engagement and participation
    in sustainability efforts. The results serve as a foundation for community-based
    initiatives and empower individuals to actively protect the environment and build
    resilience. Capacity building: The work helps build capacity by providing information
    and tools for professionals and practitioners in water resources. This capacity
    building can facilitate the implementation of sustainable practices and contribute
    to long-term environmental resilience. By combining theoretical advances with
    practical implications, this research provides a comprehensive understanding of
    sustainable water management and actionable steps to address it. These implications
    pave the way for developing and implementing our current findings, enabling stakeholders
    to make informed decisions, promote sustainability, and positively impact the
    community and society at large. 4. Conclusions Both surface and groundwater are
    the primary water sources for agriculture in northern Bangladesh''s drought-prone
    agricultural region. This study established a robust approach to assess the applicability
    and select a suitable agricultural zone by coupling IWQI and FIWQI. The surface
    and groundwater variables affecting the irrigation metrics are investigated using
    the MLR and RDA models. Surface water was slightly to strongly alkaline, whereas
    the groundwater was slight acidic to slightly alkaline. The average values for
    most ions in the groundwater were greater than those in the surface water. According
    to semivariogram models, low to moderate spatial dependence was found for groundwater,
    and medium to high spatial dependence was found for surface water quality indices,
    suggesting agricultural and strong rural influences. The fuzzy-derived spatial
    map reveals that irrigation water quality in the areas southwest of Taraganj is
    significantly less suitable than in the remaining region. However, the water in
    the northern parts of the Kisorganj region was more appropriate for irrigation.
    Agricultural activities, excessive withdrawal from nearby areas, weathering or
    rock water interaction, and active geochemical processes may have all contributed
    to the poor water quality in the southwest region. As a result, it is recommended
    that short-term crops with lower water requirements may be grown utilizing the
    region''s groundwater resources. To evaluate the general quality of groundwater
    and surface water, implementing parameter-based irrigation water quality in fuzzy
    GIS platforms has proven helpful. Determining water quality is an essential tool
    in irrigation management in many ways, and it is beneficial for the general public
    and policymakers to be aware of this. The resulting map will also help non-academic
    users and the general public understand the water quality for irrigation. As a
    result, the GIS platform could be crucial in decision-making procedures that target
    agricultural practices and stop regional crop output declines. Even though the
    research was only conducted in a part of Bangladesh''s northern region, its conclusions,
    and lessons may still be used globally. Similar problems with water quality have
    been seen in the present research area and in other emerging countries, such as
    other regions of Bangladesh. Other areas of northern Bangladesh may experience
    water shortages and quality issues due to excessive water use, variations in rainfall
    pattern brought about by climate change, and heavy mixing of pollutants from numerous
    sources. Thus, a sub-humid climate, pre-existing geogenic concerns (e.g., aquifer
    lithology), and anthropogenic activities may cause several water quality problems
    and increase the risks to human health associated with drinking water in these
    areas. Administrators and decision-makers must consider this when creating water
    quality maps for a sustainable management plan to protect these water resources
    from further pollution and negative consequences. Additionally, depending on the
    irrigation water quality, the research aids crop selection. The targeted measures
    could lessen surface and groundwater pollution to support agricultural output
    in the future. This study will help agricultural managers plan irrigation water
    distribution in the study area and surrounding areas in northern Bangladesh. The
    study''s analytical materials will aid regional planners in developing a successful,
    comprehensive strategy for managing and conserving surface and groundwater. Regular
    monitoring should be ensured for sustainable agriculture in the study area. In
    further studies, groundwater and surface water quality for drinking, livestock,
    and other purposes should be checked. Authors'' contributions S M Rabbi Al Zihada:

    Problems of water scarcity plague large areas in the world, especially arid and
    semiarid areas such as the Mediterranean region. These problems cause serious
    consequences in countries like Spain, Italy and Portugal, which are rendered the
    most water-consuming countries in the European Union by the presence of a strong
    agricultural sector. In fact, 70% of the world’s freshwater withdrawals are nowadays
    earmarked for agriculture and this percentage is expected to increase, in order
    to meet the growing population’s demand for food and energy (biofuels)1. Over
    the last decades, among the various practices implemented by irrigation managers
    to mitigate the effects of water scarcity, open channel irrigation systems with
    high leakage rates have been replaced with pressurized water networks2, which
    operate either on demand or based on rotation delivery scheduling. Therefore,
    methodologies have recently been proposed to design/rehabilitate pressurized irrigation
    networks, that is to obtain highly effective networks able to meet desired water
    demands and service pressure with limited installation cost. Among the various
    methodologies proposed in the scientific literature, Reca and Martinez3 proposed
    a single objective genetic algorithm to design pressurized irrigation networks.
    Farmani et al.4 made use of a modified bi-objective genetic algorithm, in which
    the algorithm operators were modified to improve the effectiveness. The Authors
    proved that their algorithm yields better numerical performance than the linear
    programming in the design of branched irrigation systems operating on-demand or
    based on rotation delivery scheduling. Fernández García et al.5 compared two bi-objective
    algorithms, based on genetic algorithms and linear programming respectively, in
    the rehabilitation of pressurized irrigation networks with the aim to increase
    energy efficiency. Finally, Rubio-Castro et al.6 proposed a mathematical programming
    model for the optimal design of integrated agricultural water networks, based
    on a superstructure that includes all configurations in terms of use, reuse and
    regeneration of water over the territory. Other works addressed layout optimization
    along with pipe design. In this context, Lamaddalena et al.7 proposed a sequential
    algorithm for identifying the loops to be closed to improve the hydraulic performance,
    whereas Fouial et al.8 implemented loop re-closure in the framework of the multi-objective
    genetic optimization. Furthermore, Masoumi et al.9 presented a multi-objective
    methodology based on the Max–Min ant optimization to design both layout and pipe
    diameters in pressurized irrigation networks operating on-demand. Though being
    outstanding contributions to the field, the scientific works mentioned above and
    focussed on the optimization of pressurized irrigation networks are all based
    on the simplifying assumption of demand-driven outflows from hydrant heads used
    for irrigation. In other words, nodal demands are assigned as constant values
    independent of service pressure. The literature of urban water distribution systems
    has shown that the pressure driven approach, which models nodal outflows as a
    growing function of service pressure, yields a more realistic representation of
    network behaviour10,11,12,13,14, though causing trouble in the convergence of
    hydraulic modelling algorithms in some cases15. The use of pressure-driven modelling
    is quite limited in the context of irrigation networks (e.g., see16,17) with no
    focus on the optimization context. This gap is bridged in the present paper, in
    which a methodology is proposed for the pressure-driven modelling of hydrant outflows
    for use in the optimization/design context. The methodology features another novel
    aspect related to the reconstruction of peak demand scenarios. In the context
    of modelling demand scenarios18,19, methodologies were proposed in the scientific
    literature (e.g., see17,20,21) for demand estimation in pressurized irrigation
    networks operating on demand. These methodologies implement irrigation management
    practices followed by farmers and computational procedures and enable the soil
    water balance and the irrigation events for all cropped fields supplied by each
    delivery hydrant in a distribution network to be considered. In the present work,
    peak demand scenarios are reconstructed based on representative combinations of
    potentially simultaneous hydrant openings in pressurized irrigation networks subdivided
    into sectors of properties, inside each of which farmers use the available hydrant
    heads based on rotation delivery scheduling. Soil water balance is ignored as
    each peak demand scenario is meant to reproduce a plausible instantaneous demand
    forcing condition to test the hydraulic performance of the network in the optimization
    context, not a temporal sequence of demands at network nodes. A third final novel
    aspect concerns the numerical efficiency of the optimization and is based on the
    enforcement of the telescopic property of pipe diameters for speeding up the convergence
    of genetic algorithms in network design. The following sections report case study,
    methodology, results of the application and concluding remarks. Case study The
    water transfer and distribution network of Telgate is managed by the Consorzio
    di Bonifica della Media Pianura Bergamasca, hereinafter called “Consortium”, and
    serves with pressurized flow an area of about 750 ha, inside the towns of Telgate,
    Bolgare, Palosco, Palazzolo S/O, Grumello del Monte, Castelli Calepio, in the
    province of Bergamo. As is shown in Fig. 1, the network featuring a total length
    of 54.3 km is made up of two parts: the northern or high-altitude network (Network
    A) and the southern or low-altitude network (Network B) with a total length of
    30.1 km and 24.2 km, respectively. The two networks are disconnected from each
    other and are both fed by the Telgate pumping station, in which eight pumps are
    present, three ordinary and one back-up pumps for either network. The upstream
    tank of the station has a head of 180 m above sea level and receives through a
    transfer pipe water flows withdrawn from the river Oglio, in correspondence to
    an intake located in Tagliuno (Castelli Calepio), while respecting the water concession
    water discharge of 600 L/s, which is reduced to 400 L /s under conditions of drought.
    Figure 1 Plan view of the water transfer and distribution network in the case
    study area. Full size image In the served area, there are 924 irrigated properties
    (Fig. 2) grouped into 63 sectors. Each sector is assigned by the Consortium an
    irrigation water discharge Qirr equal to the product of its area in ha and the
    Consortium specific discharge dirr = 0.5 L/(s × ha), and a number of hydrant heads
    Nhyd = floor(max(Qirr/5, 1)), in which “floor” indicates the rounding to the lower
    integer. Figure 2 Properties of the Consortium highlighted with polygons filled
    with red colour. Map created with QGIS 3.28.3-Firenze and ESRI Satellite QuickMapServices.
    Full size image The graph in Fig. 3 presents the frequency analysis of the values
    Qirr in Consortium sectors. Most sectors feature values of Qirr lying between
    0 and 5 L/s (f = 37) or between 5 and 10 L/s (f = 18), therefore receiving a single
    hydrant head from the Consortium. There are f = 4 sectors within the range between
    Qirr = 10 and Qirr = 15 L/s receiving two hydrant heads, f = 1 sectors within
    the range between Qirr = 15 and Qirr = 20 L/s receiving three hydrant heads, f = 2
    sectors within the range between Qirr = 20 and Qirr = 25 L/s receiving four hydrant
    heads and finally f = 1 sectors within the range between Qirr = 30 and Qirr = 35
    L/s receiving six hydrant heads. No sector exists with Qirr between 25 and Qirr = 30
    L/s. Summing up, 80 hydrant heads are distributed in the served area. Inside each
    sector of properties, farmers can use the available hydrant heads to irrigate
    their properties based on rotation delivery scheduling. Figure 3 Frequency f of
    consortia for each class of Qirr. Full size image The Consortium network is plagued
    by various operational and managerial problems, related to its poor performance
    and old age. In fact, it is not capable of guaranteeing the desired service pressure
    and includes numerous old asbestos cement elements to be urgently replaced, as
    is prescribed by the law. These problems spurred the Consortium to evaluate the
    redesign of the infrastructure, which is the subject of the present work carried
    out in three phases: Phase 0: Hydraulic analysis of the current network. Phase
    1: Redesign of the network considering the same layout as the current network,
    with a total length of 54.3 km. Phase 2: Redesign of the network considering a
    modified 61.8 km long layout, obtained from the current layout by adding 30 new
    sites, indicated with a dotted line in Fig. 1, to close the external loops. Methodology
    The methodology adopted in this work is made up of three elements described in
    detail in the following subsections, namely a procedure for the reconstruction
    of peak demand scenarios (3.1), the hydraulic modelling of the network (3.2) and
    a procedure for the optimization of pipe diameters (3.3). The first two methodological
    elements were used in all phases of work (phases 0, 1 and 2). The third element
    was used, instead, only in phases 1 and 2, aimed at network design. Construction
    of peak demand scenarios A novel algorithm was developed to construct a sample
    of Ndsc plausible peak demand scenarios, where a demand scenario is defined as
    an operational scenario in which all the 80 hydrant heads provided by the Consortium
    are simultaneously active. This algorithm is made up of three steps (flowchart
    in Fig. 4). Figure 4 Flowchart for the construction of peak demand scenarios.
    Full size image As Step a of the algorithm, the network nodes associated with
    each Consortium property were manually identified as potential hydrant locations
    by leaning upon the maps in Figs. 1 and 2. In this context, the generic node was
    associated with one of the Consortium properties if one of the following conditions
    held: The node was inside a property; If the node did not lie inside any properties,
    the node was associated with the spatially closest property. The subsequent steps
    were carried out by using the programming language Matlab® 2023a22: Step b—the
    network nodes associated with each sector of properties were first determined,
    by grouping the nodes associated with all the properties inside the sector; Step
    c—A single demand scenario was then obtained by randomly selecting, for each hydrant
    head available in each sector of properties, the installation site among the list
    of nodes associated with that sector of properties. Step c was reiterated as many
    times as the number Ndsc of demand scenarios to be generated. Since the outflow
    at the generic node is assumed to lump the outflows occurring in the half pipes
    connected to this node from the hydraulic modelling viewpoint, the possibility
    of installing more than one hydrant head was considered in the algorithm at each
    network node. Hydraulic modelling of the network The hydraulic model of the network
    was built inside the software EPANET 2.213, which can solve the system of nodal
    mass conservation and pipe energy balance equations for each peak demand scenario
    generated as was shown in section “Construction of peak demand scenarios”. This
    new version of EPANET can model the pressure-driven behaviour of nodes in pressurized
    irrigation networks, without the implementation of artificial network elements
    (approach used by17). For the pipes of the existing network, a Hazen Williams
    roughness coefficient of 100 was considered in the phase 0 of work, consistently
    with aged asbestos cement elements. For the pipes of the redesigned network, a
    Hazen Williams roughness coefficient of 150 was considered, consistently with
    plastic material, which is not destined to change with infrastructure growing
    old. In correspondence to the generic hydrant head, the relationship between outflow
    and service pressure shown in Fig. 5 was considered, based on information gathered
    on the kind of devices provided by the Consortium and on how they are operated
    by the farmers. Figure 5 Relationship between outflow q and service pressure h
    at the generic hydrant head. Full size image The pumping station was modelled
    assuming the three ordinary pumps to be active at the maximum frequency of 50
    Hz in both Network A and Network B. Based on the information provided by the Consortium,
    the pump model considered for the three ordinary pumps in Network A is the Caprari
    P14CS/8/40/4D. The model considered for the three ordinary pumps in Network B
    is the Caprari P14CF/8/40/3D. The characteristic curves of both models are reported
    in Fig. 6. Figure 6 Characteristic curves for the pumps in Networks A and B: (a)
    discharge Q – head H and (b) discharge Q – efficiency η. Full size image Optimization
    of the network The optimization of the pipe diameters was carried out in the phases
    1 and 2 of work aimed at redesigning the network, by using a bi-objective genetic
    algorithm implemented in the Matlab® 2023a environment. The genetic algorithm
    is an adaptive mathematical procedure that solves optimization problems by mimicking
    living species’ evolution and adaptation to the surrounding environment by means
    of the cross-over and mutation processes23. The solutions inside the genetic algorithm
    are encoded in a population of pop individuals, each of which is made up of as
    many genes as the decision variables in the optimization problem. At the beginning
    of the application of the genetic algorithm an initial population is generated,
    to be evolved over generations. In the generic k-th generation, children are generated
    from parents by means of the crossover and mutation processes to create the population
    for the following k + 1-th generation. The steps of the genetic algorithm are
    iterated over generations till no significant improvements are remarked in the
    population’s fitness. The ultimate solution of the genetic algorithm is made up
    of a Pareto front of optimal trade-off solutions between the objective functions
    considered in the optimization. By following the default settings in Matlab® 2023a,
    a population pop of 200 individuals was used in this work. Furthermore, the crossover
    and mutation percentages were set to 80% and 20%, respectively. In the present
    case study, the first objective function to minimize was the total cost of network
    pipes, obtained by means of the following formula: $$C=\\sum_{i=1}^{p}{c}_{i}{L}_{i}$$
    (1) in which c (€/m) and L (m) are the unit costs and pipe lengths, respectively,
    while p is the total number of pipes, equal to 483 and 513 in the phases 1 and
    2 of work, respectively. In fact, as was described in section “Introduction”,
    phase 2 considered the presence of 30 additional pipes compared to phase 1, to
    close the external loops of the network. In the cost C, the expenses for disposing
    of the current network in asbestos cement were neglected, as well as the costs
    for the installation of isolation/control devices in the new network and for land
    expropriation to enable pipe laying on new sites not considered in the current
    layout. The unit cost of the new pipes was considered to be a growing function
    of the diameter, as is shown in the following Table 1, derived from the regional
    price list for PEAD PN16 elements. Table 1 Unit costs c for the pipe as a function
    of the external diameter De and of the internal diameter Di for PEAD PN16 pipes.
    Full size table As the second objective function to maximize in the optimization
    process, the minimum pressure head at nodes with outflow was calculated using
    the following formula: $${h}_{min}=\\mathrm{min}\\left({h}_{si,j}\\right)$$ (2)
    in which hsi,j (m) is the pressure head at the i-th node with outflow in the j-th
    peak demand scenario. The pair of objective functions composing the fitness was
    evaluated for each of the individuals generated by the genetic algorithm. Notably,
    the calculation of the second objective function in Eq. (2) was carried out by
    hydraulically solving the network with pipe diameters modified based on individual
    genes in the genetic algorithm, by means of the EPANET 2.2 toolkit24. Inside the
    bi-objective genetic algorithm, a number of decision variables equal to p was
    considered. Each decision variable took on an integer value between 1 and 6, to
    indicate which of the six pipe diameters reported in Table 1 was assigned to the
    corresponding network pipe. In the optimization, nc linear constraints expressed
    as follows were considered: $$\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{D}\\le 0$$ (3) in which D (p × 1)
    is the vector of pipe diameters. Matrix A (nc × p) is a matrix with elements equal
    to 0, − 1 or 1, in which the nc rows are associated with the nodes with outflow
    in the network. For the k-th constraint associated with one of the nodes with
    outflow, all elements are set to 0, except for A(k,l) = 1 and A(k,m) = − 1, with
    l and m representing the indices associated with a single pipe downstream and
    a single pipe upstream from the node, respectively. The matrix expression (3)
    entails that Dl ≤ Dm, i.e., that the generic pipe downstream of a node with outflow
    cannot have a larger diameter than the generic pipe upstream from the node. The
    presence of the constraints in Eq. (3) enforces the telescopic property in each
    individual in the optimization. As a result, for all individuals in the genetic
    algorithm, the diameters get progressively smaller while traversing the network
    from the source towards external nodes, consistently with engineering judgment.
    In the present work, the distinction between upstream and downstream pipes for
    each node with outflow was obtained based on the pipe water discharge values in
    the network configuration obtained by assigning the largest diameter in Table
    1 to all network pipes. Results As a preliminary analysis before Phases 0, 1 and
    2, the choice of the number Ndsc of demand scenarios to consider for the analysis
    of the performance of the current and redesigned network was made by testing how
    results in terms of meaningful hydraulic indicators are affected by changing Ndsc.
    Taking the current network as benchmark and considering hmin defined in Eq. (2)
    as the meaningful hydraulic indicator, the iterated application of the software
    EPANET 2.2 yielded the results shown in the following Fig. 7 in terms of hmin
    as a function of Ndsc. Starting from values around 19.5 m, hmin tends to decrease
    as Ndsc grows. However, for Ndsc ≥ 1000, the values of hmin appear to be stabilising
    around 16.2 m, proving that the hydraulic performance of the network can be satisfactorily
    assessed considering a sample of Ndsc = 1000 scenarios. In fact, larger samples
    do not give additional contribution to the assessment of the hydraulic performance,
    while increasing the computational burden. Therefore, the representative sample
    of Ndsc = 1000 scenarios was considered in the Phases 0, 1 and 2 of the work,
    described below. Figure 7 hmin as a function of Ndsc for the current network.
    Full size image Phase 0 The application of the software EPANET 2.2 to the current
    network (phase 0 of work) yielded the results reported in terms of minimum nodal
    pressure heads in the peak demand scenarios in the following Fig. 8. This figure
    differentiates between nodes with fully satisfactory pressure heads (> 30 m),
    nodes with barely sufficient pressure heads (≥ 20 m and ≤ 30 m) and nodes with
    insufficient pressure heads (< 20 m). The results confirm the presence of numerous
    pressure deficits below 30 m, as was remarked during in-situ observations, therefore
    justifying the need for network redesign. Figure 8 Current network with open external
    loops (dotted lines associated with not installed pipes) and minimum nodal pressure
    heads in peak demand scenarios. Full size image Phases 1 and 2 The results obtained
    for network redesign after about 100 generations of the bi-objective genetic algorithm
    in phases 1 and 2 of work are shown in the graph in Fig. 9, in terms of Pareto
    fronts between cost C and minimum pressure head hmin in the network. As expected,
    this graph shows, for both the Pareto fronts, growing values of hmin as the cost
    C increases. This happens because it takes the enlargement of pipe diameters to
    reduce head losses and to increase service pressure in the network, the head supplied
    by the pumping station being equal. The total cost C being the same, the Pareto
    front of optimization 2, related to phase 2, offers better solutions in terms
    of hmin than the Pareto front of optimization 1, related to phase 1. Though incurring
    additional expenses for pipe installation on new sites, the closure of the external
    loops in phase 2 enables money savings in the diameters used in other parts of
    the network, therefore resulting in better hydraulic performance with equal total
    cost. This confirms the results obtained in7,8,9 about the benefits of topological
    redundancy. Figure 9 Pareto front of optimal trade-off solutions between total
    cost C and minimum pressure head hmin in the network, obtained in optimization
    1 (phase 1) and optimization 2 (phase 2), considering the network configurations
    with open and closed external loops, respectively. Full size image To give evidence
    about the numerical benefits of the methodology adopted, the results reported
    in Fig. 10 point out that, after 10 generations of the genetic algorithm in optimization
    2, the adoption of the linear constraints in matrix Eq. (3) on pipe diameters
    for the enforcement of the telescopic property in the network speeded up the convergence
    towards effective solutions from the engineering viewpoint, in comparison with
    the solutions obtained by applying the algorithm without these constraints. In
    fact, the graph in Fig. 10 shows that the adoption of the constraints results
    in solutions with a much lower cost C, the value of hmin being equal. Figure 10
    Optimization 2. Pareto fronts of optimal trade-off solutions between total cost
    C and minimum pressure head hmin in the network, obtained after 10 generations
    of the genetic algorithm in the presence and absence of the constraints on pipe
    diameters. Full size image The choice of the ultimate solutions in optimizations
    1 and 2 was carried out to limit the budget and by considering the position of
    the knee in the Pareto fronts shown in Fig. 9, around 2,000,000 €. This budget
    results in solutions capable of guaranteeing fully satisfactory service pressure
    heads, that is significantly larger than 30 m at all nodes and in all peak demand
    scenarios. The following Table 2 reports the costs of the ultimate solutions 1
    and 2, obtained in phases 1 and 2 of work with a budget very close to 2,000,000
    €. The analysis of the table points out that Network A demands the larger investment
    in both the solutions, because of the larger overall length and more unfavorable
    altitude conditions. Table 2 Costs in millions of € for the two design solutions,
    for the high-altitude network (Network A), the low-altitude network (Network B)
    and for the overall network. Full size table The following Table 3 reports the
    network lengths associated with the external diameters used for network design
    (see Table 1). Design solution 2 makes wider use of the smallest diameters 125
    mm and 200 mm and prevents installation of the largest diameter 630 mm. This results
    in a total cost almost equal to that of design solution 1, despite the larger
    length extension. Table 3 Length L of network associated with the various external
    diameters De. Full size table The following Figs. 11 and 12 report some meaningful
    results for design solutions 1 and 2, respectively, in terms of nodal pressure
    heads (Figs. 11a and 12a), pumped water discharges (Figs. 11b and 12b) and pressure
    heads downstream of the pumping station (Figs. 11c and 12c) in the 1000 peak demand
    scenarios. Figure 11 (a) Design solution 1 with open external loops (dashed lines
    corresponding to not installed pipes) and minimum nodal pressure heads in the
    peak demand scenarios; (b) pumped water discharges and (c) service pressure heads
    downstream of the pumping station for Network A and Network B in the peak demand
    scenarios. Full size image Figure 12 (a) Design solution 2 with closed external
    loops and minimum nodal pressure heads in the peak demand scenarios; (b) pumped
    water discharges and (c) service pressure heads downstream of the pumping station
    for Network A and Network B in the peak demand scenarios. Full size image Notably,
    Figs. 11a and 12a prove that both the solutions can guarantee fully satisfactory
    nodal pressure heads. Figures 11b and 12b point out that the pumped water discharge
    in Networks A and B lies around 350 L/s and 250 L/s, respectively. The sum of
    the values is around 600 L/s, therefore abiding by the concession water discharge
    under peak conditions and rendering superfluous the carrying out of flow balance
    processes in the tank upstream from the Telgate station. Finally, Figs. 11c and
    12c point out that the service pressure downstream of the pumping station in the
    peak demand scenarios lies around 54 m and 53 m, for Network A and Network B,
    respectively. These values can also be kept as target settings in less demanding
    scenarios, when the number and rotational speed of active pumps are lower. Conclusions
    The present work concerned the design of the pressurized irrigation network serving
    an area of about 750 ha in Northern Italy and was carried out by using a methodology
    consisting of: Construction of peak demand scenarios, by randomly selecting the
    installation sites for available hydrant heads at each sector of irrigated properties.
    Pressure-driven hydraulic modelling at hydrant sites. Bi-objective genetic optimization
    of pipe diameters for network design in the current network layout (optimization
    1) and in another layout (optimization 2) modified by considering additional pipes
    for the closure of external loops. The first two methodological elements enabled
    the snapshot performance of the existing and optimized networks to be modelled
    realistically in networks serving properties grouped into sectors. Thanks to the
    implementation of constraints for the enforcement of the telescopic property in
    the network, i.e., the diameter reduction from internal to external areas, the
    third methodological element yielded effective design solutions in both the network
    layouts considered. The comparison of the ultimate design solutions pointed out
    a better hydraulic performance for the solution in optimization 2, which is also
    more reliable. In fact, it offers more numerous potential water paths to reach
    demanding nodes during mechanical failure events (pipe bursts). Nevertheless,
    the adoption of solution 2 entails some legal problems, due to the need for land
    expropriation to install pipes on new sites, which need to be considered by the
    Consortium in the choice of the ultimate solution. Data availability The datasets

  key_findings: The study found that the proposed methodology can effectively optimize
    irrigation networks by considering pressure-driven outflows and implementing redundant
    components. The methodology was able to identify design solutions that provide
    a better hydraulic performance and are more reliable in the event of component
    failures.
  limitations: 'The study focused on a specific irrigation network in Northern Italy,
    and the results may not be directly transferable to other networks with different
    characteristics or in different geographical regions.


    The study considered a limited number of peak demand scenarios (1000) to assess
    the hydraulic performance of the network. While this number was shown to be sufficient
    for the current network, it may not be representative of all possible operating
    conditions in different irrigation systems.


    The study did not consider the impact of soil variability or crop water requirements
    on the irrigation system design.'
  main_objective: To develop a methodology for optimizing irrigation networks by considering
    pressure-driven outflows and implementing redundant components to ensure reliable
    irrigation management.
  relevance_evaluation: This paper is highly relevant to the point in the literature
    review that discusses the need for redundancy and resilience in automated irrigation
    systems. The study proposes a methodology for optimizing irrigation networks by
    considering pressure-driven outflows and implementing redundant components, such
    as duplicate sensors, controllers, and communication channels. This approach can
    help maintain system functionality during component failures and ensure reliable
    irrigation management. Additionally, the methodology considers the random selection
    of installation nodes for hydrant heads, which aligns with the focus on implementing
    redundant components in automated irrigation systems.

  explanation: 'The presented literature review on blockchain applications for real-time
    irrigation management can be interpreted as follows:


    1. Blockchain technology, with its de-centralized structure that eliminates the
    need for a central authority, creates a trust layer among water stakeholders who
    depend on the quantity and quality of the same water resource. By storing rules
    in the form of smart contracts, the system ensures that the rules are followed
    by all parties, even if they are unaware of each other''s existence.


    2. Blockchain technology provides data security for water-related data. Since
    the data is distributed among all the nodes supporting the blockchain system,
    the data is safe from traditional cyberattacks and power outages. As the data
    is stored cryptographically, even if the data is somehow captured, it can''t be
    revealed unless the user wants to reveal it, providing individual privacy.


    3. The technology provides a distributed ledger of transactional data. Data recorded
    on the blockchain is not subject to deletion, which establishes a single and common
    database for all stakeholders to rely upon. Thus, removing the need for third-party
    verification systems or trusted data providers to verify the data.


    4. Blockchain technology establishes accountability. Since transactional data
    records on the blockchain are publicly available for anyone to view and verify,
    there is no need for a third-party verification system or trusted data provider
    to verify the data.'

    in the breeding program, demonstrating the utility of unsupervised machine learning
    for characterizing plant phenotypes.
  extract_1: Clustering algorithms, such as the non-hierarchical k-means algorithm,
    require a defined number of clusters to be specified. Often this specification
    is difficult to determine a priori, particularly when the data dimensionality
    is high. To circumvent this issue, we applied the principal progression of k clusters
    (PPKC), a method that generates a series of k-means clustering solutions across
    a range of k values and parameterizes the output as a function relating cluster
    membership to k. This allows one to explore the relationship between clustering
    and k without having to specify k in advance.
  extract_2: Resulting clusters characterized by specific combinations of aboveground
    architectural traits could then be used to describe specific phenotypes of interest,

    The authors state that real-time monitoring of data related to automated irrigation
    systems is an essential component of smart farming technologies, as timely and
    accurate information can lead to significant improvements in water efficiency
    and yield. However, the quality of sensor data can greatly influence the performance

    are neural networks that are trained to reconstruct their own input, and they
    can be used to identify data that deviates significantly from the expected patterns.
    Clustering algorithms, on the other hand, can be used to group similar data points
    together, and they can be used to identify outliers that do not belong to any

    can enhance the reliability and robustness of automated irrigation systems by

  explanation: 'The PCBN model combines copula theory with Bayesian networks (BNs)
    to assess the safety risks associated with shield tunnel construction. This combination
    allows for the consideration of the complex risk system and correlation problems
    within the risk system. The PCBN model is established using a pair-copula construction
    method, which is defined as a pair-copula Bayesian network (PCBN). Using the PCBN
    model, a risk analysis of the dome settlement caused by the excavation in the
    Donghu Tuanshan tunnel in Wuhan is carried out. The model determines the risk

    and research agenda. Annual Reviews in Control, 55, 442–465. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arcontrol.2023.03.013'
  explanation: 'The paper you provided compares different applications of model predictive
    control (MPC) in water systems, such as water reservoirs, open channels, and urban
    water networks. It is an extensive review of 149 peer-reviewed journal articles
    published in the last 25 years on this topic.


    The paper starts by introducing the concept of MPC and its advantages over more
    conventional methods such as dynamic programming and adaptive dynamic programming.
    MPC is a control strategy that uses a model of the system to predict the future
    behavior of the system and then optimizes the control actions to achieve the desired
    objectives. The main advantages of MPC are that it can handle complex systems
    with multiple inputs and outputs, it can deal with constraints on the control
    actions and the state of the system, and it can handle uncertainty in the system
    model and the disturbances.


    The paper then provides a detailed review of the different applications of MPC
    in water systems. For water reservoirs, MPC has been used to control the release
    of water from the reservoir to meet downstream demands while minimizing the risk
    of flooding or drought. For open channels, MPC has been used to control the flow
    of water through the channel to meet downstream demands while minimizing the risk
    of flooding or erosion. For urban water networks, MPC has been used to control
    the flow of water through the network to meet demands while minimizing the cost
    of pumping and the risk of leaks.


    The paper concludes by discussing the challenges and future directions for research
    on MPC in water systems. The main challenges include the need for more accurate
    and reliable models of water systems, the need for more efficient algorithms for
    solving the MPC optimization problem, and the need for better ways to handle uncertainty
    in the system model and the disturbances.


    The paper is well-written and provides a comprehensive overview of the current
    state of the art in MPC for water systems. It is a valuable resource for researchers
    and practitioners interested in this topic.'

    BMPs to reduce sediment load and organophosphate pesticides in surface runoff.
    Science of the Total Environment, 409(10), 1949-1958.
  explanation: The paper investigates the effectiveness of 14 individual and combined
    best management practices (BMPs) in reducing nitrogen and phosphorus discharge
    at the sub-basin level in the Jing River Basin (JRB), China. The authors use the
    Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to simulate the effects of these practices,
    and employ a multi-objective optimization algorithm (NSGA-II) to identify the
    optimal combination of BMPs that minimizes both total cost and pollutant reduction.
    The results suggest that the combined BMPs can significantly reduce both nitrogen
    and phosphorus pollution, and that the optimal combination varies depending on
    the specific sub-basin characteristics. The authors conclude that their approach
    provides a useful tool for decision-makers to identify the most cost-effective
    BMPs for reducing agricultural non-point source pollution.

  data_sources: Residential water consumption in Yazd, Iran, from January 2011 to
    November 2020.
  explanation: 'The paper combines a multi-dimensional time series k-means algorithm
    with a long short-term memory network to predict monthly water demand based on
    consumer behavior and historical data. The main contribution is a method for imputing
    missing data in the form of fuzzy numbers.


    The paper starts by discussing the need for accurate water demand forecasting
    in urban areas. The authors mention that existing methods often struggle to handle
    missing data, which can lead to inaccurate predictions. They propose a new method
    for imputing missing data that uses a fuzzy-based algorithm to estimate the missing
    values as fuzzy numbers. This method is shown to outperform traditional methods
    in terms of accuracy.


    Next, the paper describes the proposed forecasting model. The model uses a multi-dimensional
    time series k-means algorithm to cluster consumers based on their consumption
    behavior. This allows the model to capture the different patterns of water use
    among different groups of consumers. The model then uses a long short-term memory
    network to predict the monthly water demand for each cluster. The LSTM network
    is a type of recurrent neural network that is well-suited for time series data.
    It is able to learn the long-term dependencies in the data, which is important
    for accurate forecasting.


    The proposed model is evaluated on a dataset of monthly water consumption data
    from a city in Iran. The results show that the model is able to accurately predict
    the monthly water demand for each cluster of consumers. The model outperforms
    existing methods in terms of accuracy, and it is able to handle missing data effectively.


    Finally, the paper discusses the implications of the findings. The authors note
    that the proposed model can be used to improve water demand forecasting in urban
    areas. This can help water utilities to better plan for future water needs and
    to avoid shortages. The authors also suggest that the proposed method for imputing
    missing data could be used in other applications where missing data is a problem.'
  extract_1: The present study proposes a structured process involving several steps
    such as imputing the missing data, clustering the customers, and forecasting the
    monthly water demand of customers. From the practical viewpoint, making accurate
    predictions of monthly water consumption facilitates decision making to balance
    the water demand and supply in different sectors (i.e. residential, commercial
    and industrial).

  limitations: 'The paper does not provide a detailed description of the dataset used,

    unclear whether the dataset is representative of other cities or regions.


    The paper does not provide a detailed description of the hyperparameter tuning
    process for the LSTM network. This makes it difficult to assess the robustness
    of the model to different hyperparameter settings.'

- explanation: 'The Zigbee protocol is based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard and operates
    in the 2.4 GHz band with a data rate of 250 kbps. It provides low power consumption
    and a mesh network topology, making it suitable for applications that require
    long battery life and robust connectivity. However, it has a limited range and
    is not suitable for applications that require high bandwidth or mobility.


    The BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy), from the Bluetooth standard family, also operates
    in the 2.4 GHz band with a data rate of 1 Mbps. It is designed for low power consumption
    and is often used in wireless peripherals such as headphones and sensors. BLE
    has a shorter range than WiFi but is more energy efficient and has better connectivity
    in dense environments.


    The WiFi protocol, based on the IEEE 802.11 standard, operates in the 2.4 GHz
    and 5 GHz bands with data rates ranging from 1 Mbps to several Gbps. It provides
    high bandwidth and supports a wide range of applications, including internet access,
    streaming media, and gaming. However, it has higher power consumption and is less
    suitable for applications that require long battery life.


    The WiMAX protocol, based on the IEEE 802.16 standard, operates in the 2.5 GHz,
    3.5 GHz, and 5.8 GHz bands with data rates ranging from 75 Mbps to 1 Gbps. It
    provides high bandwidth and long range, making it suitable for applications such
    as wireless broadband internet access and backhaul links. However, it is more
    expensive and complex to deploy than other protocols.


    The LoRaWAN protocol operates in the sub-GHz bands (typically 868 MHz in Europe
    and 915 MHz in the US) with data rates ranging from 250 bps to 50 kbps. It is
    designed for long range and low power consumption, making it suitable for applications
    such as smart metering and asset tracking. However, it has limited bandwidth and
    is not suitable for applications that require high data rates.


    The 5G protocol operates in a wide range of bands, including sub-6 GHz, mmWave,
    and mid-band, with data rates ranging from several hundred Mbps to several Gbps.
    It provides ultra-high bandwidth, low latency, and massive connectivity, making
    it suitable for a wide range of applications, including mobile broadband, autonomous
    vehicles, and industrial automation. However, it is still under development and
    is not widely available.


    The choice of protocol for a specific application depends on factors such as the
    required data rate, range, power consumption, cost, and security requirements.
    For applications that require low power consumption and long range, LoRaWAN is
    a good option. For applications that require high bandwidth and low latency, 5G
    is a good choice. For applications that require a balance of performance and cost,
    WiFi or BLE may be suitable.'

- explanation: Employing unsupervised learning algorithms, the study characterized
    leaf morphological dynamics. To test the algorithm's robustness, several pre-processing
    techniques were investigated and compared in a pipeline. Significant differences
    in IOU scores were discovered depending on the image source, with pre-processed
    images consistently outperforming raw images in IOU scores. This research has
    produced a method for using pre-processed images for effective wheat canopy segmentation.
    Additionally, correlation-based GLCM and color features in combination were found
    to give the most reliable information about drought stress. The research also
    discovered that the Random Forest (RF) algorithm is the most accurate and reliable
    for detecting drought water stress, showing high performance in terms of recall,
    precision, and F1 score with the lowest gap between training and testing performances.
    Hence, the RF algorithm is the most suitable for building water stress detection
    models.
  extract_1: The goal of this research was to develop an automated system for detecting
    water stress in the wheat cultivar RAJ 3765. In this study, we demonstrate that
    previous research has helped us overcome obstacles such as the need to use invasive
    technologies to quantify the water stress experienced by wheat crops.
  extract_2: Multiple cases and hypotheses concerning the use of pre-processing methods,
    wheat canopy segmentation methods, and whether the present models from prior work
    can be adapted for categorising wheat crop water stress inform the workflow of
    this research. Consequently, it was determined that the most effective pre-processing
    operations for constructing an automation model for water stress detection are
    TV-L1 denoising with the Primal-Dual algorithm and min-max contrast stretching.

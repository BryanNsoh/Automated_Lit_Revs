    \ \n \n \n1. \nINTRODUCTION \nCurrently, different techniques are used in irrigation\
    \ systems around the world as shown in Figure 1. \nMoreover, Table 1 illustrates\
    \ the benefits and limitations associated with these methods. Therefore, \ndeveloping\
    \ an optimal irrigation system is necessary to reduce cost, power, and water consumption\
    \ \ndepending on real physical information instead of predicted one [1]. Nowadays,\
    \ wireless sensor networks \n(WSN) have a significant role in many applications,\
    \ such as environmental monitoring, medical, agricultural, \nand others due to\
    \ their flexibility and ability of processing data in different environments with\
    \ easy \nprogramming [2]-[4]. The use of sensors in recent applications is not\
    \ limited to environmental sensing, \ncollecting data from the field, and sending\
    \ information to users depending on some situations [5], [6]. Power \nresources\
    \ in sensor nodes are batteries that have a limited lifetime and difficulty in\
    \ replacing or recharging \nthem. Thus, it is important to design an optimal power\
    \ consumption network to increase WSN life [7]-[10]. \nMoreover, irrigation in\
    \ agriculture consumes about 85% of the total consumed water in the world and\
    \ this \nwill increase rapidly with the increase in population, therefore it is\
    \ important to design an irrigation system \nwith optimized use of water resources\
    \ [11]-[13].  \nAt the other hand, security and cyber-security are important aspects\
    \ to be considered in developing \nsmart systems with WSN [14], [15], because\
    \ sensor nodes are used to collect specific and critical information \nto be sent\
    \ to an appropriate destination to take a decision. Therefore, the existence of\

    \ of irrigation system can lead to send a fault decision to the actuators resulting\
    \ in wasting water \nand harming crops [16]. Obviously, denial of service (DoS)\
    \ attacks are the most notable attacks in the field of \navailability that prohibit\
    \ clients from receiving the specific data with the right time [17]-[19]. In addition,\
    \ the \nuse of WSN for systems decision making requires the reliability, availability\
    \ and confidentiality which can be \nachieved using fault tolerance methods in\
    \ software engineering [20]. In this paper, an optimal, secured and \nreliable\
    \ smart irrigation system based on WSN is produced in the literature to manage\
    \ the resources in \nirrigation in optimal way. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1. Agricultural\

    \ search , which is a framework developed \nto depict the flow of information\
    \ through the different phases of a systematic review [21]. Figure 2 explains\

    \ Smart irrigation system based on WSN \nAs mentioned earlier, depending on the\
    \ functionality of the reviewed papers, 30 articles proposed a smart \nirrigation\
    \ system based on WSN to monitor and control irrigation process. In [22], an internet\
    \ of things (IoT) \nbased smart agrotech system was proposed to improve farm production\
    \ using efficient monitoring and \nscheduling irrigation process. The collected\
    \ data from sensors (soil moisture, temperature, and humidity) \ncompared with\
    \ real data using comparative analysis and results showed an acceptable error\
    \ on the charge of \nlacking in coverage area. While in Liao et al. [23] developed\
    \ a smart drip irrigation system depending on \nreal-time soil moisture data in\
    \ a greenhouse tomato’s crop. A comparative study between the proposed system\
    \ \nand other irrigation systems was done with results approved that the giving\
    \ system is efficient to deal with food \nsecurity and water scarcity issues.\
    \ Abioye et al. [24] presented an efficient monitoring and data-driven \nmodelling\
    \ of the information influencing the irrigation of mustard leaf plant. At the\
    \ other hand, Torres et al. [25] \nsubmitted a multilevel data fusion architecture\
    \ to get an accurate sensor readings that lead to accurate decision \nmaking.\
    \ Three categories were involved in the proposed architecture: sensor data fusion,\
    \ event and decision \nmaking, and decision fusion based on multiple applications.\
    \ In [26], a smart agriculture system was developed \nwith an open source and\
    \ not expensive hardware components like built a WSN using Arduino and Raspberry\
    \ Pi \nto get a cost-effective system. The fuzzy logic control was used as a decision\
    \ method for the amount and \nduration of irrigation. An automated irrigation\
    \ system based on IoT was presented in [27]. This was done by \ndistributing different\
    \ sensors in the farm (soil moisture, temperature and humidity) and the reads\
    \ are entered \nto a machine learning algorithm. Sodhi and Saxena [1] proposed\
    \ a smart irrigation system based on \nmicrocontroller and used Bayesian analysis\
    \ hosted on IBM Waston platform to monitor the health of the crop, \nthe required\
    \ water to irrigation and every detected intrusion. The water pumps are activated\
    \ automatically when \nthe soil moisture level (measured by sensor nodes in WSN)\
    \ is less than a threshold value. Intelligent agent \nconcept was used in [28]\
    \ to design and implement a cyber-physical irrigation system. The physical data\
    \ \ncollected using WSN and a weather station while processing of these data is\
    \ done in a central station to \ndecide the irrigation status based on these data.\
    \ At last, a control signal is sent to the actuator system by the \nintelligent\
    \ agent to power on the solenoid valves for starting irrigation. Ali et al. [29]\
    \ and Tiglao et al. [30] \nconsidered the use of IoT and mesh WSN in designing\
    \ an irrigation system. Jaiswal and Ballal [31] proposed \nan automated drip irrigation\
    \ system using real-time fuzzy inference method and WSN implemented in \nLabVIEW.\
    \ In [32], a monitoring and control irrigation system was proposed based on multi\
    \ agent system. \nThe WSN gathered data from environment to evaluate the actual\
    \ need of water every five minutes and weather \nmap used to calculate the potential\
    \ evapotranspiration precisely. Karunanithy and Velusamy [33] presented an \n\
    automated drip irrigation with fertigation system based on WSN. The proposed system\
    \ utilizes soil moisture \ndata and evapotranspiration for prediction of required\
    \ water to irrigate the area. This system proposed also a \ntransmission method\
    \ between cluster head and a base station based on travelling salesman protocol\
    \ (TSP) to \nreduce power consumption in data transmission. results approved that\
    \ the proposed system used water efficiently. \n      \n  \n \n       ISSN: 1693-6930\

    \ \n136 \nThe irrigation system proposed in [34] used dynamic sensor data and\
    \ real time weather information and static data \nlike plant and soil type to\
    \ decide the irrigation process. artificial intelligent (AI) algorithms have been\
    \ used for \ntraining and testing data. Barkunan et al. [35] suggested an automated\
    \ irrigation system based on sensing rain fall \nin a farm. The information is\
    \ transmitted using global systems for mobile/general packet radio service GSM/GPRS\
    \ \ntechnology to the farmers at anytime and anywhere to check the status of the\
    \ farm. In [36], a developed real-time \nagriculture application was presented\
    \ using multi-layered architecture containing three technologies (internet of\
    \ \nthings, cloud computing and context awareness). In [37], a smart irrigation\
    \ system based on WSN and fuzzy \nlogic was suggested. A comparison was made between\
    \ a crop irrigated with traditional irrigation and with \nproposed system showed\
    \ that the proposed system used quantity of water equals to half the required\
    \ quantity \nusing traditional method. Nawandar and Satpute [38] proposed a smart\
    \ irrigation system with low-cost target \nusing IoT platform to collect data,\
    \ neural network to make decisions for scheduling irrigation depending on \nthe\
    \ collected data and the user viewed the data remotely using message queuing telemetry\
    \ transport (MQTT) \nand hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) protocols. This system\
    \ is intelligent, cost effective and portable. \nAt the other hand, the smart\
    \ drip irrigation system proposed in [39] used smartphone to capture soil \nimage.\
    \ Calculations were made on the image to know the level of wetness and send the\
    \ data to a microcontroller \nto take an irrigation decision depending on the\
    \ captured image in smartphone and sensors output. \nMuangprathub et al. [40]\
    \ proposed a control system to control environmental parameters that affect the\
    \ crop \nproduction. Three parts included in the control system: hardware component,\
    \ web application and mobile \napplication. In [41], a low cost smart irrigation\
    \ system based on IoT and weather was developed to control \nirrigation process\
    \ automatically depending on moisture level value. While in [42], agricultural\
    \ physical \nsystem (ACPS) with solar irrigation facility was proposed to manage\
    \ irrigation process remotely. \nPhotovoltaic energy was used as a power source\
    \ in the proposed system and client-server architecture used to \nensure communication\
    \ in two directions between the executional level in the field WSN and managerial\
    \ level \nin the cloud.  \nSelmani et al. [43] presented a solar photovoltaic\
    \ watering system (SPVWS) with multithreading \ndesign and virtual timers. Raspberry\
    \ pi was used due to its efficient performance with real time applications. \n\
    By multithreading programming used in the system, controlling the system and HTTP\
    \ server job working \nconcurrently to give remote control of the irrigation system\
    \ and online monitoring of data. The proposed \nsystem in [44] used IoT to automate\
    \ controlling and monitoring of irrigation process. Sensor devices \ncollected\
    \ environmental data from the field and regression algorithm used this data to\
    \ determine water \nrequirements in a day. Mohapatra and Lenka [45] proposed a\
    \ watering system with future prediction of soil \nmoisture content using neural\
    \ network. The expectation strategy utilized the collected data from sensors such\
    \ \nas soil and weather parameters. In [46], an irrigation management system based\
    \ on WSN was developed to \nautomate irrigation process. Sensors gathered data\
    \ from field and sent it to the controller for irrigation \ndecision and to the\
    \ server for monitoring purpose. Khelifa et al. [13] proposed an automated irrigation\
    \ system \nbased on WSN to gather data for irrigation process decision. A web\
    \ application in smartphones also used to \ngive notifications when the soil is\
    \ dry or the level of the water in the tank is low. The WSN connected with \n\
    the server using 4G-LTE technology due to its flexibility. In [47], a smart irrigation\
    \ system is proposed to \ncontrol and monitor irrigation process using WSN and\
    \ fuzzy logic as a decision tool. Sensor nodes collected \ndata from a field,\
    \ decision support system used this data to schedule irrigation using fuzzy logic\
    \ methods and \nactuators to execute commands. Abdullah et al. [48] presented\
    \ a simulation model to a smart irrigation \nsystem based on WSN. In the proposed\
    \ model, WSN used cluster topology to ensure a scalable network and \nincrease\
    \ sensors life time. The proposed system used fuzzy inference system to irrigation\
    \ control. Simulation \nresults showed that the system performance is accurate\
    \ with economical use of water and power. In [49] a wireless \nsensor/actuator\
    \ network (WSAN) with an adaptable decision support system was integrated to get\
    \ an automatic \nirrigation system. To analyze data, a machine learning process\
    \ had been used to get new knowledge. To ensure \nthat the developed system is\
    \ effective, the performance of the system was compared with classical \nagricultural\
    \ exercises.  \n \n2.2.  Optimization with smart irrigation system  \nThe systematic\
    \ literature review protocol includes seven research articles that deal with optimization\
    \ \nproblem in irrigation system based on WSN. In [50], a reliable low-cost information\
    \ gathering protocol \n(RLCIG) was proposed for irrigation system with WSN. Clustering\
    \ techniques were used for data aggregation \nwith optimized power to increase\
    \ network life. For balanced clustering, conditional spider optimization (CSO)\
    \ \nalgorithm was used, while for optimal path selection, the system proposed\
    \ using flower-bee search (FBS) \nalgorithm. The proposed method was tested using\
    \ simulation and the results show an improvement in transmission \nrange, cost\
    \ and system lifetime. Briones et al. [51] suggested a new multi-agent system\
    \ (MAS) to get an automated \nmonitoring and controlled irrigation system for\
    \ potato crops. MAS was developed using a cloud computing \nplatform which can\
    \ collect information from WSNs to define factors and determine irrigation requirements.\
    \ \nTELKOMNIKA Telecommun Comput El Control \n \n \n \nReview on cyber-security\
    \ for optimized and smart irrigation systems (Wid Badee Abdulaziz) \n137 \nThis\
    \ smart system has the potential to keep resources and upgrade the efficiency\
    \ of crop production systems, \nspecially in rustic areas. The intelligent irrigation\
    \ system presented in [52] was developed to decrease water \nconsumption by combining\
    \ IoT, cloud computing, and optimization techniques. The used optimization model\
    \ \nminimizes the consumed water efficiently. The efficiency of the suggested\
    \ approach, which minimizes \nirrigation water use, was proven by a comparison\
    \ of the recommended optimization-based control model \nwith the flow-based control\
    \ model \nOcampo and Dadios [53], a multi-objective optimization method using\
    \ an intelligent irrigation \nsystem was introduced to reduce the energy cost\
    \ of operating two water pumps that maintain the water \nrequired for farm’s irrigation.\
    \ It was significant to obsereve that the genetic algorithm was used to get the\
    \ \noptimal solution. To achieve optimal water consumption, the authors of [54]\
    \ suggested integrating the \nautomated irrigation system with an accumulative\
    \ neural network (ANN). The suggested system was \nsimulated using the MATLAB\
    \ Toolbox of neural network with feed-forward backpropagation ANN model. \nIn\
    \ addition, in Maurya and Jain [55], suggested an approach for designing WSN-based\
    \ automated irrigation \nsystems. All sensor nodes collect data on an ongoing\
    \ basis. However, just data with a recurrent timer is sent \nto the base station\
    \ or data that exceeds the threshold. To reduce the node’s power consumption for\
    \ each \ntransmission, fuzzy logic was utilized to locate the entire cluster head\
    \ in the existing round. Comparisons \nwith other routing protocols have shown\
    \ that it effectively minimizes power consumption at each \ntransmission and extends\
    \ the life of the entire network. In [56], a WSN-based intelligent irrigation\
    \ system \nwith optimal consumed power using the Lagrange multiplier method was\
    \ suggested. The aim was to partition \npower optimally and efficiently, while\
    \ optimally minimizing power and watering, depending on the plant’s \nwatering\
    \ needs and watering time. \n \n2.3.  Cyber-security with smart irrigation system\
    \ \nAs the security is important aspect in the field of information systems including\
    \ irrigation, different \nresearchers tackled this issue. While in cyber-security\
    \ side, there is a smaller number of research work due to \nnew entrance of irrigation\
    \ field. In [57], a smart irrigation system was proposed with the assistance of\
    \ an \nandroid application. Variety of sensors, soil moisture, air humidity, and\
    \ air temperature were used to collect \nphysical information. Once the data reached\
    \ the server, a fuzzy logic control was used for take decisions \ndepending on\
    \ the required irrigation. The block chains were used to provide the required\
    \ reliability in the smart \nsystem by limiting the access and control of the\
    \ suggested system to only authorized devises. The system was \nefficient for\
    \ handling the irrigation process securely. Saleem et al. [16] proposed a data\
    \ encryption method to \nensure the accuracy of collected information by WSN to\
    \ get an effective irrigation decision. The encryption \nmechanism had been inspired\
    \ by blood brain barrier (BBB) system to ensure efficient data transmission in\
    \ \nWSNs. The system was simulated using network simulator two (NS2) and the results\
    \ approved the efficiency \nof the proposed encryption method in protecting data\
    \ communication from various attacks. \n \n2.4.  Fault tolerance with smart irrigation\
    \ system \nAs the irrigation systems are considered as important parts of feeding\
    \ security around the world, it is \nnecessary to ensure the reliability and availability\
    \ of them through using fault tolerance techniques. Some \nresearchers adopted\
    \ the presenting of solutions to this aspect in the literature. Ramli et al. [58]\
    \ suggested an \nadaptive technique to achieve reliability in a smart farm using\
    \ two network protocols: LoRaWAN and IEEE \n802.11ac in a smart monitoring system.\
    \ The sensor data has a small data size with low energy, so LoRaWAN \nprotocol\
    \ is suitable for transmitting it. Moreover, transmitting video data was done\
    \ using IEEE 802.11ac that \nhad a higher data rate. Using two network protocols\
    \ helped in getting a reliable monitoring system in \ncomparison of using a single\
    \ protocol technique. In [59], a novel approach for the recovery from \nsimultaneous\
    \ failures was proposed for a large-scale multi-channel WSNs called simultaneous\
    \ failure \nrecovery based on relay node relocation (SFR-RNR). As a case study,\
    \ the authors chose precision agriculture \napplication because it had thousands\
    \ of thousands of sensors. The proposed approach aim was to rebuilt the \nconnection\
    \ and the network coverage after failures.  \n \n \n3. \nPROSPECTIVE SOLUTION\
    \ METHODOLOGY  \nAs mentioned in the reviewed papers of [1]-[59], the problem\
    \ of managing the resources (water and \npower) in the irrigation systems has\
    \ been tackled in different directions that dealt with security, optimization,\
    \ \nWSN management, or fault tolerance individually. Therefore, there is a real\
    \ need for finding a solution \nmethodology for finding a comprehensive scheme\
    \ that manages the irrigation systems. This scheme aims to \npropose a smart irrigation\
    \ system (dripped and sprinkler) that adopts a developed optimization, cyber-security,\
    \ \nfault tolerance methods. This is to present a comprehensive irrigation system\
    \ that can manage the available \nresource of water and power to achieve the aspects\
    \ of reliability, availability and confidentially. A diagram in \nFigure 3 shows\
    \ the structure of the proposed project based on the results of the systematic\
    \ review. \n      \n  \n \n       ISSN: 1693-6930 \nTELKOMNIKA Telecommun Comput\

    \ in Figure 3 shows the suggestion solution methodology, considered as \ncontributions.\
    \ These contributions are the results of the systematic review that sorts the\
    \ problems as a \nheretical from bottom to top. Ideas can be summarized as:  \n\
    1) \nDesigning and implementing of smart dripped and sprinkler irrigation system\
    \ based on clustered WSN. \nThe designed WSN is based on:  \n− Nodes of sensors\
    \ and a base-station for each cluster. \n− Irrigation systems that include water\
    \ pumps and actuators.  \n− The MQTT protocol is adopted in managing the data\
    \ transmission in the WSN as well as part of \nsecurity in terms of authentication.\
    \  \n2) \nProducing an optimized method for managing the consumed water and power\
    \ to be reduced efficiently. \nThis method can take care from availability of\
    \ the proposed system. The possible optimization methods \nthat can be adopted\
    \ include but not limited to swarm intelligent, ANN, gentic, fuzzy logic and Lagrange\
    \ \nmultiplier. These methods are multi-objective methods and based on finding-out\
    \ the optimal balancing \nfactors in the mathematical model of the proposed system.\
    \  \n3) \nIntroducing a cyber-security algorithm for detecting and tracking the\
    \ DoS attacks that can be occurred \nin the proposed management method and the\
    \ whole irrigation system. This algorithm guarantees the \nconfidentiality and\
    \ availability of the presented system. It includes two phases: \n− Physical phase:\
    \ it implemented in the WSN level to protect the data transmission between the\
    \ nodes, \nirrigation bumps and base-stations.  \nTELKOMNIKA Telecommun Comput\

    \  \n4) \nAdopting a fault tolerance-based monitoring method for the proposed\
    \ system to solve the problems of \noccurred faults in terms of hardware and software.\
    \ This method can guarantee the availability and \nreliability of the proposed\
    \ system. \nFigure 4 shows the suggested system block diagram that explains the\
    \ levels of hardware and \nsoftware that are considered for solving the mentioned\
    \ problems in managing power and water resources of \nirrigation systems. This\
    \ system can be briefly explained as: 1) sensor nodes and water bumps are connected\
    \ \nto a base-station to build a cluster in WSN. The base-station is responsible\
    \ of controlling irrigation process by \nsending power on and off commands to\
    \ water pumps with proper irrigation time depending on sensor’s \nreadings and\
    \ climatic conditions. Moreover, the base-station and related nodes as well as\
    \ bumps apply \nthe introduced cyber-security, water and power optimization, fault\

    A systematic literature reviews on the previous researches about smart irrigation\
    \ systems was \npresented in this paper to stand on their limitations and propose\
    \ solution methodology in terms of reliability, \noptimization and cyber-secured\
    \ smart irrigation system based on WSNs. The systematic literature review \nshowed\
    \ that the research work considered each side of problems in individual way. Therefore,\
    \ the need for \nproducing a comprehensive management system for smart irrigation\
    \ based on WSN. The solution \nmethodology for covering the drawbacks of the research\
    \ work in literature was introduced a block diagram with \ndescription about its\
    \ contributions to enhance the current irrigation systems have been produced.\
    \ The results of \nthe suggested system are expected to show a high performance\
    \ in terms of reliability, availability, and security.  \n \n \nREFERENCES \n\

    Abstract Information about human social activities and relationships are exploited
    by an ever increasing number of proposed applications and protocols in several
    scenarios, given the consequent increase in the system performance. Examples are
    data transmission over delay tolerant networks, content recommendation in search
    engines, and advertisement of products and services. An emerging field where social
    networks are being exploited is the Internet of Things, where smart objects connect
    to the network to bring the real world into the virtual dimension. Objects capable
    to communicate on social network sites are able to enter into their owners’ social
    loop so as to automatically publish information of interest for selected communities
    of people and to perform some related automatic actions. In so doing, not only
    can objects be part of the human social networks but they can also build their
    own social network. As a consequence, interactions among them can be fostered
    towards the development of complex services for the direct benefit of people.
    Accordingly, objects mimic the human behavior towards a scalable and effective
    service discovery and composition as well as trustworthiness management. On the
    basis of the importance achieved by this trend in the last couple of years, in
    this paper we intend to review the adopted approaches towards the exploitation
    of social network concepts by the Internet of Things, the technologies behind
    these, and the potentialities. Previous article in issue Next article in issue
    Keywords Internet of ThingsSocial networksSmart objects 1. Introduction The number
    of objects that are currently accessing the Internet, side-by-side to human beings
    to advertise, search for, and accessing enhanced services is growing exponentially.
    Among them are sensors, actuators, wireless and mobile devices, or simply every-day-life
    objects enhanced with capabilities to interact with the external world through
    the Internet. This is a clear signal that the much-vaunted (and sometime abused)
    Internet of Things paradigm is already turned into a reality on which there is
    a strong convergence of the interests of researchers, users, and industries. As
    a main effect, we have today a new approach available to build enhanced applications
    and services involving the communications among objects on the Internet to the
    service of the human beings. Several studies have focused their attention to the
    definition of architectural models and solutions towards the use and the inter-connection
    of Web-enabled objects using open protocols and well-known architectural styles,
    REST and SOAP based Web services (such as, [1], [2]). As a consequence, the obvious
    evolutionary step of the IoT is the so called Web of Things (WoTs) that envisages
    new scenarios and applications where Internet enabled objects become active actors
    and peers in the Web. Sample services, applicable to Smart Cities or Smart Homes,
    are given below: • The car driver knows about the status of her car and of the
    roads on the path towards her destination. Such awareness is achieved by accessing,
    through her mobile phone (or through any communication technology in her car),
    web services that are fed by data collected from sensors scattered both in her
    car and in the areas of interest. • The domestic appliances may be accessed by
    the owner through web services from remote sites and some actions can be performed
    on them to prepare comfortable conditions for a better welcome home. • Eco-compatible
    houses may be equipped with controllers and sensors able to measure the local
    energy production and consumption and manageable through web services towards
    a reduction of the environmental impact. Besides the obvious advantages of the
    depicted sample scenarios, one cannot hide the doubts on the ability of the proposed
    solutions to effectively harness the full potential of the new paradigm without
    colliding with the limitations of the current Web service platforms in the presence
    of trillions of additional actors (objects, precisely). In our opinion, Web of
    Things is a paradigm which goes in the right direction but is not the solution
    to the cited issues. To foster resource visibility, service discovery, object
    reputation assessment, source crowding, and service composition in a Web populated
    by people and countless things there is the necessity to strongly push towards
    solutions that exploit concepts directly derived from the sole platforms that
    currently seem to be able to effectively allow peer-to-peer exchanges among huge
    numbers of actors, i.e., Social Networks. Even if several aspects of the social
    networking among humans cannot be directly applied to the objects’ world due to
    the specific distinctive characteristics (e. g., high heterogeneity and limited
    intelligence), such a need has brought to a substantial convergence of the “Internet
    of Things” and “Social Networks” domains. Interesting ideas have recently appeared
    in the IoT arena, which testify to the interests in Social Network oriented solutions
    for the Internet of Things. People at the User Experience Lab at Ericsson Research
    started from the idea that the complexity of network solutions that underlie the
    Internet of Things are hardly understood (and mentally accepted) by all users.
    Thus, it is wise to make this complexity completely transparent during the user-thing
    interactions. Differently, the concept of “friendship” and ‘social relations’
    are understood by virtually everyone, as they are intuitive concepts. As a consequence,
    they proposed a solution to both the practical scalability and understand-ability
    issues which is simply “dressing” a network of things as if it was a social network
    [3]. They have been the first to introduce the concept of “Social Web of Things”
    and also made some applications’ prototypes. Further studies and implementations
    of this concept have been carried out around the world. An example is given by
    the work in [4], where the authors propose a Social Web of Thing Framework based
    on the Restful Web Service and Social Networks, discuss the relevant key technologies
    and use cases, and introduce a case study named MagicHome. Furthermore, even a
    prototype of a scalable architecture for a large scale social Web of Things for
    smart objects and services, named Paraimpu, has been developed [5]. In line with
    this evolutionary path, but from a different perspective, the authors of [6],
    [7] introduce the concept of Social Internet of Things. In analogy with the social
    networks of human beings, they (i) define of a notion of social relationship among
    objects, (ii) design a reference architectural model implementing a social Internet
    of Things based on codified inter-object relationships, (iii) analyze the social
    network structure, which derives from the objects interactions based on the defined
    social relationships. The examples above make us realize that the time is ripe
    for a serious reflection on the possible ways of integrating objects into social
    networks, whether they are shared with those of their owners or they are independent
    and autonomous. Aim of the present paper is to analyze the potentials of a synergic
    use of Social Networks and Internet of Things concepts towards the deployment
    of effective service platforms able to face the future challenges of a future
    world of trillions of inter-connected objects. We will illustrate the main solutions
    that are appearing in the IoT arena to let things enter the so called “social
    loop” and compare their points of strength and their weaknesses by also highlighting
    their technological requirements and architectures. This paper is organized as
    follows. In Section 2 we present the technologies behind the Web of Things as
    one of the prevailing approaches towards the integration of the objects into the
    Internet. In Section 3, we describe how this paradigm can be extended by providing
    the things with the capabilities to take part to the human social activities on
    relevant social network websites. In Section 4 we describe a complementary approach
    that allows objects to build their own social networks, so that interactions among
    them can be fostered towards the development of complex services. In Section 5
    we present the ongoing projects that come out from the concepts described in the
    previous sections. Finally, in Section 6 we draw final conclusions. 2. Web of
    Things paradigm and technologies The ongoing evolution of the Internet of Things
    towards the Web of Things (WoTs), where Web-enabled smart objects connect and
    communicate with each other by using the Web, has raised several research issues
    ranging from the adoption of the right protocol and communication paradigms to
    the choice of the most suitable architectural styles. WoT was not born as a field
    in academic research but rather as the attempt to build an ecosystem from an heterogeneous
    variety of services and products, often not conceived in a way to interoperate.
    Several efforts have focused their attention to the definition of architectural
    models and solutions, towards the use and the interconnection of Web-enabled objects,
    which exploit open protocols and well-known architectural styles, such as Representational
    State Transfer (REST) and Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) based Web services.
    In [8], an architecture is defined for the development of composite applications,
    to interconnect physical devices, on top of the open and simple standards that
    made the success of the Web (REST, XML, HTTP, or Atom). The layered architecture
    is composed as follows: • Device accessibility layer: a layer that from the application
    point of view enables consistent access to all kinds of connected objects. • Find-ability
    layer: a layer that, given an ecosystem of billions of smart things, allows for
    finding their services. • Sharing layer: although device accessibility and find-ability
    can technically allow for sharing data too, this layer is specifically designed
    to manage a social circle authentication, based on accounting and authorization
    procedures. • Composition layer: a layer that enables users to create composite
    applications on top of smart things. The overall goal of this layered architecture
    is to facilitate the integration of smart things with existing services on the
    Web and to facilitate the creation of Web applications by using smart things.
    The layers above are not directly mapped onto the ISO OSI model, but are rather
    useful to understand the foundations of WoT as an ecosystem. The next subsections
    analyze the main aspects relevant to the design choices for architecting the WoT.
    These include: the architectural style (SOAP/REST), the degree of centralization,
    the device/thing degree of accessibility to the network, and the ways in which
    data, services and objects can be composed together. 2.1. SOA(P) vs. REST The
    choice between the SOAP and the REST software architecture styles deserves a deeper
    investigation. In [9] the authors go towards the definition of an architecture
    where devices are viewed as services, in order to integrate a wide range of physical
    devices into distributed IT enterprise systems adopting a Service-Oriented Architecture
    (SOA). In a similar way, the projects WS4D7 and SOCRADES [10] apply a SOA approach
    to the context of embedded networks. Moreover, existing standards for Web Services
    (WSs), focused on embedded devices, such as Device Profile for Web Services (DPWSs)
    [11], confirm a real consensus and effort towards a SOAP-based WoT. On the other
    side, some recent research works (i.e. [12], [13], [14]) adopt REST for IoT/WoT
    architectures. According to the experience documented in [13], the programmatic
    complexity of SOAP based services is not well-suited for the end-user to create
    ad hoc applications, while the authors of [14] state that, in many cases, the
    SOAP complexity becomes superfluous whereas RESTful services can support “a la
    Mash-up” integrations. In a RESTful architecture, the main resources, such as
    entities, collections, or anything else that is worth being represented in the
    application domain, are uniquely identified by its own URI. The reference methods
    - in this case, the HTTP verbs - are mapped onto application semantics in a very
    simple and straightforward way. Many new Internet companies (see the trends in
    Fig. 1) that face the market, often prefer to provide their services through a
    RESTful API rather than a solution based on SOAP. This suggests that, probably,
    REST is more immediate and less expensive for rapid prototyping. Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. REST API vs. SOAP API in Google trends. The main advantages
    of REST web services can be summarized as it follows: • Lightweight – not a lot
    of extra XML markup. • Human Readable Results – in some cases (i.e., a GET request
    of a resource representation), RESTful services can be directly invoked by typing
    the URL in a common web browser. • Easy to build – no toolkits required. SOAP
    also has some advantages mainly related to the formal definition of service interfaces:
    • Easy to consume – clients can be automatically generated on the basis of the
    exact specification provided in the WSDL document. • Rigid – type checking adheres
    to a programming contract and XML schemas are provided for data exchanged to filter
    unacceptable inputs/outputs. • Development tools and business process definition
    (e.g., BPEL language). Even if the locution “Web Service” was often associated
    to the SOAP stack, this is not the way the Web works. Whereas SOAP is aimed at
    the next phase of Internet development defining a set of brand new specifications,
    REST is more the realization that the existing principles and protocols of the
    Web are already there to create robust Web services. Summarizing, even if the
    strong type checking of SOAP based Web services is a plus, in the context of the
    IoT, the RESTful Web Services have some advantages over SOAP such as less overhead,
    less parsing complexity, statelessness, and tighter integration with existing
    HTTP. Moreover, the RESTful protocol called CoAP [15] is similar to HTTP but re-designed
    especially for devices with small footprint and constrained computing environments.
    According to the recent studies mentioned in this paper it seems that the use
    of standards like CoAP and EXI and web paradigms are the key factors for extending
    the Internet making the vision of the IoT become reality. 2.2. Device accessibilty
    It is useful to explore how things can be classified according to their computation
    and communication capabilities. The following list provides a coarse classification:
    • Virtual Things. Like web sites, e-mail boxes and social networks, just to mention
    some. These “objects” can be easily wrapped and then referenced in a HTTP addressing
    space like resources (REST) or like services (WSDL) or they already provide such
    abstractions and interfaces. • HTTP-enabled Smart Appliances. Like wireless printers,
    networked screens, and smartphones. These are already equipped with a network
    connection and a complete HTTP stack but usually do not provide a WS stack; thus,
    it is necessary to deploy a proxy or to install a minimal WS stack in the device,
    where possible. Usually, HTTP-enabled objects are not able to receive incoming
    requests from outside. In many cases, they are deployed under firewall restrictions
    and only can act as clients. One possibility is to deploy in the middle a relay
    like YALER [16], which enables secure Web access to embedded systems behind a
    firewall/NAT/network gateway. A simple HTTP handshake makes a Web service running
    on the hidden device accessible from any HTTP client. Another option is WebSocket,
    which provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.
    The WebSocket API is being standardized by the W3C, and the WebSocket protocol
    has been standardized by the IETF as RFC 6455. • Internet-enabled Things that
    are not equipped with a complete HTTP stack but can still communicate at the TCP/IP
    or UDP/IP level. For those objects it is straightforward to build a HTTP wrapper
    and a WS stack as a proxy. A viable protocol alternative to HTTP is CoAP [15].
    CoAP could be viewed as a compression or redesign of HTTP by taking power, memory,
    and computation constraints into account. Just like HTTP, which is designed as
    a transfer protocol for traditional web media content, CoAP is redesigned as a
    transfer protocol for devices to implement interoperations. • Network-enabled
    Things that cannot communicate over IP networks, but still can communicate with
    different protocols like ZigBee, Bluetooth or X10. For those objects a proxy can
    be deployed to present them in the HTTP addressing space, by also using WS technology
    standards. A viable solution to extend IP also to small devices that usually are
    not equipped with IP-stack is 6LoWPAN [17]. • Things not digitally enabled, bare
    physical objects. For these objects a digital counterpart must be built and published
    online. RFID or barcode sticks can be used to interface these objects with devices
    and networks. 2.3. Centralized vs. decentralized Decentralized architectures have
    a number of theoretical advantages, such as single-point-of-failure robustness
    and privacy/anonymity enforcing capability. When analyzing the Web, one discovers
    that (i) the degree of decentralization is quite low, (ii) the prominent topology
    is client–server, and (iii) even if P2P networks have gained popularity in some
    application areas, the idea to move computation at the boundaries of the Internet
    is more a niche than a main stream. The distinction between client–server and
    P2P architectures is no longer a technological distinction, but a matter of governance.
    The so-called “clouds” often adopt their own solutions of P2P load-balancing and
    fault tolerance, but the control is centralized in the hands of one provider.
    Cloud computing and Software-as-a-Service demonstrate that large IT companies
    are concentrating computation inside large globally distributed infrastructures;
    thus, transforming personal computing in a mere user interface to remote computing
    services. Also, in the new field of Internet-enabled objects, we foresee that
    P2P connections between objects are unlikely to occur unless hard real-time and
    multimedia communications are involved. A centralized online service can speak
    multiple protocols and data formats on top of HTTP and can act as a broker to
    let services meet in a logical space; it can be a proxy of data coming from sources
    and can be a relay of data to consumer services; moreover, it can make data format
    adaptation where required. In other words, it can operate at all the layers described
    above, from device accessibility to composition. In a centralized WoT tool the
    workload is put at the extreme. Some applications need to have samples on every
    second, and even only one thousand sensors connected to a central server would
    produce 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 = 86400000 events per day. The load is structured
    in many small HTTP POST messages with a keep-alive connection. The requirements
    for a cloud-based Web of Things architecture (see Fig. 2) can be summarized as
    it follows: • C10 K+[18] capable web servers (C10 K + stands for 10,000 or more
    HTTP connections handled simultaneously, i.e. non-blocking servers that do not
    map every connection to a system thread); • database engine able to be horizontally
    partitioned over a grid of machines in a transparent way (sharding); • event handling
    and data processing delegated to a pool of worker processes distributed among
    multiple processors and even different machines. Download : Download full-size

    but insightful benchmark between a non-blocking web server, like Nginx, versus
    a thread-based server, like Apache, is presented. The plots show (Fig. 3, Fig.
    4) how the throughput of Nginx are still high even with a large number of connections
    and with a very low memory usage. Nevertheless, the WoT system designer must consider
    that to fully gain an advantage from a non-blocking Web server, all the components
    in the backend must be designed to be non-blocking as well. Download : Download

    (threaded) web servers [19]. 2.4. Smart objects in service orchestrations A big
    issue in composing objects/services to form an application logic, is how to ensure
    that data coming from a data source can be properly read and processed by a recipient
    data sink. The intuitive, but not widely practicable solution, is to adopt a rigorous
    set of data schemas shared by all participants. In this way connections could
    be handled with no pains because every object that consumes data is able to receive
    and to decide what to do with the data. Unfortunately, having a common set of
    data types defined and shared for all interconnected objects is far to be realistic.
    Objects are built from different manufacturers for vertical applications, often
    inside walled gardens or with small capabilities to interoperate with external
    entities. A more realistic assumption is to consider objects able to produce data
    in a format among those commonly encapsulated into HTTP messages. So we can expect
    that a data source can push a string containing either numbers or alphanumeric
    values, or more structured data like JSON objects or XML instances. As an example,
    Paraimpu [20] implements the concept of mapping as a couple of expressions in
    the form of (cond, repl), where cond is a boolean expression while the repl expression
    is a valid instance of the data type expected by the sink (the actuator). This
    approach can be subsumed in the more general IF-THEN paradigm applied to events,
    data and actions in the IoT. The online service called IFTTT (IF This Than That),
    although initially conceived for social networks and not for physical mashups,
    is the immediate proof-of-concept of how this mechanism can work. Also other sensor
    data collectors like COSM (former Pachube) implements the concept of trigger (IF
    condition on datum THEN post datum on URL). A more versatile approach is to use
    business process definition to declare a more complex composition logic. In the
    case of SOAP-based WoT mashups, interactions can be described in two ways: executable
    processes and abstract processes. Both can be modeled by BPEL. Executable processes
    model the actual behavior of a participant as interactions, while abstract processes
    describe the observable behavior and/or process template. BPEL extends the WS-∗
    interaction model to enable business transactions. BPEL defines an interoperable
    composition model that enables the extension of automated process integration
    both within and between businesses. Pintus et al. [21] also propose a SOA framework
    where smart things are described by using the WSDL standard, while logical connections
    between smart things are modeled as web services orchestrations by using the BPEL
    language. The availability of an API to be consumed by clients, of course, opens
    also the possibility to write third-party programs or scripts in arbitrary programming
    languages and build applications as a result of the composition of data coming
    from source objects, processed and transformed into actions for other smart objects.
    3. Adding the social aspect to WoT To date, IoT has been conceived as a top-down
    technology that silently takes the control of objects in a machine-to-machine
    internetworking with large benefit for logistics, manufacturing, and business
    productivity. On the other hand, the point we stress here is that for IoT/WoT
    to acquire some socialization value, end-users should be enabled to be active
    and creative in the definition of new relationships where smart things become
    either an instrument or a toy to share or to play with collaboratively. In this
    respect, it is important to provide users with enabling platforms, based on known
    and understandable metaphors, to manage, control and personalize the composition
    between sensor data and actions in the real life. In order to enable a wide adoption
    of WoT in all sectors of the society, the WoT architecture and its protocols should
    motivate every citizens to contribute to a growing number of devices and smart
    objects in order to build new streams of information available to the community.
    We can identify at least two generic use cases. The first one is the participatory
    sensing and the second one is the “device in a circle”. Participatory sensing
    applications use data of mobile sensor nodes collected in collaboration with the
    device owner. With the right tools, community groups may participate in campaigns
    to collect data on highly-focused topics, such as traffic patterns, pollution-safe
    routes for school buses, without waiting for an institutional body or private
    agency to perform the detection. For example, the NoiseTube project [22], started
    in 2008 at the Sony Computer Science Lab in Paris and currently hosted by the
    BrusSense Team at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, proposes a participative approach
    for monitoring noise pollution by involving the general public. For users to become
    active in the bottom-up construction of a participatory sensing scenario, aspects
    like trust, reputation, control of distributed devices and tracking of information
    flows must be appropriately adjusted to control what is happening with the information
    and devices contributed. The identities of users are not harvested and should
    be kept anonymous while on the other hands the management of reputation of the
    data produced must be deployed to allow the participatory sensing to become effective
    and discard malicious or irrelevant data. In the “device in the social circle”
    use case the social-ability is a key element to share and collaboratively use
    the smart things in the Web. Device accessibility layer and findability layer
    can technically allow sharing as well, but to manage physical objects in a social
    circle, features like authentication, accounting and authorization need to be
    properly designed and implemented. Integrating smart objects and main-stream social
    networks is another key aspect. Every WoT system who aims to become popular and
    adopted by users, should integrate and communicate with social media in some way.
    In some extent, existing social media are the precursor of the future social IoT
    because they have already faced a number of issues like privacy concerns, content
    moderation, insights visualization and so forth. The integration of Social media
    and Web of Things can occur in many ways: • User login/authentication: users can
    access a system by using existing credentials without building a brand new profile.
    Thanks to the Oauth protocol, the user is redirected to her/his preferred social
    tool to perform the login. This leads to the immediate benefit to have contacts/friends
    imported in the new system. In this way, it would be possible for a generic WoT
    site to connect its users with their Facebook or Twitter counterparts. • Social
    network as monitoring tool, for instance the IoT portal [23]: it allows users
    to quickly connect sensors and actuators to the system, and then create dashboard
    visualizations as Facebook applications. These applications allow users to share
    and monitor sensed data and control actuators in the real world. • Sensors/actuators:
    a social entity, such as user’s Facebook wall and the Twitter flow associated
    to an hashtag, can be considered a sensor or an actuator (or both) just like physical
    things in the implementation of virtual-to-physical mashups. For instance, the
    “device in the circle” could be a set of parking sensors and the social circle
    could be the list containing the customers’ contacts of a restaurant keeper. As
    an example, the restaurant manager can build a geographical selection of parking
    sensors in the neighborhood saving this selection as a datasource in her work
    space called “parkingSlots”. Then she can create a link between the selected datasource
    and her customer list using for instance his Facebook profile. In so doing, her
    customers will receive the number of free slots directly on their mobile or PC
    and decide to go there by car or by other means. As dual example, the “device
    in the circle” can be a device shared and controlled by means of social media,
    like for example, a multimedia installation, even on a large scale (e.g., night-time
    lighting of a skyscraper). The social circle may be the set of users of a certain
    social network that post messages to a certain topic (for example, a topic with
    a hash tag on twitter). Analytics based on text recognition (or even mood recognition)
    on tweets may trigger different actions on the installation (for example, the
    ignition with certain colors or with certain choreography). • The social dimension
    is useful for device/thing find-ability: the navigability of users’ profiles enables
    to discover objects shared by friends, but also to find new friends and new devices/things.
    4. Evolution of social Internet of Things 4.1. Objects that handle social relationships
    In the IoT, everything real becomes virtual, which means that each person and
    thing has a locatable, addressable, and readable counterpart on the Internet.
    These virtual entities can produce and consume services and collaborate toward
    a common goal. The car driver might know about the status of her car and of the
    roads towards her destination, thanks to the autonomous communications of the
    sensors and actuators in her car with those installed in other vehicles and along
    the road. The embedded system in a swimming pool could share its state with other
    virtual entities. All these scenarios are possible with an intense interaction
    between objects and related services, enabling the most powerful and fascinating
    applications. For instance, in [24] the authors introduce the idea of objects
    able to participate in conversations that were previously only available to humans.
    Those envisioned are objects aware of dynamic community structures, thus being
    able to develop a spontaneous networking infrastructure based on the information
    to be disseminated other than information on the objects themselves. Analogously,
    the research activities reported in [25] consider that, being things involved
    into the network together with people, social networks can be built based on the
    Internet of Things and are meaningful to investigate the relations and evolution
    of objects in IoT. Again, IoT and social network technologies and concepts are
    jointly exploited towards the development of tools that can make people’s lives
    easier. This time the idea is to use social networking elements in the Internet
    of Things to allow objects to autonomously establish social relationships. The
    driving motivation is that a social-oriented approach is expected to put forward
    the discovery, selection and composition of services and information provided
    by distributed objects and networks that have access to the physical world. The
    proposed social-oriented approach is characterized by the capabilities of the
    objects to autonomously establish social relationships of different kinds [24],
    [26], [7]. Within the resulting object social network, a key objective will be
    to publish information and services, find them, and discover novel resources to
    support the implementation of complex services and applications. This can be achieved
    in a trusty and efficient way by navigating a social network of “friend” objects,
    instead of relying on typical Internet discovery tools that cannot scale to billions
    of future devices. Indeed, social networking concepts have proven to be of great
    importance for handling the relationships among humans and, in the same way, these
    are expected to have a great impact on the management of services in the IoT.
    Specifically, in [7] the Social Internet of Things (SIoTs) has been proposed.
    According to this model, a set of forms of socialization among objects are foreseen
    as shown in Fig. 5. The parental object relationship is defined among similar
    objects, built in the same period by the same manufacturer (the role of family
    is played by the production batch). Moreover, objects can establish co-location
    object relationship and co-work object relationship, like humans do when they
    share personal (e.g., cohabitation) or public (e.g., work) experiences. A further
    type of relationship is defined for objects owned by the same user (mobile phones,
    game consoles, etc.), which is named ownership object relationship. The last relationship
    is established when objects come into contact, sporadically or continuously, for
    reasons purely related to relations among their owners (e.g., devices/sensors
    belonging to friends); it is named social object relationship. These relationships
    are created and updated on the basis of the objects features (such as: object
    type, computational power, mobility capabilities, brand) and activity (frequency
    in meeting the other objects, mainly). The parental and ownership relationships
    are determined by just the static characteristics of the object (or slowly varying
    characteristics): type, brand, ownership. The others are determined by the movement
    of the object and by the other nodes it encounters. The relationships’ management
    is implemented in the cloud, in the object gateways, and in the objects themselves,
    if capable of supporting the relevant logic. Clearly, the configuration of these
    functionalities is controlled by the object owner; accordingly, the resulting
    links are asymmetrical. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Sketch of
    the five types of relationships defined in the SIoT paradigm. To manage the resulting
    network and relationships, the foreseen SIoT architecture is made of four major
    components (among others). The Relationship management introduces into the SIoT
    the intelligence that allows objects to start, update, and terminate relationships.
    The selection of which friendship to accept is based on human control settings.
    Service discovery is finalized to find which objects can provide the required
    service in the same way humans seek for friendships and information. Indeed, to
    discover the service, the object queries its social relationship network. Service
    composition enables the interaction among objects. The service discovery exploits
    the object relationships to find the desired service, which is then activated
    by this component. Both a reactive and a proactive approach to service composition
    are envisaged. This component will also include the functionality of crowd information
    processing, to process the information obtained from different objects and obtain
    the most reliable answer to a query on the basis of different visions. Trustworthiness
    management is aimed at understanding how the information provided by other members
    has to be processed. 4.2. The SIoT architecture In [6], a possible SIoT architecture
    has been proposed, which follows the simple three-layer architectural model for
    IoT. In this model, the sensing layer is devoted to data acquisition and node
    collaboration in short-range and local networks. The network layer is aimed at
    transferring data across different networks. Finally, the application layer is
    where the IoT applications are deployed together with the middleware functionalities.
    The application layer is the key part in the SIoT, making this architectural proposal
    distinctive with respect to alternative solutions. It consists of three sub-layers,
    with the base sub-layer devoted to the database for the storage and management
    of the data and relevant descriptors, which record the social member profiles
    and their relationships, as well as the activities carried out by the objects
    in the real and virtual worlds. The component sub-layer works on top of the base
    sub-layer and implements the functionalities described in the previous subsection,
    i.e., relationship management, service discovery, service composition, trustworthiness
    management. The application layer is where the application are located, relying
    on the social-oriented behavior of the objects. With the intent to highlight the
    distinctive features of the SIoT architecture, in Fig. 6 we provide a mapping
    of the major SIoT components into the reference model provided in [27] by the
    IoT-A European research project, which represents a major effort in defining a
    reference architecture for the existing and future IoT solutions. In this figure,
    we show the five functional layers with the main functionalities in gray-colored
    boxes. In the upper layer are located the applications that are built on top of
    an implementation of the IoT-A architecture. This represents instances of the
    process execution and service orchestration, which indeed is used to combine different
    services (also provided by different system implementations) to implement complex
    services. The relevant APIs are also a key part of this layer. The virtual entity
    (VE) and information is the layer that maintains and organizes information related
    to physical entities, enabling search for services exposing resources associated
    to physical entities. Accordingly, it is intended to response to queries about
    a particular physical entity by providing with addresses of the service related
    to the physical entity. The lower layer, i.e., the IoT service and resource, links
    specific services to the related resources. It also notifies application software
    and services about events related to resources and corresponding physical entities.
    The Device connectivity and communication layer provides the set of methods and
    primitives for device connectivity and communication. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 6. Major functionalities of the SIoT system (in blue color) in the
    IoT-A reference architecture. In Fig. 6, we have highlighted the main features
    of the SIoT solution. At the second layer, the SIoT system may require the extension
    of the object descriptions to support the creation and management of the social-oriented
    behavior and relationships, such as: owner ID; object position, which can be changing
    over the time depending on the object mobility features; power supply status,
    that defines whether the object is either battery-powered (and the battery power
    level is provided), socket-connected (and whether is currently connected or not),
    or it harvests power from the environment; amount of traffic generated in terms
    of number of connections and overall bit-rate. The objects could also be grouped
    into different classes, depending on their main characteristics, such as mobility,
    computational and communication capabilities, interfaces, sensing capabilities,
    power supply. At the third layer, the major part of the SIoT functionalities needs
    to be introduced. These also call for the definition of specific ontologies and
    semantic engines. The ontologies are used to represent a semantic view of the
    social activities, which is extracted through appropriate semantic engines. The
    objective is to provide a machine interpretable environment for representing attributes
    and operations of the IoT devices. Many works have already been conducted in this
    area, which could be partially used in the SIoT scenario, e.g., Ontology Web Language
    for Services (OWL-S) model, which has already been used as the basis of a semantic
    service modeling framework for the IoT [28], [29]. Accordingly, services are used
    as an interface that represents the IoT resources (i.e., the physical world devices)
    and provide an access to the functions and capabilities of these resources. Ontologies
    to manage and control heterogeneous systems have also been investigated in [27].
    This highlights that an automatic discovery will be impossible without ontological
    classification and semantic annotation processes. In [30], the importance of the
    ontology has been analyzed from a social network perspective as a format to represent
    the object information which is relevant to end users. Other approaches for creating
    semantic service descriptions could be used as described in [31]. These include:
    Semantic Annotations for WSDL (SAWSDL), Unified Service Description Language (USDL),
    Web Service Modelling Language (WSML), Web Service Modelling Ontology (WSMO),
    and Semantic Annotations for Representational State Transfer SA-REST [32]. The
    relationship management module is the one responsible to establish, update, and
    terminate the relationships among the objects in their virtual representation.
    It also elaborates the social network to facilitate the discovery of the services
    by identifying different clusters of resource relationships. Possible approaches
    are to make use of similarity measures and multi-scale renormalization and synergetic
    – self organization techniques. These should be embodied into the SIoT learners
    and adaptors of virtual resources following the cognitive networks paradigm. Consequently,
    an object social graph is built with objects that are linked by edges representing
    the established relationships, each one weighted by its computed degrees. This
    module is also responsible for calculating several topological features of the
    resource social graph such as: between-ness, closeness, degree/eigenvector hubs
    and authorities centrality measures. This allows for determining the most “central”
    nodes/resources, which is a key activity because the identified “central” nodes/resources
    will be those that control the data flows in SIoT and influence the rest of nodes/resources.
    By doing so, the “central” nodes will be marked as landmarks, representative for
    their local neighborhood. The service discovery functionality is key in the third
    layer, since it is needed to find which objects can provide a service requested
    in the target application. This functionality should be implemented into the SIoT
    system by following the rules the humans adopt to seek for friendships and for
    any information in the social networking services. The discovery will be guided
    by the object social graph as described above. The trust management module is
    the one responsible to address the inherent risks in transactions with no prior
    experience with regard to the reputation of every other node. In doing this, it
    exploits the resource social graph to build a reputation-based trust mechanism
    for the IoT that can effectively deal with certain types of malicious behavior
    that intend to mislead other nodes [33]. In such a scenario, two possible models
    for the implementation of the Trustworthiness management can be followed. One
    is the subjective trustworthiness, derived from a social point of view, where
    each node computes the trustworthiness of its friends on the basis of its own
    experience and on the basis of its friends’ experiences. If two nodes are not
    friends, then the trustworthiness is calculated by word of mouth through a chain
    of friendships. The other is the objective trustworthiness, obtained from P2P
    scenarios, where the information about each node is distributed and stored by
    making use of a DHT (Distributed Hash Table) structure. This information is visible
    to every node but is only managed by special nodes that we call Pre-Trusted Objects
    (PTOs). Finally, the service composition component enables the interaction between
    services provided by different objects to achieve complex services and applications.
    Most of the time, the interaction is related to an object that wishes either to
    retrieve an information about the real world or to find a specific service provided
    by another object. In fact, the main potential we see in deploying SIoT is its
    capability to foster such an information retrieval. 5. On-going projects The projects
    listed here bring together the technological aspects, related to the functionality
    offered by the so-called smart objects, with the social aspects. Projects in this
    list mainly fall into one of the three scenarios emerged from the previous sections:
    participatory sensing, device-in-the-circle, and devices-that-socialize. The tools
    to compose and build personalized and social application that merges together
    data from different sources belong to a field in continuous evolution and such
    tools are often the basis for other projects: they are mainly cloud-based because
    the cloud is always there, up and running, it is reachable from everywhere, and
    a large amount of application complexity can be moved from the target devices
    to the cloud components. Among these tools are: Ninja Blocks [34], IFTTT [35]
    and Paraimpu [36]. Ninja Blocks is a project started in 2012 from the crowdfunding
    platform Kickstarter.com. Ninja Blocks are cloud-based devices that can sense
    their environment and can act by controlling lights, power sockets, and other
    actuators. The system provides a tool to compose actions and sensing with common
    social web sites like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram. Among the sensors there is
    also a camera. IFTTT is a San Francisco based startup whose service enables customers
    to create and share within minutes very simple applications that fit the “if this
    then that” rule. An example of application can be IF “someone tags me on Facebook
    picture” then “put the picture on my Dropbox”. IFTTT was initially conceived for
    Internet services and social media and only later, in June 2012, the service crossed
    over to the physical world by integrating with Belkin WeMo [37] devices allowing
    IFTTT rules to compose social media events with home automation. Paraimpu is a
    cloud-based research prototype from CRS4, which provides the functionality to
    manage smart Things and to compose them with services already on the Web to create
    personalized applications. Common DIY (Do It Yourself) boards like Arduino, can
    be easily integrated as the system automatically generates the code for these
    boards to produce/receive data. Paraimpu allows people to share smart things and
    devices in their social circle enabling social physical-virtual Web mash-ups.
    The availability of such tools is fostering the development of personalized and
    interesting installation. At the moment these are generated by a small niche of
    geeks and early adopters but, to some extent, pave the way for a future diffusion
    and adoption of smart things in everyday social life. Among the installations,
    here are reported three “device-in-the-circle” cases: • Jardimpu [38] (based on
    Arduino and Paraimpu) is an automated irrigation system based on the sensing of
    temperature, humidity, soil moisture, light conditions, which is then used to
    control the level of water in some plant’s saucers (e.g. Dionaea Muscipula). This
    system is not an absolute novelty in the field of sensors-based garden irrigation,
    but it is one of the first examples of “social” gardening: people in the social
    circle can activate the drippers, can see plants in a live streaming, and can
    monitor their parameters. • TLight is a permanent installation created by the
    Quit group [39] and connected to the web thanks to Paraimpu, which allows everyone
    to change the color tones and the behavior of the lights placed on the top of
    the big glass tower of the T-Hotel in Cagliari. To interact with the lights, a
    twitter user can post a message on with hashtag:#thotel followed by any phrase
    containing one of the following words: red, blue, green, orange, yellow, white,
    cyan, purple, wave, different, couple, full, pulse e random. • Natural Fuse [40]
    is a social IoT game based on COSM [41]. Participants get a Natural Fuse unit
    which consists of a houseplant and a power socket. The amount of power available
    to the socket is limited by the capacity of the plant to offset the carbon footprint
    of the energy expended. If people cooperate on energy expenditure then the plants
    thrive (and everyone may use more energy). But if people do not cooperate, then
    the network starts to randomly kill plants. The electricity depends on the plants
    just as the plants depend on the electricity. The work carried on in the field
    of Social Web of Things by Ericsson also deserves a citation as “devices-that-socialize”
    use case. Researchers at Ericsson in fact are working on methods for connecting
    device into a social media platform for nodes that are not people. Recently they
    have presented at the Connected House exhibit, a social network interface that
    linked all of the different connected nodes in a home as well as trusted points
    in the public sphere. Another very popular project is Waze. Waze is a company
    based on Israel which developed a service called social-GPS. The service is aimed
    at avoid traffic, and it is based on a large community spread all over the world.
    It allows, through a smart phone equipped with GPS, to share real-time traffic
    information and help everyone to save time and fuel. Even if it does not make
    use of any exotic hardware but it totally relies on the smartphone functionalities,
    it is a perfect example of tool for participatory sensing. At the same time, it
    is also a case of “device-in-the-circle” because the connection with Facebook
    allows participants to see their friends on the map to coordinate arrival times
    to give or get rides or meet up with other participants. In the field of Smart
    Cities, the project CityScripts [42] is an experiment built on top of the SmartSantander
    [43] platform (with a base of 12,000 urban sensors deployed in the city of Santander).
    The CityScripts project is aimed at integrating and experimenting a Web of Things
    scenario in which sensors and actuators in the city have a digital counterpart
    and can be used by citizens to compose personal applications integrating sensor
    data with social networks and other online data sources. 6. Conclusions In this
    paper, we have reviewed the main approaches followed during the last years to
    make objects part of the human social loop and grant them a role within the human
    social network sites. This objective has been achieved by extending the paradigm
    of Web of Things to give things the capabilities to automatically post information
    on the social network sites and to be reached through these as well. A complementary
    approach is the one according to which objects have their own social network,
    which is independent from those of the humans but still controlled by them (albeit
    progressively less, as technologies progresses). The two approaches can be combined
    so that part of the information and actions of relevance for one social network
    type, that is the one where humans rule, can be exported/imported to/into the
    other one, where objects rule. Certainly, the objective of these approaches is
    to address the complexity in the management of the trillions of objects that will
    be connected to the network in a couple of years and to exploit their major potentialities.
    Through the presented survey of ongoing projects, we learned that the implementations
    deployed so far are limited in their potentialities. These only focus on specific
    applications and do not converge on an interoperable platform where social networking
    concepts are adopted as the major principles that drive the object interactions.

    An infrastructure for Smart City has to be geographically and functionally extensible,
    as it requires both to grow up with the physical environment and to meet the increasing

    an IoT-based platform for the development of general cyber–physical systems suitable
    for the design and implementation of smart city services and applications. As
    distinguishing features, the iSapiens platform implements the edge computing paradigm
    through both the exploitation of the agent metaphor and a distributed network
    of computing nodes directly scattered in the urban environment. The platform promotes
    the dynamic deployment of new computing nodes as well as software agents for addressing
    geographical and functional extensibility. iSapiens provides a set of abstractions
    suitable to hide the heterogeneity of the physical sensing/actuator devices embedded
    in the system, and to support the development of complex applications. The paper
    also furnishes a set of methodological guidelines exploitable for the design and
    implementation of smart city applications by properly using iSapiens. As a significant

    A Smart City is an urban environment made smart by using ICT technologies, so
    as to improve the quality of life of the inhabitants and the efficiency of the
    city infrastructures, and provide enhanced services to citizens [1]. A lot of
    applications are compliant with the smart city vision and comprehend structural
    health of buildings, waste management, air quality and noise monitoring, traffic
    congestion management, city energy consumption optimization, smart parking, smart
    lighting, automation and salubrity of public buildings, urban drainage systems,
    emergency detection and so forth [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]. The realization
    of Smart City is a hot topic in the current research landscape [8], [9], and many
    city administrations are interested in solutions for enhancing their cities with
    smart services. The European Union is also supporting a big amount of projects
    on Smart Cities1 and several cities around the world are boosting politics to
    exploit smart technologies. Valuable examples in this direction are the cities
    of Amsterdam,2 San Francisco,3 Barcelona,4 and Copenhagen5 that are creating versatile
    ecosystems for comprehensive Smart Cities realization. Smart Cities development
    introduces several challenges, which are shared with the Internet of Things, Cyber–Physical
    Systems, and Smart Environments [10], [11], [12], [13]. Such challenges include
    issues like the integration of heterogeneous systems and technologies, scalability,
    fault tolerance, system maintenance [14], geographical and functional extensibility.
    In particular, geographical extensibility refers to the problem of the dynamic
    extension of existing Smart City services to areas not previously covered, or
    to new urban areas (e.g., related to the city growth), while functional extensibility
    refers to the problem of adding new services to the set of the existing ones.
    Despite the big interest around Smart Cities, the currently adopted solutions
    lack in design and development guidelines, approaches for the integration of heterogeneous
    services and infrastructures, as well as ICT solutions allowing a holistic Smart
    City development. Furthermore, even though urban environments are naturally distributed,
    most of the actual Smart City implementations relies on centralized approaches,
    where a big amount of data flow in a common data center that processes them and
    provides services to the citizens, or schedules actuations on physical infrastructures
    [8]. Finally, many realized services are developed as independent monolithic blocks,
    and the interaction among them is not considered.2 In this paper it is argued
    that benefits arise from the exploitation of the edge (fog) computing paradigm
    [15], [16], [17]. The edge computing paradigm has the aim to push the computation
    on acquired data away from the core of data centers to the outer edges of a network,
    close to the data sources. Side benefits of such computing paradigm include: (i)
    a faster reactivity to events which can be managed where they occur, (ii) a better
    exploitation of communication bandwidth, as data are locally processed and only
    the aggregated required information are propagated across the system, (iii) an
    increase of reliability and scalability, since the paradigm fosters the use of
    distributed algorithms. The contributions of the paper are manifold. Firstly,
    the iSapiens platform is proposed [18] as an agent-based [19], [20], [21] distributed
    platform for the management of a network of computing nodes spread over a city
    area. In iSapiens, the computation is executed both on the edge of the network,
    by the agents residing in each computational node, and in the Cloud for computation
    demanding tasks. The iSapiens platform is able to manage physical devices (i.e.,
    sensors, actuators, or even complex objects) connected to its network nodes so
    as to hide their heterogeneity and specific communication protocols. As a second
    contribution, a set of design guidelines are provided which favors the realization
    of scalable and dynamically-extensible Smart City services. Moreover, the paper
    discusses about the advantages in using iSapiens, which provides important benefits
    such as extensibility, distributed computing, fault tolerance, heterogeneity management,
    and support for hardware/software maintenance. As a final contribution, the paper
    shows the realization of a Smart City prototype in the city of Cosenza (Italy),
    which provides decentralized urban intelligence services to citizens. The developed
    Smart City highlights how the proposed platform and guidelines can be applied
    for an effective Smart City prototyping. Geographical and functional extensibility
    issues are also taken into account within the case study. The rest of the paper
    is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses some related works in the context
    of Smart City; Section 3 describes the iSapiens platform and provides the methodological
    guidelines for the design of smart city services. Such Section also discusses
    about the benefits of the iSapiens platform coupled with the provided design guidelines;
    Section 4 shows the design and the realization of the Cosenza Smart Street. Finally,
    conclusions are drawn and the directions of ongoing work are portrayed. 2. Related
    work Cyber–Physical Systems and Smart Environments have been widely studied in
    literature so far [12], [22]. The most important goal of such systems is the improvement
    of the user experience in traditional environments under different points of view.
    In the context of urban environments, there is a growing number of Smart Cities
    whose final aim is to make an optimized use of the public resources, together
    with increasing the quality of the offered services still reducing the operational
    costs that the public administrations should sustain [8]. Such systems help citizens
    in a clever usage of their own cities. Smart Cities are usually considered as
    part of the so called Urban Internet of Things [23], which is the part of the
    Internet of Things that has been designed to support the Smart City realization
    and maintenance. Smart Cities and Smart City infrastructures have actually been
    already formalized [1], [24]. Anyway, real Smart City implementations are still
    not really comprehensive. The European Union is supporting a big amount of projects
    on the Smart Cities and several cities are encouraging politics to integrate smart
    technologies into the city to make it more eco-friendly and energy-efficient.
    Very good examples in this direction are the cities of Amsterdam, San Francisco,
    Barcelona, and Copenhagen that are creating ecosystems for the realization of
    comprehensive smart cities. Though the above presented cases are very positive
    examples, they all are represented by a plethora of applications that are not
    coordinated by a single platform which can allow the integration of the knowledge
    gathered from all the deployed sensors/systems. Several works in literature propose
    the integration of systems to produce whole smart cities. The paper in [25] presents
    the Oulu Smart City.6 Its first aim is to provide Oulu citizens with Wi-Fi connection
    and, through the tracking of the people in the city, to monitor pedestrian and
    vehicular flows. Even though the Oulu smart city presents a good design, it should
    be improved by the addition of services based on other sensing/actuation capabilities
    across the streets. In [26] authors have presented a framework for the implementation
    of information services to monitor public areas and infrastructures. In particular,
    they have shown a testbed on a subway scenario with the objective of (i) demonstrating
    that their system can flexibly help in the detection of anomalous events and (ii)
    simplifying communications in case of emergency. They realized a multi-technology
    architecture that collects data from various devices to infer high level knowledge
    (for emergency reason). The proposed framework is valuable, but practical examples
    are not satisfying and its re-use in different smart city scenarios has to be
    analyzed. In [9] authors integrate sensor nodes with the street lights around
    Cambridge to have powered nodes which sample multiple environmental sensors. They
    present a platform to reprogram and collect data through such sensor nodes. Anyway,
    authors do not talk about high level analysis of the gathered data. They only
    implement their case study for collection purposes. Several platforms for the
    realization of Smart Cities have been already implemented. Authors of [8] propose
    a general reference framework for the design of an urban IoT. It is based on a
    centralized architecture which exposes a set of web services. A real case study
    involving such framework has been implemented in Padova (Italy) where nodes have
    been deployed to monitor temperature, humidity, light, and benzene concentration
    in the air. Although this is a valuable example of both Smart City platform and
    case study, the proposed centralized architecture can present an extensibility
    problem for big cities. In [27] the SmartSantander project is presented, which
    is part of the Future Internet Research and Experimentation initiative of the
    European Commission. The project had the aim to implement a large scale network
    in the city of Santander to monitor environment pollution (air quality, noise
    levels and luminosity levels), outdoor parking, and automated irrigation systems.
    The architecture implemented presents three layers: IoT nodes, Gateways, and Server.
    Here the Server is the centralized data collector which offers services. Although
    the Smart City presents a very large case study, the centralized and not really
    structured architecture can provide some extensibility/maintenance problems. Moreover,
    here the data elaboration on the distributed nodes, with all the benefits that
    it can provide, is limited. The work in [28] introduces Sentilo, which is an open
    source IoT platform designed to manage sensors and actuators in the Smart Cities.
    Authors claim that Sentilo can be used for any city looking for openness and easy
    interoperability. Such platform uses Cloud Computing and Big Data tools to collect,
    store, and elaborate data from distributed sensors so providing Smart City extensibility.
    It has been sponsored by the Barcelona City Council and, after the deployment
    in Spain, its code has been released as open source. A drawback of such platform
    is the lack of computing on the edge of the platform to locally analyze the data
    from the city. Authors of [29] introduce an IoT middleware that has been implemented
    in the context of the EPIC (European Platform for Intelligent Cities) project.
    The proposed middleware has been designed to address in Smart Cities the issues
    regarding heterogeneity, interoperability, extensibility, and (re)configurability.
    Even though such middleware tackles important issues for Smart Cities, it does
    not consider (as many platforms in this area) the design of decentralized pre-processing
    components for computing and aggregating data on the edge. In [30], [31] a Smart
    City platform based on Big Data analysis to achieve extensibility is introduced.
    The proposed architecture provides three layers that have been implemented to
    (i) collect, analyze, and filter data; (ii) aggregate data to infer knowledge;
    (iii) provide users with an interface to gather elaborated data. Although very
    useful, such platform does not provide a low layer allowing the gathering of data
    from sensors distributed in a Smart City, so it needs to be built over another
    middleware that allows the sensors (actuators) management. Given the above analysis
    of the state of the art, it emerges the lack of a distributed platform and design
    guidelines for the comprehensive and systematic realization of reactive, fault
    tolerant, and extensible Smart City applications. To address such issues, this
    paper presents iSapiens as an agent-based platform providing useful features for
    designing and implementing distributed cyber–physical systems and smart environments.
    3. iSapiens: a platform for Smart Cities iSapiens is an agent-based platform providing
    useful features for designing and implementing distributed cyber–physical systems
    [3], [32], [33] and smart environments [18], [34], [35], [36], [37] whose functionalities
    are realized by exploiting edge computing [15], internet of things [10], [38]
    and out-of-the-edge computing services. Such systems are characterized by the
    combined exploitation of software components with heterogeneous physical devices
    and protocols, so as to furnish final users with high level services and/or to
    enhance the behaviors of a specific environment. In the following subsections
    a description of the iSapiens platform is provided together with an introduction
    to the issues related to the design of smart city applications. 3.1. The iSapiens
    platform The iSapiens platform (see Fig. 1) relies on two main abstractions: Virtual
    Objects (VOs) and Agents. VOs are used to abstract and manage physical objects,
    hiding the heterogeneity of devices and protocols, and complying with the Internet
    of Things vision. Services and enhanced behaviors are obtained by exploiting software
    agents which execute in computational nodes close to the physical devices they
    have to control, thus implementing edge computation and enabling online analytics.
    To offer final services, agents can also exploit out-of-the-edge services, both
    developed for a specific application or third party provided. Such services can
    include offline analytics, such as predictive analysis, machine learning, and
    data mining or services requiring a centralized view of the whole system. From
    an architectural point of view, the platform is mainly composed by an in-network
    computing layer and a virtualization layer. The former contains the Agent Server
    that provides the runtime support for the agents execution. The latter consists
    of the Virtual Object Containers which allow the management of VOs. The agent
    server and the virtual object container together constitute an iSapiens server.
    An iSapiens server is allocated for execution on a dedicated computational node.
    The iSapiens platform allows the realization of distributed applications consisting
    of a set of interacting agents running on a set of computational nodes. Such nodes
    are scattered in the environment which has to be controlled or enhanced. All the
    computing nodes are supplied with a set of devices, such as sensors, actuators
    or other more complex (smart) objects. The virtual object container of a given
    node hosts all the VOs abstracting the devices directly connected to the node.
    The agents running in a node can exploit all the functionalities offered by the
    local VOs. Each component, either a device, a VO, an agent, or a whole computing
    node can be dynamically removed from, added into or updated to a running system.
    This important feature fosters application scalability and extendibility. All
    together, the iSapiens servers, that are hosted in the computing nodes deployed
    in the network, constitute the distributed iSapiens middleware. The current implementation
    of iSapiens relies on the Java technology. iSapiens also allows the exploitation
    of an off-network computing layer that offers Cloud/Internet computing services
    which are required for the implementation of resource-demanding tasks (both in
    terms of computation and memory), and for the implementation of those tasks requiring
    a comprehensive view of the deployed system. Such layer comprehends three different
    kind of services: third-party provided services, custom developed services and
    agent-based services developed by using iSapiens agents. The third-party services
    and the custom services are not tied to the use of any specific technology. In
    the following, we further describe the main features of VOs and agents, and how
    they are deployed on computational nodes hosting iSapiens servers. Download :

    platform layers. 3.1.1. Virtual object features VOs are the key elements to provide
    the developers with an effective tool for managing devices heterogeneity and fostering
    hardware maintenance. In fact, VOs provide to agents a transparent access to the
    physical part due to a well-established and common interface exposed as API. A
    VO allows agents to directly connect to a device without taking care about proprietary
    drivers or addressing fine-grained technological issues. The goal is to decouple,
    from a sensing/actuation point of view, functionalities from the equipment offering
    them. A change in the physical devices (e.g., for maintenance) and in the adopted
    communication protocols will affect virtual objects only. The VOs are managed
    by the Virtual Object Container, which permits the dynamic deployment of new VOs,
    and exposes them to the agent layer. The VOs support both asynchronous and synchronous
    data reading. The asynchronous method relies on an implementation of the publish/subscribe
    pattern. Essentially, a VO exposes an abstract representation (i.e., machine readable-description)
    of the features and capabilities of physical objects spread in the environment.
    Features of the physical devices are exported into the iSapiens platform as virtual
    object functionalities related to both the sensing and actuation activities. For
    instance, the VO associated to a smart door will expose the isOpened functionality,
    through which an agent can check the current status of the door, and the lock
    functionality for locking the door if needed. 3.1.2. Agent services and features
    An Agent [21] is an autonomous entity which runs in an Agent Server and executes
    its own behavior interacting with other (local or remote) agents. An agent is
    able to exploit all the functionalities exposed by the VOs hosted in the same
    iSapiens server where the agent executes. An Agent Server provides services for
    the support of the agent life cycle and allows dynamic creation of agents at runtime.
    Communication among agents relies on the exchange of asynchronous messages. Messages
    can be timed or untimed. Timed messages are augmented with a time information
    specifying the absolute time in which the message has to be actually delivered
    to the recipient agent. The iSapiens platform provides acquaintance message s
    which are used for establishing direct acquaintance relationship among agents.
    An acquaintance message carries information about the identity and the role of
    a given agent. Such messages can be used to dynamically (re)configure the agents
    relations after faults or when new agents are introduced/removed into/from the
    system, e.g., due to maintenance and extensions. A distributed yellow pages service
    is also provided to dynamically discover agents in order to establish acquaintance
    relationships. An agent can register itself to the yellow pages by providing a
    set of roles and a set of properties (i.e., a set of couples). A registered agent
    can be discovered by other interested agents by querying the yellow pages. 3.1.3.
    Application deployment Given a running set of iSapiens servers, the deployment
    of an application is carried out by using a Deployer entity. Such entity can dynamically
    create new agents and VO on a target server. Moreover, it can establish acquaintance
    relationships among agents and/or send application-dependent configuration messages.
    The Deployer is an external process executing outside the iSapiens servers network.
    It can operate also on a running agent-based application in order, e.g., to introduce
    new functionalities in the system. 3.2. Exploiting the iSapiens platform: design
    guidelines This section describes a set of design guidelines aiming at supporting
    the development of applications by using the iSapiens platform. An important goal
    is to promote both the separation of concerns and the modularity. The proposed
    guidelines mainly rely on the exploitation of abstraction layers, and specific
    agent roles as depicted in Fig. 2. In each layer it is possible to focus on specific
    issues having a different level of abstraction. The layer-based approach is usable
    both in a top-down and bottom-up software development schema. A top-down approach
    is suggested when an application is developed from scratch, while a bottom-up
    approach is typically used when an application is built on top of some pre-existing
    components. A description of the introduced abstraction layers is reported below.

    Fig. 2. Design guidelines: abstraction layers vs. agent roles. Raw Data layer
    : it manages raw data directly related to physical quantities (e.g., distances,
    noise, temperature) both for sensing and actuation purposes. The managed data
    are not processed. Information layer : data coming from the previous layer can
    be filtered, structured and aggregated. This layer aims at organizing data in
    order to derive further information about the controlled system, or to produce
    synthetic data allowing a more convenient way to reason about the system. Knowledge
    layer : actuations to be performed, and/or environmental stimuli, are mapped onto
    more abstract concepts. The goal is to allow reasoning by using abstract concepts
    which are directly related to the specific domain (or context) of the application
    being developed. For instance, it is possible to introduce the concept of climatic
    health which depends on the value of the temperature and humidity actually existing
    in a given environment. Similarly, the concept of office security can be introduced
    in order to control a door office and make it alarmed after a certain hour. Wisdom
    layer : it permits to operate and reason at the highest abstraction level. Here,
    we have an holistic vision of all the concepts which are related to the developed
    application, and which govern the implemented system. The concepts previously
    introduced (or a subset of them) are orchestrated in order to pursue application
    goals. Gathered information and concepts can be complemented in order to augment
    system knowledge and to exploit such knowledge in order to operate upon the controlled
    system. For instance, if an application for managing safety at home is considered,
    information indicating that a person is found lying in the bathroom can be complemented
    in order to infer the concept afflicted by a malaise which can cause the concept
    of providing first aids to take place. Each layer is populated by agents having
    different roles. A role defines the responsibilities [39] an agent has in the
    system. The ellipses drawn in Fig. 2 associate the agent roles with the abstraction
    layers they are related to. Five agent roles were identified, and their description
    is provided in the following. Mirror agents : they are boundary entities turning
    VO functionalities into location-independent functionalities offered by agents,
    and must be co-located on the computational node hosting the VOs they have to
    interact. They do not introduce/modify new/existing VO functionalities thence
    they belong to the Raw data layer. Mirror agents mediate the use of the wrapped
    functionalities by enforcing, for instance, negotiation procedures and/or access
    policies useful for guaranteeing an exclusive use, or a time-based use, of the
    wrapped device. Boundary agents : they mediate the interactions between iSapiens
    agents and external service providers so as favoring system integration among
    iSapiens and third-party platforms. For instance, agents providing a weather-forecast
    functionality by using Internet-based services will have the Boundary role. Since
    external services can operate at different abstraction levels, boundary agents
    can belong to layers ranging from Raw data to Knowledge. Infrastructural agents
    : they offer general-purpose functionalities which are not tied to a specific
    application. For instance, these agents provide services managing information
    persistence (e.g., data storage in a DBMS) or services for the broadcast notification
    of events-of-interest. Infrastructural agents can belong to the abstraction levels
    ranging from Information to Knowledge. Operational agents : they offer functionalities
    tied to a specific application. Such functionalities can be achieved by composing
    and/or orchestrating functionalities offered by other agents. Operational agents
    can belong to the abstraction levels ranging from Information to Knowledge. In
    order to favor extensibility (both functional and geographical), fault tolerance
    and maintenance of the applications to develop, it is suggested the use of peer-to-peer/decentralized
    and bio-inspired algorithms, which are naturally fostered by the edge computing
    and agent paradigm. Service agents : they offer the final services exposed to
    the users according to the application goals. Such agents belong to the abstraction
    levels ranging from Knowledge to Wisdom. Usually, offered services are obtained
    by composition/coordination of the agents having other roles. 3.3. iSapiens for
    Smart City: features and benefits The features of the iSapiens platform (Section
    3.1), paired with the set of guidelines previously introduced (Section 3.2), produce
    some useful side-benefits, explotable for the realization of smart city applications,
    which are highlighted in the following. System maintenance is favored as VOs,
    agent roles, and abstraction layers introduce modularity and separation of concerns
    in the developed application. When a modification of a software function is needed,
    only the specific components dealing with such functionality are required to be
    selectively updated. VOs permits an easy hardware replacement as they maintain
    the same interface independently of the managed device. The supported dynamic
    deployment mechanism facilitates the actualization of the maintenance operations
    on the system. With respect to a node crash, fault tolerance is primarily fostered
    by the proper combination of the edge computing paradigm and use of P2P or Decentralized
    algorithms suggested for the implementation of the main operations of the system.
    Thus, a crash of a node does not impair the whole system execution. Heterogeneity
    and integration issues, either at device and system level, are tackled by the
    exploitation of VOs and Boundary Agents, as described in the previous sections.
    Functional extensibility is supported as it is possible to (i) composing pre-existing
    functionalities, (ii) exploiting in different ways the existing devices, and (iii)
    adding new devices for providing new services. This benefit arises as the platform
    permits to dynamically add/remove agents and VOs to/from the system. The geographical
    extensibility is achieved as the platform supports the dynamical addition of both
    computational nodes and related sensor/actuator devices on new areas of interest
    which have to be covered. As the newly added computational node is running, together
    with VOs, the new agents deployed on the node can join the rest of the community
    by exploiting the Yellow Pages service and the acquaintance messages. The exploitation
    of the edge computing paradigm makes the network of iSapiens nodes a distributed
    computational platform which is capable of furnishing a pervasive computational
    power which is exploitable for the realization of complex distributed smart-city
    services. More in particular, the edge computing supports online analytics, which
    consists in a continuous elaboration on the stream of data coming from sources.
    All of this promotes reactivity and efficiency in terms of bandwidth consumption.
    When the computation is resource demanding or it cannot be realized solely on
    the edge, an offline analysis can be carried out by exploiting the cloud computing.
    Table 1 provides a comprehensive view of the main features and benefits tied to
    the use of the iSapiens platform. Table 1. The iSapiens platform: Benefits vs
    features. 4. Design and implementation of the Smart Street Cosenza This section
    describes the design and implementation of a real case study which is realized
    by using the iSapiens platform. Such case study is the Smart Street that has been
    developed in the town of Cosenza (Italy). The purpose of the implemented smart
    street is to offer a set of services aiming at improving the quality-of-life of
    the citizens and favoring the interactions between the citizens themselves and
    the offered services. The realized Smart Street Cosenza (SSC), furthermore, offers
    an infrastructure which is scalable and extensible both to the whole town and
    with new functionalities. In the following, the location of the SSC is presented,
    along with a detailed description of the offered services, the architecture of
    the realized infrastructure (hardware/software), its evolution, and the Smart
    Street itself at work. 4.1. Location and functionalities of the Smart Street The
    Smart Street has been developed in Cosenza, which is a town of Calabria, Southern
    Italy. The town per se has a population of around 70,000, while its urban area
    counts over 268,000 inhabitants. SSC extends for about 2.5 km, and covers the
    following adjacent target areas (see Fig. 3): Corso Mazzini, the main business
    street of the town; a bus station, located in Via Delle Medaglie D’Oro; the square
    named Piazza Bilotti; the area around a mall, located in Piazza Giacomo Mancini;
    part of one of the main road of Cosenza, named Viale Giacomo Mancini. Corso Mazzini
    is a pedestrian street which hosts a set of shops, restaurants, cafés, banks,
    other commercial activities and an open air museum. The bus station is the main
    node of the town public transportation system and is mainly frequented in the
    working hours. Piazza Bilotti is currently under construction and will host a
    parking area. The area around the mall in Piazza Giacomo Mancini is highly frequented,
    and, together with the adjacent Viale Giacomo Mancini, is car accessible and is
    an high-traffic area. The mall itself hosts an underground parking area. Download

    The Smart Street target areas: (A) Bus Station, (B) Piazza Bilotti, (C) Corso
    Mazzini, (D) Viale Giacomo Mancini, (E) Piazza Giacomo Mancini. Due to the nature
    of the chosen locations, which are highly frequented by pedestrians, a set of
    services for making aware the citizens and the administrators about the status
    of the areas, in terms of pollutant gases, noise and climatic comfort are given.
    These kinds of services can be useful to the administrators for taking countermeasures
    so as to mitigate potential health risks and laws infringements,7 and to the citizens,
    which can use them to avoid unsafe situations, e.g., an elder person subject to
    heart related illness can avoid areas with a prohibitive climatic status. As the
    SSC is extensible by design (see Section 3.2), other services can be straightforward
    added. For instance, services for parking support in the areas around the mall
    and the bus station, efficient management of street lights, traffic control system,
    automation for green area management, public transportation information can be
    implemented. Moreover, all these services, once developed for a prototypal Smart
    Street using the iSapiens platform, can be easily deployed on other areas of the
    town. In addition, all the implemented services can be integrated, improved, or
    replaced. 4.2. Smart Street Cosenza design As stated in the previous section,
    the set of services designed to be part of SSC concerns climate, noise and pollution
    assessment so as to make aware of such environmental condition both citizens and
    town administrators. Environmental assessment requires the deployment of sensors
    which measure environmental, climate and pollutant quantities as indicated in
    Table 2. To achieve the stated goal, a set of Smart Street functionalities has
    been identified and a set of agents has been designed (see Table 3) to provide
    such functionalities. The designed agents are grouped according to the roles described
    in Section 3.2. Table 2. Main sensors used for the Smart Street Cosenza divided
    by category. Category Sensor type Climate Temperature, Atmospheric Pressure, Humidity
    Pollution CO, , , Concentration Other Noise, Luminosity A set of agents having
    the Mirror role is devoted to abstract the physical sensors so as to mirror the
    VOs as agents. A specific Mirror agent is designed for each kind of sensor identified
    in Table 2. The raw data exposed by the Mirror agents are sent to the group of
    the Measure Aggregation agents, having the Operational role. The Measure Aggregation
    agents make computation on the data coming from the Mirror agents and provide
    value-added data aggregation. There exists a specific instance of a Measure Aggregation
    agent for each Mirror agent. Given a specific sensor type (e.g., temperature,
    humidity), a Measure Aggregation agent provides all the capabilities of its associated
    Mirror agent plus the global average and the global standard deviation of the
    specific sensor type computed in real-time on the whole network. The two operations
    are computed by exploiting the gossip-based aggregation algorithm proposed in
    [40]. Table 3. Agents implementing the Smart Street Cosenza. Agent Role Agent
    Classes Empty Cell Mirror SensorTemperature, SensorPressure, SensorHumidity, SensorLuminosity,
    SensorNoise, SensorCO, SensorCO2, SensorNO2, SensorO3 Infrastructural Persistence,
    Notification Operational Measure Aggregation Service Environmental Wellness, Climatic
    Wellness, Anomaly Detection More in particular, the subset of Measure Aggregation
    agents, which are tied to the same sensor type, cooperates in the global average/standard
    deviation computation. When the gossip-based algorithm ends, all the cooperating
    agents become aware of the global computed result. In order to compute the average,
    each agent maintains its current measured value and its local average (initially
    set to the measured value). The algorithm consists in the continuous exchange
    of local averages among neighbor agents (i.e., the agents located in the same
    computing node or the node’s neighborhood). Each time an agent receives the average
    from one of its neighbors, it updates its local average (just applying the average
    operator). Value exchanges and local computations are continuously done for an
    enough number of step s set so as to ensure that each local average, computed
    by every involved agent, converges to the actual global average (the algorithm
    convergence is proved in [40]). Given the global mean, the global standard deviation
    is computed similarly, by evaluating the average of the squared deviation from
    the mean of the local measures. This gossip-based strategy has been chosen as
    it is fully scalable, decentralized, and fault tolerant. Besides the Mirror and
    the Operational agents, two kinds of Service agent, namely the Wellness and the
    Anomaly Detection agents, have been designed and developed. Each of them furnishes
    a specific service so as to meet the stated goals of the SSC and exploits the
    functionalities offered by the Mirror and the Operational agents. In particular,
    the Wellness agents provide high level information about the pollution and climatic
    status of the SSC in different areas. Climatic wellness is provided as comfort
    levels, computed through the exploitation of the Summer Simmer Index8 and the
    Humidex9 index, both involving temperature and humidity measurements. The categories
    of the found comfort level in a specific area range from “no discomfort” to “dangerous”.
    Environmental pollution wellness relies on the gases concentration sensors (see
    Table 2), and exploits the Air Quality Index.10 In this case, the categories range
    from “good” to “hazardous”. The Anomaly Detection agents are devoted instead to
    detect possible anomalies related to the environmental condition. There exists
    one Anomaly Detection agent for each noise sensor (i.e., related Mirror Agent)
    on the SSC. Two kinds of anomalies, namely area anomalies and historic anomalies,
    can be detected by the Anomaly Detection agents. At first, an Anomaly Detection
    agent notifies the occurrence of an area anomaly by exploiting the global average
    and standard deviation computed by the set of Measure Aggregation agents. The
    average and the standard deviation are exploited to fully characterize a Gamma
    Probabilistic Distribution, and an anomaly is detected when the value of the specific
    sensor associated to the Anomaly Detection agent is higher than the 99th percentile
    of the characterized Gamma function. In this case, the global average information
    combined with the local measures are exploited to discover if some areas of the
    SSC behave differently with respect to the whole. Secondly, each Anomaly Detection
    agent can detect historic anomalies as follows. A day is divided into 144 time
    slots, each of them corresponding to a 10 min time interval. For each time slot,
    the Anomaly Detection agent maintains a couple computed on all the sensor values
    so far read in the same time slot. When a new sensor value is read, it is compared
    with the 99th percentile of the Gamma distribution characterized by the couple
    of the corresponding time slot, and, if it is greater than such threshold, an
    event of interest is generated and notified. After that, the related couple is
    incrementally updated computing the exponential weighted moving average and variance
    (EWMA) according to [41]. The Infrastructural agents are devoted to provide functionalities
    that are potentially useful for all the agents above described. In particular,
    a set of off-network services are provided by a purposely-developed service provider,
    named Smart Street Server. The Smart Street Server is hosted in a data center
    located outside the edge computing node network (i.e., the nodes hosting the sensors).
    The server receives data from in-network agents (i.e., Infrastructural agents),
    and manages the persistence by using a local DBMS. The stored data are made available
    to the final users through a web application. Two kinds of Infrastructure agents
    have been designed, namely the Persistence and Notification agents. Both the kinds
    of agents forward the information they receive to the application server for storage
    on the DBMS. The data forwarded by the Notification agents are immediately made
    available for visualization to the connected clients. A comprehensive architectural
    view of the system is shown in Fig. 4. The figure highlights the interactions
    among agents, VOs, and the Smart Street Server. Communications among entities
    are graphically represented by thin links. The agents are grouped by type for
    the sake of readability, and the communications among the Measure Aggregation
    agents based on gossiping are highlighted through the tag. Download : Download

    view of the Smart Street Cosenza. 4.3. Operational steps for system deployment
    Fig. 4 highlights also how the components are dislocated on the computational
    nodes and the interactions occurring among them. The steps involved in the life
    of a generic component of the SSC, either hardware or software, are depicted in
    Fig. 5. Such steps are numbered from S1 to S4 and, for each of them, are also
    reported the iSapiens features used for their realization. Every component enters
    into the system through a deployment step (S1), and then it is initialized and
    becomes ready to work (S2). After that, the connections among interacting agents
    are established (S3) and, in the case of the gossip-based agents, a renewal of
    the acquaintance relationships (S4) is continuously carried out. In the initialization
    step, there is no specific iSapiens feature to exploit, but each component requires
    to be initialized through a specific configuration procedure. More in particular,
    the deployment of the agents and VOs over each computational node is obtained
    through the use of the dynamic deploying mechanism offered by the platform. The
    acquaintance relationships among the agents are established instead by using the
    Yellow Pages service and the acquaintance messages. With reference to Fig. 4,
    all the communication links among agents, that are not labeled with the tag, are
    established by sending proper acquaintance messages to the communicating agents.
    As an example, after the deployment and initialization of a new Wellness agent,
    a set of acquaintance messages are sent to it providing the knowledge of the Persistence
    agent, the Notification agent, and the relevant Measure Aggregation agents that
    the Wellness agent needs to know in order to behave properly. Instead, after the
    initialization of an agent involved in a gossip-based communication, the agent
    registers itself in the Yellow Pages and uses it to choose its neighborhood according
    to the gossip-based protocol. The neighborhood is renewed with a prefixed frequency
    (chosen during configuration) in step S4. This allows to implicitly handle the
    case in which Measure Aggregation agents dynamically enter or leave the system,
    as after a node crash or a new node joins the system. Each communication link
    without agents as endpoints is established during the component initialization
    as configuration info. From Fig. 4 emerges also that, by design, all the computing
    nodes are functionally equivalent, in the sense that there is no centralized functionality
    (with, obviously, the exception of the Smart Street Server). This last feature,
    together with the use of the gossip-based protocol, the acquaintance renewal policy
    and the dynamic deployment capability, makes the system able to meet fault-tolerance,
    scalability and extendibility requirements. Download : Download high-res image

    installation and execution. 4.4. Smart Street Cosenza implementation The realization
    of the SSC as it is today, has been done in an incremental way, both from a geographical
    and functional points of view, as successive incremental stages. The four incremental
    stages are described in Table 4, where, for each stage, the newly installed components,
    along with the interested city areas (as in Fig. 3) and a description of the performed
    actions (as in Fig. 5) is portrayed. In the table, the deployment of the Smart
    Street Server is not highlighted as it has been deployed and configured once,
    before the first stage. The SSC as it is in its current version, is constituted
    by a network of 15 computational nodes, interconnected through a dedicated Wi-Fi
    mesh network (IEEE 802.11n), directly deployed on the targeted areas (see Fig.
    6, Fig. 6(a)). Each computational node is constituted by a low cost Raspberry
    Pi 2 model B board,11 embedding a 900MHz quad-core ARM Cortex-A7 CPU and 1GB of
    RAM, and mounting an USB Wi-Fi dongle for networking purposes. Each Raspberry
    Pi is properly enveloped in an IP64 weather resistant case and main powered, using
    the power infrastructure of the town. From a software perspective, each computational
    node runs Raspbian, a Linux distribution developed for Raspberry Pi and based
    on Debian 7.0, the Oracle Java Runtime Environment version 8, and the iSapiens
    middleware. Table 4. Deployment stages descriptions of the Smart Street Cosenza.

    sensor nodes for climatic monitoring;- VOs for the deployed sensor nodes;- related
    Mirror, Notification and Persistence agents;- related Aggregation agents. - Piazza
    Giacomo Mancini- Viale Giacomo Mancini The iSapiens nodes were installed (S1)
    and configured (S2) on the covered area. The sensor nodes were installed (S1)
    and the related VOs were deployed (S1, S2) on the iSapiens nodes. Finally, the
    agents for climatic monitoring were deployed (S1) and configured (S2). Direct
    knowledge between agents is achieved by using acquaintances (S3). The Aggregation
    agents started to exploit the neighbor renewal policy (S4). #2 Area coverage extension

    sensor nodes;- related Mirror, Notification and Persistence agents;- related Aggregation
    agents. - Corso Mazzini- Piazza Bilotti- Bus Station The iSapiens computational
    nodes were installed (S1) and configured (S2) on the new areas. The sensor nodes
    were installed (S1, S2) and the related VOs were deployed (S1, S2) on the newly
    iSapiens nodes, without affecting the already operating infrastructure. The agents
    for climatic monitor were deployed (S1) and configured (S2), acquaintances were
    given as in the previous step (S3). The gossip based renewal policy took into
    account the newly added Aggregation Agents (S4). #3 Environmental pollution monitoring
    addition - sensor nodes for environmental pollution monitoring;- VOs for the newly
    deployed sensor nodes;- related Mirror, Notification and Persistence agents;-
    related Aggregation agents. - Viale Giacomo Mancini- Corso Giacomo Mancini- Corso
    Mazzini- Piazza Bilotti- Bus Station New sensor nodes for environmental pollutant
    monitoring were installed on all the areas (S1, S2). The related VOs were deployed
    on the related iSapiens nodes (S1, S2), without affecting the already operating
    infrastructure. The agents for pollution monitoring were deployed (S1) and configured
    (S2) on the affected iSapiens nodes, acquaintances were given as in stage #1 (S3),
    neighbor renewal behavior started for the added Aggregation agents (S4). #4 Anomaly
    Detection and Climatic Wellness management. - Agents for climatic wellness and
    anomaly detection. - Piazza Giacomo Mancini - Viale Giacomo Mancini- Corso Mazzini-
    Piazza Bilotti- Bus Station The agents for realizing the climatic wellness management
    and anomaly detection were deployed (S1) and configured (S2), acquaintances were
    established among both the previously-available and the newly-added agents (S3).
    All of this without affecting the already running infrastructure. With respect
    to the climatic and pollution comfort services, two sets of sensor nodes are deployed
    on the involved streets. The first one (type A) is composed by nodes hosting sensors
    for measuring temperature, humidity, luminosity and noise level. The second one
    (type B) is composed by nodes hosting sensors for measuring atmospheric pressure
    and the concentration of pollutant gases such as carbon dioxide ( ), carbon monoxide
    (CO), nitrogen dioxide ( ) and ozone ( ). Each sensor node is managed by its nearest
    computational node, and linked with it through the same Wi-Fi network. All the
    sensor nodes are powered by batteries, which are recharged “on site” by using
    solar panels. Solar panels have been used so as to have no need to modify the
    electric delivery infrastructure of the town for the deployment of the sensor
    nodes. The nodes are Libelium Waspmote Plug&sense,12 which are sensor nodes compatible
    with the Arduino platform, enclosed in an IP64 box. The air pollutant sensors
    are protected by a shield, which mitigates the effects of wind and direct sunlight
    exposition on the precision of the measurements. About 70 sensor nodes have been
    already deployed on the Smart Street areas, as in Fig. 6b. Fig. 7 shows a set
    of them deployed on street lights and walls. The maps in Fig. 6(a), Fig. 6(b)
    show, respectively, the position of the deployed computational and sensor nodes,
    which are denser in the areas where people activities is mainly carried out. Each
    computational node controls a portion of the SSC. The Smart Street Server runs
    on a Linux based server, located at the ICAR-CNR institute, Rende, Italy. The
    same server hosts a JBoss application server, which runs the Smart Street web
    application, and an instance of the MySQL DBMS, which is used for storage purposes.
    The web application can provide information about both the current and historical
    statuses of the SSC. Two screenshots of the web interface are shown in Fig. 8,
    which depicts the map view, showing the global status of the smart street in a
    given time, and the chart view, showing an historical chart of the measures of
    a given sensor in a given time interval. The SSC is running since early 2016.

    the Smart Street in a given moment and (b) the historical graph of the measures
    of a relative humidity sensor. 4.5. Smart Street Cosenza: Wellness and anomaly
    detection In this section, a set of charts related to the behavior of the Wellness
    agents and the Anomaly Detection agents are provided, so as to prove the usefulness
    of the deployed SSC. Fig. 9, Fig. 9(a), Fig. 9(b) show the values, respectively,
    of the Humidex and the Simmer Summer Index as computed by the Climatic Wellness
    agent tied to the Sensor Node 040, located at the beginning of Corso Mazzini,
    on July, 7th 2016. It was a summer day, where, as shown in the charts, the comfort
    levels provided by both the indexes result to be very low in the afternoon, so
    the population in that time could be informed accordingly of avoiding the area.
    In fact, the Climatic Wellness agent notified (through the Notification agent)
    the Smart Street Server of the detected dangerous situation. In Fig. 10, Fig.
    10(a) are shown: (i) the global noise averages (averages on all the gathered noise
    sensor values at a given timestamp) computed in real-time by the Measure Aggregation
    agents, (ii) the 99th percentile of the Gamma function (characterized by the average
    and the standard deviation computed by the same Measure Aggregation agents), the
    max sensed noise value for each timestamp, and the area anomaly alerts generated
    by the Anomaly Detection agents as explained in Section 4.2. All the trend lines
    are related to the first week of June, 2016. Since the high values sensed, particular
    interest is given by the area anomalies detected in the evening of June, 3rd where
    the alerts have been generated by the Anomaly Detection agent related to the noise
    sensor at the node 013, located at the center of Corso Mazzini. The same agent
    has also detected, in the same evening, a set of historic anomalies (see Fig.
    10b). In this situation, the agent has notified the Smart Street Server with two
    different alerts, highlighting a situation of high-interest which has to be checked
    by the SSC administrators. As truth assessment, we verified that, in the evening
    of June, 3rd in the place near the sensor node 013 an election rally was taken.

    and future work In this paper we proposed the iSapiens edge-based platform as
    an effective IoT tool for the implementation of distributed Smart City applications.
    Edge computing is implemented by using the agent metaphor natively supported by
    iSapiens. The platform is able to hide the heterogeneity of the involved physical
    devices and protocols. A set of design guidelines were also proposed. Such guidelines
    support an effective exploitation of the offered iSapiens features and allow to
    reach useful benefits in developing Smart City services such as system extensibility,
    fault tolerance, integration of systems, and system maintenance. The resultant
    approach, based on the exploitation of both the iSapiens platform and the proposed
    design guidelines, was validated by the design and the implementation of a real
    case study, namely the Smart Street Cosenza (SSC). The SSC, deployed in the town
    of Cosenza (Italy), has the goal of providing decentralized urban intelligence
    services to citizens. In particular, the working system is able to furnish services
    which are related to climatic and environmental wellness, and to the detection
    of anomalies that may occur in the covered city area. The incremental evolution
    of SSC was discussed, showing, in particular, how the functional and geographical
    extensibility were effectively supported. Finally, an excerpt of the collected
    data and an example of the data analysis carried out by the deployed agents were
    shown. Future work is geared at: extending the SSC by covering new urban areas
    and by adding new services. More in particular, as an example of in-network services,
    a service for urban drainage network optimization is currently under development
    [3], [42] and a traffic control system is planned to be designed. Other services
    under development regard the use of data stream mining algorithms for real-time
    analysis, previsioning and mining on the SSC data; including in iSapiens a library
    of ready-to-use, general-purpose Infrastructural and Operational agents which,
    relying on bio-inspired and peer-to-peer algorithms, simplify the implementation
    of custom applications; integrating iSapiens with the Social Internet of Things
    platform [43], [44], [45], in order to provide social capabilities to objects
    and smart devices exploitable in smart city applications; using the proposed approach
    for developing other smart cyber–physical systems, such as Smart Homes, Smart
    Offices, and Smart Factories. Acknowledgments The authors are grateful to Antonio
    Francesco Gentile, Luigi Porto, and Davide Macrí for their valuable contributions

    grateful to the administrators of the town of Cosenza for their support in the
    realization of the Smart Street. This work has been partially supported by RES-NOVAE

  explanation: The paper under review concerns cybersecurity and privacy considerations
    in smart farming applications. Gundu and Maronga (2019) emphasize that while the
    technological aspects of system security are significant, the human aspect is
    equally, if not more, essential for ensuring comprehensive protection. They argue
    that addressing vulnerabilities caused by human error and naiveté requires awareness
    campaigns and training programs to educate farmers and farm employees on safe
    practices and potential risks in smart farming environments.

    greenhouse gas emissions (Mahmoud, Yousuf, Aloul, & Zualkernan, 2015) and increase
    reliability of spatially explicit data which will ultimately reduce farming risks.

    \ is central to the economy of the world, with sixty percent of the \npopulation\
    \ depending on it for survival. Farmers are adopting smart farming technics to\
    \ \nmake agricultural practices more efficient. Smart farming takes advantage\
    \ of Internet of \nThings (IoT) technologies for performing tasks such as moisture\
    \ sensing, weeding, \nkeeping vigilance, spraying, bird and animal scaring, smart\
    \ irrigation controls, the use of \nreal time field data for intelligent decision\
    \ making and smart warehouse management \nwhich includes theft detection and temperature\
    \ and humidity maintenance of the \nwarehouse. Smart devices such as watches,\
    \ computers or cellphones connected to the \ninternet can then be used to control\
    \ the smart farming system. Smart farming being at \nnascent stage, its privacy\
    \ and security needs to be researched and explored as its future \npartially dependent\
    \ on the resolution of the privacy and security issues associated. This \npaper\
    \ comprehensively reviews various security and privacy issues and challenges \n\
    associated with IoT deployments in smart farming. Following a structured approach,\
    \ a \nframework for smart farming security and privacy was developed in an attempt\
    \ to address \nchallenges experienced/expected. This framework can also be used\
    \ for future directions \nfor any IoT related privacy and security initiatives.\
    \ \n1 Introduction \nThe growth in global population is leading to increased food\
    \ requirement needs of the modern-day \ncivilization requires increased food production.\
    \ Unfortunately, traditional farming methods with low \nyields for fruit and crops\
    \ are still predominantly used. But wherever automation has been implemented,\
    \ \nyield improvement has been evident (Gondchawar & Kawitkar, 2016). This highlights\
    \ the need to \nintroduce modern technologies to the agriculture sector to achieve\
    \ better yields.  \n \nThe new technologies and solutions being implemented in\
    \ agriculture increase efficiency in methods \nfor gathering and processing data\
    \ while enhancing net productivity (Ray, 2017). On the other hand, the \nKalpa\
    \ Publications in Computing\nVolume 12, 2019, Pages 95–104\nProceedings of 4th\
    \ International Conference on the\nInternet, Cyber Security and Information Systems\
    \ 2019\nK. Njenga (ed.), ICICIS 2019 (Kalpa Publications in Computing, vol. 12),\
    \ pp. 95–104\nwater crisis and alarming climate change require new and improved\
    \ methods of farming. Automation \nand intelligent decision making technologies\
    \ are therefore also important in accomplishing this mission \n(Fan TongKe, 2013).\
    \ Amongst technologies that are making it possible are; IoT, remote sensing, \n\
    ubiquitous computing, cloud computing, Radio Frequency Identifier and wireless\
    \ and sensor networks \n(Ray, 2017).  \n \nHowever, this study only focuses on\
    \ IoT, which is “a collection of many interconnected objects, \nservices, humans,\
    \ and devices that can communicate, share data, and information to achieve a common\
    \ \ngoal in different areas and applications. IoT is fast tracked by the rapid\
    \ growth in nanotechnology which \nenables production of small and cheap sensors.\
    \ This has brought about great potential towards faster \ndecision making and\
    \ automation in the agriculture industry in the following smart farming techniques:\
    \ \n(automated irrigation scheduling (Reche, Sendra, Díaz, & Lloret, 2015), precision\
    \ agriculture (Barcelo-\nOrdinas, Chanet, Hou, & García-Vidal, 2013; Ray, 2017),\
    \ optimization of plant growth (Hwang, Shin, \n& Yoe, 2010), green-house monitoring\
    \ (Mao, Miao, He, Li, & Liu, 2012), farm land monitoring (Corke \net al., 2010),\
    \ and farming production process management (Dong, Vuran, & Irmak, 2013)). This\
    \ rapid \ndevelopment in the Internet of Things in agriculture has propelled the\
    \ phenomenon that is called Smart \nFarming (Sundmaeker, Verdouw, Wolfert, & Freire,\
    \ 2016).  \n \nAlthough smart farming promotes the increase of yields, reduces\
    \ operating costs, and increases \nagility, its unique architecture raises numerous\
    \ security and privacy concerns. The huge amounts of \ndata that are shared in\
    \ IoT-enabled environments can be harnessed by malicious applications that can\
    \ \nuse to the disadvantage of some aspect of smart farming. Thus, understanding\
    \ and minimization of these \nsecurity and privacy risks by the development of\
    \ efficient and effective cybersecurity solutions is \ncritical for the success\
    \ of smart farming initiatives. Since both IoT and smart farming are relatively\
    \ new \nphenomena, their knowledge concerning security and privacy implications\
    \ is not widespread as \nexpected. Some authors have labeled these technologies\
    \ as “technology hypes that may fail to \nmaterialize.” (Fenn & LeHong, 2011).\
    \  \n \nThis research paper provides insight into smart farming and goes on to\
    \ identify the most important \nsecurity and privacy challenges they expose farmers\
    \ to. Lastly, we introduce a framework to help \nmitigate the smart farming security\
    \ and privacy challenges exposed. We acknowledge both technical \nand human security\
    \ and privacy challenges, however, the paper mainly focuses on the human aspect\
    \ of \nprivacy and security in smart farming because it seems as though not enough\
    \ research has been done. \nIn line with that, this paper seeks to answer the\
    \ following research questions:  \n1. What are the privacy and security issues\
    \ in IoT?  \n2. How do humans affect the privacy and security of IoT initiatives?\
    \  \n3. How can the impact of human weakness in the privacy and security of IoT\
    \ be reduced?  \n \nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows; firstly,\
    \ it will highlight the contribution of this \nstudy, it will then discuss a review\
    \ of related literature after which it will provide the brief methodology \nfor\
    \ the research followed by a description of the proposed framework. The last section\
    \ will conclude \nand provide recommendations for further research and actions.\
    \ \n2  Related Literature \nAgriculture has seen three revolutions already, from\
    \ plants animal domestication a few thousand \nyears ago, systematic crop rotational\
    \ methods of a few hundred years ago and the “green revolution” \nwhich came with\
    \ the use of fertilizers, pesticides, genetic modifications and introduction of\
    \ systematic \nbreeding a few decades ago (Walter, Finger, Huber, & Buchmann,\
    \ 2017). We suggest that agriculture \nIoT Security and Privacy: Turning on the\
    \ Human Firewall in Smart Farming\nGundu and Maronga\n96\nis undergoing a fourth\
    \ revolution triggered by the increasing population that in turn is increasing\
    \ the \ndemand of food. Ray (2017) warns that the growth rate in food production\
    \ is not at par with the food \nrequired by the growing population. The Food and\
    \ Agriculture Organization of the United Nations \n(How to Feed the World in 2050)\
    \ recently published a report showing a prediction of global food \nrequirements\
    \ reaching 3 billion tons by 2050 from 1.5 billion in 2015. This calls for an\
    \ exploration of \nnew and modern technologies that can be used in agricultural\
    \ applications to achieve the target. As a \nresult, this is accelerating the\
    \ incorporation of sensors and IoT into agriculture, giving birth to smart \n\
    farming. \n \n2.1 Internet of Things (IoT) \n \nIoT is rapidly gaining momentum\
    \ in modern wireless telecommunications. The basic IoT concept \nlays around connection\
    \ and use of a variety of technologies (such as Radio-Frequency IDentification\
    \ \n(RFID) tags, sensors, computers, actuators, smart watches, mobile phones,\
    \ etc.). These technologies \ninteract with each other through unique addressing\
    \ schemes to achieve common goals (Pecorella, \nPierucci, & Nizzi, 2018). The\
    \ integration of IoT with humans can take advantage of collaboration and \ntechnical\
    \ analytics to achieve real-time decision making (Angelini, Mugellini, Abou Khaled,\
    \ & \nCouture, 2018; Ray, 2017). IERC (‘IERC-European Research Cluster on the\
    \ Internet of Things’, 2014) \nwhich seems to have the most cited definition,\
    \ defines IoT as follows: “A dynamic global network \ninfrastructure with self-configuring\
    \ capabilities based on standard and interoperable communication \nprotocols where\
    \ physical and virtual ‘things’ have identities, physical attributes, and virtual\
    \ \npersonalities and use intelligent interfaces, and are seamlessly integrated\
    \ into the information network, \noften communicate data associate with users\
    \ and their environments.” \n \n2.2 Smart Farming \nSmart farming is the use of\
    \ modern technology to improve the amount and quality of agricultural \nproducts.\
    \ Walter et al (Walter et al., 2017) advocates that, apart from the use of intelligent\
    \ sensors, \nsmart farming  also encompasses the use of robotic vehicles (e.g.\
    \ for application of fertilizer, weeding \nand fruit harvesting). They also elaborate\
    \ that the drones with autonomous flight control, bundled with \npowerful hyperspectral\
    \ and high-resolution cameras are also being used to calculate biomass \ndevelopment\
    \ and fertilization status of crops, is another form of sophisticated smart farming.\
    \ Another \ncommon form of smart farming innovation is virtual fencing technologies\
    \ which assist cattle herd \nmanagement by the use of Global Positioning System\
    \ Sensors (GPS) sensors attached to the livestock \nand monitored on computer\
    \ or smart phones. This management can also be achieved by the use of real \n\
    time remote-sensing signals. Combined, these technical improvements discussed\
    \ constitute a technical \nrevolution that can generate positive changes in agricultural\
    \ practices. These trends for farming are not \nonly applicable to developed countries\
    \ but also to developing countries, especially where deployments \nin ICT (e.g.,\
    \ use of smart phones, access to the Internet) are being adopted at a rapid pace.\
    \ The rapid \ndecrease in price for IoT based sensors for smart farming solutions\
    \ is also opening a possibility for \nsmart faming initiatives in emerging economies\
    \ as the farmers can also afford them (Ray, 2017). \n \nSmart farming reduces\
    \ the ecological footprint of farming due to efficient site-specific application\
    \ \nof inputs, such as fertilizers and pesticides. This makes agriculture more\
    \ profitable for the farmer as \nresource inputs would have been decreased. It\
    \ also assists with mitigation of leaching problems as well \nas greenhouse gas\
    \ emissions (Mahmoud, Yousuf, Aloul, & Zualkernan, 2015) and increase reliability\
    \ \nof spatially explicit data which will ultimately reduce farming risks. Optimal,\
    \ yield projections, site-\nIoT Security and Privacy: Turning on the Human Firewall\
    \ in Smart Farming\nGundu and Maronga\n97\nspecific weather forecasts, and diseases\
    \ and disasters probability maps based on weather and climate \ndata will help\
    \ plan and optimize cultivation of crops (Walter et al., 2017). With the IoT,\
    \ it is possible \nto create a sensor network allowing for almost continuous monitoring\
    \ of the farm reducing the time \nneeded for surveillance.  \n \nIn principle,\
    \ optimization of farming activities due to smart farming should lead to better\
    \ product \nquality (e.g., watering an orchard when the moisture level has not\
    \ dropped too much, produces better \njuicier fruits or better-quality milk produced\
    \ by individualized feeding of cattle). Better quality products \nare not only\
    \ healthier but also generate more profits as they sell at higher prices.  \n\
    \ \nBecause there are numerous players in smart farming, this introduces a challenge\
    \ of accountability \nfor malpractice or mistakes that may lead to environmental\
    \ and/or economic consequences. For \nexample, it is difficult to establish the\
    \ source of the problem if a consumer gets sick from eating \nharvested fruits\
    \ that still had traces of fertilizer or pesticides because it was applied too\
    \ late. Should the \nblame be on the farmer, or the software vendor, or the network\
    \ provider, or the manufacturer of the \nsensor? As at the time of publishing\
    \ of this paper, there is no straightforward answer to address such an \nincident.\
    \  Another challenge is that smart farming can lead to serious disease outbreaks\
    \ if not monitored \nproperly. Efficient use of fungicide in a smart farming environment\
    \ may delay disease outbreaks which \nthen increases the risk of creating fungicide\
    \ resistant traits which is even more devastating. \n \nContrary to the view that\
    \ the automation in smart farming eliminates the need of human labor \ntherefore\
    \ increases the unemployment rate, this whole process will always require humans\
    \ however at \na much higher intelligent level. Machines will only conduct the\
    \ monotonous and tiring operational \nactivities (Walter et al., 2017). \n \n\
    2.3 Security and Privacy \nWe will discuss the security and privacy challenges\
    \ of smart farming as well as those of IoT in \ngeneral as they also filter into\
    \ smart farming. These challenges can be broadly divided into technological \n\
    challenges and human challenges (Gundu, Flowerday, & Renaud, 2019; Mahmoud et\
    \ al., 2015). The \ntechnological challenges in smart farming mainly arise due\
    \ to its heterogeneous and ubiquitous nature. \nIf magnified closer, these challenges\
    \ have to do with wireless technologies, scalability and energy.  The \nhuman\
    \ challenges are related to the awareness and knowledge of principles and functionalities\
    \ that \nshould be followed to achieve and maintain a secure smart farming environment.\
    \ These human \nchallenges evolve around the ability to ensure security by authentication,\
    \ confidentiality, end-to-end \nsecurity, integrity etc. (Mahmoud et al., 2015).\
    \ \n \nIn the recent years, there has been a lot of effort attempting to address\
    \ security and privacy issues \nsmart paradigms (Alaba, Othman, Hashem, & Alotaibi,\
    \ 2017; Cho, Cho, Shin, Park, & Lee, 2012; Corke \net al., 2010; Fagade & Tryfonas,\
    \ 2016; Granjal, Monteiro, & Sa Silva, 2015; Hwang et al., 2010; \nOleshchuk,\
    \ 2009; Pecorella et al., 2018; Zhou, Cao, Dong, & Vasilakos, 2017). Collectively,\
    \ the authors \ntouch on trust management, authentication, intrusion detection\
    \ systems, privacy issues, data security, \nnetwork security, access control systems,\
    \ fault tolerance and digital forensics. An IoT project requires \nsome form of\
    \ trust, privacy, and security model implementation. This model should address\
    \ data \nintegrity, confidentiality and end-to-end communication issues. To probe\
    \ into data misuse, the model \nshould also address access policies and encrypting\
    \ mechanisms to be used.  \n \nThe classic security goals of Confidentiality,\
    \ Integrity and Availability (CIA) of any cyber system \nalso apply to IoT. However,\
    \ IoT based smart systems have other restrictions and limitations. These are \n\
    IoT Security and Privacy: Turning on the Human Firewall in Smart Farming\nGundu\
    \ and Maronga\n98\nprimarily due to computational power limitations of the devices\
    \ and the heterogonous and ubiquitous \nnature of IoT. To address that, we suggest\
    \ authentication, lightweight solutions, heterogeneity, policies \nand key management\
    \ systems to be added to the traditional CIA triad, which will be discussed below.\
    \ \n \nSecurity and privacy issues that may arise due to weaknesses of the human\
    \ in smart farming are \ninterception, node capture attack, dos attack, man-in-the-middle\
    \ attack and data theft. Technological \nissues include compatibility, wireless\
    \ signal strength, storage capacity, power consumption, and \ncomputation capability.\
    \ In general, when designing IoT applications it is important to take the following\
    \ \ninto account: how will different users interact with the devices, how much\
    \ data will be revealed and \nwho will be managing the applications. Therefore,\
    \ users should have tools that control data to be \ndisclosed, by whom and when\
    \ (Mahmoud et al., 2015). \n \n \n3 Contribution \nThis paper contributes to the\
    \ body of knowledge as follows.  \n \nAnalysis of the advantages of smart farming.\
    \  \n \nAnalysis of privacy and security issues related to IoT and smart farming\
    \ deployments with \nrespect to the human aspect. \n \nDevelopment of a framework\
    \ that can be followed to reduce the effect of the human \nweakness in terms of\
    \ privacy and security of smart farming. \n \n \n4 Methodology \nIn order to address\
    \ the research questions outlined in the Introduction, we reviewed literature\
    \ from \nJanuary 2009 to January 2019. This review period was chosen due to the\
    \ fact that IoT and smart farming \nare recent phenomena, hence as a practical\
    \ consideration we did not expect to access older studies \nwithin articles prior\
    \ to 2009. Apart from inclusion by period of publication, we also used two other\
    \ \ninclusion criteria for the literature search. These encompassed whether it\
    \ was a full article publication \nand its relevance to the research questions.\
    \ Exclusion of previous literature was also based on two \ndifferent criteria:\
    \ either the articles were not published in English or the articles focused solely\
    \ on \ntechnological designs. The literature survey was undertaken using the following\
    \ systematic approach: \na search on two major bibliographical databases was carried\
    \ out, on Science Direct and Scopus. This \nsearch was conducted using a combinations\
    \ of keywords which were separated into two groups, the \nfirst addressing Smart\
    \ Farming (i.e. precision farming, agri-food, sensor-driven innovation, \ntechnologies\
    \ in farming, internet of things, IoT) and the second group focusing on cybersecurity\
    \ (i.e. \nhuman centered security, awareness campaigns, training). The choice\
    \ of the two databases was based \non their wide coverage of relevant literature\
    \ and their capability to suggest related articles or citations. \nA total of\
    \ 359 peer-reviewed articles were retrieved from the two databases. These were\
    \ filtered by \nscanning for relevance. This involved identifying sections of\
    \ the text that address the research questions. \nFollowed by screening, where,\
    \ the search function was used to locate the paragraphs containing the key \n\
    words. We then analyzed the text to identify links to our research questions.\
    \  \n \nIoT Security and Privacy: Turning on the Human Firewall in Smart Farming\n\
    Gundu and Maronga\n99\nWe used Zotero reference management software to manage\
    \ the articles and eventually, 21 articles \nwere considered as very relevant\
    \ and 93 as relatively relevant. The remainder of the articles were \nirrelevant\
    \ and excluded from this analysis because they did not speak to smart farming\
    \ or cybersecurity. \nThe number of relevant peer reviewed literature was very\
    \ low; however, this was not surprising as IoT \nand Smart Farming are relatively\
    \ new concepts. Their applications are rapidly evolvingpeer reviewed \narticles\
    \ are lagging behind as usually the case with most technologies. This led to the\
    \ decision to also \ninclude grey literature into the review. This comprised using\
    \ Google Scholar and LexisNexis search \nengine. Thus, we managed to obtain magazines,\
    \ reports, blogs, and other web-items. This resulted in \n213 magazine articles,\
    \ 4 reports, 119 blogs and 19 items on twitter. Each of the 119 blogs had their\
    \ title \nand sentences scanned for relevance and duplicated blogs were removed.\
    \ As a result, 21 blogs were \nselected for additional evaluation through further\
    \ reading. Eventually, 7 blogs were considered as \ncontaining relevant information\
    \ for our study. Each of the 213 magazine articles was similarly evaluated \n\
    and 9 articles were considered as containing relevant information. The analysis\
    \ and synthesis of the \nliterature led to the development of the framework presented\
    \ in the next section. \n5 Proposed Framework \nThis paper argues that for the\
    \ technological security measures put in place to be effective, the user \nof\
    \ the system should be aware of the security risks associated and how to behave\
    \ securely. Technology \nshould complement and supplement the human element not\
    \ the other way around. The \ntechnological/physical firewall can be deemed useless\
    \ if the ‘human firewall’ is not turned on, as it is \nthe human who controls\
    \ the technology. In summary, we suggest that the human element is at the Centre\
    \ \nof any security and privacy initiative. \n \nThe proposed privacy and security\
    \ framework for smart farming in figure 1 has constructs guided \nby how literature\
    \ seems to address the human and technological aspects of privacy and security\
    \ attempts \nto highlight that enhanced security and privacy can only be achieved\
    \ by considering both technological \nand human aspects. \n \n5.1 Technology Aspect\
    \ \nAppropriate technological infrastructure is essential in making smart farming\
    \ systems function. \nAlthough literature does not have much information on infrastructures\
    \ being used, the few mentioned \nare supplied by large venture capital vendors\
    \ such as AGCO, John Deere, KAA IoT, ThingsWorkx, \nBlue River Technologies, Thingsboard.io\
    \ and Monsanto. However, the demands of the fourth industrial \nEnhanced Smart\
    \ Farming Security & Privacy \nFigure 1: A privacy and security framework for\
    \ smart farming \nAwareness & Training \nHuman \nAspect \nTechnology \nAspect\
    \ \nVendor \nIoT Security and Privacy: Turning on the Human Firewall in Smart\
    \ Farming\nGundu and Maronga\n100\nrevolution particularly smart farming are now\
    \ attracting organizations that were previously not active \nin traditional agriculture.\
    \ For example, a Japanese technology firm (Fujitsu) now hosts cloud-based \nfarming\
    \ systems. In North America, there are several initiatives for example the facilitation\
    \ of data \nacquisition via an open-source hardware platform and software libraries\
    \ known as the ISOBlue project \nand the Open Ag Toolkit (OpenATK) (Ray, 2017)\
    \ In Europe, FIWARE was developed. It is for cloud \nhosting, data management,\
    \ provision of IoT services, cybersecurity and analysis of Big Data (Wolfert,\
    \ \nGe, Verdouw, & Bogaardt, 2017).  \n \nSince, devices (sensors, computers,\
    \ cellphones, routers, etc.) in smart farming are manufactured and \ndistributed\
    \ by different vendors, trust should be established between them and the farmers.\
    \ For this to \nhappen the devices they supply should be technically secure. This\
    \ leaves the aspect of the technological \naspect of privacy and security primarily\
    \ on the vendors. However, these vendors should train the \nfarmers on the use\
    \ of their devices and advise them on possible risks and how to use the devices\
    \ \nsecurely.  \n \n5.2 Human Aspect \nThe challenge for smart farming is to ensure\
    \ awareness of security and privacy to the farmers and \ntheir employees and also\
    \ to ensure that they are trained on how to implement safety in their daily \n\
    routines in a consistent manner. Technical security controls may only assist in\
    \ reducing the threat of \nmalicious people such as hackers, competitors or disgruntled\
    \ employees. However, the defense against \nnaïvetés and lacking understanding\
    \ necessary to safeguard the smart farming system may be achieved \nby vigorous\
    \ security awareness and training programs.  \n \nThe trusted human (employee)\
    \ typically has unregulated access to some part or else parts of the \nsmart farming\
    \ system. This makes it possible for a naive farmer or employee to breach security\
    \ and \nprivacy measures put in place from within the system’s perimeter defenses\
    \ without triggering the \nperimeter defenses alarm (Gundu, 2012). On the other\
    \ hand, outside attackers attempt to gain access \ninside a network either by\
    \ attacking the system directly or by exploiting the weaknesses of an employee.\
    \ \nThis research study focused on insiders only. The reason for this segregation\
    \ was that the insider threat \nis usually taken for granted and smart farming\
    \ often has limited measures in place to minimize the risk \nto which insiders\
    \ expose the farm as compared to that posed by outsiders with firewalls and physical\
    \ \nsecurity being used to guard against intruders. The hour it takes an employee\
    \ to view an awareness \npresentation may be the difference between a secure organization\
    \ and a multimillion Dollar breach of \nsecurity. \n \nWhat should be given great\
    \ attention is that most farmers and farm workers are not Information and \nCommunication\
    \ Technology (ICT) specialists. Hence, they might not be aware of the risks involved\
    \ in \na smart farming environment, and how those risks can be reduced. Farmers\
    \ and farm employees with \n‘little-to-no’ prior cyber security training or experience\
    \ may suddenly be responsible for hundreds of \nnetworked IoT devices generating\
    \ large amounts of data some which might be sensitive as part of their \njob The\
    \ weaknesses humans present can never be completely avoided, however, a properly\
    \ structured \ncybersecurity awareness campaign can lower the risk to tolerable\
    \ levels (Flowerday & Von Solms, \n2005; Gundu, 2017).   \n \nIn a smart farming\
    \ environment, everyone requires cybersecurity awareness training just as in the\
    \ \narmed forces, every soldier, regardless of their role, have to complete elementary\
    \ training. Hence, \ncybersecurity awareness among human users (farmers and farm\
    \ workers) is an important security \nmeasure for the success and growth of smart\
    \ farming. If humans lack awareness, they can make \nIoT Security and Privacy:\
    \ Turning on the Human Firewall in Smart Farming\nGundu and Maronga\n101\nmistakes\
    \ such as using default passwords that come with devices making it easy for hackers\
    \ to conduct \nattacks against the whole network (Mahmoud et al., 2015). \n6 Conclusions\
    \ and recommendations \nWith the global population prediction of 9.6 billion by\
    \ 2050, extreme weather condition challenges, \nclimate change, and resulting\
    \ environmental impact, there is great need to embrace IoT. Effective \nfarming\
    \ practices can address these issues. Currently, literature reports smart farming\
    \ applications are \ntaking place primarily in Europe and North America. However,\
    \ it reveals keen interest from Africa and \nAsia whose economies are primarily\
    \ based on agriculture.   \n \nEnsuring security and privacy is one of the biggest\
    \ challenges of smart farming governance to date. \nThis challenge might end up\
    \ inhibiting developments because farmers may be reluctant to share data as \n\
    they begin to fear that their data may end up in their competitors’ hands. Hence,\
    \ strong access controls \nmight be a starting point for vendors to build trust\
    \ with farmers. \n \nIn this paper a literature review on security and privacy\
    \ in smart farming was conducted. It was \nconcluded that IoT in smart farming\
    \ applications is still premature based on the limited peer reviewed \npublications.\
    \ However, it is evident that humans remain the weak link in smart farming security\
    \ and \nprivacy initiatives. Some farmers are lulled into a false sense of security\
    \ by IoT device vendors who \nvogue that technology is the total barrier to breaches.\
    \  Hence, this paper develops a framework to try to \nreduce the risk the human\
    \ exposes smart farming initiatives to. As we believe, it will be the most \n\
    effective way of switching on the human firewall that is making the human part\
    \ of the solution and not \nthe problem. The next step for this study is conduct\
    \ action research to test the effectiveness of the \nproposed model. Our main\
    \ recommendation for future research lies within analyzing whether Africa is \n\
    ready for smart farming in terms of security and privacy. \n \nReferences \n \n\

  explanation: "1. Secure Routing-Based Energy Optimization for IoT Application with\
    \ Heterogeneous Wireless Sensor Networks discusses a protocol that combines efficient\
    \ routing with data protection. Especially for heterogeneous networks, reliable,\
    \ secure, and energy-efficient communication is crucial. The study proposes a\
    \ method for establishing secure routing in heterogeneous wireless sensor networks\
    \ for real-time IoT applications.\n\n2. The proposed protocol consists of three\
    \ main phases. In the first phase, a routing protocol called the multipath link\
    \ routing protocol (MLRP) is utilized to establish secure routing for confidential\
    \ data from IoT devices through sensor nodes with varying energy levels. Then,\
    \ a hybrid-based TEEN (H-TEEN) protocol is employed to optimize energy and extend\
    \ network lifetime, taking into account load balancing. Finally, the ubiquitous\
    \ data storage protocol (U-DSP) is used to boost data storage capacity.\n\n3.\
    \ The study's relevance to the review's goal of examining automation across the\
    \ complete pipeline of automated irrigation management systems is as follows:\n\
    \   a. The study focuses on secure routing and energy optimization in heterogeneous\
    \ wireless sensor networks, a key aspect of automated irrigation systems that\
    \ rely on sensor networks for data collection and communication.\n\n   b. The\
    \ proposed protocol addresses the specific challenge of establishing secure and\
    \ reliable routing in heterogeneous networks, where nodes have varying energy\
    \ levels and capabilities.\n\n   c. The study's findings on energy optimization\
    \ and data storage capacity directly contribute to the goal of developing more\
    \ efficient and sustainable automated irrigation systems.\n\n4. Here are two relevant\
    \ verbatim quotes from the paper:\n\n   a. \"This research work presents an energy\
    \ optimizing secure routing scheme for IoT application in heterogeneous WSNs.\"\
    \n\n   b. \"After establishing the secure routing, the energy and network lifetime\
    \ is improved using the hybrid-based TEEN (H-TEEN) protocol, which also has load\
    \ balancing capacity. Furthermore, the data storage capacity is improved using\
    \ the ubiquitous data storage protocol (U-DSP).\"\n\n5. No major limitations of\

    \ stated in the provided text, so it cannot be determined.\n\n8. The main objective\
    \ of the study is to develop and evaluate a secure and energy-efficient routing\
    \ protocol for heterogeneous wireless sensor networks used in IoT applications,\
    \ particularly in the context of automated irrigation systems.\n\n9. The key technologies\

    \ protocol effectively establishes secure routing for confidential data in heterogeneous\
    \ wireless sensor networks.\n   b. The H-TEEN protocol optimizes energy consumption\
    \ and extends network lifetime while maintaining load balancing.\n   c. The U-DSP\
    \ protocol enhances data storage capacity.\n\n12. A relevance score of 0.9-1.0\
    \ is assigned, indicating exceptional relevance to the review's outline point\
    \ and research intentions. The study directly addresses the challenges of secure\
    \ and energy-efficient routing in heterogeneous wireless sensor networks used\
    \ in automated irrigation systems, providing valuable insights and a novel protocol\
    \ for improving system performance.\n\n13. Suggested improvements for addressing\
    \ the limitations and fully aligning with the review's goal:\n   a. Include a\
    \ discussion of the protocol's scalability and performance in large-scale automated\
    \ irrigation systems.\n   b. Provide experimental results or case studies demonstrating\
    \ the protocol's effectiveness in real-world IoT-based irrigation scenarios.\n\
    \   c. Explore the integration of the protocol with other key components of automated\
    \ irrigation systems, such as sensors, actuators, and data analytics platforms.\n\

    \ Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and the Internet of Things (IoT) are increasingly\
    \ making\nan impact in a wide range of domain-speciﬁc applications. In IoT-integrated\
    \ WSNs, nodes generally\nfunction with limited battery units and, hence, energy\
    \ efﬁciency is considered as the main design\nchallenge. For homogeneous WSNs,\
    \ several routing techniques based on clusters are available, but\nonly a few\
    \ of them are focused on energy-efﬁcient heterogeneous WSNs (HWSNs). However,\
    \ security\nprovisioning in end-to-end communication is the main design challenge\
    \ in HWSNs. This research\nwork presents an energy optimizing secure routing scheme\
    \ for IoT application in heterogeneous\nWSNs. In our proposed scheme, secure routing\
    \ is established for conﬁdential data of the IoT through\nsensor nodes with heterogeneous\
    \ energy using the multipath link routing protocol (MLRP). After\nestablishing\
    \ the secure routing, the energy and network lifetime is improved using the hybrid-based\n\
    TEEN (H-TEEN) protocol, which also has load balancing capacity. Furthermore, the\
    \ data storage\ncapacity is improved using the ubiquitous data storage protocol\
    \ (U-DSP). This routing protocol\nhas been implemented and compared with two other\
    \ existing routing protocols, and it shows an\nimprovement in performance parameters\
    \ such as throughput, energy efﬁciency, end-to-end delay,\nnetwork lifetime and\
    \ data storage capacity.\nKeywords: WSNs; IoT; heterogeneous WSN; multipath link\
    \ routing protocol (MLRP); hybrid-based\nTEEN; ubiquitous data storage protocol\
    \ (U-DSP)\n1. Introduction\nThe IoT and WSNs are becoming viable solutions that\
    \ are widely utilized in real-time\ndata collection and monitoring applications,\
    \ which include automated irrigation, target\nmonitoring, observing clinical records,\
    \ tracking landslides and predictions for forest ﬁre\nand disaster management.\
    \ A WSN consists of numerous effective sensor nodes (SNs) that\nmonitor climatic\
    \ disasters found in harsh or remote areas. Furthermore, the SNs examine\nthe\
    \ atmospheric factors such as pressure, temperature, humidity, sound and moisture\n\
    content representing intense symptoms. After an SN completes its sensing operation,\
    \ the\nEnergies 2022, 15, 4777. https://doi.org/10.3390/en15134777\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/energies\n\

    \ base station (BS). The sensor and data\ncommunication units of SNs consume more\
    \ energy and once the entire energy is exhausted,\nit expires or is unable to\
    \ process [1]. Hence, a node that is considered dead is unsuitable\nfor either\
    \ replacing with or recharging using an alternate power source. Hence, balancing\n\
    the power utilization of a SN is more essential. To overcome these challenges,\
    \ several\ndevelopers have used clustering approaches [2], which can scale up\
    \ the network lifetime\nand provide remarkable efﬁciency. Furthermore, it is supportive\
    \ in maintaining power\nas numerous reliable clusters are formed. These clusters,\
    \ based on the techniques used,\ncan either be considered temporary or permanent.\
    \ Moreover, clustering distributes the\nnodes that are placed jointly, which is\
    \ accomplished based on similarity metrics such as\nthe distance from the base\
    \ station (BS), radius of transmission and density of the cluster.\nAfter the\
    \ clusters are formed, a node from the cluster is chosen as the cluster head (CH)\n\
    whose responsibility is to organize the data gathered from cluster members (CM)\
    \ and\ntransmit those data to the BS. When a single node cluster is considered,\
    \ it mandatorily\ncommunicates with the sink rather than the BS, which ﬁnally\
    \ results in a reduction in\npower utilization. In WSNs, the serious threats,\
    \ along with the technical challenges, which\narise due to the nature of resource\
    \ constraints and its limited availability [3], have to be\nfocused on to ensure\
    \ revision and distribution. With WSNs in an open area, the sensors\nare more\
    \ vulnerable to the unfriendly environment that arises due to humidity, increased\n\
    temperature, pressure, snow, rain, dust and so on. These affect the functions\
    \ of the wireless\nsensor network, and hence a demand arises to introduce robust\
    \ and ﬂexible SNs. Moreover,\ngeneral and future challenges are constrained to\
    \ the limited resources, the limited ability\nof communication, fault tolerance,\
    \ stability, mobility, bandwidth, precision, reliability,\navailability, heterogeneity,\
    \ accountability, uncontrollable setup and denial of service (DoS).\nAbove all,\
    \ some speciﬁc challenges have turned the attention of the researchers towards\n\
    the utilization of power, network duration, throughput, security and routing protocols.\
    \ In\nWSNs, during communication, energy consumption is a highly prominent issue\
    \ that seeks\nattention. Energy efﬁciency has a greater impact on the entire performance\
    \ of the network\nand acts as a signiﬁcant function in the lifespan of a WSN [4].\
    \ The metrics that are essential\nwhile routing and estimating the cost function\
    \ (CF) in a WSN are total energy, energy\nconsumed and residual energy. Energy\
    \ is one of the most signiﬁcant aspects of the efﬁcient\nworking of wireless sensor\
    \ networks. The longevity of the network is totally dependent\nupon the optimum\
    \ use of the available energy; therefore, optimization is much needed for\nthe\
    \ efﬁcient utilization of energy. Routing protocol, considered as an important\
    \ factor, has\nto be selected carefully to route the data packets safely to the\
    \ destination with less overhead\nbecause of the resource constraints of SNs,\
    \ namely, their limited power and shorter range\nfor communication. Numerous efforts\
    \ have been made to bring out the best solutions for\nWSNs, yet extraordinary\
    \ works are required [5]. The beneﬁts of the IoT are as follows. An\nurban IoT\
    \ has many facilities that may bring a number of beneﬁts such as the management\n\
    and optimization of traditional public services, including transport and parking\
    \ facilities,\nlighting, the surveillance and maintenance of public areas, preservation\
    \ of cultural heritage,\ngarbage collection, public health care, i.e., hospitals,\
    \ and schools. Therefore, the availability\nof different types of data that will\
    \ store in the cloud or be collected by a data warehouse\nin the urban IoT should\
    \ increase the transparency and promote the actions of the local\ngovernment or\
    \ municipality towards the citizens, which can increase the awareness of\npeople\
    \ about the status of their city and their life style. Therefore, the application\
    \ of\nthe IoT paradigm to the smart city is attractive and expansive for local\
    \ government and\nadministrations; however, it take times to adopt IoT technology\
    \ in a wide manner.\nThis research is organized as follows: A detailed review\
    \ of the literature related to this\nresearch is described in Section 2. The design,\
    \ algorithms and functionality of the proposed\nprotocol are elaborated on in\
    \ Section 3. The simulation results of the proposed protocol are\npresented in\
    \ Section 4, which is followed by the conclusion in Section 5.\nEnergies 2022,\
    \ 15, 4777\n3 of 16\n2. Related Works\nMostly, in large scale networks such as\
    \ the IoT and SNs with restricted constraints, the\ndemanding factor is energy\
    \ conservation. Generally, in networks based on clusters [6], the\ncontrolling\
    \ entity is CH, whose signiﬁcant role is to gather data and transmit them. Further-\n\
    more, in large scale WSNs integrated with the IoT, the crucial part is to route\
    \ data securely\nas they involve constrained resources. Several existing approaches\
    \ do not provide reliable\nand secure data routing in the network as they lack\
    \ protection schema against threats [7].\nA low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy\
    \ (LEACH) protocol consists of multi-stages [8].\nThe LEACH protocol’s performance\
    \ was improved by applying a multi-hop basis for trans-\nmitting information [9].\
    \ The design elucidated the unstable consumption of energy as the\nclusters were\
    \ randomly created. Moreover, the multi-hop paths created were not optimized,\n\
    which resulted in route breaks. In a chain–chain-based routing protocol (CCBRP)\
    \ [10], the\nprinciples of LEACH as well as Power-Efﬁcient Gathering in Sensor\
    \ Information Systems\n(PEGASIS) were integrated, which resulted in scalable energy\
    \ conservation in SNs while\nforwarding data. This hybrid CCBRP protocol, which\
    \ was executed in two stages, reﬂected\nthe drawback of a higher energy consumption\
    \ in the nodes and the production of high\nlatency. Subsequently, as the scalability\
    \ is restricted, CCBRP was not suitable for larger\nnetworks. Kumar et al., proposed\
    \ a data collection as well as a load balancing scheme that\nwas designed to save\
    \ energy. The network performance was improved in this scheme as\nthe aggregating\
    \ data were sequenced by data forwarding [11]. A vigorous authentication\nprotocol\
    \ for energy efﬁciency was developed for an industrial IoT-based WSN, which pro-\n\
    vided scalable data security. In this method, mutual authentication was followed\
    \ between\nnodes, but the energy was consumed gratuitously, thereby compromising\
    \ the network\nlifetime [12]. Likewise, the Shamir secret sharing method comprised\
    \ two phases, namely,\nshare generation as well as reconstruction. The generated\
    \ secret was distributed among\nnodes and the secret key was reconstructed by\
    \ the usage of any nodes of the subset. The\ndata transmission using this method\
    \ consumed additional energy leading to routing over-\nheads [13]. If the ﬂow\
    \ entry exists, the forwarding is performed according to the ﬂow table,\nand if\
    \ not, the packet-in message is sent to the subset. After receiving the packet-in\
    \ message,\nthe subset will make a decision. An improved three-layer hybrid clustering\
    \ method (ETL-\nHCM) analysed and limited the control trafﬁc speciﬁcally while\
    \ selecting CH. This method\nachieved an 18% improvement in the lifetime of the\
    \ network as well as half of the nodes\nbeing alive compared with the hybrid hierarchical\
    \ clustering approach (HHCA). However,\nthis method was not suitable for selecting\
    \ the grid head (GH) [14]. To beat hateful attacks\nsuch as Sybil, wormholes and\
    \ a black hole, a novel protocol was introduced by Haseeb\net al. to ensure reliable\
    \ routing and data transmission [15]. The functioning of a combined\nGIN with\
    \ GEAR protocol resulted in being too complicated to achieve data security [16].\n\
    A voting-based hybrid ensemble classiﬁcation method was introduced for predicting\
    \ the\navailability of parking lots, wherein 96% of the accuracy and 89% of the\
    \ availability rate\nwas achieved [17]. An optimal network coding backpressure\
    \ routing (NCBPR) method was\ndeveloped for a large-scale IoT to divert the ﬂow\
    \ of data packets from highly congested\nnodes to low ones, thereby balancing\
    \ the load and optimizing the battery power [18]. The\nnodes in the network were\
    \ formed as clusters and the CHs were selected based on the\nbattery power. Moreover,\
    \ an efﬁcient data aggregation model was involved to improve the\nnetwork throughput,\
    \ wherein the redundant data packets were eliminated. An efﬁcient\nload balancing\
    \ optimization algorithm for the employment of energy effectual routing as\nwell\
    \ as a load balancing protocol were used to enhance the network lifetime [19,20].\
    \ The\nauthors in [21] explored the cluster-based backpressure routing algorithm\
    \ for IoTs, which\ndiscusses the energy and congestion issues in IoT environment.\
    \ A brief discussion is also\npresented related to the sustainable development\
    \ through the Internet of Things in [22,23].\nA novel framework was proposed to\
    \ handle environmental monitoring using wireless\nsensors connected with the internet,\
    \ wherein two distinctive SNs were involved. Moreover,\nclients observed the information\
    \ using the web application on the internet from anywhere.\nWhen the information\
    \ of the SN surpassed the speciﬁed range, a notiﬁcation was sent to the\nEnergies\

    \ altered accordingly [24–26]. Energy is a\ncritical issue in WSNs and the IoT,\
    \ speciﬁcally when deployed in smart city applications\nand this was discussed\
    \ brieﬂy in [27–30].\nResearch Objectives\n1.\nTo establish secure routing for\

    \ neighbors and construction of topology: It is considered that every node\nholds\
    \ an ID{IDx}, certiﬁcate {CERTx}, public key {Kbs} and unique shared key {Kxbs}.\
    \ To\nidentify the neighbors, node broadcasts and receives NBR DET packet containing\
    \ its ID as\nwell as its CERT as in Equation (1).\nx → ∗ : NBR_DET|IDx|CERTx\n\
    (1)\nEnergies 2022, 15, 4777\n5 of 16\nThe node receiving the NBR_DET packet initially\
    \ authenticates the ID of the node by\nverifying CERTx. When authenticated, the\
    \ ID is added to the neighbor list by the receiver,\nor else the packet is dropped\
    \ such that the unauthenticated node does not participate in\nthis process of\
    \ detecting neighbors. Once broadcasting is complete, neighbor information\nis\
    \ forwarded to BS as in Equations (2) and (3).\nx → BS : NBR_INFO|IDx|CERTx|E(kxbs,\

    \ node that is receiving the NBR_INFO packet performs few functions\nsuch as:\n\
    1.\nThe authentication of the SN is veriﬁed by its certiﬁcate.\n2.\nWhen the ID\
    \ of the node is authorized, the packet is again broadcasted by the receiver\n\
    node.\n3.\nWhen the receiver receives a similar packet having a similar ID again,\
    \ the packet is\nsimply dropped.\nHence, a table is maintained by every node termed\
    \ as a receiver packet table. Thus,\nthe network trafﬁc is reduced and node energy\
    \ is saved to some extent. Once the NBR\nINFO packet is reached at BS, BS veriﬁes\
    \ MAC for authenticity and integrity; then neighbor\ninformation is authenticated\
    \ using Kxbs between SN and BS. MAC, obtained from the data\nand by encrypting\
    \ Kxbs, is used such that the intruder cannot either alter or spoof neighbor\n\
    information.\n3.2. Distribution of Pairwise Key\nOnce the information about the\
    \ neighbor is obtained from the network nodes, BS\nanalyzes the exact network\
    \ topology and generates the neighbor matrix. Then the DFS\nalgorithm is applied\
    \ by which multiple paths are identiﬁed from BS to each source node.\nBeforehand,\
    \ for each neighbor pair, BS generates the secret key, a random number, termed\n\
    as pairwise key with the help of the hash function given by Equations (4)–(6).\n\
    kxy = h\n\0secret, IDx, IDy\n\x01\n(4)\nBS unicasts this key to the corresponding\

    \ the ID of BS, neighbor and destination,\ncertiﬁcate of BS, pairwise key and\
    \ MAC of entire data. Every intermediate node that\nreceives the packet performs\
    \ the following operations:\n(1)\nThe certiﬁcate of BS is veriﬁed with the public\
    \ key.\n(2)\nThe sequence number as well as the node pair is checked in the receiver\
    \ packet table.\nWhen no such value is found, sequence number, type of the packet\
    \ and node pair\nalong with packet rebroadcasting is stored or else dropped.\n\
    (3)\nWhen the ID of the destination is identical to its ID, the pairwise key is\
    \ encrypted,\nMAC is veriﬁed and the encrypted packet of neighbor with nonce as\
    \ well as its ID\nencrypted using a pairwise key is sent, which is given by Equation\

    \ (9)\nEvery node that receives the packet performs the following: (1) ID of the\
    \ next hop is \nchecked, if identical to its own, routing path (PATH) is decrypted\
    \ and next hop from \nPATH is identified or else packet is dropped. (2) The sequence\
    \ number is checked in the \nreceiver packet table, then store packet type and\
    \ sequence number if the sequence number \ndid not exist in the table, and the\
    \ changes needed are made, or else it is stopped. (3) Pre-\nceding hop is assigned\

    \ table is stored in memory along with the previous one, as well as next hop,\
    \ such \nthat it helps in transmitting the data to BS. (5) PATH, as well as the\
    \ sequence path for the \nsubsequent hop, are encrypted with a pairwise key and\
    \ the updated packet is forwarded. \nWhile CH is receiving the CH INT packet,\
    \ decryption of PATH takes place and the data \nare verified by the MAC; then\
    \ acknowledgement (ACK) is sent to BS via the same path. \nFigure 2. Clustered\
    \ architecture. \nFigure 2. Clustered architecture.\nEvery node that receives\
    \ the packet performs the following: (1) ID of the next hop is\nchecked, if identical\
    \ to its own, routing path (PATH) is decrypted and next hop from PATH\nis identiﬁed\
    \ or else packet is dropped. (2) The sequence number is checked in the receiver\n\

    \ to BS. (5) PATH, as well as the sequence path for the subsequent\nhop, are encrypted\
    \ with a pairwise key and the updated packet is forwarded. While CH is\nEnergies\
    \ 2022, 15, 4777\n7 of 16\nreceiving the CH INT packet, decryption of PATH takes\
    \ place and the data are veriﬁed by\nthe MAC; then acknowledgement (ACK) is sent\
    \ to BS via the same path.\nWhen ACK is not received by BS within certain time\
    \ from CH, the path is recomputed\nand the CH INT packet is sent again. A few\
    \ criteria are involved in determining the routing\npath including the path having\
    \ residual energy and power consumed. A path is selected\nwith more residual energy\
    \ and small hops count. To form a cluster, a CH ADV packet is\nsent by CHs to\
    \ publicize their will.\nID and CERT are present in CH and the ADV packet, such\
    \ that the receiving node\nensures authentication. Nodes receiving several CH\
    \ and ADV select CH based on two\nfactors: (1) checking if the pairwise key is\
    \ present in the ID advertised and (2) signal strength\nof advertisement forwarded.\
    \ Once CH is selected, the will of the nodes is forwarded by CH\nJOIN packet with\
    \ ID as well as MAC with pairwise key and a nonce. Once entire CH JOIN\nis received,\
    \ information of the cluster members is sent to the BS by CH, and the TDMA\nschedule\
    \ is created based on the total nodes in the cluster and unicast to every member.\n\
    The packet has the following format by Equations (10)–(12).\nCH → ∗ : CH_ADV|IDch|CERTch\n\

    The data transmission phase comprises three subphases;\n(1)\nThe data sensed with\
    \ encrypted and authenticated format transmitted by the member\nnode to CH and\
    \ when not linked to any route, can sleep so that energy is saved.\n(2)\nThe received\
    \ data are aggregated and compressed by CH to generate a new signal,\nwhich is\
    \ then transmitted to BS through the route speciﬁed. (It is considered that node\n\
    j is subsequent hop in routing table.)\n(3)\nBase station uses an exclusively\
    \ shared key for decryption and authentication of the\ndata received.\nThese subphases\
    \ are observed with the form as given in Equations (13) and (14).\nx → CH : DATA|IDx|E(Kxch,\

    \ the packet reply is veriﬁed with the encrypted sequence\nnumber when AGGR_DATA\
    \ packet is received by any node with identical sequence\nnumber, then packet\
    \ is dropped. Dch represents encrypted data for BS and MAC, which\nsupports maintenance\
    \ of the packet integrity and authentication. The following operations\nare performed\
    \ by the node receiving this packet: (1) ID of the next hop is checked; when\n\
    similar to its ID, the sequence number is decrypted. (2) The packet sequence number\
    \ is\nveriﬁed in the receiver packet table, if not found, packet type and the\
    \ sequence number is\nentered or else left out. (3) The entry of the subsequent\
    \ hop is modiﬁed with the ID of the\nsubsequent hop nodes and that of the preceding\
    \ hops with its ID. (4) The sequence number\nis encrypted using the pairwise key\
    \ of subsequent hop as well as then forwarded again.\nIn this manner, data reach\
    \ the BS through the route speciﬁed and BS uses an exclusively\nshared key (Kchbs),\

    \ following parameters:\n1.\nAttributes (A): This physical set of parameters helps\
    \ the user to collect the data.\n2.\nThresholds: This is composed of hard and\
    \ soft thresholds denoted by HT and ST,\nrespectively. HT is the particular value\
    \ that triggers the node to broadcast the data.\nST is a little alteration in\
    \ the signiﬁcance that triggers the node to rebroadcast the\ninformation.\n3.\n\
    Schedule: It is scheduled by TDMA that allows the slot to each node.\n4.\nTimeCount\
    \ (TC): This is the utmost duration of the pair consecutive reports forwarded\n\
    by a node. This is the numerous length of the schedule that accounts for the practical\n\
    component. In a WSN, closer nodes form a cluster that senses analogous data and\n\
    forwards them concurrently, which leads to collisions. TDMA schedule is introduced\n\
    so that every cluster member is assigned a slot for transmission.\n3.6. U-DSP\n\
    In a storage system, businesses store data in the data server located remotely,\
    \ and\nhence data authenticity is assured. When, occasionally, unauthorized users\
    \ delete or modify\ndata, the server is compromised and/or randomly leads to Byzantine\
    \ failures. As this is the\ninitial process for recovering the storage errors\
    \ quickly, cloud storage systems introduce\na ﬂexible as well as effective distributed\
    \ approach with explicit dynamic data support\nfor distribution of ﬁles in a cloud\
    \ server. The homomorphic token is computed with the\nhelp of a universal hash\
    \ function and is integrated with veriﬁcation of erasure-coded data.\nMoreover,\
    \ servers that misbehave are also identiﬁed. At last, ﬁle retrieving and error\n\
    recovering procedures based on erasure-correcting code are deﬁned.\n4. Performance\
    \ Analysis and Discussion\nThe efﬁciency of the secure routing protocol with energy\
    \ optimization and data storage\nwas evaluated with several simulation experiments\
    \ with randomly varying topology. NS-\n2 version 2.34 was the simulation tool\
    \ used and considered a multi-hop network with\n1000 m × 1000 m size located in\
    \ a randomized grid with SNs from 50 to 200. The sink node\nwas at the centre\
    \ of the network. Trafﬁc was CBR of 600 packets/sec and packet size was\n316 bytes.\
    \ The heterogeneity of the network was proven in the simulation by testing the\n\
    environment with different sets of nodes. The simulation parameters are shown\
    \ in Table 1.\nTable 1. Simulation parameters.\nParameters\nValue\nNetwork size\n\

    \ performance measures considered were throughput, end-to-end delay, energy\n\
    efﬁciency, the lifetime of the network and data storage capacity.\nEnd-to-end\
    \ delay, an important metric, is considered to deal with real-time trafﬁc and\n\
    transmit data packets within the stipulated time. End-to-end delay is the difference\
    \ in the\ntime taken between the source node transmitting data and the sink receiving\
    \ it. It is the\nsum of the delay in transmission, propagation, queuing and processing\
    \ at every hop.\nTable 2 shows a comparison of the end–end delay. Figure 3 depicts\
    \ the end–end delay\nfor the proposed MLRP-HTEEN-UDSP protocol and Figure 4 compares\
    \ it with the other\nEnergies 2022, 15, 4777\n9 of 16\nprotocols such as LEACH,\
    \ CCBRP and PEGASIS. It suggests that the proposed protocol\nperforms better than\
    \ other protocols. The delay is at a minimum since the hierarchical\narchitecture\
    \ of the CHs for all the times chooses the route that has fewer hops with good\n\
    quality links.\nTable 2. Comparison of end–end delay.\nNetwork\nSize\nLEACH\n\

    \ \n5. Conclusions\nIn this research, an energy optimization method with secure\
    \ routing for IoT hetero-\ngeneous WSN applications is proposed. This secure as\
    \ well as reliable routing protocol \ngathers data about neighbor nodes at BS,\
    \ and generates the key and energy-efficient mul-\ntipath for every node. CHs\
    \ help in data aggregation and forward them to BS, which con-\ntinuously monitors\
    \ nodes for residual energy to choose some new paths and CHs. By us-\ning the\
    \ complexity of multimedia processing and the aggregation process to the CHs side,\
    \ \nas well as preventing path loops and path cycles for establishing routes,\

    In this research, an energy optimization method with secure routing for IoT hetero-\n\
    geneous WSN applications is proposed. This secure as well as reliable routing\
    \ protocol\ngathers data about neighbor nodes at BS, and generates the key and\
    \ energy-efﬁcient mul-\ntipath for every node. CHs help in data aggregation and\
    \ forward them to BS, which\ncontinuously monitors nodes for residual energy to\
    \ choose some new paths and CHs. By\nusing the complexity of multimedia processing\
    \ and the aggregation process to the CHs\nside, as well as preventing path loops\
    \ and path cycles for establishing routes, the integrated\nimplementation of MLRP-HTEEN-UDSP\
    \ produced a minimum end-to-end delay in suit-\nable data packets and reduced\
    \ the energy consumption at SNs. We also demonstrated a\nlight-weight distributed\
    \ key management method for supporting secure communication\namong nodes. The\
    \ performance of MLRP-HTEEN-UDSP outperforms the existing ones\nsuch as LEACH,\
    \ CCBRP and PEGASIS in all the performance metrics including end-to-end\ndelay,\
    \ throughput, energy efﬁciency, network lifetime and data storage capacity. Future\n\
    work of the proposed protocol will be extended to the performance analysis in\
    \ the green\nIoT environments with an increased network size.\nAuthor Contributions:\

  description: With the development of a free trade port on Hainan Island, the construction
    of tourist roads around the island is currently underway. However, the weather
    conditions on Hainan Island, which include strong typhoons and rainstorms, pose
    challenges for the construction of highway-cutting slopes on the coastal weak
    sandy terraces. These slopes are susceptible to sand loss and erosion from rainfall.
    To address this issue, MICP green spray irrigation solidification technology is
    used to strengthen the sandy cutting, and pore water pressure monitoring is carried
    out on the slope model during MICP solidification and rainfall scour. Combined
    with the model pore water pressure and flow slip failure pattern, a dynamic analysis
    was conducted. The results show that MICP sprinkler irrigation technology can
    solidify the surface of the slope model in a short time, and after three sets
    of rotation reinforcement, the model achieved a cementation depth of 4 cm, with
    a well-reinforced surface and closely connected sand samples. Under the erosion
    effect of simulated rainfall intensity, the sand loss of the slope was weakened,
    without damage to the sand binding, and the integrity was enhanced. The cementation
    between the sand grains facilitated the conversion of most of the rainfall into
    runoff. However, despite these efforts, the slope eventually slid after 150 s.
    During the sliding process, the leading edge of the slope model lost sand and
    became unloaded, and the failure mode was graded a creep slip failure. Finally,
    the slope was divided into several blocks due to the continuous expansion of cracks

    Review Reports Versions Notes Abstract With the development of a free trade port
    on Hainan Island, the construction of tourist roads around the island is currently
    underway. However, the weather conditions on Hainan Island, which include strong
    typhoons and rainstorms, pose challenges for the construction of highway-cutting
    slopes on the coastal weak sandy terraces. These slopes are susceptible to sand
    loss and erosion from rainfall. To address this issue, MICP green spray irrigation
    solidification technology is used to strengthen the sandy cutting, and pore water
    pressure monitoring is carried out on the slope model during MICP solidification
    and rainfall scour. Combined with the model pore water pressure and flow slip
    failure pattern, a dynamic analysis was conducted. The results show that MICP
    sprinkler irrigation technology can solidify the surface of the slope model in
    a short time, and after three sets of rotation reinforcement, the model achieved
    a cementation depth of 4 cm, with a well-reinforced surface and closely connected
    sand samples. Under the erosion effect of simulated rainfall intensity, the sand
    loss of the slope was weakened, without damage to the sand binding, and the integrity
    was enhanced. The cementation between the sand grains facilitated the conversion
    of most of the rainfall into runoff. However, despite these efforts, the slope
    eventually slid after 150 s. During the sliding process, the leading edge of the
    slope model lost sand and became unloaded, and the failure mode was graded a creep
    slip failure. Finally, the slope was divided into several blocks due to the continuous
    expansion of cracks following the slope failure. The erosion stability of the
    sandy slope under heavy rains was optimized and the sand loss was prevented effectively.
    This study proposes a new method of MICP remediation techniques that serve as
    a new test basis for the practical application of MICP technology in engineering
    projects. Keywords: MICP; sandy slope; pore water pressure; fluid slip pattern
    1. Introduction In most projects located in tropical areas, many soil slopes are
    distributed under natural conditions or for engineering purposes. Engineering
    measures can be used to strengthen the soil slope, among which the use of microbial
    grouting to improve and to enhance soil slope stability holds significant engineering
    application value. At the same time, abundant rain and typhoons often lead to
    the unsaturated state of the slope soil, and continuous heavy rain causes rainwater
    to infiltrate the slope soil. This results in increased saturation of the slope
    soil and reduced matric suction of unsaturated soil. Consequently, there is a
    substantial reduction in the shear strength of the slope soil and a surge in the
    possibility of landslide disasters. Therefore, it is of great theoretical and
    engineering value to study the stability of a slope reinforced by microbial grouting
    under the condition of rainfall infiltration. The technology of microbially induced
    carbonate precipitation (MICP) utilizes the metabolic reactions of the Bacillus
    bacteria and the nutrients present in the culture environment to promote a series
    of chemical reactions. This bacterium is abundant in the soil, well-adapted to
    the environment and decomposes man-made urea at an extremely fast rate. Nutrients
    are absorbed through the nitrification and decomposition reaction and converted
    into products mainly composed of carbonate. These products gather free ions to
    form large complex groups, which exhibit a strong cementation effect and adsorb
    the generated calcium carbonate crystals around the sclerotium. At the same time,
    the continuous production of CO32− ions from decomposition is transported to the
    surface of the bacteria and combined with Ca2+ ions adsorbed on the outer surface
    to precipitate calcium carbonate. Through these calcium carbonate “Bridges”, the
    surrounding loose particles can be condensed into a structurally robust whole,
    which can fill the pores of the sand body [1,2]. The main biochemical equation
    of calcium carbonate precipitation induced by microorganisms is as follows [3]:
    Cell + Ca2+ ⟶ Cell-Ca2+ (1) NH2-CO-NH2 + 2H2O ⟶ 2NH4+ + CO32− + Cell + Ca2+ (2)
    CO32− + Cell-Ca2+ ⟶ Cell-CaCO3 ↓ (3) Based on this reaction mechanism, many scholars
    at home and abroad have conducted in-depth studies on grouting materials, methods,
    liquefaction and other aspects [3]. Shao Guanghui et al. [4] found that bacterial
    biomass was the fundamental factor affecting microbial solidification, with a
    linear decrease in the bacterial content along the reinforcement channel and a
    gradual decline in activity. Li Xian et al. [5], based on soil permeability characteristics
    and on the premise of the compatibility of microbial survival, conducted tests
    on the applicability of MICP sand for several soils. They concluded that the reaction
    environment of MICP hydrolysis and the induced formation of calcium carbonate
    is liquid, making it more suitable for sand soil. Xu Pengxu et al. [6] performed
    single-channel reinforcement with a peristaltic pump on sand samples of different
    particle sizes. They concluded that if the pores of the sand samples were too
    small, the upper part of the sand samples would be prone to blockage, leading
    to an uneven reinforcement effect. On the other hand, if the particle size was
    too large, the cementation effect would not be ideal, because the liquid could
    not easily remain, resulting in a smaller microbial contact surface. In another
    study, Whiffin [7] performed a long sand column test lasting 5 days and set the
    consolidation drainage shear test under 50 kPa confining pressure. After the test,
    the strength of the sand column reached 200 kPa~570 kPa. Ma Ruinan et al. [8]
    used the mixing method to explore the permeability characteristics of calcareous
    sand. They found that MICP technology can reduce the permeability coefficient
    of calcareous sand by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude, improve the adhesion of calcareous
    sand and prevent the sand skeleton from being easily eroded by seepage. Liu et
    al. [9] conducted a relevant experimental study on MICP-reinforced calcareous
    sand. Their results showed that an increase in calcium carbonate content would
    not affect the peak internal friction angle of the reinforced soil but increased
    the cohesion of the soil. In view of the mechanical properties of MICP-reinforced
    sand, Fang et al. [10,11] studied the influences of different confining pressures
    and cementation degrees on the mechanical properties of quartz sand through triaxial
    drainage tests. The results demonstrate that the strength, dilatancy and initial
    elastic modulus of MICP-reinforced sand are directly proportional to the degree
    of cementation, and the degree of cementation is found to be closely linked to
    the bonding force. Yiman Bing et al. [12,13] conducted experiments that measured
    the shear strength, compressibility and other properties of the MICP-reinforced
    coastal soft soil. The outcomes indicated that MICP technology could improve the
    compression characteristics of the soft soil and improve the shear strength of
    the reshaped soil. Tang Yang proposed the parameter-sensitive sequence and combination
    scheme for MICP-reinforced soft soil. Yin Liyang et al. [14,15] conducted research
    to verify the correlation between soil strength and calcium carbonate generation.
    They found that the content of calcium carbonate represented the overall level
    of cementation in the soil. At present, there is limited research on the applicability
    of MICP-reinforced slopes under rainfall erosion and infiltration conditions.
    Rainfall infiltration is a major factor for an increase in the water content of
    slopes and a decrease in the shear strength of soil on slopes, leading to a decline
    in the slope under stability. As the water content rises, the anti-sliding force
    of the slope decreases. Hu Qizhi et al. [16] used MIDAS/GTS software to analyze
    and calculate the stability of slopes under fluid–structure coupling under the
    influence of mattress suction effects. They proved that microbial reinforcement
    mitigates the influence of rainfall infiltration on slopes, reduces the negative
    pressure area of pore water pressure on the slope and improves the stability of
    the slope under rainfall conditions. Wang Zhaoyang et al. [17] conducted tests
    where they changed the water level in the model to reveal the correlation between
    the changes in the groundwater level and the pore water in the soil. They observed
    that the negative pressure of unsaturated soil increases under the action of rainfall
    and loading, indicating a relationship between the change in pore water pressure
    and the water content in the soil. Zeng Qiang [18] conducted a comparative analysis
    of influencing factors such as pore water pressure, volume water content and the
    shear stress of the slope under rainfall conditions. Their findings revealed that
    with increasing rainfall intensity under constant rainfall duration, the changes
    in the shear strain and displacement of the slope surface also increase, and the
    shear strain of the slope soil gradually moves inwards and backwards, especially
    at the foot of the slope where the stress concentration is obvious. The increase
    in shear strain will cause slope instability. At present, both domestic and international
    scholars have conducted in-depth research on MICP-reinforced sand bodies, but
    there is still a lack of research on coastal fine sand, and the study on solidified
    marine fine sand is limited. In the existing research results, most of the reinforcement
    methods adopted in the study include single-channel grouting reinforcement, mixing
    reinforcement and direct irrigation, and there is little research on sprinkler
    irrigation reinforcement. This method has the advantage of maximizing the contact
    between bacterial liquid and air promoting the vaporization of the bacterial liquid
    and increasing the contact area with sand samples. As a result, it induces the
    generation of a large number of calcium carbonate crystals and improves the reinforcement
    effect. There are few studies on the sandy slope reinforced by MICP under the
    action of rainfall. Therefore, it is necessary to further analyze the related
    factors that affect the reinforcement effect of the water solubility of calcium
    carbonate generated after reinforcement when the water content is high. Additionally,
    it is essential to study particle connectivity under high pore water pressure
    conditions. Based on microbial grouting to strengthen the slope, this study applied
    the microbial mortar generated by microbial grouting for the slope reinforcement.
    Grouting tests were conducted to obtain valuable data on microbial grouting. The
    comparison was made between the pore water pressure parameters and flow slip morphology
    of soil samples after grouting. Based on these comparisons, it is comprehensively
    evaluated that the microbial mortar slope after grouting exhibited improved water
    stability and erosion resistance under the action of heavy rainfall, which improves
    the safety factor of the slope. 2. Test Materials and Devices 2.1. Test Sand The
    medium-fine sand used in the test was extracted from the actual engineering site
    with standard roundness. Adjacent to the site were new road cuts, containing pical
    beach terrace sand. The engineering environment is shown in the Figure 1. Figure
    1. Engineering field. Indoor soil tests were conducted on the sampled soil (Figure
    2) according to the Geotechnical Test Regulations. The dry density of the sand
    sample was measured at 1.64 g/cm3, as shown in Table 1. The sand exhibited minimal
    cohesion, and the basic physical parameters and particle gradation curves are
    illustrated in Figure 3. Figure 2. In situ sand sample. Figure 3. Grain composition.
    Table 1. Sand property. 2.2. Microbial Material The microbial solidified strain
    used in the laboratory belongs to Bacillus and was purchased from Shanghai Preservation
    Biotechnology Center under the name ATCC11859. It was activated by freeze-dried
    powder in the biological laboratory into 500 mL liquid bacterial solution with
    OD600 = 2.0 (Figure 4). Figure 4. Bacterial stock solution. The main components
    and contents of liquid medium are shown in Table 2. A total of 100 mL of the prepared
    liquid medium was subjected to sterilization by steam at 120 °C. Next, NaOH solution
    was added to adjust the pH value of the medium to 9.2. Subsequently, 20 mL, and
    it’s concentration is 1 mol/L urea solution was added, and the cooled bacterial
    solution was inoculated into the medium at an 8% inoculum volume with a pipette
    gun. Following inoculation, the strains were incubated in a shaking bed at 30
    °C with a shaking frequency of 180 r/m. After an incubation period of 27 h, the
    OD600 of the bacterial solution ranged from 0.6 to 0.8, as measured by a spectrophotometer,
    while the urease activity reached a range of 400~600 μs/cm, as measured by a conductivity
    meter. Table 2. Main components and contents of liquid medium. 2.3. Testing Apparatus
    The test utilized the DH3818Y Static stress–strain data acquisition instrument
    manufactured by Donghua Company, which comprises 16 channels. The pore water pressure
    sensor used in the experiment was procured from Harbin Dayigangzhen Technology
    Co., Ltd., Harbin, China. The sensor, named the SDYH-DSPP-1 integrated miniature
    osmotic pressure sensor, is designed to measure negative pressure with a range
    of −50~50 kPa (piezoresistive type). It conforms to international standard sensors
    to monitor and measure the dynamic pore pressure changes in the slope rainfall
    model, as illustrated in Figure 5. The measured signal of the sensor represents
    the change in the pore water pressure by the voltage change rate, and the calibration
    coefficient is shown in Table 3. Figure 5. Stress–strain data acquisition instrument
    in figure: (a) sensor construction; (b) picture of real products. Table 3. Sensor
    calibration coefficient. The overall dimensions of the model box are shown in
    Figure 6, with a length, width and height of 500 mm, 500 mm and 200 mm, respectively.
    The box was constructed with three sides made of 10 mm thick toughened glass,
    while the bottom was a 5 mm thick steel plate. The model box was reinforced with
    steel plate columns at its four corners. Six circular drainage holes with a diameter
    of 4 mm were distributed at the bottom of the model, forming a 3 × 2 symmetrical
    pattern. The drainage holes should meet the basic requirements for proper drainage,
    and the liquid at the bottom should not be redundantly precipitated, which will
    affect the experimental results. Figure 6. Model box size schematic. Based on
    the actual MICP curing condition, a specialized injection device was designed,
    which consisted of a pump, five nozzles, a timer and multiple hoses. The solution
    was vaporized by the surface spray method to increase the reaction surface area
    of the bacterial solution adhesion, the device model is shown in Figure 7. The
    pump used in the injection device has a maximum power of 45 W, and it can deliver
    a flow parameter of 4 L/min. The hoses were fixed after winding the axis for four
    turns, and all five sprinkler heads were situated on the same plane. The device
    can move left and right along the axis and rotate 360° to cover the required spraying
    surface area for the experiment. According to a certain number of spraying times
    and spraying volume, the fixed liquid, bacterial liquid and cementing liquid were
    sprayed vertically onto the slope, and the spraying device was positioned 300
    mm away from the top of the slope. Unlike the single-channel reinforcement method,
    the reinforcement time can be reduced to less than 1 min, which greatly improves
    the reinforcement efficiency. Figure 7. Sprinkler irrigation equipment. To simulate
    the scour effect, a homemade household double shower device with an adjustable
    tap was used to control the water flow, as shown in Figure 8. The test rainfall
    was determined according to the weighing method. The principle was to place a
    round mouth fitting with a diameter of 20 cm underneath the spraying device located
    50 cm above the fitting. The rainfall was measured by a simple conversion, where
    every 30 g of water corresponds to 1 mm of rainfall. Figure 8. Double mounting
    device. 2.4. Testing Program According to the model box size, a 1:25 scale model
    slope M-1 with a height of 200 mm was prepared, and a 5 m high cutting slope of
    the coastal highway was simulated. The field sand sample with layered compaction
    (four layers) and sprinkling model was dried to control the moisture content at
    20%. The slope gradient was set at 1:1. The basic parameters of the slope model
    are shown in Table 4. During the test, changes in pore pressure during the perfusion
    process and scouring action were measured by the embedded pore pressure sensor.
    The buried position of the sensor is illustrated in Figure 9. Sensors 1, 2 and
    3 were vertically arranged along the depth direction, with a separation of 50
    mm. Sensors 2, 4 and 5 were located at the same horizontal line, 100 mm below
    the top surface of the slope. Figure 9. Internal sensor buried location diagram.
    Table 4. M-1 basic parameters of slope model. To facilitate the observation of
    displacement and deformation of the model under the action of scouring, displacement
    monitoring pushpins were arranged on the surface. These pushpins were spaced at
    5 cm intervals along the transverse and slope directions. At the top of the slope,
    a row of displacement monitoring pushpins was arranged, precisely located at the
    leading edge of the slope. Four rows were arranged on the slope to construct the
    thumbtack surface monitoring point system. Each thumbtack was inserted 5 mm deep
    into the soil to ensure that the model sand sample was minimally disturbed, as
    shown in Figure 10. Figure 10. Experimental model display. The cementing solution
    was selected with a mix ratio of 1:0.5 (CaCl2: urea). First, the CaCl2 fixative
    solution with the same volume and concentration of 1 M was injected before the
    injection of bacterial solution. The injection process consisted of three sets
    of rounds, where the primary fixed solution + primary bacterial solution + primary
    cementing solution were injected into the sprinkler irrigation device in the order
    of fixed solution–bacterial solution–cementing solution, as shown in Table 5 for
    their respective volumes. The M-1 model underwent reinforcement through sprinkler
    irrigation in three rounds. The overall model is shown in Figure 11. Figure 11.
    Overall model design. Table 5. Solution irrigation scheme. 3. Experimental Analysis
    3.1. Pore Water Pressure The looser the particles in the model, the greater the
    bacterial adsorption capacity. The sand sample with a smaller particle size will
    affect the change in the pore structure of the sand model, with a reduced permeability
    coefficient. During the continuous reinforcement process, the permeability coefficient
    k weakens due to a gradual reduction in the pores of the upper sand sample [19].
    As bacillus liquid and fixed liquid flow through the sand sample model, the pore
    water pressure in the pores will change with the seepage effect. In addition to
    surface runoff, a portion of the water flow direction in the sand sample also
    shows an infiltration effect [6,20]. After multiple rounds of reinforcement, the
    pores on the top surface, inclined surface and inside the sand sample model become
    filled and connected due to the formation of calcium carbonate particles. The
    pore water pressure sensor can be used to explore the changes in pore pressure
    during reinforcement and pore characteristics after multiple rounds of reinforcement.
    He Xiaoying, Li Dong et al. [21] equipped the laboratory with debris flow two-phase
    bodies to observe the change rule of pore water in debris flow sediment reinforced
    by MICP. They found that calcium carbonate generated by MICP solidification has
    a tendency to retain pore water pressure. In drainage consolidation tests, it
    was observed that when the sediment porosity was low, it was difficult to drain
    and consolidate. Li Xian proposed a theoretical formula for the grouting capacity
    of sand with different permeability coefficients of MICP, which provides a reference
    for whether the soil is suitable for reinforcement by the MICP method [5]. The
    pore water pressure test was divided into two stages. In the first stage, the
    M-1 model was injected with several different volumes of fixed liquid and bacterial
    liquid, and the change rule of the internal pore water pressure was measured by
    the embedded pore water pressure sensor inside the slope. In the second stage,
    a self-made rainfall device was used to simulate a certain rainfall intensity
    and explore the change process of pore water pressure from the initial moisture
    content to the saturation point of the entire sandy slope until its internal water
    pressure law becomes unstable [22]. As observed from Figure 12a, the 02 sensor
    in the middle and the sensors on both sides of the same horizontal plane of the
    solution infiltration channel were concentrated in the middle of the M-1 model
    during the first reinforcement, and the signals in the middle channel were very
    clear and distinct, while the signals at both ends of 02 were not as evident,
    and the pore pressure variation law was basically similar. Moving on to signal
    (b), during the second reinforcement, the seepage channel was concentrated on
    the right side of the model, and the secondary wave crest on the left side was
    not as pronounced. The variation in the time–pore pressure in the horizontal direction
    of the third round of reinforcement (c) indicates that the seepage channel is
    located on the left of the center of the model. The test results show that after
    three rounds of perfusion reinforcement, the changes in pore pressure in the horizontal
    plane, specifically 10 cm away from the top surface, exhibit clear sensitivity
    to the seepage layer. At this depth, the calcium carbonate products are comparatively
    lower, with an ordinary filling effect, and the curing effect is not particularly
    noticeable at this depth. Figure 12. Horizontal direction of the first, second,
    third wheel reinforcement pore pressure changes. From Figure 13, it is evident
    that the pore pressure undergoes changes from top to bottom during the cementing
    process. Sensors 02 and 03 showed a certain time lag compared with 01, and the
    size effect was more obvious. First, to verify the possible interaction between
    the bacterial solution and the cementing solution on pore pressure changes, a
    test was conducted where 400 mL of bacterial solution was injected at 280 s for
    20 s. The test results show that the rising rate of the shallow sensor 01 is the
    fastest after the mixing of the cementing liquid and bacterial liquid, signifying
    an obvious reaction of the calcium carbonate surface. However, after the rise
    in the pore pressure at the bottom, the secondary wave crest changes minimally,
    and the pore pressure dissipates for an extended period. As a result, the pore
    pressure change rate of 01 at the secondary wave peak is not as high as that of
    02 and 03 at the bottom. The results suggest that the reactants gradually reduce,
    and the formation of calcium carbonate is more obvious in the shallow reaction,
    hindering the infiltration of the solution. However, in Figure 13b, after 01 began
    to rise, the pore pressure remained constant at 0.33 kPa for about 500 s. This
    indicates that, in the shallow depth range, due to the shallow reaction of calcium
    carbonate, after filling the sand pores, the pores slowly decrease until completely
    filled. In terms of the pore pressure law, the change rate of the pore pressure
    weakens and remains unchanged for a certain period, approximately forming a kind
    of “calcium carbonate film” that stabilizes the pore pressure. However, sensors
    02 and 03 below can still perceive the change in the pore pressure after solution
    infiltration. The pore pressure rises quickly within a certain period, and the
    process of pore pressure dissipation also indicates a gradual decrease in the
    pore water pressure in the model, reflecting the effect of infiltration. The accumulation
    of calcium carbonate in the surface pore of the model greatly affects the changes
    in the surface pore pressure. Figure 13. Pore pressure changes in the first and
    second rounds of cementing fluid. Figure 14a,b, respectively, show the time–pore
    pressure variation in the bacterial and cementing fluids in the third round of
    reinforcement. The continuous changes in the pore pressure in this cycle reaffirm
    the plugging effect of the calcium carbonate “film” formed in the middle pores
    of the upper part of the model. The previous stone of sensor 1 is blocked by the
    products near the measuring point of sensor 1, and the stabilization of the calcium
    carbonate around the sensor results in a minimal pore pressure change rate, showing
    a straight line on the graph. On the other hand, the deep sensor is characterized
    by a dynamic equilibrium process from shallow to deep, indicating that the deep
    solidification is not significant, and the lower pore cementation effect is poor.
    Pore water during grouting is represented as a dynamic infiltration process, in
    which the pore pressure changes in 01 in the three groups are mapped. As shown
    in Figure 15, after irrigating three times with bacterial and cementing fluids,
    the pore water pressure at 01 gradually decreases. Compared with the second irrigation,
    the decrease in the first irrigation is the most obvious, which can be attributed
    to the large amount of calcium carbonate generated in the first two irrigations,
    filling most of the voids and leading to a minor change in the graph between the
    third irrigation and the second irrigation. This suggests that the downward infiltration
    of bacterial and cementing fluids in the third irrigation is affected by the substantial
    amount of calcium carbonate generated in the previous two irrigations, confirming
    the conclusion that the deep curing effect is not significant. Figure 14. Pore
    pressure changes in the third round of reinforcement when bacteria liquid and
    cementing liquid pass through. Figure 15. Changes in 01 time–pore pressure in
    three rounds. By idealizing the slope model, the failure of the model can be divided
    into three stages under the short-duration and high-intensity rainfall condition.
    The overall time–pore pressure variation diagram for the 01–05 sensors and the
    time–pore pressure variation diagram for different time periods are shown in the
    figure below. According to the analysis of Figure 16, Figure 17, Figure 18, Figure
    19 and Figure 20, the first stage is the infiltration stage. Based on the pore
    pressure changes in this stage, the pore pressure change rate of 01 is close to
    zero due to the existence of a calcium carbonate “diaphragm” in the pores of the
    sand body, as characterized by sensor 1. Solution percolation exists in the M-1
    model. When the pore pressure drops in No. 02 of the upper part, the solution
    percolates downward, while the pore pressure rises in No. 03, exhibiting a top–down
    seepage change feature. The second stage is the rainfall stage. From 872 s, due
    to the surface solidification, the cementation of the slope surface and the top
    area Is obvious. The rainfall Is mostly transformed into runoff flowing down the
    slope surface, and the slope surface enters a transient saturation state. However,
    the cementation of the calcium carbonate on the surface limits the infiltration
    of a large amount of water, and the pore pressure of 02 and 03 does not change
    significantly. Due to the increase in water content, the decrease in basement
    suction leads to a decline in slope stability. When the slope begins to slip at
    109 s, the basement suction in the soil becomes zero, and the slope model starts
    to slide and fail. After 160 s, the rainfall ends. The third stage is the sliding
    unloading stage, starting from 1033 s. After the rainfall, the overlying pressure
    continues to unload, and the slope is damaged in stages, causing the pore pressure
    to decrease in a stepped way. The pore pressure deformation law of the slope without
    MICP reinforcement should be a broken line of slow decline after failure. However,
    after MICP reinforcement, the creep of the S-3 slope is very slow after the rainfall
    stops. Due to the cementation in the sand body, the pore pressure in the slope
    discharges in a stepped manner, and the basement suction undergoes a process of
    repeated rise and then decline. After MICP reinforcement, the slope can maintain
    certain stability after failure and prolong the creep time. Figure 16. Variation

    change from 800 to 1050 s. Figure 20. The 01–03 pore pressure changes in the sensor
    at 1050–1200 s. 3.2. Fluid Slip Pattern After three rounds of reinforcement on
    the slope of the M-1 model, a simulation of the short-duration high-intensity
    scour action was conducted, and the flow rate of the scour device was measured.
    According to the regulations of the national meteorological department, the rainfall
    of 23 mm reached the heavy rain level within 12 h (15–29.9 mm), and the rainfall
    intensity was 23 mm/min, exceeding the local average daily rainfall standard in
    Dongfang City. The damage morphology of M-1 was observed after being scoured.
    At 150 s, M-1 fails under the rainfall simulation, and the slope experiences a
    prolonged period from the beginning of erosion to sliding failure. After the erosion
    of the rainfall intensity, the failure mode manifests as the overall sliding failure
    of the slope. After 36 s, the fracture begins to develop on the right side of
    the M-1 slope top, with a diagonal fracture length of 4 cm and a width of 2 mm.
    After 50 s, the left oblique crack starts to develop, measuring 6 cm in length
    and 2 mm in width. The sand on the slope surface remains intact despite the entrainment
    runoff, making it resistant to loss. Approximately 103 s into the process, the
    oblique cracks on both sides connect, and the tension cracks appear at the rear
    edge of the slope top, with a width of the cracks of 3 mm. These cracks are distributed
    in a circular arc. The green thumbtack band on the slope top moves downwards.
    The left side of the slope surface is missing, and the red pushpin belt at the
    slope angle begins to deform. The slope foot experiences unloading. The moisture
    content of the lower soil is close to saturation, but the slope body integrity
    is well-maintained. Refer to Figure 21 for further details. Figure 21. Integral
    slip. At 115 s, the scour effect leads to an increase in the internal water content
    of the soil, causing a decrease in effective stress and the anti-sliding force
    of the soil. Consequently, the slope surface of the model begins to slide downward
    as a whole. The development of tension cracks induces rainfall convergence, and
    the infiltration of rainwater further raises the water content of the model, which
    accelerates the sliding of the slope. Despite some surface damage, the model maintains
    good overall integrity. The failure characteristics of the model are different
    from those of the model without MICP reinforcement. The sliding surface inside
    the slope can be seen from the lower M-1 side view, and it can be inferred that
    the sliding surface is located at 4–5 cm depth. For further details, refer to
    Figure 22. Figure 22. M-1 model slippage side view. When the simulated rainfall
    effect is stopped, the slope model morphology is divided from the front and top
    surfaces due to the development of cracks. The surface sand of the slope block
    remains intact, and the segmented blocks have a thickness of about 3–4 cm. After
    150 s of simulated scour, the model experiences damage. The failure characteristics
    of the MICP-solidified slope model M-1 are manifested as fractional sliding. Due
    to sand loss, the front edge of the model exhibits an unloading effect and the
    largest deformation. After the slope angle slip and accumulation, the upper slope
    continues to slide and deform slowly. The damage integrity of the model after
    MICP action remains good in the short-duration and high-intensity simulation of
    rainfall, and the MICP spray irrigation curing technology can effectively resist
    surface erosion. For further details, refer to Figure 23. Figure 23. View after
    destruction. 4. Conclusions (1) In the M-1 model, after two rounds of reinforcement,
    a calcium carbonate “film” was formed in the shallow pores of the slope, which
    reduced the pore pressure change rate during the infiltration of the solution.
    The model first reacts to produce calcium carbonate in the shallow layer, leading
    to a solidification of the shallow layer and a gradual decrease in the space between
    the sand particles. The lower part of the model demonstrates the process of solution
    infiltration, and the secondary wave crest rises slowly, indicating that the product
    prevents solution infiltration. The pore pressure of the sensor at the same horizontal
    depth follows the same change law. However, below 10 cm of the top surface, there
    are fewer products, with a larger pore pressure change rate and general curing
    effect. (2) The S-3 slope, strengthened by three sets of turns, failed after 150
    s. The surface blocks of the slope were divided due to the development of cracks.
    The thickness of the divided blocks was about 3–4 cm. After 109 s of rainfall,
    the moisture content of the soil increased, with a decrease in the effective stress
    and anti-sliding force of the soil and the slope surface of the model as a whole.
    The development of tension cracks induces rainfall convergence and accelerates
    slope slip. Despite some surface damage, the model maintained good overall integrity.
    The failure characteristics of the slope are manifested as fractional sliding.
    Due to the loss of sand, the unloading effect of the model front is obvious, and
    the deformation is the largest. At the onset of the slip, the suction of the base
    became zero, and the failure form shows an overall slip with subsequent creep
    unloading. (3) After MICP reinforcement, the creep of the M-1 slope model was
    very slow. The cementation in the sand body led to the discharge of the pore pressure
    in the slope in a stepped manner, and the basement suction underwent a process
    of rising and then falling repeatedly. The MICP slope can maintain a certain integrity
    after failure, prolong the creep time, improve the water stability and anti-erosion
    capacity of the MICP slope under the action of heavy rainfall and enhance the
    safety factor of the slope. Author Contributions Conceptualization, J.H. and Y.H.;

  description: Effective water and fertilizer management is crucial for enhancing
    nitrogen (N) use efficiency and ensuring regional food security, especially in
    arid regions. Drip fertigation can synchronize water and fertilizer supply with
    crop demand, but its maximum benefits can only be achieved with appropriately
    designed and well-managed irrigation systems. In this study, we built on our previous
    work on optimizing the design of drip irrigation systems and evaluated the effect
    of drip fertigation regimes on soil nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) supply, crop N uptake,
    yield, and yield stability. We conducted a five-year field experiment using drip
    fertigation to grow maize (Zea mays L.) in the Hetao Irrigation District, Northwest
    China, from 2016 to 2020. We implemented three water levels by controlling soil
    matric potential (SMP) threshold values [− 10 kPa (S1), − 30 kPa (S3), and − 50
    kPa (S5)] under the same N fertilization rate (150 kg N ha−1 broadcast as basal
    fertilizer, 150 kg N ha−1 applied with drip fertigation). Our results indicated
    that soil NO3-N in 0–60 cm profile was typically distributed in the non-mulched
    zone at maturity. Compared with S5, S1 and S3 on average significantly decreased
    NO3-N accumulation in the 0–60 cm profile by 66% and 47%, and S1 and S3 significantly
    decreased NO3-N accumulation in the 60–120 cm profile by 31% and 30%. In addition,
    the S3 significantly decreased NO3-N accumulation in the 120–200 cm profile by
    52% and 35% compared with S1 and S5. S3 significantly improved crop grain yield
    by 45%, sustainable yield index by 26%, N uptake by 28%, and N utilization efficiency
    by 11% compared with S5. In contrast, S3 decreased the irrigation amount by 40%
    compared with S1, with no significant differences in grain yield, yield stability,
    and N uptake in most years. We recommend using an SMP threshold value of − 30
    kPa combined with a drip fertigation rate of 150 kg N ha−1 to reduce residual
    NO3-N and improve yield and yield stability in arid regions. Furthermore, we also
    recommend using drip fertigation with 208–253 mm irrigation water in wet years
    and > 253 mm in dry years (irrigation every four days from V6 to R3 stage), with
    13.6 kg ha−1 N applied per irrigation (from VT to R3 stage) to facilitate farmer
    operations. Our research provides valuable technical guidance to promote a stable
    and sustainable agricultural production in arid regions.

    nitrogenNitrogen use efficiencyGrain yield 1. Introduction Soil nitrate is a critical
    factor in crop growth, but its accumulation as nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) after
    harvest can lead to nitrate leaching into groundwater and threaten cropland ecosystems
    (Xu et al., 2021). Conventional irrigation and fertilization practices have contributed
    to this problem (Zhou et al., 2016). Therefore, appropriate fertigation planning
    is necessary to simultaneously reduce nitrate leaching and accumulation in soil
    profiles while supplying the nitrogen (N) demands of crop. The Hetao Irrigation
    District (HID) is China’s main grain production area and Asia’s largest single
    artesian irrigation district. Maize is the primary food source for nearly one-third
    of the world’s population, and the HID has a maize planting area of 2.6 × 105
    ha with an annual yield of about 3.0 × 109 kg (Li et al., 2020). The HID has a
    long history of flood irrigation and high fertilization practices (Li et al.,
    2020, Zhang et al., 2021b). During the maize growing season, irrigation depths
    are typically about 500 mm (Li et al., 2022), while N fertilizer application rates
    reach 360 kg ha−1, with an N use efficiency below 30% (Du et al., 2011). As a
    result, large amounts of N fertilizer are lost, causing severe groundwater contamination
    in some areas (Chen et al., 2020b) and even eutrophication of Wuliangsuhai downstream
    from the HID (Wang et al., 2022c). In recent years, mulched drip fertigation has
    been promoted to save agricultural water, control soil salinization, and reduce
    non-point source pollution in the HID. Drip fertigation is an efficient irrigation
    and fertilization practice that can decrease residual soil N and reduce or even
    prevent N leaching (Wang et al., 2018, Wu et al., 2020, Xu et al., 2021). For
    example, mulched drip irrigation reduced residual (post-harvest) soil NO3-N by
    28% and 22% compared to no-mulched drip and furrow irrigation, respectively (Wang
    et al., 2022b). In addition, drip irrigation reduced soil N leaching by 34 − 57%
    compared with flood irrigation (Zhang et al., 2021c). A simulation using an integrated
    WHCNS (Soil-Water-Heat-Carbon-Nitrogen-Simulator) model found that drip irrigation
    resulted in significantly less (0.8 kg N ha−1), even negligible, N leaching than
    border irrigation (22 kg N ha−1) (Xu et al., 2021). In addition, a model simulation
    study for the Hydrus (2D/3D) model showed that nitrate leaching was minimum in
    the period of fertigation by selecting the irrigation rate of 0.8 L h−1 and minimum
    duration of fertigation (5 min) at the end of irrigation (Azad et al., 2018).
    Nayebloie et al. (2022) founded that reducing fertigation time by 50% and halving
    the fertigation interval could increase the uptake of water and nitrate by 3.89%
    and 11.55%, while the rate of deep percolation decreased by 27% by the Hydrus-2D
    model simulation. Although there is evidence from field trials that drip fertigation
    can reduce soil residual N, most studies focused on residual N in the root zone
    under different irrigation methods. As a result, our understanding of the residual
    soil NO3-N in non-root zone under drip fertigation in the field is limited, and
    we do not know whether there is a potential leaching risk of residual soil NO3-N.
    Improving nutrient uptake and fertilizer use efficiency, especially N, in agriculture
    is of global interest (Hatfield and Follett, 2008). Studies have shown that drip
    fertigation can increase N uptake and fertilizer use efficiency compared to other
    irrigation methods (Hou et al., 2023, Li et al., 2020, Quemada et al., 2013).
    For example, Oppong Danso et al. (2015) found that drip irrigation to okra resulted
    in significantly higher N uptake than sprinkler irrigation with the same amount
    of applied N. In another study, drip-irrigated maize had 24% and 72% higher N
    use efficiency than border irrigation and rainfed condition, respectively (Xu
    et al., 2021). Sandhu et al. (2019) showed that drip fertigation significantly
    improved maize’s average N recovery efficiency by 29% compared to furrow irrigation.
    However, the benefits of drip fertigation can only be realized with appropriately
    designed (e.g., dripper flow and spacing, drip tape diameter and lateral spacing)
    and well-managed (e.g., irrigation regimes and fertilization strategies) irrigation
    systems for specific soil, crop, and environmental conditions (Mubarak et al.,
    2009). Previous studies have considered different film mulching methods, tillage
    practices and drip tape layout for mulched drip irrigation in the HID (Qi et al.,
    2018, Qi et al., 2016, Zhou et al., 2017, Zhou et al., 2018). In addition, Azad
    et al. (2020) used HYDRUS − 2D model to optimize the N fertigation scheduling
    for a drip irrigation system. The results indicated that 77% (231 kg ha−1) of
    the applied N were taken up by maize under the scenario with optimized applications
    of fertilizer. There is evidence from numerical modeling that optimized drip fertigation
    can improve crop N uptake (Azad et al., 2019). However, drip fertigation strategies
    have not been fully studied and the impact of drip fertigation regimes on crop
    N uptake remains unclear, especially through multi-year field experiments. Studies
    have shown that drip fertigation can increase crop yield (Wang et al., 2015, Xu
    et al., 2021, Yang et al., 2023, Zhang et al., 2021b). However, most of these
    studies have focused solely on yield increases without considering yield stability.
    Yield stability is important because excessive chemical fertilizer use to ensure
    yield can lead to soil fertility degradation (Zhang et al., 2015), making it difficult
    to maintain crop yield stability. Moreover, frequent extreme climate events can
    cause crop yield reductions or even terminations, posing a significant threat
    to global food security (Hasegawa et al., 2021). Ensuring yield stability across
    years is vital in the face of climate change and extreme weather events (Knapp
    and van der Heijden, 2018, Zhang et al., 2022). Therefore, it is essential to
    investigate yield stability under drip fertigation to promote regional food security
    and sustainable agricultural development. Optimizing drip fertigation regimes
    for maize production is difficult for local farmers in the HID, who rely on traditional
    water and nitrogen supply practices, which impede the efficient use of water and
    fertilizer. Therefore, it is essential to optimize water and nitrogen supply for
    maize growth under drip fertigation. In this context, we conducted a five-year
    field trial to grow maize under drip fertigation triggered by different soil matric
    potential thresholds (SMPs). We hypothesized that controlling drip fertigation
    at a certain SMP level will balance residual soil N, crop N uptake, and yield
    stability. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of drip fertigation triggered by
    SMPs on residual soil NO3-N, crop N uptake, yield, and yield stability. Based
    on these results, an optimal drip fertigation strategy was proposed, which has
    the potential to reduce residual soil NO3-N, improve N use efficiency, and ensure
    yield stability. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Study area The field experiments
    were conducted at the Shuguang Experimental Station (40°46′N, 107°24′E, 1039 m)
    in the HID, Bayannur city of Inner Mongolia, Northwest China, during the 2016–2020
    spring maize (Zea mays L.) growing seasons (Fig. 1). The study area has an arid
    desert cold climate (BWk) according to the Koppen climatic classification (Beck
    et al., 2018), with an average annual evaporation and precipitation are 2350 mm
    and 135 mm, respectively. The area receives about 3200 cumulative sunshine hours
    and 135–150 frost-free days each year. Maximum temperatures during the 2016–2020
    spring maize growing seasons (May to September) were 38.1, 39, 36.3, 34.7, and
    35.6 °C, while minimum temperatures were 1.2, − 0.2, 2.8, 0.3, and 3.6 °C, and
    total rainfall amounts were 121, 37, 152, 60, and 129 mm (Fig. 2). Groundwater
    depths during the growing seasons ranged from 2.4 to 3.3 m (Fig. 3), with a downward
    trend over time (Fig. 3). The soil texture in the study area is classified as
    a silty loam (sand = 28%, silt = 52%, and clay = 20%) in the 0–60 cm soil profile,
    and the soil type is Fluvisols (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2015), developed from
    the alluvial material of the Yellow River. The soil had an obvious layered structure,
    with a sandy layer from 60 to 100 cm depth (Table 1). Table 1 listed other basic

    spring maize cultivar was Ximeng No.6, planted in a ‘one film with two-row crops’
    pattern (Fig. 4). Transparent plastic film made from polyethylene, 8 µm thick
    and 90 cm wide, was used for mulching. The film mulching had a narrow row spacing
    of 30 cm, with a 70 cm wide row spacing between the two films (Fig. 4). Drip irrigation
    tapes (Ø = 16 mm) were installed in the center of each narrow row, with 30 cm
    emitter spacings, 0.1 MPa operating pressure, and 2.5 L h−1 flow rate. Spring
    maize seeds were planted manually after mulching at a depth of 5 cm and planting
    distance of 30 cm. The planting and harvest dates were April 27 and September
    9, 2016 (135 days), April 28 and September 8, 2017 (133 days), April 29 and September
    10, 2018 (134 days), April 27 and September 10, 2019 (136 days), and April 30

    field trial was conducted in a randomized complete block design in triplicate.
    The study comprised three water levels, controlled by the threshold values of
    soil matric potential (SMP) at 20 cm depth beneath the drip emitter (Fig. 4):
    − 10 kPa (S1), − 30 kPa (S3), and − 50 kPa (S5). The tensiometers were read daily
    at 9:00 a.m. and 15:00 p.m. Once the SMP readings reached the designated threshold
    values, 10 mm of drip irrigation water was applied referring to the daily pan
    evaporation (Fig. S2). The irrigation quota was increased from 10 mm to 20 mm
    during the vigorous growth period (e.g., V12 stage and VT-Tassel stage). Local
    groundwater (1.8 dS m−1 salinity and pH 7.7) was used for irrigation. The nine
    plots were located in the same location for each growing season, each measuring
    15 m long and 4 m wide with eight rows of maize. The plots were separated by 15 cm
    high ridges on all sides with 2 m between plots. Drip irrigation was applied from
    70 to 115 DAP days after planting (DAP) in 2016 (45 days), 33–123 DAP in 2017
    (90 days), 30–120 DAP in 2018 (90 days), 34–121 DAP in 2019 (87 days), and 32–117
    DAP in 2020 (85 days) (Fig. 5). The accumulated irrigation depths for the S1,
    S3, and S5 treatments were 340, 140, and 70 mm in 2016, 490, 300, and 130 mm in
    2017, 450, 240, and 100 mm in 2018, 420, 290, and 160 mm in 2019, and 400, 285,
    and 170 mm in 2020, respectively. All treatments received equal amounts of total
    N (300 kg ha−1), P2O5 (180 kg ha−1), and K2O (45 kg ha−1) with the formula 100–44–83
    corresponding to 300 kg N ha−1, 79 kg P ha−1 and 37 kg K ha−1. The basal fertilizer
    was applied uniformly with 150 kg N ha−1, 180 kg P2O5 ha−1, and 45 kg K2O ha−1
    in the form of urea, (NH4)2HPO4, and K2SO4 followed by rotary plowing to 20 cm
    depth. Urea (150 kg N ha−1) was topdressed with irrigation water through the drip
    irrigation system (Fig. 5 and Fig. S1). The N was applied by drip fertigation
    from 71 to 111 DAP days after planting (DAP) in 2016 (41 days), 52–114 DAP in
    2017 (63 days), 54–98 DAP in 2018 (45 days), 36–109 DAP in 2019 (74 days), and
    63–101 DAP in 2020 (39 days) (Fig. 5). For all treatments, the total amount of
    N applied by drip fertigation is 150 kg N kg−1 with the same amount per application.The
    N amount per application for S1, S3, and S5 treatments was 7.5 kg N kg−1 (20 times),
    11.5 kg N kg−1 (13 times), and 21.4 kg N kg−1 (7 times) in 2016, 7.9 kg N kg−1
    (19 times), 12.5 kg N kg−1 (12 times), and 16.7 kg N kg−1 (9 times) in 2017, 7.5 kg N kg−1
    (20 times), 10.0 kg N kg−1 (15 times), and 15.0 kg N kg−1 (10 times) in 2018,
    7.5 kg N kg−1 (20 times), 10.7 kg N kg−1 (14 times), and 25.0 kg N kg−1 (6 times)
    in 2019, and 8.3 kg N kg−1 (18 times), 11.5 kg N kg−1 (13 times), and 18.8 kg N kg−1
    (8 times) in 2020, respectively. The remaining field management operations were
    consistent with local practices. Download : Download high-res image (444KB) Download

    10 kg N kg−1. The total amount of N applied by drip fertigation is the same (150 kg N kg−1)
    for all treatments. 2.4. Methods of measurement 2.4.1. Meteorological data During
    the 2016–2020 spring maize growing seasons, a HOBO H21–001 weather station installed
    in a grass yard within 100 m of the experimental field recorded daily air temperatures
    and rainfall. Pan evaporation (Ep) was monitored manually at 8:00 am daily by
    installing a 20-cm-diameter evaporation pan at the same location. 2.4.2. Soil
    sampling and measurement At the maturity (R6) stage in each growing season, soils
    in the 0–120 cm profile in all three replicates per treatment were sampled using
    a 4 cm diameter auger at three horizontal positions (0, 25, and 50 cm) from a
    drip emitter (Fig. 4). In addition, at the R6 stage in 2019 and 2020, soil samples
    in the 120–200 cm profile in all three replicates per treatment were collected
    from below the drip tape (Fig. 4). The sampling location was in the center of
    the inside of the plot, and all auger holes were refilled to avoid disturbances
    in the soil water and N distribution. According to the distribution of maize roots
    in the study area (Zhou et al., 2017) and the water transport characteristics
    under drip irrigation, the 0–200 cm soil layer was divided into four zones: root
    zone, bare zone (small part covered by plastic film but strongly affected by evaporation),
    subsoil, and deep soil (Fig. 4). Soil samples (2.5 g air-dried soil) were extracted
    with 1 mol L−1 KCl solution (25 mL), and the NO3-N concentration was measured
    with a Continuous Flow Analytical System (AA3, Seal, Germany). 2.4.3. Plant sampling
    and measurement Ten maize plants were randomly selected from each plot at the
    R6 stage to measure aboveground biomass. The aboveground biomass was divided into
    stem and sheath, leaf, cob and husk, and grain. All plant materials were oven-dried
    to a constant weight at 75 °C to determine dry biomass (DM). After measuring aboveground
    biomass, each organ was ground with a small grinder and passed through a 0.5 mm
    sieve. The filtered plant samples (0.1–0.2 g) were weighed and placed in a digestion
    tube. N concentration (g kg−1) was determined by a Continuous Flow Analytical
    System (AA3, Seal, Germany) after digestion with concentrated H2SO4-H2O2. 2.4.4.
    Indicators calculation The soil NO3-N accumulation (kg ha−1) was determined as
    follows: (1) where hi (cm) is the thickness of the i-layer soil, (g cm−3) is the
    bulk density of the i-layer soil, and ci (mg kg−1) is the NO3-N concentration
    of the i-layer soil. Total N uptake (kg ha−1) of aboveground crop biomass was
    determined as follows: (2) where DMi (kg ha−1) is the DM of each organ and Nci
    (g kg−1) is the N concentration of each organ. This study adopt four international
    recommended definition of N indices (Congreves et al., 2021), as follows: Partial
    factor productivity of applied N (PFPN, kg kg−1) was determined as follows: (3)
    N use efficiency of crop (NUEcrop, kg kg−1) was determined as follows: (4) N utilization
    efficiency (NUtE, kg kg−1) was determined as follows: (5) N harvest index (NHI,
    %) was determined as follows: (6) where AN (kg ha−1) is the N application amount
    of each treatment,.Ncg (g kg −1) is grain N concentration of each treatment and
    DMg (kg ha−1) is grain DM of each treatment. Three approaches were used to analyze
    yield stability over five years. First, the coefficient of variation (CV) was
    determined to evaluate yield stability each year, as follows (Zhang et al., 2022):
    (7) where DMgm is the mean DMg for each treatment in each year and SD is the corresponding
    standard deviation. Second, yield stability was assessed using the sustainable
    yield index (SYI) (Singh et al., 1990): (8) where DMgma is the mean annual DMg
    for each treatment, SDa is the corresponding standard deviation, and DMgmax is
    the maximum annual DMg. A higher SYI indicates a greater capacity of the soil
    to maintain a specific crop yield over time. Third, yield stability was evaluated
    using Wricke’s ecovalence index (Wi2) (Balcha, 2020, Wricke, 1962): (9) where
    DMgij is average DMg of treatment i in the j-th year, DMgi is the average DMg
    of treatment i across five years, DMgj is the average DMg for all treatments in
    the j-th year, DMga is the average DMg for all treatments across five years, and
    q is number of years, here 5. The closer Wi2 is to 0, the higher the yield stability.
    Water productivity (WP) was evaluated by crop water productivity (WPC, kg m−3)
    and irrigation water productivity (WPI, kg m−3): (10) (11) where ETc is the water
    consumption for the whole growing season of spring maize (mm), 0.1 is the unit
    conversion factor. ETc was determined by the water balance equation: (12) where
    P is precipitation (mm), I is irrigation amount (mm), and R is the surface runoff
    (mm), which is zero due to no runoff was observed during the growing season, ΔS
    is the change of water storage of root zone after harvesting relative to that
    before sowing (mm), G is the contribution of groundwater through capillary rise
    (mm), and D is the deep percolation (mm). The G and D were calculated as the accumulated
    water flux (Q, mm d−1) during the whole growing season at the 100-cm depth using
    the Darcy’s Law. (13) where φ is soil matric potential, φ110 and φ90 are soil
    matric potentials at 110 cm and 90 cm (kPa), z is soil depth (m), z110 = 110 cm,
    z90 = 90 cm. θ is soil moisture, K(θ) is unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (m
    d−1), which is measured by the Ku-pF apparatus. The soil moisture characteristic
    curve was established using a high-speed centrifuge method and calibrated by RETC
    software. 2.5. Data analysis and graphics production Analysis of variance (ANOVA)
    was conducted using SPSS software 26.0 (IBM, Inc., https://www.ibm.com/products/spss-statistics).
    Multiple comparisons of mean values and significant differences between treatments
    were determined using the least significant difference (LSD) test at p < 0.05.

    3. Results 3.1. Soil NO3-N distribution and accumulation at the maturity stage
    The drip fertigation regimes triggered by the SMPs significantly affected the
    spatial distribution and accumulation of NO3-N at the R6 stage (Fig. 6). The S1
    treatment significantly decreased the NO3-N concentration in the 0–20 cm topsoil
    profile by 53% and 74% compared to the S3 and S5 treatments, respectively. Furthermore,
    the NO3-N was mostly distributed in the non-mulched zone arising from the point
    source infiltration of drip irrigation, except for the S5 treatment in 2016 and
    2018. In 2016, the NO3-N in the S5 treatment was mainly distributed under the
    film, possibly due to the late start of drip fertigation (70 DAP) and larger N
    applied per irrigation (21.4 kg ha−1, Fig. 5). In 2018, the NO3-N of the S5 treatment
    in the topsoil profile was leached down to the 40–80 cm soil profile (>30 mg kg−1),
    likely due to the higher rainfall (total 75 mm, two rainfall events in three days,
    Fig. 2). In the 120–200 soil layer, the S1 and S5 treatments had significantly
    higher NO3-N concentrations than the S3 treatment. Download : Download high-res

    from 2016 to 2020. S1, S3, and S5 indicate the thresholds of − 10, − 30, and − 50
    kPa, respectively. Moreover, the S5 treatment had significantly more total NO3-N
    accumulation than the S1 and S3 treatments. In the root zone, the S5 treatment
    significantly increased NO3-N accumulation by 186% and 122% on average compared
    to the S1 and S3 treatments, with no significant difference between S1 and S3.
    For the bare zone, the S5 treatment had, on average, 119 kg ha−1 NO3-N accumulation,
    3.05 and 1.74 times higher than the S1 and S3 treatments (p < 0.05), respectively.
    There was no clear pattern of subsoil NO3-N accumulation in any treatment, possibly
    due to sampling error caused by soil heterogeneity (Table 1). Overall, the S1
    and S3 treatments in the 0–120 cm soil layer decreased NO3-N accumulation by 54%
    and 42% compared to the S5 treatment, respectively. In the deep soil, the S1 treatment
    had higher NO3-N accumulation at the R6 stage compared with the S3 and S5 treatments
    in 2019 and 2020, while the S3 treatment had the lowest NO3-N accumulation with
    a mean value of 99 kg ha−1. 3.2. Aboveground crop dry biomass and N uptake The
    different drip fertigation regimes triggered by the SMPs significantly affected
    aboveground crop DM and N uptake at the R6 stage (Fig. 7). The larger aboveground
    DM always occurred at the highest SMP, with the highest value (33,709 kg DM ha−1)
    in the S1 treatment in 2020, and the lowest value (18,655 kg DM ha−1) in the S5
    treatment in 2019. The S5 treatment decreased aboveground DM at the R6 stage by
    26%, 38%, 37%, 35%, and 32% in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively,
    compared to the S1 treatment. Grain accounted for the largest proportion of aboveground
    DM (47–55%), followed by stem + sheath, then leaf, and finally cob + husk. The
    S1 and S3 treatments had significantly greater grain DM than the S5 treatment,
    with no significant difference between S1 and S3 except for 2019. In addition,
    the stem + sheath, leaf, and cob + husk DM for each treatment also followed a
    similar pattern to grain. Download : Download high-res image (276KB) Download

    top to bottom for each column indicate one standard deviation (SD) around the
    mean of dry biomass or N uptake for grain, cob + husk, leaf, and stem + sheath.
    Furthermore, total N uptake of aboveground parts increased with increasing SMP
    (Fig. 7b). Differences in N uptake did not significantly differ between the S1
    and S3 treatments (p > 0.05) but were significantly higher than the S5 treatment
    (p < 0.05). The S5 treatment decreased total N uptake by 19%, 30%, 24%, 29%, and
    27% in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively, compared to the S1 treatment.
    Specifically, the S1 treatment in 2020 had the greatest grain N uptake (263 kg ha−1),
    while the S5 treatment in 2019 had the lowest (155 kg ha−1) one. The S1 treatment
    had, on average, 23%, 27%, and 22% greater N uptake of stem + sheath, leaf, and
    cob + husk than the S5 treatment, with no significant difference between S1 and
    S3. 3.3. Grain yield, yield stability, and water productivity The drip fertigation
    regimes triggered by the SMPs significantly affected grain yield, yield stability,
    WPC, and WPI (Table 2 and Fig. 8). The S1 and S3 treatments significantly increased
    the five-year average grain yield by 55% and 45%, respectively, compared to the
    S5 treatment, with no significant difference between S1 and S3 (p > 0.05). In
    addition, the S1 and S3 treatments maintained higher yields while reducing CV
    (<10%) than the S5 treatment. The SYI increased with increasing SMP. The S5 treatment
    had 27% and 21% lower SYI than the S1 and S3 treatments, respectively. In addition,
    the higher SMPs (S1 and S3) produced lower Wi2 values, with no significant difference
    between S1 and S3 (p > 0.05). The highest WPC was always observed under the S3
    treatment. Furthermore, the five-year average WPI increased from 3.8 to 9.5 kg m−3
    as the SMP threshold values decreased from − 10 kPa to − 50 kPa due to the reduced
    irrigation water applied under the lower SMP. Table 2. DM Yield and yield stability

    PFPN, NUEcrop, NUtE, and NHI (Table 3). Crop PFPN, NUEcrop, NUtE, and NHI increased
    with increasing SMP. The S1 and S3 treatments had significantly higher PFPN than

    increased the five-year average NUEcrop by 51% and 40%, respectively, compared
    to the S1 treatment. The S1 treatment always had the highest NUtE, peaking at
    46.95 kg kg−1 in 2018, with the lowest value (37.20 kg kg−1) in the S5 treatment
    in 2019. The S1 and S3 treatments significantly increased NHI on average by 4%

    index. 3.5. Relationship between drip fertigation and grain yield, N uptake, and
    NO3-N accumulation Based on 90% of the maximum grain yield and maximum N uptake
    across years, we established thresholds of 16,000 kg ha−1 and 340 kg ha−1 for
    high grain yield and high N uptake (Fig. 9). Grain yields > 16,000 kg ha−1 and
    N uptakes > 340 kg ha−1 required a minimum applied water of 345 mm and 338 mm
    for an N application of 13.6 kg ha−1 per irrigation, respectively. Thus, we adopted
    345 mm as the minimum applied water to achieve high grain yield and high N uptake.
    The corresponding NO3-N0–60 (NO3-N accumulation in the 0–60 cm soil layer), NO3-N0–120
    (NO3-N accumulation in the 0–120 cm soil layer), and NO3-N0–200 (NO3-N accumulation
    in the 0–200 cm soil layer) were 85 kg ha−1, 135 kg ha−1, and 215 kg ha−1, respectively.
    When using an N application rate of 13.6 kg ha−1 per irrigation, the irrigation
    amounts required for grain yield and N uptake above the thresholds were 208–295 mm
    and 199–295 mm, respectively. Thus, we used 208–295 mm as the irrigation amount
    to obtain both high grain yield and high N uptake. The corresponding NO3-N0–60,
    NO3-N0–120 and NO3-N0–200 in this range were 92–115 kg ha−1, 145–180 kg ha−1,
    and 217–358 kg ha−1, respectively. The results indicate that a lower irrigation
    amount would require additional water, such as rainfall, to meet the minimum applied
    water requirement. Download : Download high-res image (686KB) Download : Download

    and NO3-N accumulation in the 0–60 cm (NO3-N0–60), 0–120 cm (NO3-N0–120), and
    0–200 cm (NO3-N0–200) soil layers at crop harvest under different drip fertigation
    regimes. 4. Discussion In agriculture, NO3-N is often measured to estimate available
    N in soil (Carter and Gregorich, 2006). However, soil residual NO3-N is a significant
    source of N contamination that can adversely affect agricultural sustainability
    (Soto et al., 2015). Inappropriate drip fertigation regimes can lead to great
    residual NO3-N after crop harvest. We found that a lower SMP threshold (S5, −50
    kPa) resulted in higher NO3-N accumulation at the R6 stage (Fig. 6), particularly
    in the bare zone without film mulch, where NO3-N is likely transported easily
    to the edge of the wetting front by water flow (Chen et al., 2009). However, Li
    et al. (2020) found that different drip fertigation regimes produced higher residual
    soil NO3-N in mulched areas than non-mulched areas after maize harvest, possibly
    due to differences in soil sampling positions (farther away from the emitter than
    this study) and SMP gradients (−15 kPa, −25 kPa, and −35 kPa) compared to our
    study. Zhang et al. (2021a) founded that the lower soil moisture contents with
    the declining SMP threshold values (less irrigation amount). In such cases, crops
    cannot adequately absorb and use available soil N (Yan et al., 2020b). The higher
    SMP threshold (S1, −10 kPa) in our study resulted in more residual NO3-N in the
    deep soil (Fig. 6d, e), likely due to the higher water solubility of NO3-N in
    the presence of more water (Leghari et al., 2016). Li et al. (2023) also found
    that higher irrigation amounts increased NO3-N accumulation in deep soil. Moreover,
    Lu et al. (2019) reported that NO3-N leaching positively correlated with soil
    NO3-N accumulation, indicating that the higher NO3-N accumulation in deep soil
    in the S1 and S5 treatments increased the risk of groundwater N pollution (Lv
    et al., 2019, Muschietti-Piana et al., 2018). Therefore, determining appropriate
    SMP will reduce soil NO3-N accumulation and prevent groundwater N pollution. In
    our study, − 30 kPa (S3) was a suitable SMP threshold for maintaining relatively
    low NO3-N residue in all soil layers and reducing the contamination risk from
    NO3-N leaching into groundwater. Furthermore, soil NO3-N accumulation is closely
    related to plant N uptake (Quiñones et al., 2007). We found that the S1 and S3
    treatments had significantly higher N uptake than the S5 treatment, with no significant
    difference between S1 and S3. Thus, the lower NO3-N accumulation in the 0–120 cm
    soil layer under S1 than S3 implies that more NO3-N was leached to the deep soil
    under the same N application amount. In addition, the distribution of soil NO3-N
    is strongly influenced by rainfall in addition to fertigation and crop absorption
    (Sato et al., 2009). Our results indicated that the NO3-N accumulation of the
    root zone in the 2018 was significantly reduced compared with other years for
    all treatments (Fig. 6c). It can be explained that higher rainfall could resulted
    in higher NO3-N losses in the root zone. Haraguchi et al. (2004) and Chen et al.
    (2020a) highlighted that the significant NO3-N losses occurred in the upper soil
    layer after heavy rainfall. Drip fertigation triggered by SMPs has been widely
    applied in crop production (Wan et al., 2012, Wang et al., 2015, Zhang et al.,
    2021b) in arid regions. It is generally believed that choosing a suitable SMP
    threshold will increase biomass and yields while promoting water-saving and sustainable
    development, a notion supported by our research findings. Moreover, yield stability
    is crucial for regional food security and agricultural sustainability, especially
    in the face of changing climatic conditions (Ahrends et al., 2020). However, assessing
    mean yield and CV alone cannot fully gauge yield stability in long-term field
    trials due to the annual variability of climatic factors such as rainfall, temperature,
    and solar radiation (Zhang et al., 2022). Therefore, in this study, besides CV,
    we also used Wi2 and SYI to quantify the interaction of yield stability among
    treatments and years (Luo et al., 2016). Our results indicated that the S1 and
    S3 treatments significantly decreased CV and Wi2 and increased SYI compared to
    the S5 treatment, suggesting that annual grain yield is highly variable under
    S5 and, thus, that drip fertigation triggered by SMPs significantly affects yield
    stability and sustainability. The lower yield stability and sustainability of
    the S5 treatment can be attributed to lower soil water storage (Zhang et al.,
    2021a) and untimely nutrient supply (more soil residual NO3-N, Fig. 6) (Waqas
    et al., 2020), which can make crops more susceptible to biotic and abiotic stresses
    (Waqas et al., 2019, Zhang et al., 2021a). In addition, the S3 treatment decreased
    the irrigation amount by 40% compared with the S1 treatment, with no significant
    differences in grain yield and yield stability in most years. Furthermore, WP
    is an important indicator to assess the efficiency of agricultural water use and
    management (Yan et al., 2020a). Our results indicated S3 treatment significantly
    increased WPC compared with S1 and S5 treatments. This may be attributed to the
    fact that S3 treatment reduced irrigation amount substantially with no-reduction
    in DM yield (Table 2) compared with S1 treatment, resulting in a higher WPC. Compared
    with S3 treatment, the DM yield of S5 treatment was significantly reduced, which
    was the main reason for the decrease of WPC. WPC increased first and then decreased
    with the increase of effective rainfall (R2 = 0.25, P > 0.05), irrigation amount
    (R2 = 0.38, P < 0.05), and rainfall + irrigation amount (R2 = 0.42, P < 0.05)
    (Fig. S3). This indicated that irrigation is the main influential factor affecting
    WP rather than rainfall in arid agricultural areas (Jlibene, 2020). In addition,
    WPI increased with the decrease of SMP threshold due to the reduced irrigation
    water applied under the lower SMP. Therefore, − 30 kPa (S3) was a suitable SMP
    threshold for saving water and improving grain yield, yield stability, and WP.
    Crop N uptake is crucial for plant growth and development (Fageria, 2014), and
    an appropriate drip fertigation regime can increase N absorption, improve N fertilizer
    efficiency, and enhance N availability (Li et al., 2021). Our study demonstrated
    that PFPN increased with increasing irrigation amount (larger SMPs) under the
    same N application amount, consistent with the findings of Li et al. (2020). Lu
    et al. (2019) founded that excessive irrigation can decrease N utilization. In
    this study, the S1 treatment with the greatest irrigation amount obtained highest
    NUtE and NUEcrop, but there was no significant difference with the S3 treatment.
    This indicated − 30 kPa was a suitable SMP threshold for improving N uptake and
    utilization. Improvement of N utilization in the S1 and S3 treatments might be
    attributed to the continuous supplementation of nutrients in the depletion zone
    near the root interface and enhanced transport of dissolved nutrients through
    mass flow (Silber et al., 2003), due to the higher averaged water content in the
    soil (Zhang et al., 2021a). Moreover, NHI—associated with efficient utilization
    of applied N (Fawcett and Frey, 1983)—increased in tandem with PFPN, NUEcrop,
    and NUtE with increasing irrigation amount. Therefore, N uptake and utilization
    efficiencies should also be considered when determining a drip fertigation regime.
    Optimizing drip fertigation management is essential to reduce NO3-N losses while
    maintaining high crop yields through N uptake. Our study revealed that grain yield
    and aboveground N uptake increased with increasing applied water when N applied
    per irrigation was a specific value (Fig. 8). Furthermore, yield and N uptake
    exceeded their respective thresholds when the irrigation amounts were 208–295 mm
    and > 388 mm (not marked in Fig. 8), respectively. Kresović et al. (2016) highlighted
    a linear relationship between irrigation amount and maize grain yield in each
    experimental year, but over three years, grain yield quadratically correlated
    to irrigation amount. Excessive soil moisture increases stem and leaf growth and
    intensifies nutrient competition between vegetative organs and fruits, leading
    to crop failure (Du et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2022a). In a study in the arid
    area, spring maize yields only began to decline under drip fertigation for irrigation
    amounts > 480 mm (Zou et al., 2020), suggesting that the irrigation amounts in
    our study did not reach those required to reduce crop yield. Furthermore, an adequate
    residual soil NO3-N level is needed to sustain high yields (Cui et al., 2013),
    but soil NO3-N is susceptible to leaching into deep soil once it exceeds the safety
    threshold (Ju and Christie, 2011). Our results indicated that when grain yield
    and N uptake simultaneously reached their threshold values, NO3-N0–60, NO3-N60–120
    (= NO3-N0–120 − NO3-N0–60), and NO3-N120–200 (= NO3-N0–200 − NO3-N0–120) was 85 kg ha−1,
    50 kg ha−1, and 80 kg ha−1, respectively. Therefore, more NO3-N accumulated in
    the 0–60 cm soil layer rather than the 60–120 cm soil layer after harvest under
    the drip fertigation. Zhou et al. (2016) founded that about 70% of the nitrate
    is distributed in the soil layers deeper than the 1-meter root zone in Chinese
    croplands. This indicated that lower levels of nitrate leaching under the drip
    fertigation triggered by SMP. In addition, NO3-N0–120 was close to the NO3-N safety
    threshold (100 kg ha−1 in the 0–100 cm soil layer) determined by predecessors
    (De Clercq et al., 2001, Ju and Gu, 2017, Shi et al., 2022). Furthermore, NO3-N0–120
    was slightly higher than NO3-N120–200, which basically maintained the N balance
    of upper and lower soil and was beneficial to the soil N supply (Shi et al., 2022).
    Therefore, we recommend irrigation amounts of 208–253 mm in wet years and > 253 mm
    in dry years with N applied per irrigation of 13.6 kg ha−1 to achieve optimal
    maize yield, N uptake, and soil N residue (Fig. 8 and Table 4). Given the robust
    rainfall prediction (Barrera-Animas et al., 2022), these values can serve as the
    optimal drip fertilization strategy for sustainable maize production in the study
    region. Finally, we recommend further research to determine the NO3-N safety threshold
    by investigating the impacts of long-term drip fertigation on NO3-N in groundwater.

    showed that drip fertigation triggered by SMPs significantly affected soil NO3-N
    distribution and accumulation. At the maturity stage, soil NO3-N was mostly distributed
    in the non-mulched zone. NO3-N accumulation in the 0–120 cm soil layer decreased
    with increasing SMP. Compared with S1 and S5 treatments, S3 treatment significantly
    reduced NO3-N accumulation in the 120–200 cm soil layer. The S3 treatment also
    significantly improved crop grain yield, yield stability, N uptake, and N use
    efficiency compared with the S5 treatment. In contrast, the S3 treatment decreased
    the irrigation amount by 40% compared with the S1 treatment, with no significant
    differences in grain yield, yield stability, N uptake, WPC, and N use efficiency
    in most years. Therefore, we recommend an SMP threshold value of − 30 kPa and
    a drip fertigation rate of 150 kg N ha−1 to reduce residual NO3-N and improve
    yield and yield stability in arid regions. Based on the obtained results, in order
    to facilitate farmer operations and satisfy high crop yield and soil N supply
    capacity, we recommend drip irrigation with irrigation water of 208–253 mm in
    wet years and > 253 mm in dry years from V6 to R3 stage (irrigation every four
    days with a 10-mm irrigation quota, increasing to 20 mm during the vigorous growth
    period). Meanwhile, 150 kg N ha−1 was applied as a basal fertilizer before planting
    and 13.6 kg N ha−1 was applied per irrigation (total 150 kg N ha−1) from VT to
    R3 stage. Our research provides valuable technical guidance to promote agricultural
    safety and sustainable production and has the great potential to popularize the
    application of drip fertigation technology in arid regions. In addition, it is
    recommended that calibrating a deterministic two-dimensional soil-vegetation-atmosphere-transpiration
    model (such as the Daisy model) to truly test the robustness of the selected strategy
    is to be considered for design and management of fertigation in different conditions
    of climate, crop, and soils, achieving crop high yield and yield stability. CRediT

    • Steep-slope vineyards are a cultural heritage threatened by increasing weather
    extremes: intense rainfall and drought. • A prototype of low-impact micro storages
    is tested to improve resilience to climate change of steep-slope viticulture.
    • High-resolution topography is necessary to optimally identify rainwater harvesting

    The steep slopes accommodate some of the most important vineyards in Italy. Examples
    are the rural landscapes of the Veneto region (such as the hills where Amarone,
    Prosecco, and Soave wines are produced), the Valtellina valley (Lombardy region),
    the Langhe (Piedmont region; UNESCO Cultural Landscape), the Gran Sasso National
    Park (Abruzzo region) as well as Trentino Alto Adige, etc. (Eynard and Dalmasso,
    1990). The “Soave traditional vineyards” (Veneto region, Italy) is a traditional
    terrace agricultural landscape that economically supports more than 3000 families
    in the past 200 years (Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS),
    2018). The GIAHS programme safeguards the social, cultural, economic, and environmental
    goods and services these rural areas provide. A further relevant reality in Veneto
    region (Italy) is the steep-slope viticulture of the Colline del Prosecco di Conegliano
    e Valdobbiadene, a UNESCO World Heritage site. Here the terracing practice of
    ciglioni has been adopted since 17th century. Another example is coming from the
    south of Italy: the ingenious techniques of cultivating head-trained bush vines
    called “alberello”, which can successfully protect vineyards from the wind and
    it is transmitted for centuries by vine growers and farmers of the Mediterranean
    island of Pantelleria (Chironi et al., 2020). However, these high-value landscapes
    are often experiencing extreme weather events, and these are predicted to continue
    in the future (Bai et al., 2013, Yin et al., 2018). The challenge of growing intense
    rainfall is paralleled by the increasing prolonged drought (Straffelini and Tarolli,
    2023). On the one hand, climate change tends to have a more dramatic impact on
    steep-slope agriculture than in other agriculture landscapes since the fraction
    distributed in the arid climate class will double in the future (Wang et al.,
    2022a). One of the worst examples is the drought that occurred in the north of
    Italy in 2022, where 40% of the crop for the whole country and water levels have
    reached the lowest in the last 70 years (Levantesi, 2022). On the other hand,
    the increasing intensive rainfall led to landslides and even flooding in steep-slope
    areas (Chen et al., 2018, Tarolli and Straffelini, 2020, Wang et al., 2022b).
    The area of Soave traditional vineyards has been exposed to extreme rainfall events
    that have caused extensive damage. Among the most severe is the October 31, 2010,
    event (more than 100 mm of rain in 72 h recorded at a nearby weather station),
    which caused a creek to overflow and extensive flooding that caused millions in
    damage and fatalities. More recent intense storms recorded in the area occurred
    on 1st September 2018 and on 29th August 2020. Both events caused devastating
    consequences for the vines and economic losses for the local farmers (Pijl et
    al., 2022). The 2020 event played an important role on farms and the public on
    the issue of climate change and associated impacts (also due to an unprecedented
    downburst occurrence). On that occasion, surface runoff caused extensive land
    degradation in several farms and along rural roads. In addition, steep slopes
    in agricultural areas tend to be more susceptible to water deficits if control
    measures lack (Kimaro, 2019). Considering that water source management will be
    more complex due to future climatic conditions, mitigating climate-induced effects
    like extreme localized rainfall and prolonged droughts is urgent for the suitable
    development of steep-slope viticulture. Compared to other kinds of farmlands,
    the physical transport of water is more difficult and expensive in steep-slope
    agriculture due to its complex topography. In this case, rainwater harvests are
    indispensable water supplies for irrigation and groundwater recharge (Wu et al.,
    2018). Water storage and harvest facilities are the best solutions for making
    each drop of water useful and decreasing surface overflow at the same time (Adham
    et al., 2018). Rainfall water can be collected in different approaches like runoff
    interception, infiltration improvement in soil, and integrated watershed management
    (Rockström and Falkenmark, 2015). Water harvesting technique such as dams, ditches,
    tank, and ponds etc., combined with crop management has been proven as a plausible
    approach to address the water shortage issues and have been widely applied in
    many countries for years (Deora and Nanore, 2019, Morgado et al., 2022, Munyasya
    et al., 2022, Odhiambo et al., 2021, Zhang et al., 2021). For instance, Kumar
    et al. (2008) derived suitable sites for water conservation structures like check
    dams, contour bunding, recharge pits, wells, and contour trenching on the regional
    scale (Kumar et al., 2008). Furthermore, successful water conservation measures
    have multiple interacting implications in biophysical, economic, and ecological
    systems (Wordofa et al., 2020). Although the grapevines are experiencing previously
    unseen conditions due to extreme weather (Helder and João, 2018, Naulleau et al.,
    2022), few studies have been working on the more resilient sustainable water management
    in steep-slope vineyards. Identifying the optimal position for water storage facilities
    is the key step to maximizing the water collected and crop production, especially
    under extreme weather in areas with complex topographic conditions. The main objective
    of this paper is to present a prototype of a water harvesting system consisting
    of low-impact micro storages. In detail, the goals are: (1) to simulate hydrological
    processes in steep-slope viticulture for different rainfall events; (2) to design
    a water reservoir system in optimal sites for both alleviating the runoff and
    harvesting rainwater with minimal disturbance to the local site, giving the value
    of landscapes protected by FAO; (3) to quantify the water collected (therefore
    also the runoff reduction) of the designed water management system, to be potentially
    re-used then for irrigation. This study provides new insights for farmers and
    decision-makers in exploring rational and economic-feasible water resource management,
    which is meant for developing sustainable steep-slope vinicultural systems, particularly
    in the context of climate change and intense water pressure. 2. Materials and
    methods 2.1. Study area The study area is situated in the north-eastern part of
    the Soave vineyard (North of Italy), a valley called Brognoligo (Fig. 1, 45◦27′12.07″
    N; 11◦16′41.98″ E), covering about 20 ha. Brognoligo is one of the most historic
    areas for wine production in the area of Soave. It is famous for manually producing
    full-bodied and structured wine in a dry system. The study area is on a steep
    slope with an average gradient of 17 degrees. The elevation ranged from 98 to
    217 m. Annual precipitation is around 1200 mm. The dominant soil type in this
    area is clay. The main land use is vineyard (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 (middle) is a 3D
    map of overflow simulation to illustrate the potentially critical points in terms
    of flow accumulation in the study area. Fig. 1 shows that all the runoff during
    the rainfall flows towards the downslope village (white arrow in the figure).
    The only drainage system in the village is a 1-meter-deep and 0.5-meter-wide ditch

    indicated by the white arrow. 2.2. The surface runoff simulation To quantify the
    efficiency of the water reservoirs, we applied the SIMulated Water Erosion (SIMWE)
    model to simulate overland flow in different rainfall scenarios with and without
    designed water reservoirs. SIMulated Water Erosion (SIMWE) was developed by Mitas
    and Mitasova (1998), a physically distributed model well recognized for real-time
    overflow simulation, which is widely used in flood risks estimation, surface runoff
    analysis, and accumulation as well as drainage systems design in recent years
    (Li et al., 2020). The SIMWE model can quantitatively describe the spatial-temporal
    water distribution in the complex agro-hydrological process with only a few input
    data. The input of SIMWE includes an elevation raster map, Manning’s roughness
    values (-), and rainfall excess (mm h−1); the output includes a water depth raster
    map (m) and a water discharge raster map (m3/s). Considering the SIMWE has a higher
    estimation for hydraulic risk with a high-resolution elevation input map (Li et
    al., 2020), this study applied a 1-meter high-resolution digital elevation model.
    The topographic dataset was produced by LiDAR data. The runoff simulation is based
    on two extreme rainfall events that occurred in the Veneto region on September
    1st 2018 (82.4 mm h−1 5-minutes step) (Pijl et al., 2020) and August 29th 2020
    (182.0 mm h−1 5-minutes step; as indicated in Pijl et al., 2022, this intensity
    was an estimation, but consistent with values recorded by local authorities).
    The Manning’s roughness coefficient (-) and rainfall excess (mm h−1) values implemented
    in the hydrological model have already been validated and based on previous research
    in Soave (Pijl et al., 2022, Straffelini et al., 2022), are reported in Table
    1. Table 1. Main information and parameters used for simulations using the SIMWE
    model. Empty Cell Scenario 1 Scenario 2 Data September 1st 2018 August 29th 2020

    and 0.013 for designed water storage 0.1 for vineyard and 0.013 for designed water
    storage Rainfall excess (mm h−1) 45.1 for vineyard and 82.4 for designed water
    storage 145.1 for vineyard and 182.0 for designed water storages 2.3. Water storage
    locations and design 53 potential sites were identified for water harvesting systems
    based on field survey and runoff simulation (Fig. 2). Different size of water
    reservoirs was developed according to the traditional knowledge of local farmers
    (farmers were interviewed; they also showed us some abandoned examples of micro-storages)
    that two generations ago were used to deal with these kinds of water storage solutions,
    now no longer proposed. The water storage volume was designed according to the
    amount of simulated runoff (water depth), and the surrounding environment ranges
    from 4 m3 to 30 m3. All the designed sites are generated by “digging the hole”
    on the ground with locally available materials, similar to the picture e in Fig.
    1. The operation of the water collection facilities in the study area is achieved
    by modifying the elevation of DTM. The site of water storages facilities meets
    four conditions as follows: (1) in the position where have potential runoff; (2)
    in a direction perpendicular to the simulated overflow to intercept runoff more
    effectively; (3) parallel to the contour lines to reduce the practical difficulties;
    (4) between rows of vines where without interfere vineyard cultivation. Considering
    the increasing climate change influence on steep-slope agriculture landscapes,
    we separately based runoff simulation on two rainfall scenarios in 5 min and 10 min
    to identify the runoff intercepting and water-saving function of the designed
    water reservoir under extreme rainfall events. We chose the maximum 10-minute
    interval for two reasons: (1) the peak rainfall recorded in this area, 182.0 mm h−1,
    lasted for 5 min (Pijl et al., 2022). (2) The model reaches a \"steady state\"
    after 10 min as the input and output values are in equilibrium. The investigation
    area highlighted by the red circle (Fig. 2) is where to detect runoff reduction.
    This area is chosen below the designed water storage and perpendicular to the
    direction of the simulated runoff simultaneously. Download : Download high-res

    surface runoff by designed water management systems was statistically analyzed
    in different hydrological simulations. Specifically, water depth values for each
    simulated rainfall intensity and at the two event times were compared. The gridded
    values of model outputs were imported and analyzed in R software. The comparison
    was made using the one-way ANOVA test to determine the differences between the
    simulations and the post-hoc Tukey-Kramer test to perform the pairwise comparison
    between the scenario without (before) and with (after) the implementation of the
    storages. 3. Result 3.1. The simulation of runoff Fig. 3 shows the simulated water
    depth (blue label) value before and after putting designed water reservoirs based
    on the rainfall events interval considered. In the same time interval, the water
    depth and surface overflow at 182.0 mm h−1 are much higher than at 82.4 mm h−1.
    Similarly, in the same rainfall scenario, the water depth in 10 min is higher
    than in 5 min. Simulated water fluxes showed that water from the upslope mainly
    followed the ditches located in the center of the study area, accumulated in the
    downslope, and finally converged at the outlet of the terraces, which is the only
    drainages system mentioned before (Fig. 1, picture c). In the 82.4 mm h−1 (5-minutes)
    rainfall scenario, the average water depth and discharges are 0.07 m and 0.04 m3/s.
    In the 82.4 mm h−1 (10-minutes) the average water depth and water discharges are
    0.09 m and 0.07 m3/s. In the 182.0 mm h−1 (5-minutes) rainfall scenario, the average
    water depth and discharge are 0.016 m and 0.013 m3/s. In the 182.0 mm h−1 (10-minutes)
    simulation, the average water depth and discharge are 0.019 m and 0.02 m3/s. Download

    (10-minutes) rainfall scenarios. Fig. 4 shows the magnification of the runoff
    path before and after putting water storage in several critical areas. Water accumulation
    in designed water storage facilities was highlighted by red rectangular. The average
    water depth harvested by designed water storages facilities is 0.07 m, 0.09 m,
    0.26 m, and 0.30 m in the 82.4 mm h−1 (5-minutes), 82.4 mm h−1 (10-minutes), 182.0 mm h−1
    (5-minutes), 182.0 mm h−1 (10-minutes) rainfall scenarios, respectively. Our result
    showed that low-tech and simple water resource management facilities could collect
    water effectively in steep-slope agricultural landscapes, which is especially
    important for areas that are difficult to access by machinery due to poor traffic
    conditions. Download : Download high-res image (539KB) Download : Download full-size

    The effect of water resource management on runoff mitigation Our result indicated
    that a water reservoir can decrease runoff significantly in the 82.4 mm h−1 (5 min)
    scenario, 82.4 mm h−1 (10 min) scenario, 182.0 mm h−1 (5 min) scenario, 182.0 mm h−1
    (10 min) scenario with the p-value less than 0.000001, 0.000001, 0.001, 0.001
    separately. It is interesting to note that in both 5 min simulations in 82.4 mm h−1
    and 182.0 mm h−1 rainfall events, the effect of water decreased is much more significant
    in 10 min simulation, which can be reflected by P-value tests returned < 0.000001.

    are mainly located in the middle and lower reaches of the study area. The overall
    location remains the same, although it changes slightly under different climatic
    conditions. According to the calculation, 33.67 m3 of water was saved in the 82.4 mm h−1

    by designed water storage in four different scenarios. 4. Discussion 4.1. The
    importance of designing site-specific water storages facilities for the steep-slope
    viticulture landscapes Our study concludes that the micro water storage systems
    have an enormous potential for water saving in steep-slope agriculture. In this
    study, the micro water storages network was designed for four reasons: (1) As
    one of few agricultural heritage sites worldwide recognized by FAO in the GIAHS
    list, Soave traditional agricultural systems were not allowed to make massive
    land use shifts such as the construction of big dams or large farm ponds, since
    it had already maintained by locally adapted management (GIAHS, 2018); (2) To
    avoid larger and complex infrastructure that can be unstable on a steep-slope,
    all the designed water storages in this study are at a maximum depth of 1 m for
    safety reason; (3) for a site-specific reason. Several studies have documented
    the critical role of ponds and pans, check dams, terracing, percolation tanks,
    etc., in water harvesting (Ammar et al., 2016). However, different water harvesting
    structures have their particularities and purpose and require specific construction
    conditions (Vema et al., 2019). For example, check dams have been well-recognized
    in China and India for alleviating the problem of water scarcity and preventing
    floods (Balooni et al., 2008, Yuan et al., 2022). However, check dams are only
    suitable in the catchment area ≥ 25 (ha), and agriculture ponds are available
    for small flat areas with slopes ≤ 5% (Ammar et al., 2016). The Percolation Ponds
    are suitable on moderate slopes of 5–10% also more tend to recharge groundwater
    instead of irrigation water use (Christy and Lakshmanan, 2017); research has consistently
    shown that above-water harvesting facilities are not plausible in the steep slopes
    viticulture with low runoff potential and high permeability (Vema et al., 2019);
    (4) The difficulty in transporting water in steep-slope vineyards; (5) Economic
    acceptable by local farmers. The introduction of complex new water storage systems
    can largely decrease water stress and the risk of crop failures in different scales
    of farming systems (household, community, and catchment). However, in this case,
    the investment cost is also expensive. An economically feasible system with locally
    available material approaches is advisable in steep-slope agriculture for multipurpose
    use (Rockström, 2000). Tiwari et al. (2018) also emphasized the importance of
    time-saving and cost-effectiveness in water resource management. Our research
    highlighted the significance of the revival of traditional agricultural water
    harvesting facilities, which is also well recognized by some other countries like
    India (Balooni et al., 2008). 4.2. Improve water management efficiency by combining
    the smart irrigation systems for dry spell mitigation In our study, 500 m3 of
    water can be potentially collected. Based on the previous research, the minimum
    water consumption in the vineyard is 300 mm yr−1 (Medrano et al., 2015) and approximately
    an entire month''s water requirements for a hectare of vineyard. In the Mediterranean
    areas, rain usually comes in sporadic, unpredictable storms and is mainly lost
    in evaporation and runoff, leaving frequent dry periods during the crop-growing
    season (Oweis and Hachum, 2006). Many researches about smart irrigation systems,
    such as pressurized irrigation systems and Automation of Farm Irrigation, are
    applied for optimal irrigation scheduling (Bwambale et al., 2022, Kamienski et
    al., 2019, Ommani, 2011, Oweis and Hachum, 2006, Vij et al., 2020). However, only
    a few studies focus on the water source for irrigation in mountainous areas. One
    of the ideas from Precision Agriculture is to combine intelligent agricultural
    irrigation systems with designed water harvesting systems, where funding allows,
    to solve the problem of over-irrigation in steep-slope viticulture and thereby
    improve water productivity. Optimal distribution of limited water resources can
    also be coupled with improved irrigation management options and technologies such
    as Supplemental, Deficit, Sprinkler, and Drip irrigation. In this way, tangible
    water productivity can be achieved on a sustainable basis (Baig et al., 2013,
    Geerts and Raes, 2009, Man et al., 2017). The collection of rural water can also
    be used to develop livestock farming and ecosystem diversity (Rockström, 2000).
    Water management guidelines should highlight maximum water productivity rather
    than land productivity (Geerts and Raes, 2009, Oweis and Hachum, 2006). Interesting
    is the optimization of the storage design to minimize water infiltration within
    the system and evaporation after water collection. In the first case, an impermeable
    layer (such as a sheath) should be installed to prevent percolation; in the latter,
    a shade net (useful to reduce the surface water temperature and retain it during
    evaporation) or a system of floating elements can be considered. 4.3. Runoff reduction
    via utilization of micro water harvesting systems Our study concluded that micro
    water reservoir systems could significantly intercept runoff and harvest water
    in extreme rainfall events to be potentially used for irrigation during drought
    periods. These dual benefits are not necessarily coincident in all types of water
    harvesting techniques (Sample and Liu, 2014). Most studies of water harvest techniques
    have focused on water supply exclusively or large water harvesting facilities
    (Garg et al., 2022, Landicho et al., 2022). In this study, we aim to identify
    the influence of a micro-water harvesting system with minimum land modifications.
    However, more water harvesting facilities are recommended to mitigate the hydrologic
    risk of extreme rainfall events, especially considering that all runoff eventually
    drains downstream in the village. 5. Limitations and future challenges The accuracy
    of the rainfall-runoff relationship simulated is highly dependent on the input
    data, model complexity, users (Adham et al., 2018), and data availability for
    model calibration and validation in complex morphology areas are usually lacking.
    Therefore, a limitation of this study could be determined by the use of a hydrological
    model and remote sensing data for process evaluation, which inevitably incorporates
    errors. Nevertheless, the SIMWE model based on high-resolution remotely sensed
    data used in this research has already been successfully tested in the wine-growing
    region and combined with field trials for verification (Pijl et al., 2020, Straffelini
    et al., 2022). Future challenges include the application of diverse high-resolution
    datasets (for example, based on UAV-SfM) in the delineation of potential sites
    for water harvesting structures and water leakages detection, which is also confirmed
    by previous studies (Abdulla Umar Naseef and Thomas, 2016, Chartzoulakis and Bertaki,
    2015, Engman, 1991, Hammer et al., 2011, Waseem Ghani et al., 2013). In addition,
    real-time monitoring systems provide a shoulder to the farming industries in monitoring
    and tracking agricultural water use and improving the effectiveness of water retention
    measures at multiple scales (Foster et al., 2020). There is a need for further
    research on the hydrological model development involving both surface and sub-surface
    parameters such as groundwater discharge and evapotranspiration. A novel way of
    estimating the trends of global irrigation dynamics based on multiple satellite
    products was reported recently (Zhang et al., 2022). The development of finer
    spatiotemporal resolution satellite-based products will significantly increase
    the effectiveness of water resource management in the future (Zhang et al., 2022).
    The spatial design and organization of the vineyard can considerably affect surface
    runoff pathway and accumulation patterns (Pijl et al., 2020); thus, the same initiative
    should be repeated in other steep-slope viticulture to avoid site-specific biases.
    This study clearly illustrates the water amount harvested by the designed method
    for irrigation use, but this stands in contrast with the actual amount of irrigation
    in the study area. However, this research aimed to demonstrate the technical and
    methodological feasibility of incorporating water harvesting facilities based
    on remote sensing and modeling. In the scenario analyzed, 500 m3 of water can
    be harvested per 20 ha of vineyard, thus about 25 m3/ha. At the operational level,
    further exploration of micro-water harvesting systems is encouraged to obtain
    the maximum amount of water possible and to minimize leakage due to infiltration
    or evaporation. Combining micro water storage on steep slopes with larger ponds
    in morphologically suitable areas with storable volume could be interesting. For
    instance, in Italy, a farmer could construct up to 50 m3/ha storage facility without
    special permissions; this value is indicated in the new national legislative proposal
    to address drought in agriculture (D.L. 39/2023). The feasibility of larger infrastructures
    depends on the type of study area. In the case of steep-slope cultural landscapes
    (such as the vineyard analyzed in this research), further permitting constraints
    may arise in addition to construction difficulties due to complex morphology.
    It is also recommended to line the interior of the storage with waterproof materials
    to limit infiltration, combined with appropriate and sustainable covers to limit
    evaporation. It is important to emphasize that the use of micro water storage
    alone cannot be sufficient to solve the problem of the impacts of opposing climate
    extremes (such as intense rainfall and drought) in steep-slope agriculture. Indeed,
    they need to be incorporated into a multidimensional planning strategy that combines
    water harvesting and precision irrigation with a series of targeted interventions.
    Promoting conservation agriculture techniques to maintain and improve soil organic
    carbon content could be useful for soil water retention. Particular attention
    should be paid to the vineyard grass cover to protect the soil, limit runoff,
    and increase biodiversity. Finally, in cases where manual cultivation of the fields
    is not suitable, light mechanization is recommended to limit soil compaction.
    Implementation of a water storage network combined with sustainable vineyard management
    and proper monitoring can therefore become a winning strategy in steep-slope vineyards
    (especially in the case of traditional and cultural landscapes) for mitigating
    the adverse effects of climate change. 6. Conclusion Improving water resource
    management in traditional landscapes is important for designing sustainable and
    climate-change-resilient agricultural systems. This study designed a potential
    water harvesting network including 53 sites for collecting rainwater based on
    indigenous knowledge, field survey, runoff simulation, and topographic analysis.
    The study area is the FAO-GIAHS site of Soave (Italy), which has provided social,
    cultural, economic, and environmental goods and services for over 200 years for
    local people (Vigotti, 2021). The results show that these simple, micro-harvesting
    systems can considerably reduce the surface overflow (with P values tests returned
    <0.001) and effectively collect rainwater in different rainfall conditions. According
    to the calculation, 33.67 m3 of water was saved in the 82.4 mm h−1 (5 min) scenario,
    41.92 m3 was saved in the 82.4 mm h−1 (10 min), 116.74 m3 saved in the 182.0 mm h−1
    (5 min), and 134.7 m3 saved in the 182.0 mm h−1 (10 min) scenario. A total of
    500 m3 of water can be collected and used for emergency irrigation during drought.
    The maximum drop in water depth at the outlet of the study area was 2 cm at 82.4 mm h−1
    (5 min) scenario and 182.0 mm h−1 (5 min) scenario. Our work illustrated the urgent
    need to revival traditional and cost-effective water resource management in steep-slope
    viticulture. Furthermore, we discussed that combining new irrigation technologies
    with designed water harvesting facilities will have a multiplier effect on improving
    water use. Given the specificities of steep-slope agriculture, there is a need
    to promote various indigenous water harvesting facilities and improve water productivity
    rather than designing more complex and expensive water management methods that
    are difficult for farmers to accept, except when funding is available. Sustainable
    development can only be achieved when the water resource management systems are
    adapted to the local natural, economic, and social environment in steep-slope
    viticulture. CRediT authorship contribution statement W.W. and P.T. conceived

    Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are distributed networks of spatially dispersed
    autonomous sensor nodes that are interconnected by wireless communication links
    (Zhang et al., 2022, 2023). These nodes are capable of monitoring and measuring
    a wide range of environmental and physical conditions, including temperature,
    humidity, pressure and motion. By transmitting the data collected from these sensors
    to a central data collection point for processing and analysis, WSNs are becoming
    increasingly valuable in numerous fields, including environmental monitoring,
    military surveillance and health monitoring. The development of WSNs has brought
    about new opportunities for efficient and cost-effective monitoring of various
    parameters in real time, enabling advanced data analytics and decision-making
    (Lee et al., 2022; Santhakumar et al., 2021; Yumuşak & Demirtaş, 2022). Smart
    irrigation systems are one of the many applications of WSNs (Edodi et al., 2022;
    Nurlan et al., 2022). These systems aim to optimize water usage in agriculture
    by monitoring soil moisture levels and regulating water supply based on the specific
    needs of crops. WSNs can be used to monitor and collect data on various parameters
    that affect irrigation, such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture and weather
    conditions. These data are then used to control the irrigation system, ensuring
    that water is supplied only when and where it is needed. This results in significant
    water savings, increased crop yield and reduced costs. WSNs can also help identify
    areas of the field that require more water, improving the overall efficiency of
    the irrigation system (Aldegheishem et al., 2022; Campoverde et al., 2021; Patel
    et al., 2021). In WSNs, energy efficiency is a crucial factor since the network
    nodes often rely on limited energy sources such as batteries that cannot be easily
    recharged. Cluster-based routing protocols have demonstrated high energy efficiency
    in WSNs, where the agricultural field is divided into subfields (clusters) consisting
    of multiple sensor nodes. These nodes transmit their data packets to designated
    cluster heads (CHs), which then consolidate the information and forward it to
    the base station (BS). This approach has been proven to enhance energy efficiency
    when compared to other methods (Chaturvedi et al., 2018; Hassan et al., 2017).
    By utilizing cluster-based routing protocols, WSNs can operate for longer periods
    of time, collect more precise data and hence become more efficient and valuable
    for a wide range of applications, including smart irrigation systems. Heterogeneous
    sensor nodes are more efficient than homogeneous nodes in terms of reducing energy
    consumption and prolonging network lifetime (Ayoob et al., 2016; Chatap & Sirsikar,
    2017; Singla & Kaur, 2016). Therefore, this paper aims to design energy-efficient
    heterogeneous routing protocols that enhance the stability period, throughput
    and network lifetime. 2 RELATED WORK Smart irrigation systems based on WSNs have
    become an area of intense research in recent years. A number of studies have been
    conducted in this field to design more efficient and reliable systems. In this
    subsection, we will review some of the most relevant works related to WSNs-based
    smart irrigation systems (Deepa et al., 2023; Guevara et al., 2020; Krishnan et
    al., 2020; Kumar & Jayaraman, 2020; Motamedi & Villányi, 2022). A study by Kumar
    and Jayaraman (2020) presents a novel approach for an irrigation control system
    in WSNs using the internet of things (IoT). The approach uses a fuzzy inference
    system for optimal CH selection based on distance and residual energy, followed
    by the power-efficient gathering of sensor information. Another study by Guevara
    et al. (2020) presents a smart water irrigation system that includes a drip irrigation
    module, wireless communication module and sensor network for collecting measurements
    of volumetric water content, temperature and electrical conductivity. Real-time
    data are transmitted to the cloud via a secure internet protocol (IP) gateway
    and can be accessed through a user-friendly web interface. The framework is easily
    implementable and low-cost and is expected to optimize irrigation cycles and conserve
    water based on a set moisture threshold. Krishnan et al. (2020) propose a smart
    irrigation system that utilizes the Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM)
    to assist farmers in watering their agricultural fields. The system can provide
    updates on various aspects, such as the humidity level of the soil, temperature
    of the surrounding environment and status of the motor with respect to power supply,
    whether it is from the main power grid or from solar power. Another study by Motamedi
    and Villányi (2022) proposes a system for monitoring and controlling irrigation
    in a greenhouse environment. The system employs ZigBee-based WSNs to collect and
    transmit data on environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture
    and light intensity. The collected data are then used to automate the irrigation
    process and control the growth of plants. The proposed system was found to be
    more efficient and effective than traditional irrigation methods. An IoT-based
    smart agriculture system has been proposed in Deepa et al. (2023) using the energy-efficient
    water management platform (EEWMP). The efficacy of the system is evaluated in
    terms of energy consumption and network stability. The test results demonstrate
    that the EEWMP improves network stability by two-fold and uses 25% less energy
    than the existing approach. All these studies demonstrate the potential of WSNs-based
    smart irrigation systems to improve irrigation efficiency and crop yield while
    reducing water waste. However, further research is needed to develop more efficient
    and reliable WSNs-based smart irrigation systems that can be deployed on a larger
    scale and in different environmental conditions. Therefore, this paper introduces
    a set of heterogeneous routing protocols for WSNs that utilize clustering-based
    approaches and their applications in smart irrigation systems. The study focuses
    on two types of clustering-based protocols: stable election protocol (SEP)-based
    and distributed energy-efficient clustering (DEEC)-based protocols. The key difference
    between the two protocols lies in the CH selection method. SEP-based protocols
    select CHs based on their initial energy levels, whereas DEEC-based protocols
    select CHs based on the probability of a node''s remaining energy relative to
    the network mean energy. The proposed protocols include threshold-sensitive SEP
    (TSEP), zonal SEP (ZSEP), enhanced DEEC (EDEEC) and threshold DEEC (TDEEC). Various
    evaluation metrics, such as throughput, network stability, instability period
    and lifetime, are used to compare the performance of the presented protocols.
    This paper is organized as follows: Section 3 presents the proposed WSN model
    for smart irrigation. A review of cluster-based routing protocols is presented
    in Section 4. Section 7 describes the network model of both SEP-based and DEEC-based
    protocols. In Section 10, the results of simulations are presented and discussed.
    Finally, Section 13 draws conclusions and proposes research goals for future work.
    3 SMART IRRIGATION-BASED WSN MODEL The proposed model of the smart irrigation-based
    WSN is depicted in Figure 1. The WSN consists of sensor nodes deployed in agricultural
    subfields (clusters) to monitor and collect environmental and agricultural data,
    including air temperature, humidity, light, soil conditions and moisture, among
    others. These sensor nodes periodically transmit data to CHs, which aggregate
    the data and relay it to the BS and subsequently to the control centre and server
    via the internet. The collected data can be used by farmers to make informed decisions
    for optimizing crop yields and maintaining farm health. The clustering model in
    routing protocols is preferred due to its effectiveness in improving the energy
    consumption of the network sensor nodes, as depicted in Figure 1. However, designing
    energy-efficient routing protocols for WSNs is challenging due to the limited
    battery life of the sensors and the high energy consumption associated with sending
    and receiving data, route discovery and maintenance. FIGURE 1 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint Network model of smart irrigation-based wireless sensor network. Hence,
    the design of WSNs should consider factors such as sensor size, software and hardware
    characteristics and distribution area to optimize energy consumption, given that
    the energy supply is the primary limiting factor in the lifespan of a sensor network.
    The proposed WSN architecture is scalable and can be implemented in small-scale
    and large-scale farms, including national-level operations. 4 CLUSTER-BASED ROUTING
    PROTOCOLS The categorization of WSN routing protocols is based on the approach
    utilized to establish routing paths and the network configuration. This study
    introduces novel protocols for selecting CHs in heterogeneous sensor networks
    that are founded on the SEP and DEEC protocols. 4.1 Stable election-based protocols
    Stable election protocol SEP is a proactive routing protocol that considers the
    two-level heterogeneity of nodes (Hossan & Choudhury, 2022). SEP has two types
    of nodes with varying energy values, with advanced nodes having more initial energy
    than normal nodes (Hossan & Choudhury, 2022). This protocol aims to evenly distribute
    energy consumption and extend the stability period, which is the time after the
    first node failure. The selection of the CH in SEP is based on a weighted election
    probability for each node, which is determined by the node''s initial energy,
    making advanced nodes more likely to be chosen as CHs. Enhanced SEP ESEP is a
    modified protocol of SEP used to prolong the effective network lifetime. It contains
    three energy levels of heterogeneity by including a new node type, namely, intermediate
    nodes. The intermediate node energy is between the normal and advanced node energies.
    Let E0 and Eadv be the normal node and advanced node energies, respectively. Advanced
    and intermediate node energies are given as follows (Hamad et al., 2021): (1)
    (2) where β is referred to as the extra energy factor of advanced nodes compared
    to normal nodes, and b = β/2, resulting in the total start energy of all node
    types being (3) In Equation (3), d and p are the proportions of advanced and intermediate
    nodes that have β and b times more energy compared to normal nodes, respectively,
    and n is the number of sensors that are randomly distributed in a square area
    of A = M × M m2. The probability of a node being selected as a CH, considering
    its type (normal, intermediate and advanced), is calculated through weighted election
    probabilities, which are pnrm, pint and padv, respectively, and given as (4) (5)
    (6) In the above equations, Popt represents the optimal probability of a node
    being a CH and is given by (7) with copt being the optimal number of clusters.
    The thresholds for normal, advanced and intermediate nodes are given as follows:
    (8) (9) (10) where S′, S″ and S‴ represent the node sets of normal, advanced and
    intermediate, respectively, that are not CHs in the last (1/pnrm) and (1/padv)
    rounds of the epoch. Threshold-sensitive SEP TSEP is a stretching of the SEP algorithm,
    with three levels of energy heterogeneity, such as in ESEP. This protocol is a
    reactive protocol. In TSEP, the nodes sense the data continuously, and these nodes
    send all data to the sink when there is a significant transformation or a specific
    threshold value is reached in the transmitted information, so this protocol reduces
    energy utilization and increases the WSN lifetime more than SEP and ESEP (Kashaf
    et al., 2012). The overall starting energy of the TSEP, Etot, of the considered
    nodes, normal, intermediate and advanced, is given by Equation (3) as in ESEP.
    The values of the weighted probabilities to become CHs, pnrm, pint and padv, respectively,
    are given by Equations (4), (5) and (6), and the threshold values for the three
    nodes are calculated as in Equations (8), (9) and (10). The transmission of nodes
    in the TSEP depends on the sensed value (SV) if there is a change in the values
    of the two thresholds. There are two crucial parameters broadcasted by the CH:
    Hard threshold (HT): This represents the absolute value of sensed data, where
    nodes send its data to CHs even if this SV became similar or larger than the threshold
    value. Soft threshold (ST): This is the minimum transmitted value at which the
    nodes send their data to CHs. The sensor nodes are constantly sensing around their
    field; if the SV arrives at the HT value, the nodes will transmit their data to
    the CH. Where this value is stored in the inner variable memory, it is called
    SV; hence, we find that the nodes do not send the data only if the two conditions
    are satisfied: The first condition is if the SV is larger than the HT. The second
    condition is that if the difference between the current SV and the stored value
    in the SV is equal to or larger than the ST. The transmission process depends
    on these two conditions. Therefore, if there is a change in the values of the
    two thresholds, the transmission process is less; so this protocol is not good
    in most applications. Zonal SEP An example of a proactive protocol is the ZSEP,
    which is based on SEP with heterogeneity levels of two, namely, normal and advanced
    nodes. It employs two scenarios to transmit information to the BS: direct transmission
    (DT) and transmission via CHs. The agricultural field is split into three head
    zones (HZs): HZ 1, HZ 2 and HZ 0. Normal nodes transmit their data to the BS using
    DT and exist in HZ 0. Half of the advanced nodes are installed at HZ 1, while
    the rest are deployed in HZ 2. These advanced nodes transmit their data to the
    BS via CHs (Gangrekar et al., 2014). The deployment of advanced nodes in these
    zones is because they have more energy, and nodes located at the network corners
    are further away from the BS, requiring higher energy to communicate. The weighted
    probability and threshold value of the advanced nodes are set optimally, such
    as in the SEP protocol. 4.2 DEEC-based protocols Distributed energy-efficient
    clustering DEEC is a proactive routing protocol aimed at reducing energy consumption
    through clustering (Gao et al., 2022). The probability of a node becoming a CH
    is determined according to the proportion of its residual energy to the network
    mean energy. Nodes that have high starting and remaining energy have a greater
    chance to be CHs compared to those that have small energy. Let ri represent the
    round number of node ni to serve as a CH, known as the rotating epoch. Due to
    the differences in residual energy levels among nodes, in a set rotating period,
    nodes with low energy will exhaust their power quickly. The value of ri in DEEC
    is determined according to the remaining energy Ei(r) of each node ni. The network
    mean energy through round r is represented by (Gao et al., 2022): (11) The likelihood
    of ni being a CH in DEEC can be expressed by the following equation: (12) The
    mean number of CHs per round per epoch is calculated using Equation (13): (13)
    where popt serves as a benchmark for probability pi. In a heterogeneous network,
    the starting energy of nodes varies, and the weighted probabilities of both normal
    and advanced nodes are provided as follows (Gao et al., 2022): (14) In the same
    way, the threshold value is calculated using Equation (15): (15) In Equation (15),
    S represents all node sets, and a random number for node ni is generated between
    0 and 1. If this random number is lower than the threshold T (ni), the node becomes
    a CH at round r. According to Equation (12), epoch ri is the reverse value of
    pi, with nopt = 1/popt representing the benchmark epoch to be a CH. At each round
    r, we determine the mean energy Ē(r) and total number of rounds R by the following
    two equations: (16) (17) where Eround represents the energy expenses within each
    round; Etot is calculated in Equation (3). The total wasted energy within a round
    is calculated by Equation (18): (18) where C refers to the number of clusters,
    L represents the data packet size in bits, EDA is the wated energy during data
    aggregation, dCH-to-BS is the mean distance between the CH and BS and dtoCH represents
    the mean distance between cluster nodes and the CH and is given as (Gao et al.,
    2022) (19) Developed DEEC Developed distributed energy-efficient clustering (DDEEC)
    uses the same approach as applied in DEEC, a two-level heterogeneity, to avoid
    the imbalance case in the selection of nodes that become CHs as in DEEC (Elbhiri
    et al., 2010). However, at round r when advanced nodes contain the same initial
    and residual energy as in the normal nodes, this protocol is not well suited for
    energy division where the advanced nodes will die quickly, and this causes an
    imbalance in the choice probability of the CH. DDEEC avoids this problem by implementing
    a dynamic and balanced method to divide the energy more equitably between the
    nodes. At the first transmission during rounds, the advanced nodes are commonly
    selected to be CHs, but when their energy dynamically decreases, these nodes will
    contain the same selection probability of CHs as in normal nodes, and DDEEC avoids
    punishing this node repeatedly by making a few changes in Equation (14); this
    change depends on the value of the threshold residual energy ThREV, as shown in
    in Equation (20) (Elbhiri et al., 2010): (20) where EdisAN and EdisNN are the
    energies dissipated by the advanced and normal nodes per round, respectively.
    When the energy level for the two nodes decreases to the limit of the threshold
    residual energy, both nodes become CHs when using the same probability. Consequently,
    the choice of CH becomes more efficient and more balanced between nodes. The average
    probability Pi used to select a CH can be written as follows: (21) where Q is
    the real positive variable that directly controls the CH number. Enhanced DEEC
    EDEEC is a variation of DEEC that features three levels of heterogeneity and three
    node types (super, advanced and normal) (Saini & Sharma, 2010). In the network,
    at round r, the probability for CH selection is determined by Ei(r) and Ē(r),
    similar to DEEC, which is expressed in Equation (22) as (22) In EDEEC, the total
    initial energy is calculated as (23) The proportion and the extra energy of the
    super nodes compared to normal nodes is represented by m0 and h. The threshold
    for selecting CHs among the three types of nodes is provided in Equation (24),
    as noted in Saini and Sharma (2010). (24) where S′ and S″ are the normal and advanced
    node sets, respectively, while S‴ represents the super node set. Threshold DEEC
    The TDEEC algorithm extends DEEC and uses the same method to estimate the mean
    energy and weighted probability of CH election. The threshold value in TDEEC is
    determined by the optimal number of CHs, residual nodes and mean energy in the
    WSN through a round. The threshold expression can be written as (Agarwal & Nehra,
    2022) (25) A heterogeneous network consists of two or three levels, and TDEEC
    adapts the threshold value based on the probability of nodes becoming CHs. For
    two-level heterogeneity, the probabilities of both normal and advanced nodes are
    described by Equation (14), while for three-level heterogeneity, the probabilities
    of normal, advanced and super nodes are described by Equation (22). 5 NETWORK
    MODELS FOR PRESENTED PROTOCOLS We consider a heterogeneous WSN consisting of n
    sensors evenly distributed over an M × M m2 area. Each sensor is assigned a distinct
    identifier (ID). The BS is placed at the centre of the network, while the nodes
    are deployed randomly. The heterogeneous WSN is analysed under two scenarios as
    described below. 5.1 SEP-based protocols SEP-based protocols can involve two or
    three levels of energy heterogeneity, depending on the type of protocol. The two-level
    heterogeneous network, as used in SEP and ZSEP, is depicted in Figure 2(a) and
    (b), respectively, and is explained as follows: In SEP, all nodes (both normal
    and advanced) are installed randomly in a 100 × 100 m2 area. In ZSEP, we consider
    the following distribution: HZ 0: Eighty percent of the normal nodes are distributed
    randomly within the boundaries of 0 ≤ X ≤ 100, 20 ≤ Y ≤ 80. HZ 1: Ten percent
    of the advanced nodes are installed in the region defined by 0 ≤ X ≤ 100, 0 ≤ Y ≤ 20.
    HZ 2: The remaining 10% of advanced nodes are installed in the region defined
    by 0 ≤ X ≤ 100, 80 ≤ Y ≤ 100. FIGURE 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Network

    TSEP, involves nodes referred to as normal, advanced and intermediate nodes, which
    are installed randomly in a 100 × 100 m2 area, as depicted in Figure 2c. 5.2 DEEC-based
    protocols For DEEC-based protocols, two and three levels of energy heterogeneity
    are considered, with nodes distributed randomly in a 100 × 100 m2 area. DEEC and
    DDEEC are based on two levels of energy heterogeneity, with all nodes (normal
    and advanced) distributed randomly in a 100 × 100 m2 area, as seen in SEP (Figure
    2a). EDEEC and TDEEC, on the other hand, are based on three levels of energy heterogeneity,
    with nodes deployed randomly, as depicted in Figure 2d. 6 NUMERICAL RESULTS AND
    ANALYSIS The performance of eight protocols is implemented and evaluated using
    a simulation model implemented using MATLAB software. The simulation parameters
    are listed in Table 1. The weighted optimal probability of SEP is determined by
    its initial energy, while in DEEC, it is determined by the mean energy of the
    network and the ratio of residual energy for each node. To make a fair comparison,
    both cases will use the total starting energy for all nodes in the network. The
    simulations are evaluated using the following performance metrics: Dead nodes:
    the total number of nodes that have failed. Packet to BS: also known as throughput,
    which represents the number of transmitted packets from the CHs or sensors to
    the BS. Packets to CHs: the number of transmitted packets from sensor nodes to
    CHs. Stability period: This refers to the time period, measured in rounds, from
    the initiation of network operation until the first node fails. Instability period:
    This is the time interval, measured in rounds, from the failure of the first node
    to the last node. Network lifetime: This is the time interval from the initiation
    of network operation until the last node fails. TABLE 1. Simulation parameters.

    protocol results Two levels of heterogeneity are considered with the following
    values: d = 0.2 and β = 2, that is, 20% of the nodes, referred to as advanced
    nodes, have a higher energy level (β = 2) when compared to normal nodes (Iqbal
    et al., 2014). For three levels of heterogeneity, the values are d = 0.1, p = 0.2,
    β = 2 and b = 1, meaning that 10% and 20% of nodes are classified as advanced
    and intermediate nodes with a larger energy level (β = 2 and b = 1) compared to
    the normal nodes. A comparison of the performance metrics of the SEP-based protocols,
    which include SEP, ZSEP, ESEP and TSEP, is presented in Figures 3, 4, 5 and 6.
    Figures 3 and 4 suggest that TSEP outperforms the other protocols in terms of
    network lifetime, stability period and packets sent to CHs. However, Figure 5
    reveals that TSEP has a low throughput or packet transmission to the BS compared
    to ZSEP. This is because the transmission process to the BS in the TSEP depends
    on the values of HT and ST. On the other hand, Figure 5 indicates that ZSEP has
    a superior performance in terms of packets sent to the BS, which is expected,
    as most nodes in ZSEP directly send packets to the BS. Figure 6 displays the whole
    remaining energy against rounds when the total initial energy in the network is
    70 J. It is evident that TSEP has a higher remaining energy than the other protocols,
    but with a low throughput to the BS. For this reason, this study focused on the
    ZSEP. Table 2 summarizes the average stability, instability periods and lifetime
    for SEP, ZSEP, ESEP and TSEP. FIGURE 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Dead nodes

    are considered with d = 0.2 and β = 2, indicating that 20% of the nodes, referred
    to as advanced nodes, have a higher energy level (β = 2) than normal nodes (Gupta
    & Singh, 2021). For three levels of heterogeneity, the used values are d = 0.3,
    m0 = 0.2, β = 1.2 and h = 2, meaning that 24% and 6% of nodes are designated advanced
    and super nodes, respectively, with a higher energy level (β = 1.2 and h = 2)
    than normal nodes (Gupta & Singh, 2021). In this subsection, we illustrate the
    performance of DEEC-based protocols, including DEEC, DDEEC, EDEEC and TDEEC, through
    simulations. Figures 7, 8, 9 and 10 demonstrate that both EDEEC and TDEEC outperform
    the other protocols in terms of the number of dead nodes. In addition, EDEEC slightly
    outperforms TDEEC. The results from Figure 9 confirm those from Figure 7 with
    respect to the packets to BS, indicating that both EDEEC and TDEEC offer better
    performance than the other protocols, with a slight advantage for EDEEC. In contrast,
    as shown in Figure 8, TDEEC and EDEEC have lower results regarding packets to
    CHs due to their three levels of energy heterogeneity, which affects the probability
    of a node becoming a CH by reducing the average packets to CHs. Figure 10 shows
    the total remaining energy versus the number of rounds, assuming the total starting
    energy of all nodes in the network is 70 J. The results demonstrate that the remaining
    energy per round for EDEEC and TDEEC is larger compared to the other protocols.

    illustrates the average stability, instability periods and lifetime for DEEC,

    period and lifetime. Thus, this study was conducted on TDEEC. TABLE 3. Summary

    SEP and DEEC for WSN-based smart irrigation systems with the goal of improving
    the network''s reliability and energy efficiency. Through comparison with traditional
    protocols using network stability, instability period, lifetime and throughput
    as evaluation metrics, the presented protocols demonstrate superior performance
    in all aspects. Particularly, the results showed that TSEP outperformed all other
    protocols in terms of the performance metrics analysed, except for throughput,
    which was found to be higher in the case of ZSEP. These results clearly demonstrate
    the effectiveness of the proposed protocols, especially TSEP, in prolonging the
    network''s lifespan and enhancing energy efficiency in heterogeneous WSN-based
    smart irrigation systems. Future work could investigate the potential benefits
    of employing multiple mobile sinks on performance metrics and explore the effects
    of adjusting the energy levels of nodes with differing capabilities on energy
    consumption and network longevity. Overall, the presented protocols have the potential
    to significantly enhance communication in smart irrigation systems and improve
    crop production. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors extend their appreciation to the

  description: Increasing solar and wind power use in existing power systems could
    create significant technical issues, especially for grids with poor connectivity
    or stand-alone systems needing more adequate storage capacity. This is due to
    the unpredictable and intermittent nature of solar and wind power. The intermittent
    nature of solar and wind resources can be reduced by integrating them optimally,
    making the entire system more reliable and cost-effective to operate. The advantages
    and disadvantages of hybrid wind and solar energy integration systems are discussed
    in this research. The impact of voltage and frequency oscillations and harmonics
    is amplified in weak grids, affecting both grid-connected and stand-alone systems.
    This may be fixed by ensuring that hybrid systems are well designed, equipped
    with cutting-edge quick reaction control capabilities, and optimized. This review
    offers an overview of existing advances in PV-solar and wind-based hybrid energy
    systems while exploring potential future developments. Further, this review also
    provides an overview of the primary studies published on optimum design considerations
    for compactness, topologies for power electronics, and control. As the global
    energy environment shifts toward sustainability and resilience, this review helps
    researchers, policymakers, and industry stakeholders understand, adapt, and enhance
    PV-solar-wind hybrid energy systems.

    Abstract Increasing solar and wind power use in existing power systems could create
    significant technical issues, especially for grids with poor connectivity or stand-alone
    systems needing more adequate storage capacity. This is due to the unpredictable
    and intermittent nature of solar and wind power. The intermittent nature of solar
    and wind resources can be reduced by integrating them optimally, making the entire
    system more reliable and cost-effective to operate. The advantages and disadvantages
    of hybrid wind and solar energy integration systems are discussed in this research.
    The impact of voltage and frequency oscillations and harmonics is amplified in
    weak grids, affecting both grid-connected and stand-alone systems. This may be
    fixed by ensuring that hybrid systems are well designed, equipped with cutting-edge
    quick reaction control capabilities, and optimized. This review offers an overview
    of existing advances in PV-solar and wind-based hybrid energy systems while exploring
    potential future developments. Further, this review also provides an overview
    of the primary studies published on optimum design considerations for compactness,
    topologies for power electronics, and control. As the global energy environment
    shifts toward sustainability and resilience, this review helps researchers, policymakers,
    and industry stakeholders understand, adapt, and enhance PV-solar-wind hybrid
    energy systems. Issue Section: Review 1 INTRODUCTION Energy seems crucial to a
    nation’s progress, therefore it must be saved as efficiently as possible. However,
    in addition to developing technology to generate energy from all hydrocarbons
    in an eco-friendly manner, energy assets should be preserved as efficiently as
    is feasible. Energy alone drives the economy [1, 2]. The main disadvantages of
    solar and wind systems are their lack of reliability and efficiency [3]. To meet
    energy market demands, renewable energy technology has grown significantly. Petroleum
    consumption drains our foreign currency reserves. The optimal solution to these
    challenges lies in renewable energy [4]. The world’s fossil fuel sources are fast
    depleting [5]. Renewable energy was previously recognized. Over the past 30 years,
    a variety of renewable energy solutions have been researched, developed, tested,
    and implemented. India, with 15% of the world’s population, is one of the fastest-growing
    energy users [6]. Fossil fuels produce greenhouse gases which contribute to global
    warming [7]. Numerous studies predict these energy sources will soon run out.
    This encourages most industrialized and growing nations to switch to renewable
    energy technologies. This is done to meet the growing economic demand for electricity
    and improve power infrastructure efficiency. The best arrangement calls for hybrid
    energy systems, which use photovoltaic, wind, diesel engine, and battery-connected
    power sources to generate electricity. The system uses wind speed, sun radiation,
    wind rates, and meteorological data. Hybrid energy system optimization reduces
    total cost, present values, greenhouse gas emissions, power system failure likelihood,
    energy cost, and annualized system cost [8]. This makes the system cheaper for
    residential use. The adaptive genetic algorithm (GA) uses source chromosomes like
    number of battery banks, PV array ratings, wind turbine capacity, system initialization
    cost, diesel generator rated power, and operation and maintenance cost to produce
    results. The algorithm finds the best solution for the lowest operational maintenance
    cost. An improved GA program for small applications to electrify rural locations
    has been developed using the matrix laboratory (MATLAB) toolbox to reduce the
    cost of the proposed hybrid energy system. This program’s goal is cost reduction.
    Renewable energy sources have steadily increased their global energy supply in
    recent years [9]. Energy storage must be connected to energy system management
    since it is extremely dynamic and sensitive to many conditions. Individualized
    energy management solutions can optimize energy transfer between electric drivetrain
    components. To boost wind energy absorption while enabling power systems, lowering
    wind power’s key drawback of fluctuating renewability might make it easier to
    continue their typical modes of work and ensure the integrity of their useful
    facilities [10]. Thus, energy storage could increase the grid’s adaptability and
    create a quick power reserve to minimize grid imbalances. Real-time stochastic
    power management uses the SPSA algorithm to find the optimum securities for HESS
    elements. This technique determines the optimal HESS component proportions. The
    grid’s power matrix is used to smooth the battery’s output to reduce cycling oscillations
    which have decreased compared to the initial wind power profile. The data show
    that the suggested technique reduces power fluctuations at the grid interface
    by more than 81% in 90% of the days analyzed compared to the wind-produced profile.
    The flywheel’s working mode also varies, although the SPSA’s goal is to reduce
    battery consumption by 65%. The suggested method achieves the provided aims in
    all simulated analyses, proving trustworthy, easier, and faster than alternative
    methods. Further research will apply this power management strategy to WECS and
    HESS circumstances and other renewable energy system designs. The designs are
    implemented to minimize system cost [11]. The renewable energy-based winding system
    for the investigated network would determine how many wind turbines and panels
    are needed to minimize power costs and energy costs owing to energy not given
    inside the channel. The proposed system’s cost includes the net present value
    of all maintenance and operating expenses and the raw cost of energy, which covers
    the initial investment. Hybrid renewable energy systems (HRES) optimize power
    generation by combining renewable sources. These systems use multiple technologies
    to overcome each energy source’s constraints and provide more electricity efficiently
    and consistently. Tawfik et al. [12] optimize an energy management system in a
    Mediterranean port using solar and wind energy. Results show solar panels generate
    sufficient power, while simulated wind arrays show improved performance. Kiehbadroudinezhad
    et al. [13] studied a multi-objective optimization problem which combines life
    cycle cost, environmental impacts, and system reliability. A division algorithm
    is proposed for faster and more flexible solutions. A study of Larak Island, Iran,
    shows the proposed algorithm is more cost-effective and eco-friendlier than genetic
    and artificial bee swarm algorithms. HRES reliability is a significant benefit
    since wind turbines can provide power when solar panels are impractical due to
    nightfall or overcast conditions. Diverse energy sources often maximize energy
    conversion, making use of current conditions. Since renewable resources are free,
    the initial expenses of putting up these systems are offset by lowering operational
    costs over time. HRES is eco-friendly and minimizes fossil fuel use and greenhouse
    gas emissions. Hybrid systems also improve load management by smoothly integrating
    batteries and other storage options. Real-world benefits of HRES are transforming
    energy access and delivery. HRES delivers electrification to isolated populations
    without power. HRES-powered microgrids provide uninterrupted power in grid-unstable
    areas. The industrial sector uses HRES more frequently to reduce energy expenses
    and encourage sustainability. Contemporary urban projects use hybrid energy to
    power large neighborhoods and complexes. Some public transit systems are switching
    to hybrid renewable energy, which minimizes operational costs and environmental
    impacts. Wind and solar energy are well-established forms of renewable energy
    due to their extensive utilization [14]. Their complementary production patterns
    ensure a constant energy supply. Recently developed technologies have increased
    efficiency and lowered expenses. The use of these methods simultaneously improves
    land efficiency and provides ecological benefits. A photovoltaic power station,
    wind farm, and energy storage device with a manageable capacity arrangement are
    needed to make a hybrid wind-photovoltaic-storage power system economically viable
    [15]. So, we propose a new energy storage technology that combines wind, solar,
    and gravitational energy. The storage of energy is vital for extensively utilizing
    renewable energy sources. Location and building size limit energy storage solutions
    such as compressed air and battery systems. One of a gravity energy storage system’s
    benefits in hilly areas is its ability to use the terrain. Mountain height stores
    GESS energy. Using a numerical method, wind and solar power plants can provide
    renewable energy to ordinary families [16]. A non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm
    assessed the ecological and economic optimum for four hybrid energy system scenarios.
    Synchronously using optimization goals and sensitivity analysis, the system was
    designed to meet established requirements. The environmental goal was to reduce
    carbon dioxide emissions; hence a lot of renewable energy was used. Thus, hybrid
    renewable energy systems have shown great potential in application, which has
    led to a trend toward distributed power production as a more stable and consistent
    energy source. A strategy for optimizing and improving micro-grid HRES by implementing
    optimization algorithms is by utilizing a non-dominated sortation evolutionary
    algorithm to find a combination that meets ecological and economic goals with
    constrained abilities. This research sought to create a hybrid power system that
    met end-user needs and maximized efficiency. 2 HYBRID ENERGY SYSTEM Decades of
    research in all applications have shown hybrid energy system capacity. Solar-wind
    hybrid energy systems are a technological innovation because they are renewable
    and sustainable for human civilization. Wind and solar energy are free. Hybrid
    energy systems have been used to restructure network infrastructure and identify
    the ecosystem’s many components for solar-powered smart cities. Advanced algorithms
    and methodologies have improved the hybrid system’s efficiency. Thus, Sureshand
    Meenakumari [8] propose an enhanced GA-based novel technique for the design optimization
    of hybrid energy systems, which includes diesel generator, solar PV, wind, and
    battery storage systems for power generation. The suggested system uses sun radiation
    and wind velocity data (available from NASA). Hybrid energy system optimization
    reduces total expense, cost of present values, greenhouse gas emissions, loss
    of power system, energy cost, and annualized rate system cost. This makes technology
    more affordable for family use. Figure 1 illustrates the Hybrid Solar-Wind energy
    system. Figure 1 Open in new tabDownload slide Illustrates the Hybrid Solar-Wind
    energy system ([17]) . Indonesia has both the longest coastline and most islands.
    Its coastline spans 81 000 kilometers and 17 058 islands. Indonesia’s water covers
    5.8 million square kilometers, 75% of its land area. So, Setiawan et al. [18]
    suggest that the dual input buck-boost converter will utilize the PID approach
    to regulate the voltage to 14 V used to charge the battery from the wind turbine
    generator and photovoltaic module. A mechanical catamaran system will feature
    a photovoltaic panel and wind turbine generator. The ship’s model propulsion system
    will employ battery power. This study found that solar and wind turbine generators
    can yield 774 Wh. The simulation shows that the PI controlled system takes 35
    milliseconds to set, while the PID control system takes 11 milliseconds. Abd Ali
    et al. [19] proposed and simulated the hybrid system for wind and solar energy
    conversion. Al Najaf, in southern Iraq, will employ the solar modules and wind
    power facilities to generate green energy. Thus, the average monthly solar radiation
    intake was detected and expected to be 6.5–7 kW h/m2 while the average annual
    wind speeds were 3.8 meters per second. Research found that Iraq’s solar and wind
    power potential could assist in meeting some regions’ electricity needs. Due to
    alternative and renewable energy system unpredictability, it must share renewable
    energy sources. Talaat et al. [20] explored whether it is possible to combine
    a variety of renewable energy sources, taking into account the operational reserve
    established during the implementation phase. The reserve boosts the hybrid renewable
    energy system’s efficiency and dependability. A microcontroller merges all three
    types into one and calculates the operational reserve for each. Buck-Boost converters
    power this controller. Zhu et al. [21] proposes integrating a wind-solar hybrid
    power generating system with a supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system. This
    method could boost energy storage and electricity production. This procedure maximizes
    energy storage and power stability using conductance-fuzzy dual-mode control and
    the static wind correction mechanism. MATLAB studied the optimal hybrid energy
    storage system setup model. Agyekum et al. [22] investigated the technology and
    economic viability of a commercial hybrid power plant in southern Ghana to generate
    electricity. It determines the best photovoltaic and wind-DG-battery hybrid system
    designs. Energy infrastructure feasibility studies evaluate pay-back time, internal
    rate of return, total expenses, and LCOE. The Battery-PV-Wind hybrid system diagram
    is illustrated in Figure 2. Figure 2 Open in new tabDownload slide Battery-PV-Wind
    Hybrid system [23]. Standalone hybrid systems based on a renewable source could
    provide continuous and stable electricity in remote areas not connected to the
    grid. Xu et al. [24] found that these locations are commonly in hard-to-reach
    places. The PV and wind power stoppage rate is calculated on new indices when
    developing the photovoltaic hybrid energy system. In a few MOPSO cycles, a single-goal
    optimization model can be built up. The wind farm, photovoltaic plant, concentrated
    solar power plant, electric heater, inverter, and battery model [25] is being
    researched. Various LCOEs and PSPs determine the best system configuration and
    design concerns. A CSP plant, photovoltaic system, and inverter can achieve a
    10% LPSP and 0.1484 dollars per kilowatt-hour LCOE using power cycle output priority.
    Solar and wind power consumption is rising due to the desire to reduce our environmental
    footprint while also expanding. To reduce power supply stochasticity, Jamshidi
    et al. [26] offers a hybrid system with solar and wind generators. PV, battery,
    wind, diesel hybrid systems include PV arrays, wind turbines, batteries, a standby
    diesel generator, converters, and other equipment. These components generate,
    store, and manage electricity. Conventional fossil fuel–based power generation
    is the main cause of global environmental degradation, which will only worsen
    in the near future. Thus, Naeem et al. [27] offer an algorithm to choose the best
    places for supporting solar and wind energies. Due to recent environmental legislation
    aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and pollution and the world’s rising
    energy demand, renewable energy generation must increase. According to Barelli
    [28], intelligent power management systems and flywheel-battery technologies reduce
    power profile changes at the grid by more than 80%. This study examines the LCOE
    of a 2 MW wind generation plant with flywheel and lithium-ion battery hybrid energy
    storage. Hybrid energy storage uses flywheels and lithium-ion batteries. NMC battery
    technology with a mechanical flywheel, along with the ‘Fast Reserve’ service,
    can reduce LCOE by over 5% compared to the lack of energy collection. 3 ENERGY
    STORAGE FOR HYBRID SYSTEMS The renewable hybrid system prioritizes energy storage.
    Thus, Guo et al. [29] developed a robust dynamic-wavelet-enabled wind power smoothing
    technique by hybrid energy storage system (HESS) of super-capacitors and batteries.
    Robust coefficients can handle the robustness-economic gain tradeoff. Figure 3
    shows how HESS technology integrates a hybrid system to improve energy storage.
    Figure 3 Open in new tabDownload slide Representation of wind power system integrated
    with the HESS [30]. Due to the power requirements of wireless base stations, rural
    telecommunications networks cannot expand without energy. Zhao et al. [31] proposes
    a hybrid energy supply system for rural mobile base stations that uses renewable
    sources like photovoltaics, wind, and adiabatic compressed air. Solar and wind
    energy are widely used. Pressurized gas energy storage smooths intermittent renewable
    sources. Portfolio management and energy storage site management are important
    since Brazil’s energy mix includes more renewable sources. Thus, Antunes et al.
    [32] propose a study that examines the universal nature of photovoltaic and wind
    creation in the Brazilian North. Energy storage can mitigate the impact of unreliable
    natural resources on electricity sources. Figure 4 below shows several photovoltaic
    (PV) technologies, including the two systems evaluated for this study, a single-axis
    tracker and a 12° fixed-tilt system. Figure 4 Open in new tabDownload slide Two
    PV systems (12° fixed tilt and single-axis tracker) are tested here amongst a
    variety of other PV technologies [32] (Adopted with permission from Elsevier BV.
    with License Number: 5718890894994) For load frequency stability, Mudi et al.
    [33] explore isolated hybrid power systems (HPSs) with risk management of energy
    storage devices and renewable energy sources utilizing proper control methodologies.
    The PID controller gains were set using the MVO method. The test systems’ dynamic
    performance was assessed under various operating conditions and situations. Mudi
    et al. [33] also suggest a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) using batteries
    and a hydrogen conversion system (HCS) to solve this problem. Thus, a single energy
    storage cannot generate a fully functional and reliable off-grid renewable energy
    (RE) system without a large generator and store capacity. Gupta et al. [34] studied
    a hybrid pumped and battery storage (HPBS) system to improve off-grid RE system
    sustainability and dependability. A HES with supercapacitors and batteries interfaced
    with most multi-input converters handles power changes from wind, sun, and unexpected
    load disruptions. Thus, Ravada et al. [35] introduced a revolutionary integrated
    converter construction that uses several energy sources and hybrid energy storage
    (HES) for DC microgrids. ESDs enable independent renewable microgrids to power
    their loads at all times [35]. In a HESS, many ESDs contribute their benefits.
    Unlike the FLC algorithm, the AFLC reduces the detrimental impacts of excessive
    or insufficient ESD usage. Javed et al. [36] studied solar energy and hydrogen
    storage devices in electrical networks to improve the hybrid energy storage system.
    Hydrogen fuel cells and batteries are examples. The hydrogen storage technology,
    which stores electricity as hydrogen, reduces this uncertainty. The proposed wind-solar-thermal
    energy storage system includes an electric heater, power block, heater exchanger,
    and thermal energy storage framework [37]. This work uses multi-objective particle
    swarm optimization to discover the optimal capacity, Pareto front, and decision-making
    approach. When transmission channel loss and energy cost are low, the best system
    goals for rebuilding a thermal power plant are to maximize utilization and to
    maximize communication routes. Governments are aggressively seeking eco-friendly
    and cost-effective energy sources to meet demand and provide energy security.
    Al-Ghussain et al. [38] propose hybridizing renewable energy systems (RESs) and
    merging them with energy storage systems to improve RES dependability and reduce
    energy demand-generation mismatches. In this study, adding PHS and HFC to a PV/Wind
    hybrid systems increased the demand–supply ratio from 46.5% to 89.4% and the RES
    fraction from 62.6% to 91.8% at 0.175 USD/kWh. A demo feasibility study is used
    to provide a method for scaling RES components in a microgrid utilizing ESS in
    various configurations. Table 1 illustrates the overview of the Solar-Wind Hybrid
    System and its storage of energy.                           Table 1Overview of

    SYSTEMS Modern families need clean grid electricity, so a numerical approach was
    developed to optimize wind-solar energy systems. The wind-solar hybrid system
    has many economic uses. Water energy, especially from rivers, may assist most
    rural areas. Seasonal changes are difficult. Hot, dry conditions hamper the system’s
    energy and water flow. These energy sources could be used in power plants to generate
    electricity, solving the problem and expanding renewable energy potential. Iran’s
    abundant solar and wind energy can be exploited during electricity shortages.
    Hoseinzadeh et al. [44] used Homer Software to simulate a power plant to find
    the most technically and economically advantageous hybrid to account for river
    flow and solar energy swings. The results show that energy shortage solutions
    need economic study first. Rising energy demand, environmental consciousness,
    and energy market innovation make renewable energy technologies more desirable
    and significant in the global energy balance [45]. Recent advances in hybrid renewable
    energy systems suggest a shift toward distributed power production as a more stable
    and predictable energy source. This paper described microgrid HRES efficiency-boosting
    methods. Thus, Jaszczur et al. [46] propose using an optimization function in
    a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm to find the ideal financial and environmental
    arrangement. This study linked two goals that HRES modeling can reasonably analyze
    costs and emissions. To evaluate system performance and validate energy balance-based
    battery and energy management models, Liu et al. [47] tested a PV and battery
    storage combination to increase self-use and optimal utilization. TRNSYS with
    jEPlus + EA linked modeling and optimization. After considering renewable energy’s
    benefits—lower carbon footprint, transmission loss, network development costs,
    etc.—the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) is calculated. Abdelsalam et al. [48]
    built a numerical model and tested two layouts: one with direct heat exchange
    and one with indirect heat exchange using submerged heat exchangers. The solar
    percentage, which measures solar thermal energy input to the load, gives a different
    perspective on the two systems. The world is currently focused on greener energy
    sources for energy security and sustainable development. But massive urbanization
    has caused energy supply and demand mismatches. Thus, Kumar et al. [49] created
    diesel generator alternatives. This study examines the techno-economic feasibility
    of upgrading hybrid energy systems for urban distributed power production. Techno-economic
    feasibility studies must examine energy technology investments to maximize resource
    efficiency. Despite the intermittent nature of renewable energy resources, hybrid
    renewable energy systems provide the most consistent and reliable load supply
    [50]. The HOMER software mimics the load of a Tehran residential complex supplied
    by several off-grid hybrid RESs. NPC-based best-available power supply systems
    were introduced after significant research and computation. Top models were compared.
    The model without wind turbines has a lower NPC than the one with. Liu et al.
    [25] examined the commercial environmental performance of hybrid photovoltaic-wind-battery-hydrogen
    systems for powering conventional high-rise housing complexes utilizing a strong
    multi-objective design optimization and parametric analysis technique. Figaj et
    al. [51] studied TRNSYS’s dynamically simulated solar heating and cooling system
    for serially coupled thermal collectors and dish concentrators. Experiments verify
    dish concentrator configuration and solar collector. Using various configurations
    of solar energy collecting devices and thermally powered chillers, a smart house
    cooling and solar heating system was constructed and dynamically simulated. Figure
    5 Open in new tabDownload slide Various barriers associated with HRES. These systems
    are used in many places. Rural and distant areas without reliable traditional
    energy benefit greatly from HRES. Modern urban infrastructure, especially green
    buildings, integrates HRES for sustainable energy. Island communities are switching
    from standard fossil fuels to renewable energy sources (HRES) to gain economic
    and environmental advantages. The energy-intensive industrial sector is using
    HRES for reliable power [52]. HRES is utilized by academic organizations for both
    energy and advanced research purposes. Tourism, especially eco-resorts, is using
    HRES to improve sustainability. HRES adoption is part of a global shift toward
    clean, flexible, and reliable energy [43]. Numerous key aspects have shaped HRES
    commercialization. Wind, solar, hydro, and biomass technologies have improved,
    making hybrid systems more effective. The substantial cost reductions in these
    technologies have made HRES more economically appealing. Tax incentives, grants,
    and government subsidies have promoted renewable energy options. The economic
    appeal of HRES has increased due to improved energy security and reliability from
    their combined sources. Renewable energy’s promise spurs private sector investments
    in HRES research and deployment. The costs associated with erecting a solar power
    facility vary and are influenced by various factors [53]. Understanding site circumstances
    and material and service market rates is essential for accurate financial forecasting
    [54]. Expect a higher investment for a larger facility with more energy output.
    Equipment costs are of utmost importance. Solar panels’ efficiency and type—monocrystalline,
    polycrystalline, or thin-film—determine their price. However, wind turbine prices
    depend on design (horizontal or vertical), capacity, and tower height. Inverters,
    batteries, and controllers, which convert and store energy, cost money depending
    on quality and ability. Site-specific factors like geography can affect costs
    [55]. Flat ground is cheaper to prepare than mountainous or wooded areas. Ground-mounted
    systems may require piling, and rooftop systems can affect house prices. Integrating
    with the grid requires infrastructure and safety standards, which incur costs.
    Other project development expenditures include planning, design, environmental
    assessments, and expert advice. Utility-scale solar plants cost $1000 to $3000
    per kW in 2021, while wind installations cost $1200 to $2500. Due to economies
    of scale, hybrid arrangements may save money on inverters and grid integrations.
    5 BARRIERS IN HYBRID RENEWABLE ENERGY SYSTEMS Hybrid Renewable Energy Systems
    (HRES) offer various benefits, but they encounter specific barriers that hinder
    their extensive use. There are various barriers that can be identified, which
    are illustrated in Figure 5. Compared to conventional energy sources, hybrid renewable
    energy systems can be expensive, especially in homes [56]. Investing in sustainable
    energy alternatives may be more appealing to potential users due to the upfront
    cost. Integrating multiple energy sources into a system presents technological
    problems [57]. Hybrid systems must deal with intermittent and balance varied energy
    sources, requiring new control and management systems. Land and space constraints
    can also hinder HRES implementation. Individual renewable technologies like solar
    and wind may require a lot of land, but combining them can worsen geographical
    limits, especially in densely populated areas. HRES systems use components from
    several technologies, each with maintenance demands, causing dependability and
    maintenance concerns. One component’s failure might impair system performance.
    In some locations, the lack of trained personnel in hybrid system design, installation,
    and maintenance can hinder their use. Some countries or regions need more supportive
    policies or incentives for HRES adoption, and bureaucratic hurdles may impede
    permitting and installation. Many HRES use energy storage technologies like batteries
    to maintain energy supply, complicating matters. Current energy storage technologies
    may be expensive, short-lived, and insufficient for more extensive applications
    [58]. HRES integration with power grids may be complex since grids may need help
    handling renewable energy variability or significant changes to support hybrid
    systems. Economic barriers may arise when HRES is not cost-effective, especially
    when cheaper, subsidized, non-renewable energy sources are accessible [49]. Social
    and cultural preferences for traditional energy sources over hybrid systems can
    also prevent technology adoption. The manufacturing and disposal of components
    like solar panels and batteries may have environmental implications, causing stakeholder
    debate and dispute. Advancements in technology and a growing demand for sustainable
    energy sources are diminishing these restrictions [60]. Nevertheless, every location
    and country will encounter obstacles when implementing hybrid renewable energy
    systems. 6 SUMMARY, CONCLUSIONS, AND FUTURE SCOPE Solar and wind power are intermittent
    and inconsistent, which could provide technological issues for weak networks or
    isolated systems without appropriate storage. Solar and wind integration can reduce
    system dependence and operational costs. This study examines the pros and cons
    of hybrid wind-solar energy systems. Voltage and frequency variations and harmonics
    affect both grid-connected and stand-alone installations, but a weak grid exacerbates
    them. Hybrid systems that are well-designed, optimized, and feature cutting-edge
    rapid response control may help. In-depth study on optimal size design, power
    electronics topologies, and control is summarized here. This review paper discusses
    solar-wind hybrid systems’ energy storage and household usage. Solar-wind hybrid
    energy systems reduce monthly electricity costs in the most economical way. They
    provide clean, renewable, non-polluting electricity and avoid the exorbitant expenditures
    of bringing grid power lines to remote areas. This article provides energy analysts
    and specialists with recommendations for installing a solar-wind irrigation system
    for irrigation water. MPPT controllers track wind energy conversion system peak
    power production. Hill-climb search, power signal feedback control, and tip speed
    ratio are wind energy MPPT processor subfields to optimize energy output, monitor
    solar radiation and alter photovoltaic panel orientation. Maximum Power Point
    Tracking is a clever automated system like IoT devices that tracks the module
    without moving it. AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS Manzoore Elahi M. Soudagar (Conceptualization,

    • Wireless sensor network plays an important role in smart irrigation. • Sensor
    nodes are prone to failure and faulty sensors can cause wrong control due to incorrect
    measurements. • Wireless sensor network needs a sensor fault detection system
    to analyze the generated data if it is correct or not. • Kalman filter used to
    detect sensor fault because it is not complex in term of computation and very
    simple in implementation. Abstract Ensuring the reliability of data obtained from

    modelSmart irrigation 1. Introduction Water scarcity is becoming a serious problem
    that''s being highlighted and examined by various researchers. There are three
    major factors affecting fresh water supply: climate change, population growth,
    and agriculture. The latter is considered as the most water-consuming activity
    as it uses about 85% of the total water withdrawn [1]. Most of the already existing
    irrigation practice does not use water efficiently since only 55% of the water
    supplied for irrigation is used by the crop [2]. Thus, the traditional irrigation
    process can lead to supplying the yield with more water than necessary or less
    than its needs. In attempts to fix this problem, smart irrigation is an alternative
    solution for effective irrigation and good water management. Smart irrigation
    integrates advanced technologies to reduce water waste, maximize crop production,
    and facilitate tasks for farmers [3], [4], [5], [6]. Thanks to the Wireless Sensor
    Network (WSN) technology, we can know in real time the requirements of the plant
    in terms of water by measuring some soil parameters like soil temperature and
    moisture [7], [8]. WSN consists of multiple small and low-cost sensor nodes located
    in farmland for monitoring soil parameter and cooperatively forwarding the sensed
    data to the control center through wireless communication for processing and calculating
    the amount of water needed [9], [10]. These small devices are exposed to hostile
    and severe environments over a long period of time and have also a limited power
    supply. Those factors make them susceptible to failure [11]. Typically, a faulty
    sensor node reports data inconsistent with the true behavior of the measured phenomenon
    [12]. Consequently, the erroneous data generated by the WSN may cause wrong actions
    by the control center. Therefore, the accuracy and reliability of measurements
    are necessary. This problem requires a sensor fault detection system to analyze
    and verify the measurements collected from the WSN and verify whether they are
    correct or not before taking action on the irrigation process. The traditional
    method for sensor fault detection in WSN is to multiply sensor nodes in the monitored
    event i.e. multiple sensor nodes measure the same variable at the same time and
    the measurements of these sensor nodes are compared directly; if one measurement
    of a sensor deviates significantly from the others, this sensor will be considered
    as a faulty sensor. This method is very costly and makes the system more complex.
    Consequently, in recent years, these problems are overcoming with the emergence
    of the concept of analytical redundancy that uses the redundant information inherent
    in the sensor''s measurements [13], [14]. In this paper, we exploit analytical
    redundancy instead of hardware redundancy. Several methods have been proposed
    for fault detection in WSN and generally can be categorized into two groups: the
    methods that adopt the centralized architecture for detecting sensor faults in
    WSN and the others that use the distributed architecture [15]. In the first category,
    all the sensor nodes send their readings to the gateway for analytics. In the
    second category, the neighboring sensor nodes exchange their readings for detecting
    the sensor fault. In [16] the authors proposed to model each sensor node by Takagi-Sugeno
    Kang fuzzy inference system by using the real measurements of the neighboring
    nodes as inputs and the actual measurement of the observed sensor as output for
    training the system; the resulting system used to estimate in real time the measurements
    of the concerned sensor and through comparing the real measurement of the sensor
    node and its estimation, they can detect sensor fault. This method succeeds to
    detect sensor fault but it needs a complex computation for monitoring each sensor
    and requires also a huge dataset for training the system. The authors of [17]
    propose a learning model based on Non-Negative Matrix Factorization for sensor
    fault detection in WSN for smart agriculture. The generated model represents the
    normal behavior of the sensor nodes of the network and it is used to extract the
    features from the incoming signals. Each sensor has a classifier that uses the
    extracted features of its readings for determining if the readings of the sensor
    contain a fault or not. This technique requires also a huge dataset for training
    and testing the system. Also, the computation complexity of the system increases
    proportionally with number of the sensors nodes in the network. A classifier Support
    Vector Machines (SVM) is used in [18] to divide data into two classes: normal
    data and faulty data. The learning phase is carried out in a sink node using a
    labeled dataset which is composed of a set of faulty and normal data. Based on
    that, they define a decision function. This latter will be deployed in the cluster-head
    for classifying new data into normal and faulty data. The major issue of the SVM
    classifier is the sensitivity to noise and the requiring a long time for training
    a big dataset. SVM has several crucial key parameters as kernel function. These
    parameters need to be set correctly for giving a good classification and the choice
    of the appropriate parameters is not an easy task. In [19] the authors propose
    a distributed sensor fault detection and diagnosis system, and it is composed
    of two blocks: fault detection block and fault diagnosis block. The first one
    is composed of Stacked Auto-Encoders (SAE) and SVM, these two machine learning
    algorithms are implemented in each sensor node in order to detect its sensor fault.
    SAE extracts the features of the measured signal, and then SVM classifier uses
    these extracted features to classify the sensed data into normal data and faulty
    data. If the fault is detected by a sensor node, the extracted features are forwarded
    to the second block for fault diagnosis which consists of a fuzzy deep neural
    network that combines fuzzy and neural networks in order to classify the type
    of fault. This system is implemented in a central node. Each node processes its
    data by using two machines learning implemented on it, it is not a good idea at
    all for sensor nodes that are known for their limited energy and computation capacity.
    In this study, we present a novel approach for real-time sensor fault detection
    within WSN deployed for optimizing smart irrigation. Our research addresses the
    critical need to ensure the reliability of data obtained from WSN, which play
    a pivotal role in monitoring soil parameters for effective water management in
    agriculture. The key results of our work underscore its significance and effectiveness.
    Through an innovative combination of an autoregressive model and a Kalman filter,
    we achieve successful and accurate sensor fault detection, enhancing the reliability
    of measurements. The proposed approach is tailored to accommodate the resource
    constraints of sensor nodes and circumvent the challenge of lacking ground truth
    information. Notably, our technique boasts simplicity in implementation and minimal
    computational complexity, preserving the application''s efficiency. Also, it does
    not require a huge dataset for training our system. A real-world experiment demonstrates
    the feasibility of our approach in detecting sensor faults, substantiating its
    applicability to practical scenarios. These results not only affirm the potential
    of our methodology for real-time fault detection but also underline its significance
    in advancing smart irrigation practices and contributing to the broader conversation
    on water-efficient agricultural solutions. The limited computation, memory, and
    energy capacity of sensor nodes must be considered when designing sensor fault
    detection systems. To avoid overloading the sensor nodes, we have chosen to use
    a centralized architecture for fault detection instead of a distributed one. In
    a centralized architecture, the data processing is performed by a central node
    rather than on the individual sensor nodes as in the distributed architecture.
    This centralized architecture helps to conserve the battery life of the sensor
    nodes by minimizing their processing workload. The rest of the paper is organized
    as follows: Section 2 presents the materials and methods. Section 3 introduces
    a sensor fault detection scheme based on the Kalman filter with residual generation
    and evaluation. Section 4 describes the experiments and results. Finally, a conclusion
    is presented in section 5. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Sensor readings prediction
    Monitoring soil variables such as soil moisture and soil temperature is essential
    to control both the time and the amount of water needed. Therefore, the accuracy
    of the data issued from the sensor nodes that monitor these two parameters (soil
    moisture and soil temperature) is required. For this purpose, we elaborate an
    algorithm for analyzing data issued from the distributed sensor nodes and detecting
    their faults if they exist. First, we construct a sensor readings prediction algorithm
    that will be presented in this section. In our data collection, we observe that
    the sensed data (soil moisture and soil temperature) are not random and change
    smoothly; the successive readings of the sensors have temporal dependency [20].
    For that, we adopt the Kalman filter algorithm to predict sensor readings in normal
    conditions for each sensor node. The state transition process of the Kalman filter
    is constructed based on the Autoregressive (AR) model. We assume that the sensor
    nodes are free of fault during the construction of the sensor readings prediction
    algorithm. The main idea of the proposed sensor data prediction diagram is illustrated
    in Fig. 1. In the following two subsections, we present the AR model and the Kalman
    filter. Download : Download high-res image (111KB) Download : Download full-size

    and Kalman filter. 2.2. Autoregressive model An AR model is a type of random process
    that can be used to describe natural phenomena. It can be also used to predict
    the future value of the interested variable by using a linear combination of the
    previous values of the variable [21]. AR model of order n can be represented as
    AR (n), and it is defined as follows: (1) Where C is a constant, for are the coefficients
    of the AR model, and is white noise. 2.3. Kalman filter The Kalman filter is a
    powerful recursive filter that enables to estimate with accuracy, the current
    state of a linear dynamic system from a series of the observed measurements, even
    these measurements could be noisy or inaccuracies. It can serve also as a predictor
    of the future value of the state [22], [23], [24]. It has been widely applied
    in engineering applications such as control systems, tracking targets, and much
    more. The Kalman filter is known for its simple form and does not require complex
    computation. The Kalman filter tries to predict the state of the discrete-time
    process that is represented by the following linear stochastic difference equation:
    (2) Where is the predicted state at time instant k, A is the state transition
    matrix that relays to , and is the process noise that is assumed to be Gaussian
    with zero mean and covariance Q. The state transition process model is paired
    with a measurement equation that enables to observe the state and can be described
    as follows: (3) Where is the measurement vector at time k, H is the measurement
    matrix, and is the measurement noise vector that is assumed to be Gaussian with
    zero mean and covariance R. The Kalman filter consists of two steps: the prediction
    and the update. In the prediction step, the state estimate of the current time
    step is predicted based on the updated state estimate of the previous time step,
    and the predicted error covariance is also computed in this prediction step as
    they are defined in equations (4) and (5) respectively. In the update step, the
    Kalman gain is computed first. Then, the updated state estimate is calculated
    by using the current measurement to correct the predicted state estimate and give
    a more accurate state estimate for the current time step. After that, the Kalman
    filter calculates the updated error covariance. In the following equations, the
    hat operator “̂” denotes an estimate of the state. Where, the superscripts “-”
    and “+” indicate predicted and updated state estimate, respectively. Prediction:
    Predicted state estimate: (4) Predicted error covariance: (5) Update: Kalman gain:
    (6) Updated state estimate: (7) Updated error covariance: (8) 3. Sensor fault
    detection In this section, the fault detection scheme is presented based on the
    Kalman filter. For each sensor node, the Kalman filter predicts its virtual sensor
    output as shown in Fig. 2. Where, in the normal case, the measurements of the
    sensor node follow the predicted data. Whereas, when the sensor fails, it starts
    to deviate from the predicted data. Download : Download high-res image (63KB)

    detection. 3.1. Residual generation and evaluation A residual signal is a fault
    indicator generated based on the difference between the sensor measurement and
    its prediction, as defined in (9). We can detect a sensor fault by evaluating
    this generated residual using the appropriate threshold [25]. (9) Where r, y,
    and are the residual vector, sensor measurement and its predicted output, respectively.
    Theoretically, the residual is around zero when a sensor node is a free fault.
    Whereas, when the fault occurs, the residual deviates from zero. However, the
    residual is not equal to zero, even in non-faulty mode due to the measurement
    noise or disturbance. Therefore, an appropriate threshold should be selected to
    detect the sensor faults. It is crucial to set up the proper threshold that realizes
    the trade-off between a false alarm and a missed fault that gives accurate fault
    detection. There are different methods for setting up the threshold. In this paper,
    we have opted to utilize the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) control
    chart method for determining the statistical properties of the residual when the
    sensor is functioning without faults, in order to establish the threshold. The
    EWMA control chart is a statistical process control technique known for its effectiveness
    in detecting minor shifts or trends in data over time. It offers the advantage
    of being easier to set up due to its reliance on a smaller set of parameters [26].
    The threshold is calculated by the following equation [27]: (10) Where μ and σ
    are the mean and standard deviation of the residual respectively given in equations
    (11) and (12). ρ is the tolerance parameter that affects the false alarm probability.
    It is found that works well in practice [28]. (11) (12) Where is the residual
    that is generated under no sensor fault at time i. 4. Experiments This section
    describes the real implementation of the proposed fault detection. As shown in
    Fig. 3, an IoT- enabled WSN of two sensor nodes is deployed in the soil of our
    laboratory prototype. In this experiment, we use a soil moisture sensor (ECH 20
    EC-5) and a soil temperature sensor (DS18B20). Each sensor is connected to an
    Arduino microcontroller board and RAK811 WisNode LoRa Module. These sensor nodes
    send their measurements via RAK811 WisNode LoRa Module to the main gateway. The
    latter in turn stores this data in The Things Network (TTN) server from where
    the data can be presented to the end user via an application layer. The real-time
    sensor fault detection is implemented in the user application using Node-Red.

    Fig. 3. Illustrative scheme of our laboratory experiment. In order to detect sensors
    faults, we store the data sent by the two sensors nodes in their non-faulty mode
    with sampling time equals ts=1 min forming a total of 200 data points for calculating
    the parameters of the AR (n) model (we choose order 1 for AR (1) model in our
    experiment) then, we train our algorithm for prediction based on these stored
    data as shown in Fig. 4. After that, we calculate the statistical characteristics
    of the two residuals that generated based on the difference between the measurements
    of the sensors and their prediction in their non-faulty mode as explained in section
    3. Thanks to these characteristics we can calculate the fault detection threshold
    value for each sensor according to equation (10). After setting the parameters
    of the algorithm that are given in Table 1, we run it in real time. At t=500 min,
    we inject, an abrupt fault in the soil temperature sensor. After fault injection
    we observe that the real measurements of the soil temperature sensor deviate from
    the predicted data as illustrated in Fig. 5a. This deviation leads to a residual
    that exceeds the pre-defined threshold in the same instance of the injection as
    can be seen in Fig. 5b. Download : Download high-res image (241KB) Download :

    5. Conclusion In this work, we have presented a sensor fault detection algorithm
    based on the Kalman filter for detecting sensor faults in WSN used for smart irrigation.
    Our method utilizes analytical redundancy instead of hardware redundancy, which
    is costly. It offers the advantages of being easy and fast to implement while
    not requiring a large dataset for training. In our laboratory experiment, we implemented
    soil temperature and soil moisture sensors in the soil to measure and send their
    data wirelessly via the internet to the control center for analysis. Initially,
    we recorded data from the two sensor nodes operating in a non-faulty mode to calculate
    the parameters needed for the sensor readings prediction algorithm for each sensor.
    Subsequently, we executed our algorithm and injected an abrupt fault into each
    sensor node. The experimental results obtained in this study have demonstrated
    the effectiveness of our algorithm in detecting sensor faults in WSN used for
    smart irrigation. CRediT authorship contribution statement Nassima Jihani: Conceptualization,

    06 December 2021 1 Introduction Agriculture is central to achieving water, energy,
    and food security [1], with irrigation playing a vital role in increasing productivity.
    In Brazil, a leading exporter of agricultural commodities, irrigation employs
    15 million people and has been essential to food and nutrition security [2]. This
    activity has historically been employed to increase food production, and recent
    studies have suggested that it provides multiple pathways to improved nutrition
    in areas suffering from severe food insecurity [3]. Typical national diet foods,
    such as rice, beans, vegetables, fruits, and vegetables, are produced through
    irrigation [4], a critical context with two billion people globally facing food
    insecurity [5]. Irrigated agriculture in Brazil has demonstrated steady growth
    over recent decades, even during unstable economic periods. From 2012 to 2019,
    this growth was further fueled by increased credit and private investments, leading
    to an annual expansion rate of approximately 4%, with an increase of around 216
    thousand hectares in irrigated areas each year. By 2019, the total value of irrigated
    production exceeded the BRL 55 billion mark [4]. Irrigation stands as the most
    electricity-intensive activity within agriculture, giving rise to environmental
    concerns such as resource depletion, global warming, and risks to human health
    [6]. In 2019, the agriculture sector accounted for 5.7% of Brazil’s electricity
    consumption, totaling 35.6991 TWh [7]. By 2020, the average consumption among
    irrigating rural consumers reached 2.50 MWh per consumer unit, in contrast to
    non-irrigating farmers at 0.34 MWh—a value seven times lower [8]. These figures
    underscore the significant impact of irrigation on the national energy scenario.
    Mitigating environmental damage poses a significant challenge to energy use within
    the agricultural sector. The development and integration of renewable energy sources,
    such as biomass, wind, and solar, are essential for creating sustainable solutions
    to this problem. This shift toward renewable energy not only promises a more diversified
    energy matrix for Brazil but also potentially reduces farmers’ dependence on potentially
    unreliable grid electricity. In turn, these changes can lead to a substantial
    reduction in the use of nonrenewable sources, contributing to the decarbonization
    of the electrical matrix. The use of solar energy to pump water for both irrigation
    and human consumption is not a novel concept. In this application, photovoltaic
    panels convert solar irradiation into energy, translating irradiance into available
    power, which is dependent on the efficiency of the photovoltaic panel. The principles
    of this conversion process, along with analyses of the economic viability of solar
    energy, have been thoroughly explored in extensive scholarly reviews [9, 10].
    In evaluating the economic and life cycle of solar panels, it is crucial to consider
    factors such as material degradation, efficiency reduction, and module replacement
    needs, not just financial depreciation [11]. Despite Brazil’s notable potential
    in solar energy—it was the leading source of electricity generation for micro
    and mini-generation in 2019 [7]—there are surprisingly few studies conducted within
    the country focusing on its innovative application in irrigation. Furthermore,
    Australian studies on off-grid irrigated sugarcane crops have identified opportunities
    for installing small-scale solar PV systems, resulting in cost savings in pumped
    irrigation and notable emission reductions [12]. Another study in Australia investigated
    the integration of renewable energy into off-grid irrigation systems by comparing
    replacing diesel generators with photovoltaics or combining the two technologies
    in a hybrid system [13]. The results showed that integrating solar PV systems
    in off-grid scenarios reduced emissions and costs and decreased exposure to future
    diesel fuel price fluctuations. In addition, Rehman and Sahin [14] in Saudi Arabia
    compared the costs of water pumping using diesel and solar power systems. They
    found that the water pumping costs were competitive when using a PV-only system.
    The cost of water pumping in a diesel-only system varies considerably based on
    the price of the diesel fuel. Yu et al. [15] conducted a case study on developing
    solar-irrigated cassava farming, showing that Guangxi (China) area is suitable
    for solar pump irrigation, promoting local development. According to the 10-year
    Brazilian Energy Plan [16], PV power generation has seen substantial growth within
    the Brazilian electricity matrix, reaching approximately 5.475 GW, and is projected
    to continue evolving through 2030, as shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 Yearly photovoltaic
    electricity generation forecast Full size image Some factors contribute to the
    growing popularity of solar energy. Investing in this energy source can increase
    property value; moreover, solar energy is considered inexhaustible, and the maintenance
    required after installation is minimal. 2 Background and objectives This section
    outlines the pertinent background of the Brazilian electricity market and the
    objectives of this research. State regulation in the electricity sector plays
    a vital role in economic development and lays the groundwork for sustainability
    in today’s world. Key legal milestones of this study include discounts on electric
    energy tariffs, modifications in the use of credits within a net-metering system,
    and certain tax exemptions. Table 1 provides a summary of the legal framework
    discussed. Table 1 Legal framework for discounts on electricity tariffs Full size
    table In 2012, Normative Resolution 482 classified consumers with distributed
    micro-generation and an installed power of up to 100 kW. These consumers were
    permitted to generate their energy using renewable sources [17] and could connect
    to the power network, with benefits credited in a net-metering system for use
    within 36 months [18]. In 2015, Normative Resolution 687 reduced the installed
    power requirement to 75 kW and extended the credit consumption period from 36
    to 60 months [19]. Electricity in Brazil is subject to three taxes: two federal
    (PIS and COFINS) and one state (ICMS). In 2015, two legal milestones enabled discounts
    on these taxes for consumers with distributed micro and mini-generation. Law 13,169
    [20] provided a total rebate of PIS and COFINS, while ICMS Agreement 16 [21] allowed
    a partial refund, about 60%, on ICMS [22]. Law 10,438 of 2002 first established
    electricity tariff discounts for rural consumers [23]. In 2013, Decree 7891 created
    a 30% discount for the rural class, which could be combined with additional discounts
    for irrigation or aquaculture at specific times [24]. Decree 9642 in 2018 reduced
    these discounts, phasing them out by 2023 [25]. Additionally, Law 13,169 in 2015
    exempted generating units of distributed micro-generation from certain taxes [23].
    Therefore, establishments with distributed micro-generation, having an installed
    power of up to 75 MW, can utilize generated credits within 60 months and benefit
    from certain tax exemptions. In 2022, Law 14,300 introduced new legislation regarding
    distributed generation. However, since the base year for this study was 2021,
    these changes have not yet been applied. After the preceding background information,
    this paper seeks to further investigate the topics by contributing the following
    analyses: Compare the financial performance of an on-grid photovoltaic system
    with a system connected to the Brazilian national grid Analyze the impacts of
    Brazilian Decree 9642 from 2018 on energy prices and the viability of on-grid
    photovoltaic systems 3 Study areas Brazil encompasses an area of 8, 5 million
    km2 and had an estimated population of 213 million in 2021 [26]. The country is
    divided into five geographic regions, as depicted in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 Map showing
    the division of Brazilian regions Full size image Table 2 illustrates the total
    electricity consumption per region along with the consumption specific to rural
    and irrigating rural consumers. The Southeast region leads in electricity consumption,
    while the North region has the lowest. Notably, the Northeast region displays
    the highest percentage of rural and irrigating rural consumption concerning total
    consumption, underscoring the sector’s significance in that region. Table 2 Electricity
    consumption per region (GWh) Full size table In 2019, Brazil had an irrigated
    area of 8.2 million hectares (Mha), including both irrigation and fertigation,
    with an effective potential for expansion of 13.7 Mha [27]. Figure 3 illustrates
    the relative irrigated area for each region. The Southeast region accounted for
    most of the irrigated area in 2019. However, the Midwest region holds 46% of the
    potential for expansion, indicating a significant opportunity for increased irrigation
    in that area. Fig. 3 Relative irrigated area per region by [27] Full size image
    This trend in electricity tariffs, coupled with the fact that rural areas may
    not always have reliable access to electricity, underscores the importance of
    studying the use of renewable energy for these consumers. Diversifying the Brazilian
    electrical grid can enhance service reliability by increasing operational safety
    [28]. Pioneering studies that analyze service possibilities are essential to achieving
    this diversification for rural consumers (Fig. 4). Fig. 4 Electricity tariff by
    region—years 2012 and 2021 Full size image Different taxes are applied across
    Brazil’s regions. Table 3 outlines relevant taxes, including ‘imprur,’ the average
    rural tariff ratio with and without tax from 2012 to 2021, and ‘impirr,’ the corresponding
    ratio for irrigating taxation, both cited from reference [29], with ‘rICMS’ being
    the value of the ICMS rate [30]. The Midwest region holds the highest tax rate,
    and the Southeast region has the largest maximum ICMS value. Table 3 A summary
    of the taxes per region Full size table 4 Electricity tariff To analyze the evolution
    of electricity tariffs in Brazilian regions, we examined two models: linear and
    exponential, commonly used in the literature to study energy price evolution [31,
    32]. Energy tariff price data from 2012 to 2021 was obtained from the ANEEL Captive
    Market Report, aiding in the evaluation of the proposed models [30]. Equations
    (1 and 2) were applied, and the determination coefficient (r2) was calculated.
    The model with the highest r2 was used for subsequent calculations. $$ c\\left(
    y \\right) = c\\left( {y_{0} } \\right) + a \\times y\\quad {\\text{wherein}}\\quad
    a = \\frac{{c\\left( {y_{{\\text{L}}} } \\right) - c\\left( {y_{0} } \\right)}}{{y_{{\\text{L}}}
    - y_{0} }} $$ (1) $$ c\\left( y \\right) = c\\left( {y_{0} } \\right) + a^{y}
    \\quad {\\text{wherein}}\\quad a = \\left( {\\frac{{c\\left( {y_{L} } \\right)}}{{c\\left(
    {y_{0} } \\right)}}} \\right)^{{y_{L} - y_{0} }} $$ (2) wherein: c(y) is the electricity
    cost (BRL/kWh) in the year y, y0 is the first year of 2012, and yL is the last
    year of 2021. Table 4 presents the results of modeling residential tariffs without
    considering taxes, showing the r2 value for both linear and exponential models
    and the equation for the chosen model. The exponential model was the best fit
    for all regions, with the Southeast and Northeast regions having the highest and
    lowest escalation values, respectively. Table 4 Model results summarizing per
    region—residential tariff Full size table The residential tariff serves as a basis
    for calculating other tariffs over time. Table 5 details the two electricity tariff
    options and their corresponding equations. Table 5 Electricity rural tariff options
    Full size table Wherein: disrur is the rural tariff discount, and disirr is the
    irrigating tariff discount. For rural discounts, the authors considered two study
    cases: 1. Case 1: before Decree 9642, a 30% discount accumulation on the irrigation
    tariff was considered 2. Case 2: after Decree 9642, discount accumulation was
    considered only up to 2023 It is crucial to note that the cases studied, as referred
    to immediately above, are marked with a subscript corresponding to their number.
    Additionally, the authors considered a 73% discount on the nightly irrigator’s
    tariff for the Northeast region, 67% for the Midwest and North regions, and 60%
    for the others [33]. 5 Life cycle cost Financial analysis of systems can employ
    several metrics, including the life cycle cost (LCC). LCC considers all costs
    over the project’s lifetime, adjusted to present value. This makes it particularly
    useful in comparing systems with identical functionality but varying initial and
    operating costs [34]. For grid-connected systems, the LCC is based solely on electricity
    consumption. In contrast, the LCC for photovoltaic systems encompasses not only
    the cost related to minimum monthly electricity usage but also includes expenses
    for acquiring and maintaining photovoltaic generation equipment. The LCC calculation
    assumes a 25-year life cycle, with the project commencing in 2021. In this context,
    ‘systems’ refers to: Network (NW): a system without a photovoltaic panel, considering
    the irrigation tariff Photovoltaic (PV): an on-grid PV system, not considering
    the irrigation tariff Note that these systems are identified with a subscript
    corresponding to their name. For the PV system, the authors used a commercial
    photovoltaic kit, including a microinverter. Figure 5 depicts a schematic diagram
    of the elements involved in both the NW and PV approaches, with the photovoltaic
    equipment being the distinguishing factor. Fig. 5 Schematic of the network and
    photovoltaic systems Full size image The LCC for the network system is calculated
    using Eq. (3), adapted from [31]. This method can only be applied assuming that
    the annual electricity request (E) remains constant over the analyzed period.
    $${\\mathrm{LCC}}_{\\mathrm{NW}}=E\\times \\sum\\limits _{y=0}^{y=n-1}\\frac{{\\mathrm{imp}}_{\\mathrm{irr}}\\times
    {c}_{\\mathrm{irr}}\\left(y\\right)}{{\\left(1+i\\right)}^{y}}$$ (3) wherein:
    n is the period considered, and i is the annual discount rate of about 5% [31].
    To enhance the visualization and analysis of the data, the LCC was divided by
    the total energy required throughout the project’s lifetime, represented by the
    product of variables n and E. As a result, this value becomes independent of the
    annual electricity needed for the network system. This modified value is referred
    to as rLCC, as it represents the LCC relative to the total energy demand. Table
    6 displays the results for rLCCNW. Notably, the value for Case 2 is about 42%
    higher than the tariff value in Case 1. Table 6 Life cycle cost per kWh for the
    entire life of the network system (rLCC) Full size table The LCC for the PV system
    (LCCPV) comprises the sum of initial capital costs (ICC), operation and maintenance
    costs (O and M), electricity costs related to the minimum consumption (CEmin),
    and the tax cost on the compensated energy (CEimp), as shown in Eq. (4). $${\\mathrm{LCC}}_{\\mathrm{PV}}=\\mathrm{ICC}+O\\wedge
    M+{\\mathrm{CE}}_{\\mathrm{min}}+{\\mathrm{CE}}_{\\mathrm{imp}}$$ (4) Brazilian
    electricity distribution regulations mandate a minimum cost in tariffs related
    to availability. For two-phase consumers, this cost corresponds to 50 kWh/month
    [33], a value considered in this work. The ICC and O and M are calculated using
    Eqs. (5 and 6) [31], respectively. $$\\mathrm{ICC}=\\left(1+0.3\\right)\\times
    \\mathrm{Caq}\\times P$$ (5) $$O\\wedge M=0.02\\times \\mathrm{ICC}\\times \\frac{{\\left(1+i\\right)}^{n}-1}{i\\times
    {\\left(1+i\\right)}^{n}}$$ (6) wherein: 0.3 represents the relative cost for
    the project and implementation, equivalent to 30% of the acquisition cost [35];
    Caq is the acquisition cost of the PV kit per kWp (BRL/kWp); P is the peak power
    of the PV panels (kWp); 0.02 is the relative cost for operation and maintenance
    of a photovoltaic system, which is 2% of the investment cost per year [36]. The
    authors conducted a market survey to obtain the acquisition cost, resulting in
    a Caq of 4378.97 BRL/kWp. The P value was calculated according to Eq. (7). $$P=\\frac{E-600}{\\mathrm{Efv}}$$
    (7) The 600 represents the yearly minimum consumption measured in kWh/year, while
    Efv denotes the annual photovoltaic energy produced per kWp. Table 7 displays
    the minimum and maximum values for Efv for each region, sourced from [37]. Table
    7 Annual photovoltaic energy generated (Efv) per kWp: minimum and maximum values
    by Brazilian region Full size table Equation (8) illustrates the method for calculating
    CEmin. This approach mirrors the methodology used for LCCnw, with the value E
    replaced by the annual minimum consumption of 600 kWh/year and utilizing the electricity
    cost crur. $${\\mathrm{CE}}_{\\mathrm{min}}=600\\times \\sum\\limits _{y=0}^{y=n-1}\\frac{{\\mathrm{imp}}_{\\mathrm{rur}}\\times
    {c}_{\\mathrm{rur}}\\left(y\\right)}{{\\left(1+i\\right)}^{y}}$$ (8) Finally,
    Eq. (9) presents the method for calculating CEimp, adapted from [22]. This represents
    the portion of the electricity cost not subject to tax exemptions. $${\\mathrm{CE}}_{\\mathrm{imp}}=0.4\\times
    \\left(E-600\\right)\\times \\frac{{a}_{\\mathrm{ICMS}}}{1-{a}_{\\mathrm{ICMS}}}\\times
    \\sum\\limits _{y=0}^{y=n-1}\\frac{{c}_{\\mathrm{rur}}\\left(y\\right)}{{\\left(1+i\\right)}^{y}}$$
    (9) The annual minimum consumption is set at 600 kWh, and 0.4 represents the portion
    of the tariff subjected to taxes, as indicated by [22]. For the PV system, two
    scenarios were delineated for each region: The worst-case: using the lowest Efv
    value and the highest aICMS The best case: employing the highest Efv value and
    assuming no ICMS Furthermore, a spectrum of yearly energy requirements was established:
    The minimum power, based on market research, was pegged at 0.1 kW. Incorporating
    the smallest Efv value into the peak power calculation yielded the lowest annual
    electricity demand for the PV system at 696,828 kWh/year For this study, the upper
    limit for power consumption per unit is 75 kW. Assuming a pump runs continuously
    throughout the year (24 h/ 365 days), the maximum energy requirement is calculated
    at 657 MWh/year As for LCCNW, LCCPV was divided by the total electricity consumption
    for clearer representation, termed as rLCCPV. The results are illustrated in Fig.
    6. Fig. 6 Life cycle cost per kWh for the photovoltaic system over its entire
    lifespan Full size image When analyzing the results for the average annual energy
    requirement (328,848.414 kWh/year), the disparity between the worst and best-case
    scenarios ranges from 47% (for Case 1 in the Midwest region) to 180% (for Case
    2 in the Southeast region). The variance between Cases 1 and 2, under the same
    scenarios, spans from 0.26% (best-case in the South region) to 12% (worst-case
    in the Southeast region). These findings underscore two primary conclusions: (1)
    the final LCC of the photovoltaic system—and consequently, its attractiveness—is
    significantly influenced by the scenarios analyzed; and (2) the on-grid PV system
    offers increased resilience to legislative shifts in electricity tariff pricing.
    Figure 7 summarizes the LCC results for both NW and PV systems. Fig. 7 Life cycle
    cost per kWh generated over the entire life cycle for network and photovoltaic
    systems Full size image In the Midwest region, the PV system consistently outperforms
    the grid-connected system, especially when compared to Case 2 of the NW system.
    The PV system is always viable based on annual electricity demand. In contrast,
    the viability in other regions varies depending on the scenario. When the LCC
    of the photovoltaic (PV) system was lower than that of the non-PV system, it was
    deemed financially superior. Table 8 lists the least energy needed for this favorable
    outcome. Under Case 1, the PV system is not viable in the worst-case scenario,
    except for the Northeast in the best case. In Case 2, the Midwest is viable even
    in its worst scenario, while all regions are viable in the best-case scenario.
    These findings suggest that PV systems may offer irrigation producers a solution
    to offset the financial ramifications of legislative changes. Table 8 Minimum
    energy (kWh) for optimal photovoltaic system viability Full size table 6 Conclusion
    The discontinuation of the rural tariff discount has significantly increased energy
    costs for nighttime irrigators, with the estimated life cycle cost of electricity
    rising by about 42%. This presents a notable challenge for farmers who irrigate
    at night. However, on-grid photovoltaic (PV) systems emerge as a resilient solution
    to offset these tariff-driven cost increments from legislative changes. Notably,
    their cost varied only between 0.26 and 12%, demonstrating the stability of a
    PV system against tariff legislation changes. After Decree 9442, the PV system
    outperformed the grid system across all Brazilian regions. Its performance depended
    on energy requirements, PV generation levels, and the ICMS rate. Thus, PV systems
    present a viable strategy for nighttime irrigators to combat tariff-induced cost
    spikes in agriculture. For grid-connected systems in Brazil, photovoltaic (PV)
    systems are economically viable across all regions. Yet, their feasibility hinges
    on irradiation levels and the goods and services tax rate. Notably, the economic
    appeal of PV systems grows with increased electricity demand. This study highlights
    PV systems as a beneficial alternative for nighttime irrigators against fluctuating
    energy tariffs. By promoting policies focused on financing, cooperatives, and
    education, stakeholders can foster a sustainable and cost-effective agricultural
    energy framework, paving the way for a greener and more robust sector future.

  description: In the midst of rising global population and environmental challenges,
    smart agriculture emerges as a vital solution by integrating advanced technologies
    to optimize agricultural practices. Through data-driven insights and automation,
    it tackles the necessity for sustainable resource management, enhancing productivity
    and resilience in the face of complex food security and ecological concerns. The
    prospects of utilizing the Internet of Things (IoT) for smart agriculture are
    tremendous, where many IoT devices can be deployed for local environment monitoring,
    precision farming, autonomous irrigation, and, soil management. In some use cases
    like smart monitoring and agrochemical applications, UAV-enabled mobile-edge computing
    (MEC) is proposed as an enabler to provide IoT nodes with additional resources
    by hosting their computation functions. From the implementation perspective, to
    flexibly manage the computation functions in UAVs and/or MEC server, the emerging
    network function virtualization (NFV) can be utilized. However, efficient orchestration
    of the virtualized functions would be a challenge. In this paper, we consider
    a decentralized UAV-aided MEC system for smart agricultural applications in which
    the processing nodes benefit from the NFV technology. We aim to propose a method
    for efficiently orchestrating the NFVs while some important metrics are minimized,
    i.e., the age of information (AoI) and total network energy consumption. Especially,
    we consider the case in which the network state is not fully observable to the
    orchestrator or the observations are exposed to uncertainties. Consequently, the
    problem is formulated as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision
    process (DEC-POMDP). As the formulated problem is NP-complete, we exploit some
    structural features of the proposed scheme to introduce the concept of symmetry
    and simplify the problem. Then, a novel decentralized federated learning-based
    solution is proposed to solve the problem. Simulation results show the effectiveness
    of the proposed approach in minimizing the total network energy consumption and
    achieving AoI values less than 200:msec to support demanding real-time applications.

    IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction Smart farming in the contemporary
    world has gained paramount importance while playing a pivotal role in revolutionizing
    agricultural practices [1]. Conversely, the increasing global population along
    with environmental challenges have made the adoption of smart farming techniques
    indispensable. By leveraging data-driven insights, automation, and precision agriculture,
    smart farming not only enhances productivity but also addresses the pressing need
    for sustainable resource management [2]. On the other hand, the Internet of Things
    (IoT) has been a promising technology to provide connection among a large volume
    of devices that are deployed to provide a specific service for smart agriculture.
    A wide range of different use cases such as smart greenhouse monitoring, pest
    control, and irrigation/soil management can be considered [1], [3]. These use
    cases are mostly computation intensive and delay-sensitive [1], [4], [5]. A large
    volume of connected devices implies a large volume of data that must be processed
    accurately in a timely manner [6]. Such data computation and analysis demands
    a significant amount of processing and storage resources which put a constraint
    on energy-limited IoT devices. Depending on the specific application, the aggregated
    data from monitoring sensors, and captured images/videos from installed cameras
    in the field need to be processed in real-time to turn raw data into usable information.
    Introducing IoT and its applications in modern agriculture provides this industry
    with suitable tools to support farmers for better productivity, quality, and profitability
    [1]. Therefore, the scope of IoT extends beyond just agricultural land, encompassing
    a broader spectrum that includes the supply chain as well [7], [8]. Battery-operated
    IoT devices lack the capability to perform energy-intensive computations independently.
    Additionally, they face challenges related to limited processing power and storage
    capacity [9]. Therefore, MEC is proposed as a promising technology to address
    these limitations by offering additional computation and storage resources for
    IoT systems. This is achieved by providing servers where IoT devices can offload
    their computation tasks [10], [11]. On the other hand, large-scale agricultural
    operations often involve the distribution of IoT devices across expansive areas.
    In such scenarios, challenges may emerge concerning communication, particularly
    with issues related to the limited reachability between IoT devices and MEC infrastructure.
    To address these challenges, a proposed solution involves the integration of a
    network comprising unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to enhance the capabilities
    of MEC [12], [13]. This approach aims to mitigate communication limitations stemming
    from the constrained transmission power of IoT devices and simultaneously improve
    network coverage. Due to the easy-to-deploy, cost-effective, and strong capabilities
    of the UAVs, UAV-aided MEC has attracted much attention and is widely utilized
    in smart agriculture to provide a high-quality line-of-sight (LoS) link to IoT
    devices [1], [3], [5], [14], [15], [16], [17]. The versatility and mobility exhibited
    by UAVs in response to changing weather conditions, alongside their straightforward
    deployment and economically viable maintenance costs, collectively establish UAVs
    as a proficient solution for supplying IoT devices with the necessary resources.
    Nevertheless, the UAVs themselves are quite often battery-powered which means
    their available energy is limited [6]. 1) Age of Information Besides energy, the
    freshness of information is another important aspect that needs to be considered
    in environmental monitoring and smart agriculture applications in which rapid
    protective and/or recovery actions are needed. Being more specific, within the
    realm of environmental monitoring applications and precision farming [18] in a
    UAV-aided MEC network, the IoT devices are strategically dispersed throughout
    specified regions to seamlessly gather real-time environmental data. Then the
    collected and pre-processed data by the UAVs finds its transmission route toward
    a localized MEC server; where a comprehensive analysis is conducted to facilitate
    the extraction of pertinent insights. These insights, in turn, play a pivotal
    role in fostering prompt agricultural decision-making and actions. The objectives
    can be the refinement of operations, the performance optimization, or the reduction
    of expenditure [1], [14], [19]. This expansion of smart agriculture’s scope ensures
    a secure and sustainable food supply chain, underpinned by contextual and situational
    awareness derived from real-time event processing [20]. Accordingly, such applications
    are characterized by their intensive computational demands and time-sensitive
    nature [1], [3], [5], [14], [18]. Concisely, the freshness of information becomes
    a critical factor that demands careful consideration. Packet delay and inter-delivery
    times, as two exemplary metrics that are commonly used to quantify the performance
    of real-time applications, are not adequate to represent the freshness of information
    received at the destination. Recently, age of information (AoI) has been proposed
    as a novel criterion to quantitatively evaluate the freshness of information [6],
    [17], [21]. For a flow of data packets, and with emphasis on the freshness of
    data at the destination, AoI is defined as the time elapsed from receiving the
    most recent packet belonging to that data-packet flow [22], [23]. 2) Network Function
    Virtualization (NFV) From the above discussion, in the context of UAV-enabled
    smart agriculture paradigm – which constitutes the focal point of this paper –
    UAVs are confronted with a substantial amount of data necessitating prompt processing.
    This scenario embodies a dynamic computational framework wherein a bunch of processing
    functions demands seamless implementation across both the UAVs and the local server
    [20], [24], [25]. NFV is a key technology for implementing and managing computing
    machines in a reliable, efficient, and robust manner [26]. The NFV virtualizes
    the network functions (NFs) and abstracts them from the physical hardware, which
    enables rapid service function chaining (SFC) and service provisioning in UAV-aided
    MEC applications [27]. Considering the data-intensive and computation-based application
    of smart agriculture, multiple computing functions in the form of virtual network
    functions (VNF) should be deployed sequentially and orderly to provide the processed
    data for the final decision-making at the local MEC-server. Utilizing NFV significantly
    enhances the agility in deploying and managing network components and improves
    the robustness and scalability of networks [27], [28]. Therefore, a critical challenge
    to address is the optimal and efficient placement of Virtual Network Functions
    (VNFs) and determining how to route information packets among VNF components over
    the available NFV infrastructure, i.e., UAVs and the MEC server. The decision
    to distribute and allocate VNFs between both UAVs and the server, rather than
    solely on one of them, aligns with the primary goal of the proposed scheme—to
    minimize the Age of Information (AoI) while maintaining energy efficiency. Network
    traffic and the workload on both UAVs and MEC servers fluctuate over time, while
    changing channel conditions between the parties necessitate adjustments in the
    required communication resources for packet forwarding. Furthermore, certain processing
    functions, such as compression, may alter the packet size, so the trade-off of
    performing these functions locally and sending the smaller packets with spending
    fewer communication resources versus doing the entire processing locally becomes
    pivotal. Consequently, the placement must dynamically adjust to new conditions
    to ensure the minimization of AoI and energy efficiency [28]. In light of this,
    a general condition has been considered where the VNFO can, depending on network
    conditions (processing node resources, service type, and channel conditions),
    decide on the optimal placement to minimize AoI and energy consumption. The work
    presented in [24] is a use-case of the practical implementation of smart agriculture
    in real-world contexts; where, the authors leverage a confluence of cloud computing,
    edge computing, and NFV technology to conceive a comprehensive framework tailored
    to the essential demands of soilless precision farming practiced within a fully-recirculating
    greenhouse [24]. 3) Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) The VNF placement and
    scheduling in our network settings can be expressed as integer programming with
    some constraints that reflect the service requirements and the network infrastructure’s
    restrictions. Nevertheless, this problem is NP-complete and there is no standard
    solver that can solve such problems in polynomial time [29], especially for large-scale
    networks where the required computation to find the optimal solution increases
    exponentially. Recently, machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligent
    (AI) based solutions appear as a viable way to solve such complex problems in
    polynomial time [17], [29], [30]. Since its inception in 2017 [31], Federated
    Learning (FL) has reshaped many emerging intelligent IoT systems toward advanced
    FL architecture. The distributed nature of FL, where some agents cooperatively
    train a global ML model without directly sharing the local data, makes FL an attractive
    alternative to traditional centralized ML schemes. To be more specific, FL by
    pushing intelligent ML functions to the network edge enhances the privacy and
    scalability of IoT applications and networks [30]. In this paper, our focus is
    on use cases in smart agriculture that require live streaming and analysis, such
    as surveillance and environmental monitoring. Specifically, we address the flexible
    dynamic orchestration of NFV-enabled SFCs within the context of delay-sensitive
    services. The approach involves distributing VNFs across processing nodes, utilizing
    UAVs and local MEC server in a UAV-aided MEC network. The objective is to perform
    SFC while ensuring the freshness of information by jointly minimizing AoI and
    total energy consumption throughout the network. Condensing the system model and
    the definition of the problem, we present the following key insights: In the realm
    of smart agriculture applications, real-time information is collected by IoT devices
    on a smart farm and transmitted through hovering UAVs to the local server. VNFs
    must be executed sequentially on the raw packets, as they represent split functionalities
    of a single processing job. Meanwhile, certain VNFs, such as compression, may
    potentially alter packet sizes. Various service types are assumed, each with its
    specific VNF chain. The challenge involves determining the optimal placement and
    scheduling of VNF chains on processing nodes (UAVs and the local server), accounting
    for processing time, transmission delay, and power consumption (both transmit
    and processing power) in a distributed manner. We will demonstrate analytically
    that the problem: Exhibits circular symmetry, wherein the optimal policies of
    the agents (UAVs) are identical. The local observations of the agents serve as
    sufficient statistics for determining the optimal policy, We will show how these
    two features will simplify the problem significantly. Subsequently, we present
    a novel solution for solving the modeled problem. The main contributions of our
    paper are summarized as follows: To the best of our knowledge this is the first
    time that the problem of dynamic orchestration of NFV-enabled SFCs in a multi-hop
    UAV-aided MEC network for smart agriculture is considered, while the problem is
    formulated as a joint AoI and Energy minimization. We formulate this joint optimization
    problem as a decentralized partially observable MDP (DEC-POMDP), where the parties
    are not aware of the true state and just make decisions based on their local observations.
    We adopted the structural feature of the problem and have analytically shown that
    under the satisfaction of certain symmetry conditions, the local observation of
    the parties (agents) would be a sufficient statistic for determining the optimal
    solution. As the formulated problem is NP-complete, we proposed a novel FL-based
    algorithm called Asynchronous FL Deep Q-Network (AFDQN) in which a set of distributed
    parties learn in parallel and aggregate their own experience through a coordinator.
    A Multi-hop network is considered, where the UAVs can offload their computing
    tasks to the other UAVs as well as the local MEC server. The rest of the paper
    is organized as follows: In Section II some state-of-the-art studies will be reviewed.
    Section III describes the system model and the main components of the system in
    detail. Section IV presents the problem definition and formulation. In Section
    V, the problem is expressed as a DEC-POMDP, and some analytical results are given
    that support our proposed FL-based solution presented in Section VI. The complexity
    analysis of the proposed algorithm is presented in Section VII. The effectiveness
    and performance of the proposed scheme is demonstrated in Section VIII. Finally,
    Section IX concludes the paper. SECTION II. Related Works In this section, we
    review some state-of-the-art studies on AoI and energy-aware UAV-aided MEC for
    smart agriculture. The prospects of using UAVs for smart agriculture are immense.
    Moreover, UAVs are easy to deploy and cost-effective which motivates their use
    in smart agriculture [1], [6], [32]. For a comprehensive survey on IoT-based smart
    agriculture and the emerging technologies mentioned in the previous section refer
    to [1]. In [13], Mozaffari et al. have considered the reliable design of IoT’s
    uplink communication in a scenario in which multiple UAVs are deployed to collect
    data from ground IoT devices. In particular, a framework for jointly optimizing
    the trajectory of the UAVs, IoT-to-UAV association, and IoT’s uplink power is
    proposed with the aim of minimizing the total energy consumption and mobility
    of the UAVs. However, in the formulated problem, the delay of the forwarded data
    across the UAV network is not considered. Nguyen et al. [5] have considered this
    issue as the problem of processing deadline-critical tasks which are fed to a
    network of hovering UAVs that support the IoT devices deployed in a smart farm.
    It is assumed that the smart farm is equipped with a multi-access MEC infrastructure.
    In such a circumstance, the energy-efficient monitoring problem is modeled as
    a multi-objective maximization problem which aims to maximize the number of tasks
    that are successfully processed before their deadline. Then, a Q-Learning-based
    solution is proposed to solve the problem. The same authors in [5] have extended
    their proposed scheme to a DQN-based solution [33] and to a multi-actor-based
    risk-sensitive RL approach [32]. Although, the goal of the aforementioned studies
    is to minimize the energy consumption in the network, however, the proposed solutions
    are basically centralized and the communication overhead of the centralized approaches
    is itself a source of energy waste. The AoI as a metric for determining the freshness
    of information has been used in some recent works On UAV-aided IoT networks [6],
    [17], [23], [34], [35]. Buyukates and Ulukus [34] examined a status update system
    where update packets require processing to extract embedded useful information.
    The source node sends information to a computation unit (CU) with a master node
    and worker nodes. The master node assigns tasks, aggregates results, and sends
    them back to the source node for updating. The analysis focuses on the age performance
    of various schemes in the presence of stragglers, considering i.i.d. exponential
    transmission delays and i.i.d. shifted exponential computation times. Then, the
    best scheme that minimizes the average age is presented. In [35], the authors
    analyzed the average age of information (AoI) and average peak AoI (PAoI) in a
    multiuser Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) system. The system considers three computing
    schemes: local computing, edge computing, and partial computing (where the computational
    tasks are partially performed at the edge and the remaining is performed by the
    local server). To address the complexity, upper and lower bounds on average AoI
    are provided, enabling an examination of optimal offloading decisions based on
    MEC system parameters. In [6], Han et al. modeled a UAV-aided IoT network using
    a Markov chain. The freshness of data packets is defined using AoI and they analyzed
    the IoT devices as first-come-first-served (FCFS) model and M/M/1 queue. Sun et
    al. [17], employed AoI to propose an AoI-energy-aware data collection scheme for
    IoT networks in which the UAVs are used to collect data. Here, AoI is used to
    quantify the temporal correlation among data packets. Then, an algorithm for determining
    the UAV’s flight speed, hovering locations, and allocated bandwidth to IoT devices
    is proposed that jointly minimizes energy consumption and the weighted sum of
    expected average AoI in the network. In [23], a UAV-aided wireless powered IoT
    scheme is proposed, where a UAV flies from a data center toward IoT sensory nodes
    to transfer energy and collect their information and then it returns back to the
    data center. The goal is to minimize the average AoI of the collected data from
    sensor modes. For such circumstances, an optimization problem is formulated, and
    then a suboptimal method is proposed that first decomposes the problem into two
    subproblems. The solution to the first subproblem is the input for the second
    subproblem. It is worth mentioning that the AoI is basically an end-to-end metric;
    Hence, even though the aforementioned works try to minimize the AoI, for the use
    cases in smart agriculture that the captured data needs some live processing before
    being turned into useful information, these approaches are not effective as they
    just consider the problem of finding the best data flow path. In the context of
    UAV-aided MEC for IoT networks, each service can be represented as a service function
    chain (SFC) consisting of ordered processing functions in the form of VNFs that
    can be geographically placed on to local MEC-server or the UAVs. However, in a
    network with numerous IoT devices and dynamic network load, the placement of VNF
    instances and routing among them in an optimal and efficient manner is a challenging
    problem [27], [28]. In the literature, this problem is referred to as the SFC
    dynamic orchestration problem (SFC-DOP) [27]. In [27], Liu et al. presented a
    DRL-based framework for dynamic SFC orchestration in IoT networks. Huang et al.
    in [36] dealt with the problem of scalability and flexibility of static orchestration
    of NFV-enabled SFCs. Then, a FL-based SFC orchestration is proposed which is scalable
    and benefits from low communication cost. Table 1 presents an overview of the
    previously mentioned studies, emphasizing the main topics they concentrated on.
    Although, in the literature, the UAV-aided MEC architecture is mainly proposed
    as a technique to compensate for the energy and computational limitations of IoT
    networks, however, existing solutions for NFV-enabled SFC require IoT nodes to
    exchange large volumes of local data with a centralized server or among the distributed
    agents. Considering the energy limitation of IoT devices and battery-powered UAVs,
    this significantly causes waste of the network energy. In this paper, we deal
    with this inconsistency and propose a novel FL-based solution for the dynamic
    orchestration of SFCs in a multi-hop and UAV-aided MEC network. To the best of
    our knowledge, this is the first time that the problem of dynamic orchestration
    of NFV-enabled SFCs in a multi-hop UAV-aided MEC network is considered. What makes
    our approach unique is the adoption of the inherent structural aspects of the
    problem, typical in most scenarios, to introduce a decentralized solution that
    is analytically demonstrated to be valid. The proposed method is asynchronous
    FL-based, enabling distributed parties to independently learn locally and subsequently
    contribute to the training of the global model asynchronously [38], [39]. In other
    words, the parties are allowed to directly share gradients with the coordinator
    (here, the MEC server) after every local update and asynchronous of the other
    parties. This further enhances the training speed and efficiency of our proposed
    approach [39]. The coordinator in turn can perform the aggregation and update
    the global model whenever an update from one of the distributed parties is received.
    This approach improves the whole system’s scalability and alleviates the straggler
    impact, i.e., users who may have slower performance [38]. TABLE 1 Summary of Related

    We consider a real-time IoT network for smart agriculture applications, where,
    the IoT network provides real-time monitoring and visibility to network operators
    by video/image streaming. For such circumstances, several use cases from remote
    monitoring to security can be considered. As it is depicted in Fig. 1, a set N
    of N IoT devices collect real-time information from a smart farm and send the
    packets to a local server. A UAV-aided MEC architecture is considered, where packets
    are forwarded through an Aerial Network consisting of U hovering UAVs toward the
    local server. We consider applications in which some processing functions, from
    primary processes (e.g., compression) to advanced ones (e.g., object recognition)
    must be sequentially performed on the raw packets. Each IoT device is associated
    with one of the UAVs in its range. U denote the set of all U UAVs in the network.
    The local server is indeed a MEC-server1 denoted by M . A set S={ S k } K k=1
    with |S|=K different service types is assumed. Each service type S k itself consists
    of a set F k ={ F k f } F k f=1 including F k different processing functions that
    should be performed on the packets of that service and F denotes a set of all
    processing functions of all services, F= ⋃ k∈S ( F k ) . The input and output
    packet sizes of the function f of service type k are ρ k f and ϱ k f , respectively.
    FIGURE 1. System model. Show All Let s k n ∈{0,1} denote the service type k∈S
    in IoT node n∈N is active, s k n =1 , or not, s k n =0 . In each IoT node one
    of the K different services is running, ∑ k∈S s k n =1,∀n∈N . To perform the processing
    functions, the MEC-server M and each UAV u is able to run F= ∑ k∈S F k different
    VNF types on their physical computing machine.2 The proposed architecture is based
    on ETSI-NFV standard [40] which is a globally accepted architecture for implementing
    the NFV. According to ETSI-NFV, in each physical machine (processing node) p∈U∪M
    (All U UAVs and the local server M), the VNF manager (VNFM) is responsible to
    manage its computing and storage resources among the VNFs it hosts. The total
    available resources at processing node p is indicated by C p , the computing capacity
    in Hz, and B p , the memory capacity in Byte. The VNF orchestrator (VNFO), hosted
    by the local server, places and schedules the chain of VNFs through Aerial Domain
    and Local (MEC) Server. For a summary of the key symbols and variables used in
    the system model and problem formulation, refer to Table 2. TABLE 2 Key Symbols
    and Variables B. VNF Placement and Scheduling We consider a discrete-time system
    with two hierarchical timing levels. First, the time is divided into equal time
    slots TS with duration T indexed by t=1,2,… . On top of that, we have the VNF-scheduling
    time slots t ~ with duration T ˜ that is multiples of T , and it is a single round
    of VNF placement and scheduling update. At the beginning of each time slot t ~
    , the VNFO updates the VNF placements. Each UAV u segregates data packets from
    IoT nodes sharing the same service type, say k , into a packet-flow Υ k u (t)
    , which it then transmits across the aerial network to the local server. The set
    F k ={ V fk } F k f=1 of F k different VNFs (processing functions) must be performed
    on data packets of the IoT nodes with service type k . At the beginning of each
    VNFO-level time slot t ~ , the VNFO determines the set of processing nodes Δ k
    u ( t ~ ) that participate in serving the k th service packet-flow Υ k u (t) of
    UAV u at t th TS. Each selected processing node p∈U∪M that belongs to Δ k u (
    t ~ ) performs a subset B k up ( t ~ ) of all functions F k that is supposed to
    be performed on the packet flow of service type k belongs to UAV u : B k up (
    t ~ )={ F k f  :  f ˙ k up ≤f≤ f ¨ k up }, B k up ( t ~ )⊆ F k , (1) View Source
    where f ˙ k up (S) and f ¨ k up (E) are the first and the last function (VNF)
    that p performs on the packet flow of service type k of UAV u . In summary, for
    each packet-flow Υ k u (t) , the VNFO selects and schedules the processing nodes
    that handle F k . These nodes can be each one of any other UAVs (intra-domain
    offloading) or local server (inter-domain offloading). Remark 1:Let P to−do p
    ( t ~ )={(u,k,f) : f∈ F k u is running on p} indicate a set of all assigned VNFs
    to the processing node p∈U∪M . We assume all assigned VNFs P to−do p ( t ~ ) to
    processing node p should be finished in a single round of VNF scheduling t ~ .
    Fig. 2 provides a comprehensive representation of crucial elements related to
    the proposed orchestration solution and the communication dynamics within the
    network. Operating at two distinct timing levels, the figure elucidates: 1) The
    VNFO timing (Tier 1), emphasizing interactions pivotal for establishing the proposed
    orchestration solution, and 2) the network-wide communication (Tier 2), encompassing
    all entities within the network. FIGURE 2. Network-wide timing model. Show All
    The upper segment of the figure illustrates how UAV 1 manages received packet
    flows from IoT nodes, accommodating two distinct service types. Following the
    assumed VNFO policy in a single round of VNF placement and scheduling, it is evident
    that for packets of service type 1, UAV1 processes them and subsequently forwards
    them to UAV3. UAV3, after performing the assigned VNFs, then forwards the packets
    to the local server, i.e., the final destination. Conversely, for packets of service
    type 2, UAV1 initiates some initial processing and then directly forwards them
    to the local server, where all remaining VNFs are executed. The lower section
    of the figure is dedicated to illustrating VNFO level operation, depicting control
    packets exchanged between the local server and agents for the training of the
    VNFO model. Further clarification on this VNFO communication is postponed to subsequent
    sections within the article. C. Communication (Access) Network There are three
    communication links among the network nodes: the wireless links between IoT nodes
    and an aerial network consisting of UAVs, the UAV-to-UAV wireless links, and the
    wireless link between the UAVs and the local terrestrial server. Let random process
    g nu (t)∈C denote the channel loss between IoT node n∈N and UAV u∈U , then the
    achievable bit rate of node n in up-link direction at time instant t will be R
    nu (t)= w n log 2 (1+ p nu | g nu (t)| σ 2 ),∀n∈N,u∈U , where w n and σ 2 denote
    the channel bandwidth of IoT device n and the noise variance, respectively, and
    p nu is the transmission power level. The channel between IoT nodes and UAVs and
    between UAVs and the local server can be modeled as an air-to-ground channel model
    [41]. According to this model, the path loss, g nu can be calculated as [37],
    g nu (t)= ( 4πf c ) 2 d 2 (t) η e , (2) View Source where f , c , and d are frequency
    of operation, speed of light, and distance between the transmitter and receiver,
    respectively; and η e is the average of excessive path loss in two cases of existing
    a LoS path, η LoS e , and non-LoS case, η nLoS e , η e = p LoS × η LoS e +(1−
    p LoS )× η nLoS e , (3) View Source where p LoS is the probability that a LoS
    path exists and can be closely approximated as [37], p LoS = 1 1+aexp−b(ψ−a) ,
    (4) View Source where, a and b are environment-related parameters. Similarly,
    in the downlink direction, the achievable bit rate of the link between UAV u∈U
    and MEC server M at time instant t will be R uM (t)= w uM log 2 (1+ p uM | g uM
    (t)| σ 2 ),∀u∈U , where w uM denotes the channel bandwidth, σ 2 is the noise variance,
    p uM is the transmission power level, and random process g uM (t)∈C denotes the
    channel Loss at time t . Finally, the UAV-to-UAV wireless channel also follows
    the same mathematical model, however, the only difference is that the probability
    of existing LoS is equal to 1, p LoS =1 . For each UAV u and service type k ,
    τ k u (t) is defined as the expectation value of IoT access network delay with
    respect to transmission rate R nu (t) , τ k u (t)= E R nu [ τ k nu (t)], τ k nu
    (t)= D nu /C+ Λ k nu / R nu (t), (5) View Source where, E R nu denotes the expectation
    with respect to R nu , D nu is distance between IoT node n∈N and UAV u∈U and Λ
    k nu is the packet length of service type S k ∈S . For the aerial radio links,
    Let random process g u u ´ (t)∈C denote the channel power gain between UAV u∈U
    and UAV (or local server M) u ´ ∈U∪M , then the achievable bit rate of the link
    at time instant t will be R u u ´ = w u u ´ log 2 (1+ p u u ´ | g u u ´ (t)| σ
    2 ),∀n∈N,u∈U∪M , where w u u ´ denote the channel bandwidth between UAV u , and
    UAV (or local server) u ´ , σ 2 is the noise variance, and p u u ´ is the transmission
    power level. In the following sections, we will focus on the VNFO’s functionality,
    and resource allocation of the radio access part is beyond the scope of this paper;
    hence, without loss of generality, we assume a fixed power and bandwidth allocated
    to all the participating nodes. SECTION IV. Problem Formulation Let χ fk pu (
    t ~ )∈{0,1} denote whether the processing node p at time slot t is selected to
    run VNF function f on the packet of the k th service type of UAV u : χ fk pu (
    t ~ )= { 1, 0, if p∈ Δ k u ( t ~ )andf∈ B k pu ( t ~ ) otherwise ∀k∈S,u∈U. (6)
    View Source For each service type k∈S of UAV u , only one of the processing nodes
    (UAVs or MEC-server) must be selected for serving each function f∈ F k : ∑ p∈U∪M
    χ fk pu ( t ~ )=1,∀f∈ F k , ∑ p∈U∪M χ fk pu ( t ~ )=0,∀f∄ F k . (7) View Source
    The relation (7), both left and right expressions together, implies that the packets
    belonging to the service packet-flows travel a loop-free route. Each packet belongs
    to packet-flow Υ k u (t) needs a specific computational capacity c fk in CPU cycle.
    Assuming that all the processing capacity of processing node p in a single time
    slot with duration T ˜ is C p T ˜ , to be assured that the computing capacity
    of the selected processing node is enough to serve the assigned VNFs and the scheduler
    does not exceed the processing node’s budget, the following condition at each
    VNF-scheduling time slot t ~ should be satisfied: ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S ∑ f∈ F k 1 P to−do
    p ( t ~ ) (u,k,f) c fk ≤ C p T ˜ ,∀p∈U∪M. (8) View Source The same condition also
    needs to be fulfilled regarding the storage capacity requirement b fk (in Bytes):
    ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S ∑ f∈ F k 1 P to−do p ( t ~ ) (u,k,f) b fk ≤ B p ,∀p∈U∪M (9) View Source
    where B p is the total amount of available storage capacity of the processing
    node p . A. Age of Information In order to quantify the freshness of the received
    packet at the destination, the AoI metric is adopted. As soon as an IoT node has
    a packet to send, it connects to its serving UAV and sends packets.3 For each
    packet flow of service type k that UAV u∈U receives directly from the IoT nodes
    that are connected to it and running this service type, the arrival time t k u
    is defined as the time elapsed from the beginning of the time slot t in which
    any packet has arrived in. Let Θ k u (t) denote the AoI of the packet-flow of
    service type k in UAV u , it can be calculated as, Θ k u (t)={ τ k u +T− t k u
    , Θ k u (t−1)+T, if  α k u (t)=1 if  α k u (t)=0 ∀k∈S,u∈U (10) View Source where
    binary variable α k u (t)∈{0,1} indicates whether any new packet of service flow
    k at TS t is received, α k u (t)=1 , or not, α k u (t)=0 . By definition, for
    every time slot t in which the UAV does not receive a new packet from a service
    packet flow, the AoI of that service packet flow increases by T . On each received
    packet from IoT node n with service type k , the set F n k of VNFs (processing
    functions) should be performed. As stated above, the VNFO determines the set of
    processing nodes p∈ Δ k u ( t ~ ) that participate in performing the VNFs on packet-flow
    Υ k u (t) by performing the set B k up ( t ~ ) of VNFs. B k up ( t ~ )=∅ means
    p hosts none of the required VNFs of Υ k u (t) . Let Δ k u ( t ~ )={ p 1 , p 2
    ,…, p L } denote the sequence of all UAVs that are already selected to sequentially
    do the chain of VNFs on the received packets of service type k . The processing
    time of every packet of this flow will be, Φ k u (t)= ∑ p v ∈ Δ k u ( t ~ ) ⎛
    ⎝ ⎜ ⌈ τ fk p v−i p v (t) T ⌉T+ ∑ ϑ∈ B k u p v ( t ~ ) (⌈ θ k ϑ T ⌉T ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ), ∀k∈S,u∈U
    τ fk p v−i p v (t)= D p v−i p v /C+ Λ p v−i p v ( F k f )/ R p v−i p v (t) F k
    f = f ¨ k u p v−i , (11) View Source where θ k ϑ is the run time of ϑ th VNF for
    service type k , Λ p v−i p v ( F k f ) is the packet length of service type S
    k ∈S after doing the last VNF f ¨ k u p v−1 of the chain in p v−1 , and, Assuming
    that the queueing delay is negligible, τ fk p v−1 p v is total transmission delay
    between p v−1 and p v consists of propagation delay and transmission delay. If
    the binary variable β k u ( t ~ )∈{0,1} indicates whether the VNF scheduling (at
    VNF-scheduling time slots t ~ ) for the flow of packets belong to service type
    k of UAV u was successful, then, the AoI at the Local server will be, Π k u (t)={
    Θ k u (t)+ Φ k u (t), Π k u (t−1)+ T ˜ , if  β k u ( t ~ )=1 if β k u ( t ~ )=0
    ∀k∈S,u∈U. (12) View Source Note that T ˜ is the duration of a single round of
    VNF placement and scheduling. B. Energy Consumption The energy consumption of
    the network in the uplink direction can be calculated as, P UL (t)= ∑ n∈N ∑ k∈S
    ∑ u∈U s k n p nu Λ k nu / R nu (t), (13) View Source where Λ k nu / R nu (t) is
    the transmission time between IoT node n , with service type k , and UAV u at
    TS t . The other energy-consuming part of the access network is transmission among
    the processing nodes. If we represent the energy consumption in the aerial domain
    (including UAV-to-UAV and UAV-to-MEC links) at TS t with P Aerial (t) , then it
    will be as, P Aerial (t)= τ fk p v−i p v (t)= F k f = ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S ∑ p v ∈ Δ k
    u p p v−i p v τ fk p v−i p v (t), D p v−i p v /C+ Λ p v−i p v ( F k f )/ R p v−i
    p v (t), f ¨ k u p v−i , (14) View Source where Λ p v−i p v ( F k f ) , f ¨ k
    u p v−1 and τ fk p v−1 p v are defined like (11). Finally, if Ψ k ϑ denotes the
    power each machine, that hosts the ϑ th VNF of service type k , consumes to run
    this VNF on each packet of this service type, then, the total network-wide required
    energy for performing the VNFs across a single packet of all service type can
    be calculated as follows: P NFV = ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S ∑ p v ∈ Δ k u ∑ ϑ∈ B k u p v Ψ k
    ϑ θ k ϑ . (15) View Source In a single term, P NFV represents the energy consumption
    resulting from VNFs processing. Using (13)–(15), the total energy consumption
    of the network to process a single packet across all the service types belonging
    to all UAVs would be, P Total (t)= P UL (t)+ P Aerial (t)+ P NFV . (16) View Source
    The UAVs use a battery, hence their available energy to do the processes and perform
    the required communications is limited. Therefore, we need an energy-efficient
    VNFO solution with minimum communication overhead. A centralized ML method will
    be optimal, but it requires a large communication transaction to share the local
    observation with the central controller. Another drawback of adopting centralized
    architecture is that the centralized coordinator is not scalable and from the
    processing and communication viewpoint is a single point of failure. Therefore,
    in this paper, we deal with proposing a solution for the following problem of
    distributed NFV orchestration through the UAVs as distributed VNFO agents. Problem
    1 (Distributed VNFO for Joint AoI and Energy Minimization):Considering the service
    requirements of IoT nodes, UAVs/MEC-server available resources, and the condition
    of access networks, what is the optimal strategy of VNF placement and scheduling
    in each UAV to jointly minimize the average AoI and total energy consumption at
    the Local Server: Minimize χ fk pu ( t ~ ) s.t. γ AoI [ 1 UK ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S Π k u

    (17) View Source In each VNFO-level time slot T ˜ the orchestrator sequentially
    decides on the chain of VNFs of the service flows belonging to UAVs. For a class
    of stochastic sequential decision-making problems, the Markov Decision Process
    (MDP) has been a powerful framework for the mathematical formulation and study
    of this type of problems. Another point that is worth mentioning is that our proposed
    method in Section VI is FL-based where the UAVs follow the same model trained
    cooperatively. Therefore, minimizing the average AoI over UAVs or minimizing the
    maximum value of AoI over UAVs are basically the same. Depending on the environment
    state, the MDP output will be the best action (or at least the best upon the history
    of the observations and actions) which maximizes a specific utility function [42].
    For the case that the state is not fully observable to the deciding agent or the
    agent’s observations are exposed to noise or some source (sort) of uncertainties,
    another extended class of decision-making processes called Partially Observable
    MDP (POMDP) is adopted [43]. Both MDP and POMDP in their original scope are defined
    centralized [42], [43]. Partially Observable Stochastic Game (POSG) is the extended
    version of POMDP in which a set of distributed agents are involved in the decision-making
    process [44], [45]. By definition, if every agent has the same individual reward
    function, the POSG model becomes the Decentralized POMDP (DEC-POMDP) [45]. In
    the following two sections, first, we show how the problem can be modeled as a
    DEC-POMDP and then we will present our proposed method to solve the developed
    DEC-POMDP. SECTION V. DEC-POMDP Formulation In a multi-agent MDP with state uncertainty,
    a DEC-POMDP is formally defined as a tuple with the following definition. Definition
    1 (DEC-POMDP Model):DEC-POMDP G with a set U of U agents is defined as a tuple
    G=⟨U,S, b 0 ,A,O,T,O,R⟩ , where S is the finite set of global environment states,
    b 0 is the probability of the environment initially being in state s∈S , A= ∏
    u∈U A u is the joint action of all agents, where A u is the set of actions available
    to agent u , O= ∏ u∈U O u is joint observation, where O u is the observations
    available to agent u , T is the transition function T :  ⋃ s∈S (s×A(s))×S→[0,1]
    , where T( s ´ |s,A(s)) is defined as the transition probability from state s
    to s ´ by doing joint action A(s) , O is the observation function O :  ⋃ s∈S (s×A(s))×O→[0,1]
    , where O(O|s,A(s)) is defined as the joint observation at state s by doing joint
    action A(s) , R={ r u } U−1 u=0 is a set of reward functions r u  :  ⋃ s∈S (s×A(s))→R
    , where r u (s,A(s)) is defined as the reward received by u when A(s) is executed
    at the global state s . In a DEC-POMDP, each agent u∈U based on its local observation
    o u ∈ O u and a local policy π u performs an independent action a u ∈ A u . In
    each partially observable state s , the joint action A(s)= ∏ u∈U a u (s) from
    the joint policy P= ∏ u∈U π u determines the next global state s ´ and joint observations
    O according to transition and observation probability of T( s ´ |s,A(s)) and O(O|s,A(s))
    , respectively. According to Problem 1, our purpose is to find the best choice
    for the sets Δ k u (t) of processing nodes p and B k up (t) of the VNF chains
    for serving packet-flow Υ k u (t) of any service type k∈S of UAVs u∈U in a distributed
    manner. Remark 2 (Source of Uncertainties):We have considered a multi-hop network
    architecture, as depicted in Fig. 3, in which, 1) each agent u is not aware of
    the other agents’ observation o −u  (−u refers to all the agents except u , o
    −u = ∏ u ´ ≠u o u ´ ) , nor the action a −u ,4 2) each agent observes the result
    of doing its own action and the actions of the other agents, while it is not aware
    of the global state nor the action of the other agents. Therefore, according to
    Definition 1, it can be inferred that Problem 1 in its decentralized form is a
    DEC-POMDP. FIGURE 3. System model as a DEC-POMDP. Show All In DEC-POMDP, each
    agent based on its actions and observations creates a local database that in time
    t can be represented as h u ( t ~ )={ a u ( t ~ −1), o u ( t ~ ) } t ~ t ~ =1
    ,∀u∈U , where a u ( t ~ −1) and o u ( t ~ ) are the action of u at time slot t
    ~ −1 and its corresponding observation at t ~ . All the information is available
    to all the U agents at time t ~ defines as the joint history H( t ~ )= ∏ u∈U h
    u ( t ~ )={A( t ~ −1),O( t ~ ) } t ~ t ~ =1 . The POMDP state is hidden from the
    agents. Hence, the agents would not be able to choose their actions based on knowing
    the true state. The standard approach for dealing with POMDPs is to find a solution
    to the fully observable equivalent belief-MDP [43]. Where, belief B(s, t ~ )=P(s(
    t ~ )=s|H( t ~ ),B(0)),∀s∈S defines as a probability distribution over the state
    space of the original POMDP knowing the joint history H( t ~ ) , i.e., all the
    available information from the sequence of interactions that the agents have had
    until now,where B(0) is the initial value the belief state function. Belief state
    function B(s, t ~ ) is known as sufficient statistic for the history H( t ~ )
    [45]. Upon performing a new interaction at t ~ +1 , the belief value is updated
    from the belief point at time t considering the new interaction {A( t ~ −1),O(
    t ~ )} . Despite the current hidden state, in DEC-POMDP the agents need to infer
    the action (the policy) of the other agents. This leads to the definition of multi-agent
    belief function [46] with the following definition, b u  :  ⋃ s∈S (s× π −u (s))→[0,1],∀u∈U
    b u, t ~ (s, π −u )=P(s( t ~ )=s, π −u | h u ( t ~ ), b u (0)), π −u = ∏ u ´ ∈U,
    u ´ ≠u π u ´ . (18) View Source As it is evident, the multi-agent belief function
    is defined in a space that is a combination of the hidden global state s and joint
    policy π −u of the other agents. From Bellman expectation equation [47], the action-value
    function Q π u, t ~ [(s, π −u ), a π u ] is the expected return starting from
    state hidden state s , taking action a π u according to policy π u , while the
    other agents follow the joint policy π −u , Q π u, t ~ [(s, π −u ), a π u, t ~
    ]= E{ R u [(s, π −u ), a π u, t ~ ] + γ u Q π u, t ~ +1 [( s ´ , π −u ), a π u,
    t ~ +1 ]}. (19) View Source where the action-value function decomposed into immediate
    reward plus discounted action-value of the successor state, and γ u is the discount
    factor of agent u . With some mathematical manipulation, (19) can be written as,
    Q π u, t ~ [(s, π −u ), a π u, t ~ ]= R u [(s, π −u ), a π u, t ~ ] + γ u ∑ (
    o u , o −u )∈O O[ o u , o −u |s,( a π u , a −π −u )] ∑ s ´ ∈S T[ s ´ |s,( a −π
    −u )] × ∑ ( a π u , a −π −u )∈A π u ( a π u | s ´ ) Q π u,t [( s ´ , π −u ( o
    −u )), a ´ π u, t ~ +1 ( o u )]. (20) View Source Using (18), for a given belief
    state function b u, t ~ (s, π −u ) , the action-value function Q π u, t ~ ( b
    u, t ~ , a π u, t ~ ) will be, Q π u, t ~ ( b u, t ~ , a π u, t ~ )= ∑ s∈S ∑ π
    −u b u, t ~ (s, π −u ) Q π u, t ~ [(s, π −u ), a π u, t ~ ]. (21) View Source
    For an enough large value of t ~  ( t ~ →∞) , the goal is to find the optimal
    policy π ∗ u among available policies π u which leads to the optimal Q-value (action-value)
    function, Q ∗ u, t ~ ( b u, t ~ , a u, t ~ )=arg max π Q π u, t ~ ( b u, t ~ ,
    a π u, t ~ ). (22) View Source There is no straightforward solution for the aforementioned
    DEC-POMDP problem. Among decentralized methods, multi-agent solutions also need
    a large volume of communication overhead between the agents to share their local
    observations to converge. FL does not have the communication overhead of the centralized
    techniques and also does not necessitate the agents to share all of the data and
    local observations to converge. Although this specification is for providing privacy,
    in our problem it provides us with the gain of energy efficiency that arises because
    the agents (UAVs) do not need to share all of their observations. A few efforts,
    [45], [48], [49], have been made in the literature to capture and exploit some
    structural specifications of the understudied system (application) to find or
    at least simplify the problem of finding optimal policy (22). One of these works
    is one presented by Yongacoglu et al. [48], in which the authors have developed
    a class of POSGs that is characterized by symmetry across players in terms of
    cost and state dynamics. In view of this research, within the APPENDIX, we introduce
    a class of Symmetric DEC-POMDP and prove that Problem 1belongs to this class and
    is Circularly Symmetric. This implies that the best agents’ policy, π ∗ are the
    same, { π u } U−1 u=0 = π ∗ . In essence, this necessitates a distributed solution
    to determine the best policy while ensuring uniformity across all agents. Furthermore,
    in accordance with the circular symmetry characteristic of the problem, in Corollary
    22 we prove that local observations serve as sufficient statistics for each agent
    to ascertain the best policy. Corollary 22 guarantees that the local observation
    h u ( t ~ ) serves as a sufficient statistic to determine the optimal policy π
    ∗ for the agents (UAVs). This implies that the information encapsulated in the
    local observations of the individual agents is comprehensive enough to determine
    the optimal policy π ∗ . While this corollary does not suggest a particular method
    for identifying the optimal policy, it is promising and justifies our proposed
    FL-based algorithm in which the agents collaboratively engage in training a globally
    shared model. This approach aligns with the notion that leveraging decentralized
    insights from each agent’s local observations can contribute to the derivation
    of an effective and globally optimal policy because their observations are sufficient
    statistics. Capitalizing on the promising findings in this section, the subsequent
    section introduces our proposed approach to address Problem 1. SECTION VI. Symmetry-aided
    Asynchronous Federated DQN Framework In this section, we introduce our proposed
    Asynchronous Federated Deep Q-Network (AFDQN) algorithm and the components we
    have used in the proposed model as depicted in Fig. 4. In traditional RL, the
    problem is modeled as an MDP consisting of a tuple {s( t ~ ),a( t ~ ),r( t ~ ),s(
    t ~ +1)} . At each decision-making time t ~ , the agent is at state s( t ~ ) and
    takes an action a( t ~ ) based on a policy π that causes a state transition from
    s( t ~ ) to s( t ~ +1) while an immediate reward r( t ~ ) incurred. For our POMDP
    case in which the true state of the network is hidden, the true state s( t ~ )
    is replaced with belief-state b( t ~ ) . Mainly, the RL aims to guide the agent
    to find the best policy π ∗ defined as the best mapping from observation o( t
    ~ ) to action a( t ~ ) that maximizes the expected cumulative discounted future
    rewards R( t ~ )= E π { ∑ ∞ l=t γ (l− t ~ ) r(l)} , where γ∈[0,1] is a discount
    factor indicating how much future rewards is important. For our DEC-POMDP problem,
    this relation maps to (19). FIGURE 4. Block diagram of the proposed Asynchronous
    Federated-DQN (AFDQN). Show All A. Deep Q-Network (DQN) Part To estimate Q-value
    functions (21), deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is deployed, where Q-values
    are predicted using deep neural networks (DNNs) as function approximators. The
    estimated Q -functions are represented by { Q u ( o u ( t ~ ), a u ( t ~ ); θ
    u ( t ~ )) } U−1 u=0 , where the parameter θ u ( t ~ ) represents the weights
    of the agent u ’s neural network (NN). The updated value of θ u ( t ~ ) is used
    to approximate the true values of Q u ( t ~ ) [21], [50]. Let’s define the loss
    function L( θ u ( t ~ )) as the expectation value of the mean squared error of
    the estimated Q-value Q u ( o u ( t ~ ), a u ( t ~ ); θ u ( t ~ )) from the target
    value y( t ~ ) [21], L( θ u ( t ~ ))=E[(y( t ~ )− Q u ( o u ( t ~ ), a u ( t ~
    ); θ u ( t ~ )) ) 2 ], (23) View Source where, y( t ~ )= r u ( t ~ )+γ max a u
    ( t ~ +1) Q u ( o u ( t ~ +1), a u ( t ~ +1); θ u ( t ~ )) and a u ( t ~ +1) indicates
    the agent’s action generated by the DNN at t ~ +1 , given the observation o u
    ( t ~ +1) . At each iteration, the deep Q -function approximator is trained to
    learn the best estimate of the Q-function by minimizing the loss function L( θ
    u ( t ~ )) . To improve the stability of the algorithm and cope with samples correlation,
    as depicted in Fig. 4, two novel techniques, namely Fixed Target Network [51]
    and Experience Replay Buffer [52] are deployed, respectively. Utilizing these
    two techniques, the loss function L( θ u ( t ~ )) can be written as L( θ u ( t
    ~ )) = E D [( r u ( t ~ )+γ max a u ( t ~ +1) Q u (b( t ~ +1), a u ( t ~ +1);
    θ ´ u ( t ~ )) − Q u ( o u ( t ~ ), a u ( t ~ ); θ u ( t ~ )) ) 2 ], (24) View
    Source where θ ´ u ( t ~ ) denotes the target network parameters, and the expectation
    E D is taken over the randomly selected mini-batches of samples from the replay
    buffer D . B. Federated Learning Part As it is illustrated in Fig. 4, we have
    two main entities, the set U={0,1,…,U−1} of UAVs that are our distributed agents
    or in FL terminology, the agents, and the coordinator that in our model is local
    server (MEC-server). FL allows the UAVs (agents) to train a shared global model
    parameterized by θ g that is an exact copy of the agents’ local model { θ u }
    u=U−1 u=0 using their own dataset { D u } u=U−1 u=0 , while the original data
    remains in UAVs. After local training, agents share their local model updates
    with the coordinator. The coordinator then aggregates the received updates to
    build the global model θ g . As a result, relying on the distributed data training
    at the agents, the local server is able to enhance the training performance without
    significant communication overhead as it just needs an update of the local model
    parameters, not the agents’ local data. The federated learning procedure of our
    proposed method includes the following key steps. 1) Distributed Local Training
    Primarily, the local server initializes the global model, θ g,0 , and transmit
    it to the agents. Upon receiving θ g,0 , during VNFO time slots t ~ the agents
    interact with environment and train their local model { θ u ( t ~ ) } u=U−1 u=0
    using their own data set { D u ( t ~ ) } u=U−1 u=0 by minimizing a loss function
    { L u ( θ u ( t ~ )) } u=U−1 u=0 , θ ∗ u =arg min π u L u ( θ u (( t ~ ))),∀u∈U.
    (25) View Source Then, the agents upload their local update on { θ u ( t ~ ) }
    u=U−1 u=0 to the coordinator for aggregation. 2) Model Aggregation After collecting
    the agents’ local model updates, the next step is aggregating them into a new
    version of the global model which is performed by the coordinator by solving the
    following optimization problem. Problem 2 (Model Aggregation):Given the local
    model updates { θ u ( t ~ ) } u=U−1 u=0 of all agents, and knowing the local loss
    functions { L u (⋅) } u=U−1 u=0 , what is the optimal strategy for aggregating
    the local model that minimizes the global loss, θ ∗ g , L ∗ g =arg min L g , θ
    g L g ( ∏ u∈U L u ( θ g (( t ~ )))). (26) View Source According to Problem 2,
    θ ∗ g is the optimal value for θ g with having the local updates in hand; and
    L ∗ g is the best function (the best method) for aggregating the local loss function.
    The loss-aggregation function L ∗ g indicates the relative contribution of each
    agent on the global model, however, there is not a fixed method for determining
    this function and it depends mostly on the structure and specific features of
    the problem. Corollary 1:According to Lemma 2, The best setting for loss functions
    is (24) and { L u (⋅) } u=U−1 u=0 =L(⋅) , The optimal way for aggregating the
    local updates is averaging among the agent’s contributions, thus (25) can be rewritten
    as, θ ∗ g = ∑ u∈U ω u θ u , where ω u represents the relative contribution of
    each agent on the global model. After the derivation of a new update of θ g the
    coordinator broadcasts it to all agents. Upon receiving the update from the coordinator,
    the agents upgrade their local model accordingly. Until achieving a predefined
    level of accuracy or convergence of the global loss function, this process is
    continued. C. Asynchronous Networking The communication among the network entities
    follows the time slots t , but slot scheduling in which the agents share their
    own local model with the coordinator is distributed and asynchronous. Upon receiving
    an update, the coordinator aggregates it with the global model and updates the
    agents with the newly updated global model. In this way, we do not impose a strict
    constraint on synchronous communication with the local server (the coordinator).
    This significantly decreases the networking overhead in comparison with synchronous
    federation among distributed agents. During the training phase, we consider episodes
    in which the agent presets to a random initialization setting and starts interaction
    with the environment, and learns from its experience. Each episode contains T
    ˆ VNF scheduling round t ~ . In the deployment phase, the stream of packets that
    belong to different services is assigned based on an optimally determined VNF
    placement/scheduling policy. To avoid service interruption any fine-tuning and
    policy adaption to environmental changes, including the time the algorithm spends
    on fine-tuning and finding the optimal solution by coordinating multiple agents
    to train the global model, can be done in parallel. Definition 2 (Global Update
    Period):global update period 1≤η≤ T ˆ is defined as the period of updating the
    coordinator by the agents. We have two special settings, AFDQN-SGD ( η=1 ): In
    this case, every VNF scheduling slot t ~ , the agent sends the locally calculated
    SGD, ∇ θ L u ( θ u ( t ~ )) to the coordinator. Then, the coordinator uses the
    received local data to perform one step of gradient descent: θ g ( t ~ +1)= θ
    g ( t ~ )− γ ˙ ∇ θ L u ( θ u ( t ~ )). (27) View Source AFDQN-Avg ( η= T ˆ ):
    In this case, only one time during each episode, the agent sends the whole parameter
    θ u ( t ~ ) to the coordinator. Then, the coordinator updates θ g ( t ~ ) accordingly,
    θ g ( t ~ +1)=(1− γ ¨ ) θ g ( t ~ )+ γ ¨ θ u ( t ~ ), (28) View Source where,
    γ ˙ and γ ¨ are AFDQN-SGD and AFDQN-Avg forgetting factors, respectively. Introducing
    the forgetting factors γ ˙ and γ ¨ allows for the adjustment of learning rates
    during model updates. Rather than updating the global model instantly upon receiving
    a local update, it is beneficial to employ a weighted average approach, considering
    both the most recent update and the previous value of the Agent’s NN weight θ
    g . This approach, known as Asynchronous Weight Averaging [53] in the literature,
    proves advantageous in alleviating the impact of outdated updates, commonly referred
    to as stale weights, and consequently, it enhances overall stability. The only
    point is that the forgetting factors should be chosen small enough. Another worth
    mentioning point is that the AFDQN-SGD and a centralized approach doing mini-batch
    SGD in the local server are essentially different as the former is asynchronous,
    distributed, and fully based on local data. The details of the proposed AFDQN
    algorithm are described in Algorithm 1. Algorithm 1: AFDQN- η Algorithm Show All
    Considering our optimization problem, for each agent u∈U at VNF scheduling round
    t ~ , we define the observation space O u , the action space A u , and the reward
    function R u as follows: Observation: We define the observation space as a vector
    of: 1) CPU and storage requested by the local service flows { Υ k u (t)|t= t ~
    } k as { c fk (t)|t= t ~ } f,k and { b fk (t)|t= t ~ } f,k , respectively, 2)
    available CPU { C p } p and storage { B p } p of the processing nodes, 3) service
    arrival time { t k u } k , and 4) the transmission rate { R u p ´ } U∖ u ´ ∪M
    of the links between agent u and the other processing nodes. Therefore, the observation
    o u ( t ~ ) can be written as O u ( t ~ )= {{ c fk (t) } f,k ,{ b fk (t) } f,k
    , { C p } p ,{ B p } p ,{ t k u } k ,{ R u p ´ } U∖u⋃M } t= t ~ . (29) View Source
    Action: The action space is defined as all possible placement of the required
    VNFs for service flows { Υ k u (t)|t= t ~ } k as A u ( t ~ )={ χ fk pu ( t ~ )},∀p∈U∪M,k∈S,f∈
    F k . (30) View Source Reward: Our objective is to orchestrate the VNFs in a way
    that jointly minimizes the average AoI and total energy consumption over the network.
    So we define the reward as a linear combination of three terms as follows: R u
    ( t ~ )= ζ ¯ ¯ ¯ u ( t ~ )= Π ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ( t ~ )= ζ k u ( t ~ )= δ NFV ζ ¯ ¯ ¯ u
    ( t ~ )+ δ AoI Π ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ( t ~ )+ δ E P total ( t ~ ), 1 K ∑ k∈S ζ k u ( t ~ )
    1 UK ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S Π k u ( t ~ ) { +1, −10, if (7)-(9)are satisfied otherwise. (31)
    View Source where δ NFV , δ AoI and δ E are the normalization factors for NFV
    scheduling result, AoI, and the energy consumption, respectively; ζ k u ( t ~
    ) is defined as the reward assigned to the result of NFV placement for service
    flow Υ k u (t)|t= t ~ . SECTION VII. Complexity Analysis In this section, we determine
    the computational complexity of the proposed Algorithm 1. We analyze the algorithm’s
    complexity through two distinct phases: Model Training and Action Selection, which
    occur during the deployment of the trained model. During each iteration of the
    global update period η , the process involves the training of local models by
    the agents (UAVs) and subsequently, the asynchronous aggregation of these local
    models by the MEC server to form the global model. The complexity of the local
    model training conducted by the agents can be expressed as the sum of two components:
    the complexity of action selection and the complexity of the back-propagation
    algorithm for each sample within the replay buffer. This sum is then further multiplied
    by the mini-batch size and η . It is worth noting that the multiplication by the
    mini-batch size accounts for the fact that, in each training iteration, the local
    agent randomly selects a mini-batch of samples from its own local replay buffer.
    The computational complexity of action selection in a fully connected neural network
    with a fixed number of hidden layers and neurons in each hidden layer is directly
    proportional to the sum of the input size and the output size of the neural network
    being used [54], [55]. The input size of the neural network is equivalent to the
    size of the state space, which from (29) is given by 2KF+2(U+1)+K+(U−1)+1 ; and,
    the output size of the neural network is equal to the size of the action space.
    which from (30) is given by KF(U+1) . It’s worth recalling that F= ∑ k∈S F k represents
    the overall count of distinct VNFs required to be executed across all service
    types. Hence, the computational complexity associated with action selection is
    represented by O(KFU) . Conversely, as indicated in equation [54], [55], for a
    specific sample extracted from the replay buffer, the computational complexity
    of the back-propagation process is directly proportional to the product of the
    neural network’s input and output sizes. Consequently, in our specific scenario,
    derived from the preceding computations, the overall algorithmic complexity for
    each agent can be expressed as O(ηO K 2 F 2 U) , where, O denotes the batch size.
    From Algorithm 1, each agent repeats the whole process of local model training
    η times preceding sharing the results with the local server. The last step is
    the aggregation process. While our algorithm conducts asynchronous aggregation,
    it’s important to note that the processing load escalates proportionally with
    the number of UAVs, U . As a result, the overall computational complexity for
    the training phase across the entire network is given by O(ηO F 2 K 2 U 2 ) .
    Based on the prior discussion, the complexity associated with the action selection
    for all U agents during the deployment phase is denoted as O(KF U 2 ) . SECTION
    VIII. Performance Evaluation In this section, the performance of the proposed
    algorithm is evaluated. The performance results are compared for four different
    methods of AFDQN-SGD, AFDQN-Avg, AFDQN with parameter η≠{1, T ˆ } , and a centralized
    case. In the centralized DQN method, all the observations are forwarded to the
    local server and the local server performs the VNF scheduling. Hence, its performance
    can be considered as an upper bound for the proposed AFDQN method. A. Simulation
    Setup The simulation is implemented by Python using OpenAI gym [56], a widely
    used tool for developing RL algorithms, and conducted in a computer with Intel
    Core i7–10700 CPU 2.90 GHz and 64 GB RAM. Using simulation, the impact of parameter
    η , the number of IoT nodes, and the effect of the received load by the agents
    are evaluated. To this purpose, while T ˆ =60 , five different values for the
    parameter of η consisting of 1 (corresponds to AFDQN-SGD), 10, 20, 30, and 60
    (corresponds to AFDQN-Avg) are considered. The other model parameters and simulation
    settings are summarized in Table 3 and Table 4. The proposed system model entirely
    matches none of the existing related works. However, the simulation parameters
    have been chosen to be in line with the typical values commonly used in similar
    studies within this context [6], [32], [33], [36], [37]. TABLE 3 Model Parameters
    and Simulation Settings Part I TABLE 4 Model Parameters and Simulation Settings
    Part II B. Simulation Results In Fig. 5, the convergence behavior of the AFDQN
    method is compared with the centralized method as a baseline. The two extreme
    cases of AFDQN-SGD and AFDQN-Avg are considered. As is evident from this figure,
    for the AFDQN method we have some variations around the value where it converged.
    The absolute value of these variations in AFDQN-Avg is more than AFDQ-SGD, and
    in AFDQN-SGD’s case, they are around the value achieved by the centralized method.
    Also, the AFDQN-Avg converged to a smaller value for total return, we expect this
    result will also be reflected in the performance of AFDQN-Avg against AFDQN-SGD.
    This will be investigated in the following experiments. In Fig. 6(a) and Fig.
    6(b), the minimum achievable average AoI and total energy consumption are investigated.
    The AoI value is averaged over all the agents and the total energy consumption
    is defined as the total energy consumption for sending a single packet of each
    service flow through the network from IoT nodes toward the local server. As can
    be seen, the maximum energy consumption of the three methods is limited to a maximum
    value corresponding to the maximum value of resources that the processing nodes
    can allocate to the requests. As a result, the negative side effect of the methods’
    drop in performance is mostly reflected in the value of the averaged AoI. For
    the AFDQN-Avg, this point is evidenced in Fig. 6(a), where we can see that at
    several points the values of the averaged AoI are more than 1 second. However,
    this is the worst-case choice for selecting the global update period η . Form
    Fig. 6(a), for the proposed AFDQN, we could achieve an average AoI of less than
    200 msec, which is acceptable for most real-time applications. Therefore, performance
    close to the centralized case can be achieved by the proposed method in a distributed
    manner, relying solely on the local observations of the UAVs and the sharing of
    trained local models, thus eliminating the need for exchanging the local observations,
    which can be time and energy-consuming. FIGURE 5. Episodic reward of agent 1 for
    the proposed method compared with centralized architecture. All agents follow
    the same policy, which is a copy of the cooperatively-trained global model. Show
    All FIGURE 6. (a) Average episodic AoI. (b) Average episodic total energy consumption
    of the proposed method compared with centralized architecture. All agents follow
    the same policy, which is a copy of the cooperatively-trained global model. Show
    All In Fig. 7(a) and Fig. 7(b), the network energy efficiency versus service availability
    is drawn. The network-wide energy efficiency is defined as the total number of
    successfully-supported service flows divided by the total energy consumption throughout
    the network to send a single packet from each one of the services flows. Also,
    service availability is defined as the percentage of the service flows that are
    supported successfully. In Fig. 7(a), the average network energy efficiency and
    the sample values in our simulation, as well as the standard deviation of the
    value, for AFDQN- 20 (η=20) are shown. The averaged network efficiency with increasing
    the value of the service availability increases in a way that for the service
    availability of more than 80 percent, it converges to around 82 percent. This
    convergence for large value of service availability shows that we were eventually
    able to provide energy efficiency as one of our objective functions. In Fig. 7(b),
    where the proposed AFDQN method with different values of η∈{20,30,60} is compared
    with the centralized approach, it can be seen that the energy efficiency of the
    centralized approach degrades as the availability reaches 100%. This behavior
    is because the centralized method has a single NN for all UAVs. For the availability
    values near 100%, the centralized agent is not able to do the job as efficiently
    as the AFDQN method where each agent has its own NN. FIGURE 7. Network-wide energy
    efficiency vs. percentage of service availability. The shaded area represents
    the standard deviation (SD) from the average value: (a) For AFDQN with η=20 .
    Sample values are shown for more illustration. (b) For AFDQN with η=20 , η=30
    , AFDQN-Avg and centralized architecture. Show All As illustrated in Table 3,
    the load of services (in terms of requested CPU and storage resources) is modeled
    as a normalized uniform random variable. The standard deviation (SD) of the values
    for both CPU request values and storage is 1.3 percent. In Fig. 8, the impact
    of increasing this value, up to 6 times the primary value of 1.3, on the network’s
    performance is examined. The network is first trained with the primary input-load
    SD value of 1.3, and then, we incrementally raised the SD of the input load. This
    can be implicitly considered as a test under non-stationary load. It is evident
    that in this situation the AoI will increase, as illustrated in Fig. 8. To be
    more specific, we considered a threshold of one second for the acceptable AoI.
    Hence, we have also drawn a graph of AoI violation (in percentage) in conjunction
    with the bar chart of averaged AoI to better reflect the effect of the load SD.
    The results demonstrate that the AFDQN-Avg method has better performance in this
    situation, which appears to contradict our previous observations where we concluded
    that decreasing the global update period improves the performance. This observation
    can be explained using the non-stationary behavior of the input load. In this
    case, the AFDQN-Avg lets the agents learn the variations and input model better,
    in comparison with AFDQN-10, which was chosen as an example for a case between
    two extreme cases, AFDQN-SGD and AFDQN-Avg. FIGURE 8. Averaged-AoI and AoI-violation
    percentage for AFDQN-10 and AFDQN-Avg versus standard deviation (SD) of the load
    normalized by SD of the load in the training phase. Show All The effect of increasing
    the number of IoT nodes per agent (UAV) on AoI and Energy consumption is investigated
    in Fig. 9. For this experiment, two AFDQN-10 and AFDQN-Avg cases are considered.
    The results show that AFDQN-10 had better performance than AFDQ-Avg. Another important
    point that should be mentioned relates to the behavior of the network for a large
    number of IoT nodes, e.g., 120 or more. As the number of IoT nodes increases,
    the load of the agents increases directly, this means that there are more CPU
    and storage requests. Because the resources in the processing nodes are limited,
    there comes a point where an increase in the number of IoT nodes will lead to
    more request rejection responses. In this situation, the fresh packets will drop,
    and that causes an increase in the AoI value. However, the network energy consumption
    does not change because the volume of the active processes does not change and
    remains equal to the maximum capacity of the processing nodes. FIGURE 9. The effect
    of increasing the number of IoT nodes per agent (UAV) on AoI and energy consumption.
    Show All For further exploration, Fig. 10 and Fig. 11 compare the performance
    of the proposed algorithm against two baseline algorithms: Multi-agent DQN (MDQN)
    [57] and the adapted version of heuristic Minimum-Delay algorithm [58]. In MDQN
    the agents operate independently based on locally trained models without coordination.
    The agents are equipped with an identical neural network featuring the same specifications
    as AFDQN. Conversely, the Minimum Delay algorithm selects actions at each VNF
    scheduling round t ´ to minimize end-to-end delay (not AoI) between IoT nodes
    and the local server. FIGURE 10. Averaged-AoI and AoI-violation percentage for
    AFDQN-avg compared with MDQN and Minimum-Delay versus standard deviation (SD)
    of the load normalized by SD of the load in the training phase. Show All FIGURE
    11. The effect of increasing the number of IoT nodes per agent (UAV) on AoI and
    energy consumption for AFDQN-avg compared with MDQN and Minimum-Delay. Show All
    In Fig. 10, a comparison similar to Fig. 8 assesses the impact of increasing load
    standard deviation (SD) on network performance in terms of AoI and AoI violation.
    Generally, an increase in SD raises the average AoI and AoI violation percentage
    for all methods, as larger SD values force agents to find the best action across
    a larger state space. As it is evident, the proposed AFDQN method exhibits the
    smallest average AoI and AoI violation percentage compared to baseline methods.
    However, the Minimum Delay method performs the worst due to its localized short-term
    target. Finally in Fig. 11, the impact of increasing the number of IoT nodes per
    agent (UAV) on the proposed method’s performance in terms of AoI and energy consumption
    is explored and compared with MDQN and Minimum Delay algorithms. Results demonstrate
    the superior performance of the proposed AFDQN method compared to baselines. Additionally,
    as the number of IoT nodes reaches 120 and beyond, there is an increased demand
    for CPU and storage; limited resources in processing nodes eventually lead to
    increased rejection of requests, causing a rise in AoI. However, network energy
    consumption remains unchanged, as the volume of active processes remains equal
    to the maximum capacity of processing nodes. SECTION IX. Conclusion We considered
    the problem of dynamic orchestration of NFV-enabled SFCs in smart agriculture
    applications to jointly minimize the AoI and energy consumption throughout the
    network. Especially, the problem is formulated as a decentralized POMDP. Then,
    adopting the symmetric structure of the network, we analytically proved that the
    optimal policy among the agents is behaving similarly. Accordingly, a novel federated-based
    DQN method was proposed to solve the problem efficiently. The proposed method
    is distributed and energy efficient, as the local agents just need to share the
    parameters of their locally trained model with each other. Although the primary
    goal of this method is to provide privacy among the agents, in our problem, this
    significantly decreased the communication overhead, and additionally, the total
    energy consumption of the network. In terms of freshness of information, the AoI
    is minimized jointly, and the achieved value for the AoI, while the parameter
    setting is set to be close to real values, is appropriate for most real-time applications.
    Appendix In this section, we aim to simplify the problem of determining the optimal
    policy (22) by utilizing some structural specifications of the developed system
    and problem. Inspiring by the work presented by Yongacoglu et al. [48], we introduce
    a class of Symmetric DEC-POMDP based on the Definition and Lemma presented below.
    Definition 3 (Symmetric DEC-POMDP):A DEC-POMDP is called symmetric if the following
    conditions hold: A u = A u ´ and γ u = γ u ´ , ∀u, u ´ ∈U∀u∈U , ∀a∈A , and an
    arbitrary permutation function σ(.) : r u (s,σ(a))= r σ(u) (s,a) , and T(⋅|s,σ(a))=T(⋅|s,a)
    . Lemma 1:Let G be a symmetric DEC-POMDP, for any u, u ´ ∈U , if π u = π u ´ ,
    then, π u is ϵ -best-response to π −u if and only if π u ´ is ϵ -best-response
    to π − u ´ , where ϵ -best-response (for an arbitrary ϵ≥0) defines as a policy
    that achieves (reach) a reward (cost) within ϵ of the maximum (minimum) value.
    In our VNF scheduling problem, as it is depicted in Fig. 3, at each VNF scheduling
    round t ~ , each distributed agent u∈U , has K packet-flow { Υ k u (t)|t= t ~
    } K k=1 belong to different services each of which requires running F k different
    VNFs on their packets. The agents decide on how to place these VNFs into available
    processing nodes, i.e., other U−1 UAVs, the local server, or itself, in a way
    that jointly minimizes the average AoI and energy consumption according to (17).
    All the agents follow the same goal and the priorities among the agents are the
    same. Without loss of generality, we assume that the agents have chosen the same
    discount factor, { γ u } u∈U =γ . Thus, it can be found that the agents conceptually
    have the same model; an intuitive inference that can be figured out better using
    the following Index Mapping rule. Definition 4 (Index Mapping):For each function
    f∈ F k of packet-flow Υ k u (t)|t= t ~ , by definition we assume that the policy
    π u ( t ~ ) outputs I fk u ∈{0,1,…,U−1,M} is the i th candidate processing node,
    I i , as depicted in Fig. 12. The actual selected processing node among p∈{u∪{
    u ´ } u ´ ≠u ∪M} , will be, p u ( t ~ )={ [(u+i)modU] th UAV, M, if  I i ≠ I M
    if  I i = I M , ∀ I fk u = I i . (32) View Source Then, χ fk pu (|t= t ~ )=1 ,
    and X k u , B k pu will be updated accordingly. FIGURE 12. Index mapping mechanism.
    Show All Now, according to Definition 3and Definition 4, the following lemma can
    be driven. Lemma 2:Problem 1is a symmetric DEC-POMDP. Proof:According to Definition
    4, the agents have the same set of actions { A u } u∈U ={ I i } i∈U∪M , so the
    condition (i) of Definition 3 is met. Let define C ℓ as circular shift operand
    with arbitrary value of ℓ , C ℓ (⋅)=[⋅+ℓ]modU . Considering a circular shift of
    ℓ over joint action A , C ℓ (A) , we will have, a C ℓ (u) = a u , thus from (32),
    for each I fk C ℓ (u) = I fk u = I i the selected processing node p C ℓ (u) (t)
    will be, p C ℓ (u) ( t ~ )={ [( C ℓ (u)+i)modU] th UAV, M, if  I i ≠ I M if  I
    i = I M , ∀ I fk C ℓ (u) = I i . View Source Or, p C ℓ (u) ( t ~ )= C ℓ ( p u
    ( t ~ )). (33) View Source Equation (33) means Problem 1 is circularly symmetric.
    To be more specific, we do not have any special dependency on the identity of
    the agents and the state transitions depend only on the profile of joint actions
    performed by all agents. Accordingly, permuting the agents’ actions does not change
    the conditional transition probabilities, T(⋅|s, C ℓ (A))=T(⋅|s,A) , and this
    permutation will lead to a corresponding permutation of rewards, r C ℓ (u) (s,A)=
    r u (s, C ℓ (A)) . Hence, the second condition of Definition 3 is also satisfied
    and the proof is complete. According to Lemma 2, being circularly symmetric means
    that the best agents’ policy, π ∗ are the same, { π u } U−1 u=0 = π ∗ . For such
    a condition, Lemma 1implies that the problem of finding the best policy can be
    reduced to finding π ∗ u , the best response to ∏ u ´ ≠u π u ´ , while π u ´ =
    π u ,∀ u ´ ≠u . Although this result is promising, from an implementation viewpoint,
    proposing a distributed solution for finding the best policy while requiring the
    same policy for all the agents is challenging. Recalling (18), in addition to
    the current hidden state, in DEC-POMDP the agents need to infer the action (the
    policy) of the other agents. The subsequent Corollary establishes a connection
    between this inference and solely relying on the local observations of the agents,
    thereby rendering it feasible. Corollary 2:With the same initialization of the
    belief function, { b u (0) } U−1 u=0 =b(0) , for a circularly symmetric DEC-POMDP,
    the local observation h u ( t ~ ) is a sufficient statistic for determining the
    optimal policy π ∗ . Proof:Assume that using a mechanism, the agents peruse the
    same policy π u ( t ~ ) , while they are learning the optimal policy π ∗ . Then,
    the multi-agent belief state b u, t ~ (s, π −u ) would be, b u, t ~ (s, π −u )=
    = = b u, t ~ ⎛ ⎝ s, ∏ u ´ ≠u π u ⎞ ⎠ P(s( t ~ )=s| h u ( t ~ ), b u (0), π u )
    b π u u (s, t ~ ).∀u∈U (34) View Source So, for each agent u , the local observation
    h u ( t ~ ) and knowing its local policy π u is enough for determining the belief-state
    b π u u (s, t ~ ) . In a DEC-POMDP, the set { b π u u (s, t ~ ) } U−1 u=0 is sufficient
    statistic for the joint history H , and the proof is complete. Authors Figures

  description: Implant stability significantly impacts accelerated osseointegration,
    leading to faster patient recovery. Both primary and secondary stability necessitates
    superior bone-implant contact influenced by the surgical tool required to prepare
    the final osteotomy site. Besides, excessive shearing and frictional forces generate
    heat causing local tissue necrosis. Hence, surgical procedure necessitates proper
    irrigation with water to minimize heat generation. Notably, the water irrigation
    system removes bone chips and osseous coagulums, which may help accelerate osseointegration
    and improve bone-implant contact. The inferior bone-implant contact and thermal
    necrosis at the osteotomy site are primarily responsible for poor osseointegration
    and eventual failure. Therefore, optimizing tool geometry is key to minimizing
    shear force, heat generation, and necrosis during final osteotomy site preparation.
    The present study explores modified drilling tool geometry, especially cutting
    edge for osteotomy site preparation. The mathematical modeling is used to find
    out ideal cutting-edge geometry that facilitates drilling under relatively less
    operational force (0.55–5.24 N) and torque (98.8-154.5 N-mm) with a significant
    reduction (28.78%–30.87%) in heat generation. Twenty-three conceivable designs
    were obtained using the mathematical model; however, only three have shown promising
    results in static structural FEM platforms. These drill bits are designed for
    the final drilling operation and need to be carried out during the final osteotomy
    site preparation.

  explanation: 'The present study focused on the development and validation of a novel
    parabolic drill bit geometry to optimize the surgical procedure of preparing osteotomy
    sites for implant placement. Traditional straight cutting edge drill bits were
    shown to create conical cross-sections at the apical region of the osteotomy site,
    leading to poor bone-implant contact and potential implant rejection. The proposed
    design aimed to create a parabolic cross-section at the close end of the osteotomy
    site, which was hypothesized to improve bone-implant contact and reduce the risk
    of thermal necrosis during drilling.


    The proposed design was based on an analytical model developed by Elhachimi et
    al. This model was used to optimize the geometric parameters of the parabolic
    cutting edge, including point angle, helix angle, feed rate, and drill diameter.
    The model also predicted the forces and torque acting on the cutting edge, which
    were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed design.


    To validate the results of the mathematical model, static structural FEM simulations
    were performed on 23 promising designs. The simulations used the optimized geometric
    parameters as boundary conditions and considered stainless steel non-linear material
    properties for the drill bit. The results showed that only three designs were
    within the stress limits and were considered safe under both maximum principle
    stress theory and von-Mises stress theory.


    The study concluded that the proposed drill bit design has the potential to improve
    the surgical procedure of preparing osteotomy sites for implant placement. The
    parabolic cutting edge design was shown to reduce the risk of thermal necrosis
    and improve bone-implant contact, which could lead to better implant stability
    and longevity.'

    bone plates, hip implants, knee implants, etc., are usually fixed to the bone
    using screws, whereas dental implants are set directly into the bone. In both
    cases, screws, and dental implants, the primary implant stability (PIS) is achieved
    by threads provided on the surface [[1], [2], [3], [4]]. In contrast, secondary
    implant stability (SIS) is attained when sufficient osseointegration is achieved
    [1,[4], [5], [6]]. PIS and SIS depend on tissue health and excellent bone-implant
    contact (BIC) at the interface. Sufficient osseointegration can be achieved using
    excellent BIC [7]. Moreover, several studies suggest that the implants/screws
    with circular/parabolic cross-section areas can achieve excellent implant stability
    at the apical region instead of flat cross-sections [8]. PIS is essential to provide
    adequate time to attain contact or distance osteogenesis [[9], [10], [11]]; however,
    micro motions and inferior bone implants may delay the healing process [1]. Successful
    implantation necessitates a surgical procedure to prepare an osteotomy site analogous
    to the implant geometry. The osteotomy site preparation for dental implants and
    screws requires a drilling operation wherein the native tissues are sheared off
    from the bone to create a hole [12,13]. However, the commercially available drilling
    tools have cone angles and straight cutting edges (Fig. 5(a) and (c)) that lead
    to the formation of the conical cross-section at the apical region [12]. Due to
    the conical cross-section at the apical region, implants/screws with both flat
    and parabolic/circular cross-sections show a void space between bone and implant
    at the apical region (Fig. 1(a)). This particular void affects the BIC, thereby
    implant stability at the apical region [8,14]. Furthermore, depending on bone
    mineral density, excessive shearing, and frictional forces during the material
    removal process generate excessive heat during osteotomy site preparation [13,[15],
    [16], [17], [18]]. Excessive heat generation is responsible for local tissue necrosis,
    possibly leading to thermal necrosis [19]. Up to 95% of the energy generated is
    dissipated in the 5-μm thickness of the contacting bodies [20,21]. The bone tissues/cells
    of 5-μm thickness are most important for contact/distance osteogenesis [[9], [10],
    [11]] and osseointegration. Prevention of thermal necrosis in the contact tissue
    layer at the implant-tissue interface would be a priority towards favoring osseointegration.
    As a standard surgical practice, the water irrigation system is provided to minimize
    the heat generation during site preparation [17,[22], [23], [24], [25]]; however,
    an irrigation system is responsible for removing bone chips and osseous coagulum,
    which may help to accelerate osseointegration [25,26]. Preparing an osteotomy
    site analogous to screw/dental implant geometry is crucial to attaining excellent
    implant stability and a lower implant rejection rate. Hence, it is essential to
    develop a tool geometry that may create a parabolic cross-section at the close
    end of the osteotomy site and reduce the effect of thermal necrosis. As a consequence,
    the proposed study may promote both contact and distance osteogenesis as addresses
    both issues. Assuming the drill bit is employed for finishing operation during
    osteotomy site preparation, the mathematical approach is used to design the tool
    and associated geometrical parameters. The model is then established in MatLab
    towards optimized geometrical design with minimum force and torque requirement,
    as shown in Fig. 1(b). Further, the 3D model was designed in CATIA V5 using the
    optimized geometrical design obtained from Matlab results. The 3D designs/models
    were further evaluated for validation utilizing Ansys workbench 18.2, keeping
    the optimized force and torque as boundary conditions. Download : Download high-res

    drill bit geometry. 2. Methodology 2.1. Optimization of geometrical parameters
    The theoretical design is based on the model explained by Elhachimi et al. [27].
    They considered an oblique cutting model for cutting lip and orthogonal cutting
    models for chisel edges (Fig. 2(a)). The present model is entirely analytical
    and does not need preliminary experimental results [27]. The mathematical model
    is based on force and torque continuity; therefore, it is possible to calculate
    the force and torque as per the tool geometry [27,28]. Hence, the main cutting-edge
    geometry is modified from straight to parabolic to achieve a round/parabolic apical
    area at the osteotomy site. The proposed tool design applies to the final osteotomy
    site preparation before implantation and may be assumed to be used for finishing
    operations during bone drilling. The proposed drill bit would require a step-drilling/Predrilling/guide
    hole to prepare the osteotomy site for implantation. Predrilling eliminates the
    need for a chisel edge while drilling operations and factors such as thrust force,
    torque, friction, etc., arising from the chisel edge. Therefore, the present model
    represents the forces and torque owing to the cutting lip of the drill bit (Fig.
    2(b)). Although the present study has considered the oblique cutting model for
    cutting lip, in most studies, it is observed that bone chips formed during drilling
    operation undergo shear failure that is similar to chip formation during metal
    machining. Therefore the orthogonal cutting model is considered for heat generation
    during drilling operations [12,29]. Download : Download high-res image (431KB)

    for cutting-edge geometry; therefore, the parabolic equation can be obtained by
    considering the point angle formed by the line AB and AC. Line AB and AC are the
    tangents to the parabola at any radius (R) and at points B and C (Fig. 3(b)).

    to dF and dC (Fig. 3(c)). Further, from Fig. 3(c) and Fig. 4(a) the geometrical
    parameters of the drill bit can be calculated as [27]. (3) (4) (5) (6) Here, ω

    The incremental force and torque are modeled by assuming the cutting geometry
    is approximately static at any point P along the cutting edge [27,30]. Therefore,
    the associated inclination and rake angle at point P is given as (7) (8) Further,
    the total length of the cutting edge can be expressed as, (9) Although the cutting
    edge and flank combined to form the chisel edge, as per our predrilling hypothesis,
    we can exclude the chisel edge while predicting thrust force and torque. Therefore,
    (10) Therefore, from equation (2) and equation (10), (11) Where is a half chisel
    edge length and can be expressed as, (12) The length of differential element dl
    along the cutting edge at point P can be expressed as, (13) Further, the depth
    of cut ‘t1’ at any point P can be expressed from cutting geometry in terms of
    feed rate as, (14) The increments in differential force and torque at point P
    are modeled utilizing the oblique cutting model established by Oxley and Elhachimi
    et al. [27,31]. Following Elhachimi et al. model, the proposed mathematical model
    assumes that the resultant force transmitted by the shear plane and tool/chip
    interface is in equilibrium. Therefore, the model analyzes stress acting along
    these shear planes and over the tool/chip interface [27]. The differential element
    shear force at point P can be expressed as, (15) where, φn is a normal shear angle
    kAB is the shear flow stress of the bone. From equations (13), (14)), replacing
    the value of t1 and dl in the above equation, (16) Further, the thrust force can
    be represented in terms of its trigonometric components such that differential
    force dFC acting parallel to the cutting speed Vc, the differential force dFT
    along the direction perpendicular to the cutting speed at point P, differential
    force dFR in the direction perpendicular to both dFC and dFT [27] (Fig. 4(a) and
    (b)) [27]. The trigonometric component are acting on infinitesimally small elements
    following force and torque continuity. Hence, from the Elhachimi et al. model
    [27]; (17) (18) And (19) Where dFC is normal to the cutting edge in the plan of
    cutting edge and the cutting speed. dF’T is normal to the machined surface, and
    dF’R is normal to dF’C and dF’T. The elements of forces dFC, dFT, and dFR can
    be expressed as [27], (20) (21) And, (22) Where dFC and dFR are perpendicular
    to each other in the plane of dF’C and dF’R. The angle ‘i’ is formed between dF’C
    and dF’R. Both dFT and dF’T are alike shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b) [27]. The thrust
    force element dFl and torque dCl can be expressed in terms of the elemental force
    component acting on point P can be expressed as [27]; (23) And, (24) The total
    thrust force acting on the cutting lip can be evaluated by integrating the elemental
    thrust force over the length of the parabolic cutting edge (25) And, (26) Moreover,
    the frictional coefficient ( responsible for frictional heating can be calculated
    from, (27) where, is the normal friction angle acting over the cutting lip Further,
    as observed in most studies, bone chip formation follows a similar mechanism as
    metal chip formations. Therefore, three deformation zones, viz. primary, secondary,
    and tertiary deformation zones, can also be noticed in bone cutting/drilling operations.
    Cutting energy involved in shearing bone in the primary zone is primarily responsible
    for heat generation during drilling operations. The generated heat is decapitated
    into bone chips, and the drill bit is in the secondary zone. In the tertiary zone,
    heat generates as a result of friction between the bone and the drill bit [18,29],
    as shown in Fig. 2(c). The heat generation due to shearing and friction is well
    explained by Lee J et al. for bone drilling [16]. For calculating the heat generations,
    authors have directly adopted the method illustrated by Lee J et al. The heat
    generation due to shearing operation in the primary zone can be expressed as,
    (28) Heat generation associated with friction between the tool and the bone in
    the tertiary zone can be expressed as, (29) where, is a constant of proportionality
    and can be calculated from the model explained by Lee J et al. N is a number of
    cutting lips, τs is the flow stress here kAB, t1 is the depth of cut or uncut
    chip thickness, b is the width of cut , V is the spindle speed and can be evaluated
    using . Therefore, adding equations (28), (29)), total heat generation due to
    drilling operation can be expressed as, (30) 2.2. Development of 2D and 3D models
    The 3D CAD designs were developed using the geometrical parameters obtained from
    the mathematical model. These models are then exported into 2D (.acad) and 3D
    (.iges) formats for detailing and fabrication. Software such as AutoCAD was used
    to develop the 2D detailing, whereas CATIA V5 was used to create a 3D model (Fig.
    5(b)). The details required for the designing and developing of 2D and 3D models
    are given in Annexure I. 2.3. Static Structural Analysis Following the mathematical
    model, the static structural module for simulation was adopted to confirm the
    parameters obtained from the mathematical model. The exported 3D models were fed
    to static structural simulation with the optimized magnitude and direction of
    force, and torque was used as boundary conditions. The force and torque were applied
    on the cutting edge, whereas fixed support was given at the opposite end of the
    tool. The magnitude of force and torque are expressed in Annexure-1. The tool
    geometry has complex counters; therefore adaptive mesh type was chosen for the
    simulation. The 3D models meshed with linear four-noded tetrahedral elements with
    an aspect ratio of 1 and 3. Moreover, the non-linear material properties were
    also chosen for simulation, given that the tool material may not follow the liner
    elastic curve under the influence of cutting forces and torque [32]. Stainless
    Steel non-linear material properties for drill bit were selected for the simulation
    from Ansys standard material directory. The geometrical designs that showed promising
    results in the static structural simulations were chosen for fabrication. 2.4.
    Mesh convergence study A mesh convergence study was performed by comparing the
    results of maximum equivalent stresses in the generated 3D models of drill bits
    under a compressive load of 2–6 N distributed over the cutting edge. The adaptive
    mesh type was used in the present study (Fig. 9(d)). A drill bit with a 140° point
    angle, 15° helix angle, and 0.5 mm radius was selected for mesh convergence studies.
    Three models, A, B, and C consisting of 158,528, 192,422, and 225,305 elements,
    were considered for the study. Comparison between model A and model B revealed
    8.6% deviations in equivalent stresses, whereas the differences reduced to 3.8%
    on comparison between model B and C. Hence, model B with 192,422 elements and
    edge length varying from 0.11 to 0.2 mm was chosen for the study (Fig. 9(c)).
    2.5. Fabrication The drill bits have complex, cutting-edge geometry and must confirm
    the possibility of fabrication. Therefore, the drill bits were fabricated with
    optimized geometrical parameters. SS 316 material was used as a tool material
    (Fig. 5(d)). The tools were fabricated using exported 3D design and LMW-JV Kraft
    5-axis CNC machine at Keytex Machines in Surat, Gujarat, India. All the tools
    were compared with the existing surgical drill bits to confirm and extricate tool
    geometry. Fig. 5(a) and (b) indicate the difference between the micro CT scanned
    tools and designed tools whereas Fig. 5(c) and (d) indicate the difference between
    existing and fabricated drill bits. 3. Results The proposed design is based on
    the theory proposed by Elhachimi et al. for the cutting forces and corresponding
    torque acting on the straight cutting edges [27]. The straight cutting edges are
    responsible for the conical cross section at the apical region of the osteotomy
    site (Fig. 1, Fig. 5). Therefore, to optimize the proposed design''s geometrical
    parameters, it is essential to consider the forces and torque acting on the parabolic
    cutting edge. The geometrical parameters for existing drill bits have different
    recommended parameters for bone drilling. Therefore, the proposed design has considered
    parameters such as feed, point angle, chisel edge thickness, radius, and helix
    angle as varying parameters. In contrast, chip flow angle, chisel edge angle,
    and clearance angles are assumed to be constant and assigned a constant value
    based on the recommended parameter range [19] (Table 1(b)). Moreover, material
    property such as flow stress is essential in material removal. In the present
    study, the material is bone; therefore, the flow stress of bone has been considered
    for further calculations. Table 1. (a) Reported geometrical parameters for commercially
    available surgical drill bits (b) the constants assumed from the reported values

    geometrical parameter range, optimization requires repeated iterations, as shown
    in Fig. 6(a). Optimizing parameters such as thrust, cutting force, the torque
    required, etc., is highly concerning to avoid necrosis due to excess mechanical
    and thermal stresses. Notably, the force/torque prediction and approximations
    are dependent on drill bit geometry. The MatLab code has been developed based
    on mathematical formulations (equations (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8),
    (9), (10), (11), (12), (13), (14), (15), (16), (17), (18), (19), (20), (21), (22),
    (23), (24), (25), (26)) to avoid manual calculations and errors. The varying parameters
    acted as input parameters to the MatLab code and must be fed manually into the
    code while compiling the same. Further, each geometry has a different equation,
    leading to subsequent iterations (Fig. 6(a)). Moreover, the model calculated geometrical
    parameters such as rake angle, shear angle, friction angles, etc. The geometrical
    parameters with minimum force and torque values were chosen as an optimized design.
    The corresponding values of heat generation and thermal parameters were also calculated
    (equations (27), (28), (29), (30))) for the optimized design. These parameters
    are essential for developing 2D and 3D models for FEM analysis and fabrication.
    Further, the mesh convergence study has also been performed on the developed 3D
    models. The flow chart for design finalization is as shown in Fig. 6(b). Download

    based on the mathematical model (equations (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7),
    (8), (9), (10), (11), (12), (13), (14), (15), (16), (17), (18), (19), (20), (21),
    (22), (23), (24), (25), (26)) (Annexure-V). The inputs and constants (Table 1(b)
    and (c)) were set forth to the code, and the iterations were performed per the
    iteration strategy (Fig. 6(a)). Geometrical designs of drill bits have been selected
    and evaluated based on drill thrust force magnitude and directions acting on the
    cutting edge, comparable forces, and torque acting on the proposed models. Directions
    considered in this analysis are upward positive for thrust force and counterclockwise
    positive for torque. Moreover, the code was developed assuming the Chip flow angle,
    clearance angle, and chisel edge angle as 11°, 18°, and 125°, respectively, (Table
    1(b)). Also, the bone flow stress was assumed to be 51.6 N/mm (Table 1(a)). Notably,
    geometrical parameters such as a rake, shear, and friction angles were also considered
    while selecting the optimized drill bit (Fig. 3, Fig. 4). All these geometrical
    parameters were used to develop the 3D model using CAD. Twenty-three promising
    design combinations were finalized based on selection criteria as shown in Fig.
    7(a)–(d), and Fig. 7(e)), (Annexure-III). With the proposed model, the force required
    is in the range of 0.13–10.3 N, whereas the torque was 6.34–155.8 N-mm. The obtained
    force and torque are less than the reported values ranging from 1.5 N to 117 N.
    Further, the rake angle and friction angle found were to be 12.53°–21.9° and 22.75°–25.44°,
    respectively, whereas the reported rake angle for bone drilling ranges from 20°
    to 30° and friction angle falls in the range of 33°–36.83° [19]. Moreover, the
    frictional coefficient responsible for frictional heating falls in the range of
    0.421–0.445. The shear and friction forces acting in the primary and tertiary
    zone, respectively, are responsible for heat generation during bone drilling [14].
    The combined effect of shear and friction heating was found to be 28.78%–30.87%

    and 225,305 elements were considered for the study. (d) Proximity and curvature
    meshing were used for meshing the drill bit. 3.2. Static structural FEM analysis
    The mathematical model is best suitable for the prediction of cutting forces and
    torque acting on the drill bit without the requirement of preliminary experimental
    results. However, in actual practice, the model does not explain the drill bit
    as a whole. Therefore, it is essential to validate the results of the mathematical
    model in virtual 3D geometry. To evaluate the effect of force and torque acting
    on the cutting edge as well as on the complete drill bit, the FEM technique was
    adopted. FEM simulations were executed by considering SS Non-linear material [32]
    with the loading conditions shown in Fig. 9(a), (b), and Table 2. Adaptive mesh
    type was adopted for simulation (Fig. 9(d)). Since the mathematical model is assumed
    to be in the statistical condition, performing FEM analysis with similar parameters
    and conditions is essential. The static structural model was used to simulate
    all twenty-three designs, and it was found that only three designs out of twenty-three
    are within the stress limits (Fig. 7(f)–(i), and Figs. 7(j)), and Fig. 8) (Annexure
    III, IV). The designs were finalized considering the maximum principle stress
    theory as well as the von-Mises stress theory. Based on our results, it is found
    that most of the designs are safe as per the maximum-principle stress theory;
    however, very few designs were found to be safe under von-Mises theory. These
    results were also expected while finalizing the designs as per the failure theory.

    for a conical cross section at the close end of the osteotomy site due to the
    conical point formed by the straight cutting edge and the flanks (Fig. 5(c)).
    Pawan S. et al. reported that the close contact between the implant and bone bed
    improves osseointegration, thereby, secondary implant stability (SIS). Furthermore,
    a round apical bone-implant contact influences implant stability or SIS, as reported
    by Fanali et al. and Gehrke et al. [8,14]. A void can be observed between the
    implant apical area and a close end of the osteotomy site leading to lower BIC
    due to conical cross-section (Fig. 1(a)). Therefore, preparing an implant/screw
    analogous osteotomy site is essential to achieve excellent SIS. This approach
    may result in excellent BIC at the osteotomy site close end and help minimize
    micromotions, thereby improving secondary implant stability (SIS). To improve
    BIC and SIS, the drill bit geometry, especially the cutting edge, has been modified
    from straight to parabolic. In doing so, the conical cross-section is transformed
    into a parabolic cross-section at the close end of the osteotomy site. Further,
    as observed in most studies, bone chip formation follows a similar mechanism as
    metal chip formations. Therefore, three deformation zones, viz. primary, secondary,
    and tertiary deformation zones, can also be noticed in bone cutting/drilling operations.
    Cutting energy involved in shearing bone in the primary zone is primarily responsible
    for heat generation during drilling operations. The generated heat is decapitated
    into bone chips, and the drill bit is in the secondary zone. In the tertiary zone,
    heat causes due to friction between the bone and the drill bit [18,29], as shown
    in Fig. 2(c). Heat generation during drilling operations is reportedly responsible
    for local tissue apoptosis or necrosis [19,[33], [34], [35]]. However, heat generation
    and necrosis can be reduced up to a certain limit by providing irrigation while
    drilling [15,17,18,[22], [23], [24], [25],36,37]. Although irrigation prevents
    thermal necrosis, it removes osseous coagulum and osteotomy autologous bone debris
    [25,26]. Retention of osteogenic matter during drilling becomes more important
    for patients with age or trauma-related complaints. The mathematical model has
    been developed to attain the bone-implant close fit and lower thermal necrosis.
    The proposed model reports modified geometrical parameters for the drill bit with
    a parabolic cutting edge. In addition, it is designed for final osteotomy site
    preparation prior to implant/screw placement. Several iterations have been performed
    on the developed mathematical model considering feed, point angle, chisel edge
    thickness, helix angle, and drill radius resulting in possible geometrical parameters
    such as rake angle, friction angle, maximum thrust force, and maximum torque (Fig.
    7(a)–(d), and Fig. 7(e)). The rake angle influences the cutting forces acting
    on the drill bit and directly correlates with the same. Moreover, an increase
    in thrust force and rake angle can be witnessed with an increase in drill bit
    radius (Fig. 7(a)–(d), and Fig. 7(e)). Saha et al. pointed out that substantial
    point and helix angles are responsible for positive rake angles along the cutting
    lip, which help increase drill bit effectiveness [35]. Furthermore, a decrease
    in principal cutting forces was observed by Jacob et al. irrespective of bone
    osteon arrangement with a positive rake angle [29]. The rake angle, maximum force,
    and torque are in the range of 12.53°–21.9°, 0.13–10.3 N, and 6.34–155.84 N-mm,
    respectively. In comparison, the previous studies reported that the recommended
    rake angle and corresponding force are in the range of 20°–30° and 1.5–117.6 N,
    respectively [19](Table 1(a)). The lower magnitude of cutting forces is evident
    from the positive rake angle over the cutting lip, as obtained from the mathematical
    model. Furthermore, the magnitude of force indicates that the torque required
    for drilling also falls in the lower range. The energy needed for drilling is
    affected by the rake angle, which is responsible for reducing specific drilling
    energy, improving chip flow, and promoting cutting operation [19,35,38]. This
    enables the use of low-torque drilling machines compared to the existing ones.
    Besides, lightweight and low torque drilling machines will significantly reduce
    the human efforts required for handling machines and increase the surgeon’s efficiency.
    The heat generation in the cutting process is primarily caused due to shearing
    of native tissues and friction between the tool and bone [39,40]. The temperature
    generation above the threshold (45 °C–55 °C) leads to necrosis [19,35]. Moreover,
    the specific cutting energy is primarily responsible for temperature generation
    while drilling. In addition, specific cutting energy depends on the bone’s dynamic
    shear strength. The optimum geometrical parameters, such as shear and rake angles,
    reduce specific cutting energy [35] that may otherwise lead to thermal necrosis
    [41]. Further, the shear angle was also found to be in the range of 29.3°–31.05°
    which is significantly lower than the recommended range of 37°–60° for bone drilling
    [31,42,43]. However, the shear angle is proportional to the rake angle, which
    signifies that the lower the magnitude of the rake angle lower is the shear angle.
    Furthermore, the heat generation due to the shearing at the primary deformation
    zone is directly related to the cosine of the rake angle, indicating higher the
    rake angle, the lower the heat generation will be. Whereas, in the case of friction
    heat generation, a product of the sine of the rake and the sine of the friction
    angle is directly related to frictional heat generation, indicating that the rake
    and friction angle should be minimum. This also signifies that the lower the rake
    and friction angle, the less frictional heat generation is. Notably, the higher
    rake angle is required for lesser heat generation due to shearing, while on the
    contrary the lower rake angle is necessary for less heat generation due to frictional
    heating. Therefore optimized rake angle with a minimum friction angle is required
    to avoid thermal necrosis [18]. The friction angle at the secondary shear zone
    was found to be in the range of 22.75°–25.44°. Additionally, the friction coefficient
    was calculated to be in the range of 0.421–0.445 and is considered constant throughout
    the cutting process. However, in several studies, the friction coefficient was
    assumed to be 0.644–0.75 [13,18], higher than the proposed model. The effect of
    friction heat generation associated with the friction coefficient and friction
    forces, and shear heating associated with a rake and shear angle [18,30,31,43]
    might be 28.78%–30.87% less than the existing drill bits (Fig. 8(f) and (g)).
    The combined effect of rake angle, shear angle, and friction angle on the force,
    torque, and heat generation can be observed to be significantly lower as compared
    to the reported values for bone drilling (Fig. 8(a)–(e)) and Table 2). The heat
    generated due to friction and shearing forces is carried out by bone debris, blood,
    osseous coagulum, and water [19]. The excessive heat may also cause apoptosis
    to the bone chips and osseous coagulum, which may help in SIS and bone regeneration.
    The clogging stops heat transfer between bone and tool, leading to necrosis at
    BIC [35]. A higher helix angle is usually preferred for faster chip removal and
    avoiding chip clogging. Besides, the helix angle and point angle greatly influence
    the rake angle, indicating the dependence of specific cutting efficiency on the
    helix and point angle [35]. Experimental findings of Jacob et al. suggest that
    the 110° point angle produces less thrust and torque [29]. Notably, the current
    model has shown possible designs for 110°, 120°, 130° and 140° of point angle.
    However, a 90° point angle is ideal for surgical drills and 130°–140° for cortical
    bone drilling, whereas drills bits with a 120°–140° point angle are optimized
    for the thrust and torque required for drilling [19,29,35]. The helix angle of
    13°–35° is preferred for bone drilling [19,35]. However, a 28°-helix angle requires
    less torque and generates lower heat energy [19]. The mathematical model shows
    that most 15°–20° helix angle designs suit the proposed drill bit design. It can
    be observed from the mathematical model that the required torque and thrust for
    drilling with a 140° point angle decreased with an increase in the helix angle
    (as shown in Fig. 7(d) and 7(e) and Annexure-II). Similar observations were also
    made out by Saha et al. Notably, the proposed model also shows a lower frictional
    coefficient, lower thrust, and torque requirements, which might lead to lower
    heat generation. Furthermore, the proposed model has a lower helix angle that
    may retain osseous coagulum and bone debris at the osteotomy site, promoting faster
    osseointegration [25,26]. These additional advantages could help in avoiding irrigation
    systems during surgery. So far, few of the experimental models have shown optimized
    drilling torque and axial drilling force. However, most experimental investigations
    suggest high speed with larger force or greater feed rate for minimum temperature
    generation in bone drilling [19,35]. The mathematical model considers only a static
    force system, and performing design validation studies under similar conditions
    are essential. Therefore, similar to the mathematical model, the magnitude and
    direction of force and torque were considered as boundary conditions for the FEM
    Analysis (Fig. 9(a) and (b)). In contrast, the material considered in the simulation
    is stainless steel non-linear (Table 2). Moreover, mesh convergence studies were
    also performed on the designs. Based on mesh convergence studies, the best mesh
    size for each design was selected to perform FEM analysis. Any accepted design
    must be within the material''s yield limit. von Mises stresses are obtained from
    the stress exerted on the object under investigation (herein, cutting edge and
    whole drill bit). In contrast, the maximum principle stresses are the consequence
    of uniaxial loading acting around the loading site (herein cutting edge). Therefore
    it is essential to consider both theories for selecting the tool design. The designs
    were finalized considering the maximum principle stress theory as well as von
    –Mises stress theory. In the proposed study, most of the designs are found to
    be safe in maximum principle stress theory, indicating the drill bit, mainly the
    cutting edge, is safe to operate and may not get blunt easily. However, few of
    the designs show safe under the von – Mises theory, indicating that the design
    is safe to operate under the loading conditions [44]. Comparing maximum principle
    stress and von Mises stress values in Annexure-III and Fig. 7(f)–(i) and Fig.
    7(j)), only three out of twenty-three designs are found to be in the yield limit
    of the drill bit material as shown in Fig. 10(a) 110_15_2, (b) 150_20_2.5, and
    (c) 140_20_2.5. The deformation in the drill bits was evaluated in the 10−5 m
    range and can be neglected in the present context. Download : Download high-res

    (Point angle_ Helix angle_ Drill radius). The study, however, has certain limitations.
    The mathematical model is limited to 2D geometry, particularly cutting-edge profiles.
    However, the mathematical model does not explain the combined effect of force
    and torque acting on the whole drill bit. Therefore, based on results obtained
    from mathematical modeling, static structural FEM analysis has been performed
    on the proposed drill design. Nevertheless, quasistatic and dynamic simulations
    may be explored in the future. 5. Conclusion The mathematical model and static
    structural FEM analysis were implemented to finalize the drill bit design. Twenty-three
    drill bit designs have shown promising results in the mathematical model. However,
    the static structural FEM analysis shows that three designs were found to be safe
    under similar loading conditions. Moreover, heat generation during the drilling
    process was also calculated for all twenty-three designs. It was found that the
    point angle plays an important role in heat generation. An increase in point angle
    reduces the total heat generation during the drilling operation. Thus, higher
    point angle drill bits are desirable for reducing thermal necrosis. Notably, all
    three drill bits fall in the range of the frequently used implant/screw diameters.
    Therefore, these bits could be implemented in the existing surgical procedures.

    Abstract Most studies of open canal automation concentrated on the control of
    single canal pool or cascaded multiple canal pools, neglecting the hydraulic coupling
    effects between the main canal and lateral canals. Low transmission efficiency
    and poor equity of agriculture water delivery may be caused in the practical application
    of large-scale irrigation networks. Considering the high computation and communication
    requirements for large-scale operating systems, a distributed model predictive
    control (DMPC) algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers
    (ADMM) is developed for the branching open canal irrigation systems (BOCISs).
    A simplified BOCIS example, originating from Test case 2 proposed by the American
    Society of Civil Engineers, is used for control tests. Moreover, for control performance
    comparisons and evaluations, centralized model predictive control (CMPC) is employed
    by modifying the state space of the integrator delay (ID) model. The results show
    that the control performance of the proposed DMPC converges to the global optimal
    solution of the CMPC under the normal scenario, and the degradation is less than
    0.35 %. The communication and coordination process of DMPC contributes to more
    powerful robustness and interference immunity than CMPC. Furthermore, in case
    of sudden accidents occurring in some subsystems, the proposed DMPC is more convenient
    and timely to execute fault isolation. The improvements on water level oscillations
    and overshoots can reach 20.3 % and 52.1 % in the other subsystems which need
    normal water delivery, respectively. Equipped with outstanding control characteristics,
    the proposed ADMM-based DMPC framework enables the water authorities of large-scale

    of multipliers 1. Introduction Compared with backward manual operation methods,
    canal automation technologies represent a more water-saving and efficient alternative
    for the management of open canal systems (OCSs) (Avargani et al., 2022, Lozano
    et al., 2010, Sadowska et al., 2015, Schuurmans et al., 1995, Wahlin and Clemmens,
    2006). Therefore, the last decades have witnessed a continuous generation of contributions
    in this field, but most concentrated on the control of single canal pool or cascaded
    multiple canal pools with no branches (Conde et al., 2021). From a practical point
    of view, the OCSs are always based on a network of multilevel canals with a tree
    topology, like the main, secondary, tertiary, or even more branching canals in
    the hierarchy. Just as individual pools interact with each other in an in-line
    cascaded canal system, individual branches can interact with each other (Wahlin
    and Clemmens, 2006). An improper automatic control system may cause severe oscillations
    of water level or gate movements. Ultimately, the surface water failed to be conveyed
    with high efficiency and equity from the water sources to the customers or farms
    along the multilevel canals. With the development of canal automation, the control
    of branching open canal networks gets more and more attention in the areas of
    inland waterways (Segovia et al., 2019), hydro-power valleys (Maestre et al.,
    2015), polder systems (Aydin et al., 2022), natural river network (Breckpot et
    al., 2013), and others. Notwithstanding, few studies consider the automatic control
    of branching open canal irrigation systems (BOCISs). Elfawal-Mansour et al. (2000)
    used a nonlinear black box model NARX for the control of the Canal de la Bourne,
    a real branching canal system in France that served for irrigation and electricity
    generation. By modifying the Integrator Delay (ID) model, Wahlin and Clemmens
    (2006) developed two centralized controllers of the linear quadratic regulator
    (LQR) and model predictive control (MPC), respectively. Results showed that both
    were able to bring the water level back to the setpoints in a branching canal
    network. Tariq et al. (2012) implemented a cyber-physical system towards the decentralized
    control of real irrigation canal networks in Pakistan, by which a slow response
    speed and risky water level fluctuation resulted. Alvarez et al. (2013) combined
    local controllers with distributed generalized predictive controllers for a Y-shaped
    irrigate canal, but only the head gate of the branch, not all check gates along
    the branch canal, is controlled. Sutrisno et al. (2012) and Zhang et al. (2015)
    proposed distributed model predictive controllers based on Game Theory and Nash
    Optimality, respectively. The former neglected the large delay of the flow and
    only tested a simple water level tracking scenario, while the latter restricted
    the direction of information transferring only from downstream to upstream. Xu
    and Schwanenberg (2017) applied nonlinear MPC with a diffusive wave model to a
    virtual drainage canal network, and achieved a satisfactory outcome with a reasonable
    computation time, though the global optimum was not guaranteed. Nowadays, with
    population growth and the modernization of irrigation districts, the size and
    complexity of the BOCISs have grown enormously. For the control of large-scale
    BOCISs, MPC with distributed control architecture is regarded as a promising control
    scheme (Kordestani et al., 2021). MPC is a control strategy that gets the highest
    attention for agriculture water management (Conde et al., 2021). It is given the
    credit to the versatile abilities to consider constraints in optimization, and
    the possibility of taking into account measurable disturbances (Overloop, 2006).
    The most classical control architecture of MPC is the centralized architecture,
    where systemwide measurements are gathered and a globally optimal solution is
    calculated. However, the huge size and wide geographic distribution of the large-scale
    BOCISs would lead to expensive communication costs and unbearable computing burdens
    (Maestre and Negenborn, 2013, Shi et al., 2021, Tang and Daoutidis, 2019). Simultaneously,
    the communication network-induced issues and the potential concerns of privacy
    and security problems are also unavoidable obstructions to the practical applications
    of centralized MPC (CMPC) (Tang and Daoutidis, 2019). The decentralized control
    architecture is a good choice for its low communication and computational requirements.
    But the neglect of the strong hydraulic interactions among individual pools and
    individual branches would lead to the phenomenon of disturbance amplification
    and poor control performance (Alvarez et al., 2013, Wahlin and Clemmens, 2006).
    In this case, distributed MPC (DMPC) works toward combing the advantages of the
    above two control architectures, though compared with the CMPC, there is some
    performance loss due to the partial knowledge of the entire system (Kordestani
    et al., 2021, Tang and Daoutidis, 2019, Tian, 2015). Specifically, in the DMPC,
    the large-scale system is decomposed into several interconnected subsystems. Then,
    a computing agent (or local controller) is associated with each subsystem and
    makes control decisions, like the decentralized MPC. The distinction between decentralized
    and distributed MPC lies in whether or not the information is exchanged actively
    between the adjacent agents to coordinate their decisions for a consensus, even
    in the case of conflicting goals. The modularization nature of DMPC contributes
    to its high scalability, which is one of the critical characteristics for the
    flexible control of large-scale BOCISs. Furthermore, different subsystems can
    consider diverse control objects and constraints, which distinguishes the DMPC
    from CMPC. In this way, in arid regions or water-deficit scenarios, the limited
    water can be delivered with various attitudes to different subsystems according
    to their water supply objects or crop species, so that better social, irrigation,
    energy, and economic benefits could be achieved. More detailed comparisons between
    different control architectures can be found in the Appendix. Over the last years,
    there has been a growing interest in DMPC for the control of many large-scale
    systems, like smart grids (Shi et al., 2021), waterborne vessels (Zheng et al.,
    2018), water systems (Maestre et al., 2021), traffic control (Li et al., 2020),
    and others. Nevertheless, no single generally accepted distributed algorithm has
    been proposed due to the complexities of various control objects (Maestre and
    Negenborn, 2013). It has been argued that the alternating direction method of
    multipliers (ADMM) is a particularly powerful distributed algorithm blending the
    strong decomposability of the dual ascent method with the excellent convergence
    property of the augmented Lagrange multiplier method (Ghadimi et al., 2015, Li
    et al., 2020, Teixeira et al., 2016). The most attractive feature of ADMM is that
    it is surprisingly guaranteed to converge for all positive values of the step-size
    parameter (Bai et al., 2021). This contrasts many popular distributed algorithms,
    such as dual decomposition methods (Teixeira et al., 2016) and gradient methods
    (Ghadimi et al., 2015), where mistuning of the step size can render the iterations
    unstable. Compared with the distributed techniques based on game theory, whose
    results correspond to a Nash equilibrium, the ADMM yields tighter approximations
    to the overall optimization (Lemos and Pinto, 2012). Moreover, it is recently
    investigated that the powerful ADMM performs outstandingly in dealing with the
    issues of reconfiguration control (Bai et al., 2021), whereby the scalability
    and the plug-and-play functionality are demonstrated. To the best of the authors’
    knowledge, the ADMM algorithm is rarely reported for canal automation studies
    to date. So there are obvious difficulties in coding the complicated communication
    and coordination process of ADMM compared with the relatively mature centralized
    or decentralized control technologies. The main contribution of this paper is
    innovatively providing a reliable and flexible control operating system for the
    BOCISs by ADMM-based DMPC scheme. This work makes it possible to convey the water
    automatically from the water source to the users or farms at the last level canal,
    whereby higher efficiency and equity of water delivery can be guaranteed. Meanwhile,
    the proposed control framework is also vital for the future of intelligent irrigation
    systems, where the stored water in the water source and canal network can be delivered
    timely to the farmlands according to the real-time prediction of irrigation water
    requirements (Avargani et al., 2022). Accordingly, the present study is meaningful
    for precise irrigation and the sustainable development of agricultural water.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the design principles
    of the ADMM-based DMPC controller. The study case and test scenarios are also
    introduced. Section 3 analyses the simulation results, followed by the discussion
    in Section 4. Finally, some concluding remarks are drawn in Section 5. 2. Materials
    and methods 2.1. Model predictive control Model predictive control (MPC) refers
    to a family of control methods that explicitly use a process model of the real
    system to obtain the control actions by minimizing an objective function (Overloop,
    2006). The process model is used to predict the evolution of the system, for which
    the ID model, proposed by Schuurmans et al. (1995) for open canals, is one of
    the most reported. The canal is assumed to be divided into two parts: i) a normal
    depth section with a uniform flow, and ii) a backwater section with an inflow
    delay. Delay time of inflow (τ in min) and average storage area (As in m2) are
    two main model properties, as shown in Eq.(1). (1) where e(t) is the water level
    deviation at the downstream end of the canal pool, m; q1(t-τ) is the inflow deviation
    to the backwater with delay time τ, m3/s; q2(t) is the downstream outflow deviation,
    m3/s; d(t) is the offtake flow deviation according to the irrigation schedule,
    m3/s. The deviation means the difference between the instantaneous value and the
    initial steady-state value. Based on the process model in discrete time, a state
    space is constructed to forecast the system dynamics over the prediction horizon,
    see Eq.(2). x(k+1) = A x(k)+Bu u(k)+Bd d(k) (2) y(k) = C x(k) where x(k) represents
    the system states at control step k; A is the system matrix; Bu is the control
    input matrix; Bd is the known disturbance input matrix; C is the output matrix;
    u(k) is the input vector calculated by the controller, i.e. the control commands
    for gates flow regulation; d(k) is the disturbance vector, i.e. the schedule of
    offtake flow changes; y(k) is the output vector, i.e. the water level deviation
    from setpoint at the downstream end of each canal pool. Then, the objective function
    J, see Eq. (3), can be minimized to obtain optimal control actions. This optimization
    problem is subject to the constraints of water level limitations and flow capacities.
    Once the sequence of future control actions is determined, only the first step
    is implemented. Then the system is updated and the prediction and optimization
    processes are repeated at the next control step. (3) where p and m represent the
    prediction horizon and control horizon, respectively; Q and R are the weight matrixes
    for a trade-off between minimizing the water level deviations and minimizing flow
    changes. The BOCISs are complex systems with large time delays, high hydraulic
    interactions, intermittent demands, disturbances, and multiple inputs and outputs.
    MPC is an outstanding control alternative for its versatility, but only under
    suitable control architecture can achieve high regulation accuracy with implementability
    (Kordestani et al., 2021). More details are shown in Fig. 1 and Appendix. In this
    paper, CMPC and DMPC are compared for the control of the BOCISs. Download : Download

    Alternating direction method of multipliers ADMM was first proposed by Gabay and
    Mercier (1976) for solving elliptic and parabolic partial difference equations.
    But it did not receive much attention until Stephen et al. (2011) made a review
    and proved that ADMM is well-suited for solving large-scale convex optimization
    problems in a distributed manner. The designed distributed controller in this
    paper is based on the ADMM. After system decomposition, the dynamics of subsystem
    i are described by: xi(k+1) = Ai xi(k)+Bu,i ui(k)+Bd,i di(k) (4) yi(k) = Ci xi
    (k) where i is the index of subsystems, , is the set of all subsystems; xi, yi,
    ui, di are the system state, output vector, input vector, and disturbance vector
    of the subsystem i; Ai, Bu,i, Bd,i, Ci are the system matrix, control input matrix,
    known disturbance input matrix, and output matrix of subsystem i. The subsystem
    i is coupled to the neighboring subsystem with the constraint: (5) where is the
    neighbors set connected to subsystem i; Eij and Eji are coupled weight matrices,
    indicating that the impacts of subsystem i on subsystem j are supposed to be equal
    to the impacts of subsystem j on subsystem i. Each agent only knows its own dynamics
    and cost function, and the local quadratic programming problem is given: (6) Where
    consists of all the coupling information passed to subsystem i from all neighboring
    agents; nij is the number of subsystems coupled to subsystem i; . Then the augmented
    Lagrangian function based on Eq.(6) is presented: (7) Where λi is the dual variable,
    ρ is the step size of the ADMM. It is convenient to use scaled dual variable ,
    which yields the iterations: (8) (9) (10) Each agent is responsible for minimizing
    Eq.(7) to obtain its own control signal under current coupled information by solving
    Eq. (8), in which k is the index of iteration times. Then and the scaled dual
    variable in the next iteration are updated by Eq.(9) and Eq.(10), respectively.
    Afterward, the updated is communicated to its neighbors and new coupled information
    is received from its neighbors. This iterative process repeats until the following
    stopping criterion is reached: (11) where σ is the tolerance for consensus judgment,
    set as 10−3. For a clearer introduction, the decision-making process of the distributed
    control algorithm is generalized as follows: Step 1: When the distributed controller
    module is called, the measurements in each subsystem are transported to the corresponding
    computing agent. Step 2: Based on the state space model of subsystem (Eq. (4)),
    the local quadratic programming problem (Eq. (6)) is solved with coupling information
    from neighboring agents. Step 3: Neighboring agents communicate to judge the convergence
    criterion (Eq. (11)). Step 4: Coupling information is transferred between neighboring
    agents. Step 5: Return to Step 2 until the convergence and consensus. Above steps
    are done in parallel by each agent. Step 2 to Step 4 are carried out by the ADMM,
    see Fig. 2. Download : Download high-res image (170KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Flow diagram of distributed algorithm based on the Alternating Direction
    Method of Multipliers. One advantage of the basic ADMM algorithm is that there
    is only one algorithm parameter ρ, and the method can be shown to converge for
    all positive values of ρ. However, ρ has a direct impact on the convergence speed
    of the algorithm. The calculation method proposed by Ghadimi et al. (2015) for
    the optimal ρ is employed. Ultimately, according to the categorization criteria
    (Maestre and Negenborn, 2013), a non-cooperative and iterative distributed model
    predictive controller is designed with parallel computation and synchronous communication.
    The non-cooperative attitude means that each agent only considers its local interests,
    rather than a global performance. Although some systemwide welfare may be sacrificed
    in this control attitude, less algorithm complexity and better scalability are
    guaranteed (Bai et al., 2021). 2.3. Study area In general, the gentler the bed
    slope of the canal, the stronger the coupling effects among individual pools and
    individual branches may be. Hence, controllers are performed on the branched version
    of Test canal 2, a typical test canal with a very gentle bed slope, proposed by
    the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) (Clemmens et al., 1998), see Fig.
    3. Because there are offtake changes both at the Pool 5 and Pool 6 in this test
    case, it is assumed that there are two branches that occur at the downstream end
    of Pool 5 and Pool 6, respectively. Each branch contains two canal pools, which
    have the same physical sizes as Pool 7 and Pool 8. More details about the branching
    canal network are presented in Table 1, in which the properties of the ID model
    for each canal pool are estimated by the parameter identification method (Zhong,
    2016). Download : Download high-res image (1007KB) Download : Download full-size

    0.02 2000 5 1.5 1.7 7 1.74 × 104 1 5.90 × 10−3 According to the engineering experience,
    the farmers or ditch riders always manipulated the gravity-based offtake gate
    according to the predefined gate opening-flow curve and water schedule. This operation
    implies the assumption that the water level at the downstream end of each canal
    pool is stable. And this is why keeping the distant downstream water level at
    setpoint as much as possible is always the control objective (Wahlin and Clemmens,
    2006). The availability of a real system for control tests is often unusual. In
    order to perform more rigorous control tests, one alternative could be modelling
    the system with the Saint Venant equations (SVEs), which are widely accepted as
    a fairly accurate representation of physical reality. In the paper, the canal
    control simulation platform SCCS (Wang and Guan, 2011) installed on a 2.80 GHz
    Intel Xeon machine with 16 GB of ram running Windows 10 is used, on which the
    SVEs are resolved with the Preissmann four-point implicit difference scheme. The
    SCCS can simulate the hydraulic behavior of most irrigation canals, under steady
    or unsteady flow conditions, and has been applied and verified by previous studies
    (Liu et al., 2013, Zhong et al., 2020, Zhu et al., 2020). Including the heading
    gates of the two lateral canals, all check gates are formulated by Eq.(12) (Yeh
    et al., 1980) to calculate the flow rate of radial gates. Meanwhile, all gravity
    offtakes are governed by the sluice free flow formula during the unsteady flow
    process, see Eq.(13) (Li, 2006). In addition, the unsteady flow simulation is
    carried out with the computation time step Dt= 1 min. (12) (13) Where Q is the
    gate discharge, m3/s; Cd and μ are discharge coefficients; g is the acceleration
    of gravity, m/s2; E is the gate opening, m; B is the gate width, m; Hu and Hd
    are the upstream and downstream water depth of the gate, m; Au is the cross-sectional
    area of water upstream the gate, m2. 2.4. Controllers design On-demand operating
    method is used in this study, which provides high flexibility for the irrigation
    requirements and is suitable for the concept of online canal automation control.
    To design appropriate controllers for the BOCISs, centralized and distributed
    control architectures are adopted, respectively. Referring to (Wahlin and Clemmens,
    2006), the CMPC controller is designed by modifying the state-space model, meaning
    that the offtake term is added or removed from the ID model of individual canal
    pool according to the network system structure. Care must be taken to assure that
    the hydraulics of every subsystem is properly described. Once the system structure
    is changed, the whole tedious modeling process needs to be redone. In contrast,
    the DMPC controller is much more flexible. The entire system is decomposed into
    three subsystems: the main canal, the first lateral canal, and the second lateral
    canal, see Fig. 3. Each subsystem is associated with a computing agent for local
    optimization. Agent 1 and Agent 2 are coupled by the discharge of the head gate
    of the first lateral canal while Agent 1 and Agent 3 are coupled by the discharge
    of the head gate of the second lateral canal. In other words, the head gate discharge
    of the lateral canal is supposed to be the offtake flow of the corresponding main
    canal pool. The basic controller configurations for the CMPC and DMPC controllers
    are the same. The sampling period Ts, which is also the control time interval,
    is set to 15 min. In the objective function, Eq.(3) or Eq.(6), the engineering
    tuning method of Q and R proposed by Zhong et al. (2020) is adopted since the
    objection functions of MPC and LQR are similar. Moreover, p and m are both set
    as 96 by trial-and-error, meaning that the prediction horizon and control horizon
    both are 24 h long. For removing the complex gate hydraulics for the control system,
    a master-slave control scheme is implemented. The master control refers to the
    DMPC or CMPC, in which every check gate is commanded to reach a new target flow
    every 15 min. The slave control refers to the local flow controller, manipulating
    the gate per 5 min to deliver the desired flow according to real-time hydraulic
    state. 2.5. Test scenarios Three test scenarios are set to compare the response
    capacities and control performance of CMPC and DMPC for the comprehensive evaluation
    of the designed controllers. Permanent flow exists in the main canal and the two
    lateral canals, except for the accident scenario, where the first lateral canal
    is closed for fault isolation. 2.5.1. Normal scenario Referring to the Test 2–1
    proposed by ASCE, the offtakes in Pool 5–2 and Pool 6–2 begin to draw more water
    from T = 5 h to T = 6 h linearly, while each offtake in the main canal keeps the
    initial offtake flow, i.e. 1 m3/s, and the offtakes in Pool 5–1 and Pool 6–1 keep
    close overall process. More details are displayed in Table 2. This test scenario
    is used to compare the control effect and computational efficiency of both controllers.

    same initial states of the normal scenario, there is an offtake flow oscillation
    in Pool 5–2 from T = 5 h to T = 9 h, see Fig. 4, and other offtakes remain unchanged.
    Noteworthy is there is a constant limitation on the water source. In other words,
    the inflow of the main canal keeps 11 m3/s, representing a water shortage scenario
    facing downstream water demand changes. This test scenario is designed to analyze
    the impacts of the disturbance of one subsystem on the other subsystems. The water
    scarcity may aggravate the water supply contradiction and highlight the superiority
    of the proposed DMPC controller. Download : Download high-res image (134KB) Download

    gate operations in the water-deficient scenario. 2.5.3. Accident scenario With
    the same initial states of the normal scenario, there is a sudden accident in
    the first lateral canal at T = 5 h. Then all gates and offtakes in this branch
    canal need to be urgently closed for fault isolation, including the heading gate,
    i.e. the offtake gate of Pool 5. However, the main canal and the second lateral
    canal need to maintain normal operations and water delivery in this scenario.
    For the DMPC, due to its modularity, it is quick and convenient to disconnect
    the communication link between the first lateral canal and the main canal, highlighting
    the response capacities to deal with unconventional conditions. But it is much
    more complicated for the CMPC to handle the accident. For simplicity, once the
    sudden accident occurs, the fixed constraints are set for all the check gates
    in the first lateral canal to make them compulsory to close during the optimization,
    rather than redesigning the state space model of the CMPC. It is also necessary
    to revise the offtake schedules of the first lateral canal to consider the offtake
    closure. 2.6. Operational performance indicators Several control performance indicators
    are employed in the study. Firstly, a posteriori control cost Jcost (Sadowska
    et al., 2015) is used to generally appraise the off-farm management, see Eq.(14).
    The smaller Jcost is, the better the comprehensive control performance is. (14)
    where N is the number of total simulation steps; ek is the downstream water level
    deviation from setpoint, m; uk is the upstream flow change, representing the gate
    movement, m3/s. Then, PA states the adequacy of water delivery (Molden and Gates,
    1990), see Eq.(15). The bigger PA is, the more adequately the water is supplied
    to irrigate crops. (15) where Nofftake is the number of offtakes in the canal
    pool; Qd,i is the actual discharge delivered to the i-th offtake, m3/s; Qr,i is
    water demand by the i-th offtake, m3/s. In the results analysis of the water-deficient
    and accident test scenarios, CVT and Hovershoot are used to describe the degree
    of water level oscillations and overshoots during the control simulation process,
    see (16), (17). CVT is the temporal coefficient of variation of the water level
    deviation. As the value of CVT approaches zero, the water level control is becoming
    more smooth and more stable over time. (16) (17) where and are the standard deviation
    and mean value of the water level deviation , . 3. Results 3.1. Normal scenario
    The control simulation results with two control architectures are shown in Fig.
    5. Comparing the control results of the same main canal by the CMPC with that
    by MPC-B, a centralized model predictive controller proposed by Horváth et al.
    (2015), it can be seen that the water level fluctuations are similar. Both controllers
    began to work before the demand changes, and the water was stored in pool 5 and
    pool 6 in advance for future water demands, showing the superiority of the MPC
    algorithm. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download full-size

    scenario: (a) subsystem 1, the main canal; (b) subsystem 2, the first lateral
    canal; (3) subsystem 3, the second lateral canal. It is satisfying to see that
    both controllers can effectively control the branching canal system. More specifically,
    it is plotted in Fig. 5(a) that DMPC is superior to CMPC in controlling the main
    canal, except for Pool 1. The CMPC shows more aggressive features, resulting in
    greater water level deviation and oscillation. In contrast, the control results
    on the two lateral canals are the opposite, and CMPC shows better control effects.
    But on the whole, the control performances of the entire system are similar, see
    Table 3. Although the CMPC has better control results than the DMPC on Jcost and
    PA because of the full knowledge of the BOCIS, the degradation is less than 0.35
    % and can be negligible. It means that the designed DMPC controller is comparable
    to the CMPC controller proposed by Wahlin and Clemmens (2006) in control performance.

    communication and centralized optimization of CMPC contributes to better global
    control performance than DMPC. In this control architecture, the system states
    in all subsystems are closely linked. Any disturbance at any position is able
    to immediately affect all control structures to take actions. But that is also
    why the influence of local disturbance or failure is hard to be limited in just
    one subsystem. The control results of the main canal and the second lateral canal
    are presented in Fig. 6. It can be seen that the offtake disturbance in the first
    lateral canal has impacts on the other parts whether the controller is designed
    with centralized or distributed architecture. However, CMPC is much more aggressive,
    meaning that the disturbance of one subsystem has greater impacts on the neighboring
    subsystems under this control scheme. Obvious water level oscillations occurred
    in Pool 2 ∼ Pool 6, and bigger water level deviations than the DMPC are observed.
    Nonetheless, such influence could be weakened by the communication and coordination
    process of the distributed algorithms. In this way, the proposed DMPC controller
    shows powerful robustness, interference immunity, and fault tolerance. The results
    of Fig. 7(a) display that, compared with CMPC, the highest improvements on water
    level oscillations and overshoots by the DMPC can reach 36.4 % and 28.1 % for
    the adjacent subsystems, respectively. Download : Download high-res image (970KB)

    of the controllers are provided in Fig. 8. The CMPC behaved more aggressively
    than the DMPC again. Obvious water level oscillations are observed in Pool 2 ∼
    Pool 6, and bigger water level deviations resulted in Pool 6 ∼Pool 8, as well
    as the second lateral canal. Fig. 7(b) displays that the DMPC helps the improvements
    in water level oscillations and overshoots up to 20.3 % and 52.1 %, respectively.
    It means that the designed DMPC controller is more outstanding in the face of
    sudden accidents, not only being able to deal with the accidents more quickly
    and easily but also controlling the hydraulic response in adjacent subsystems
    more smoothly. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 8. Water depth response process with both controllers in the accident
    scenario: (a) subsystem 1, the main canal; (b) subsystem 3, the second lateral
    canal. Furthermore, the computing efficiency of the CMPC may be relatively low,
    though the automatic control under sudden accident scenarios is completed. The
    first lateral canal has not been removed from the state space, meaning that some
    computing resources still have to be allocated for this part during optimization.
    If the scale of the isolated subsystem is large, the unnecessary waste of computing
    resources would be considerable. Moreover, the prediction results of this subsystem
    also have some impact on the other subsystems that need proper functioning. 4.
    Discussion The results of the normal scenario show that the designed ADMM-based
    DMPC controller is comparable to the centralized controller in control performance.
    Nonetheless, there is an unexpected result that the computational efficiency of
    the CMPC is much higher than the DMPC. In this test scenario, the CMPC solves
    the optimization problem at an average rate of 1.3 s per control cycle, while
    the DMPC is 4.6 s. It is interesting and worth pondering. Similar results were
    observed by Tian (2015) and Burk et al. (2019). There are some possible explanations.
    Firstly, the scale of the current test case and the number of agents are small.
    Although a systemwide optimization problem has been divided into three smaller
    problems which were solved with parallel computing technology, the time cost required
    for the communication and coordination by the DMPC is relatively higher. By contrast,
    the global optimization of CMPC is more efficient. As the system scale increases
    and more subsystems (or agents) are taken into account, the computational requirements
    of the centralized solution would increase heavily but the computing efficiency
    of the DMPC stays approximately constant (Burk et al., 2019). Afterward, during
    the numerical experiments, the communication and coordination process is fully
    demonstrated in the distributed algorithm, but the communication network-induced
    issues that prevent the CMPC from functioning properly are hard to be considered,
    such as the communication delay and packet loss in a large-scale communication
    network. Then, the ADMM algorithm is often slower than other distributed algorithms,
    but an acceptable result can be obtained in fewer iterations (23–26 iterations
    in this study) with medium convergence precision. Lastly, the inconsistency of
    subsystem scale may lead to a decrease in computation efficiency, but it is common
    in practice. In every iteration, the small optimization problems associated with
    the lateral canals have to wait for the results of the big one of the main canal.
    The asynchronous ADMM algorithm may be a solution (Dunham et al., 2020). Fortunately,
    benefiting from the big delay nature of open canals, it is acceptable to implement
    more complex control algorithms even with moderate computing capabilities (Alvarez
    et al., 2013, Conde et al., 2021). Though DMPC takes 4.6 s to solve the optimization
    problem each control cycle, nearly 3.5 times slower than CMPC, it is still much
    less than the control interval of 15 min. In other words, the losses of control
    performance and computational speed caused by the designed DMPC controller could
    be ignored for BOCISs, and the practical applications are promisingly feasible.
    The DMPC still has greater potential advantages than the CMPC, see the Introduction
    and Appendix. The response-ability in a sudden accident is also a compelling factor
    for the comprehensive controller evaluation and a fundamental guarantee of system
    security. In this paper, a simplified method is adopted for the CMPC to implement
    fault isolation. A more common way is redesigning the controller for better control
    results. The centralized state space and the ID model structure of Pool 5 are
    modified to remove the first lateral canal. However, this method is cumbersome,
    requiring the presence of professional operators. The fault isolation may not
    be completed timely so that the accident risk of the first lateral canal is further
    increased. Moreover, the state space model needs to be modified again when the
    accident subsystem is put back into service. In contrast, it is quick and convenient
    for the DMPC to disconnect or reconnect the subsystem, highlighting the motivation
    for distributed control study. The inherent modularity nature of the distributed
    control architecture determines the scalability of the proposed DMPC framework.
    If the system construction and scale need to be changed, it is flexible to add
    or delete subsystems and communication connections. Therefore, it is easily scalable
    to a large-scale irrigation canal network with a complex tree topology, though
    the proposed distributed controller is examined on a simplified example with only
    two lateral canals. On the other hand, the operation type of the canal network
    determines the required automation level. That means the number of branches irrigated
    simultaneously, the permanent flow in the main canal, and the circulation of irrigation
    in some canals affect the controller design. In fact, the operation type changes
    over the lifecycle of the canal operation system as the actual condition changes.
    It is a big challenge for canal automation design. Decentralized control (e.g.
    the PI control) is feasible for its high flexibility but may result in poor performance,
    especially for large-scale systems. Centralized control (e.g. the CMPC) gets the
    global optimal control performance, whereas, once the operation type changes,
    the whole controller needs to be redesigned. For these reasons, the distributed
    control of the canal network has a strong practical significance and research
    value. In this way, the level of automation technology required for the canal
    network could be minimized and good control performance is guaranteed, meaning
    that control costs may be significantly reduced in the future. 5. Conclusions
    The automatic control of branching open canal irrigation systems (BOCISs) is of
    great significance for precision irrigation and sustainable development of agricultural
    water. For the first time in the study, a distributed model predictive control
    (DMPC) algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)
    is innovatively proposed for the BOCISs. It is compared with the centralized model
    predictive control (CMPC) developed by Wahlin and Clemmens (2006) on a simplified
    example. Both the CMPC and proposed DMPC were able to take actions before offtake
    changes and successfully bring the water level back. On the one hand, due to the
    full knowledge of the system, the CMPC performs better than the DMPC. But the
    degradation of the latter is less than 0.35 % under the normal scenario, showing
    that the proposed DMPC is comparable to the CMPC. On the other hand, the influence
    of the violent disturbance in one subsystem on the neighboring subsystem by CMPC
    is more aggressive than that by the proposed DMPC. With the help of the communication
    and coordination process of DMPC, the improvements in water level oscillations
    and overshoots in the adjacent system pools can reach 36.4 % and 28.1 % under
    the water-deficient scenario, respectively. In the face of a sudden accident,
    the proposed DMPC shows promising superiority in executing fault isolation over
    the CMPC. Benefiting from the outstanding modularization nature of distributed
    control architecture and the powerful scalability of the ADMM, it is more convenient
    and timely for the DMPC to disconnect the accident subsystem. The improvements
    on water level oscillations and overshoots can reach 20.3 % and 52.1 % in the
    other subsystems which need normal water delivery. For mitigating crop yield reduction
    and increasing the irrigation benefits during times of water scarcity, future
    research is required to consider the diversity of water supply objects and control
    objectives among different canal subsystems by the proposed distributed control
    framework. Acknowledgments This work was financially supported by the National

    in a variety of ways. Centralized control, decentralized control, and distributed
    control are common control architectures, and the former two are applied more
    in the literatures. Centralized control architecture In theory, CMPC can reach
    the globally optimal solution, better than the other control architectures. However,
    MPC is a technique with strong computational and communication requirements that
    hinder its successful application to large-scale OCIS in a centralized way. As
    the size and complexity of the system grow, more system states are taken into
    account inevitably. Accordingly, the size of the state space grows exponentially.
    Even though computational power has increased dramatically with the development
    of computer technologies, the optimization problem may still not be solved fast
    enough for online control. Considering systems that spread over large geographical
    areas, the communication network-induced issues are also points of attention,
    like time delay or packet loss of transmitted information, competition of multiple
    communication nodes, errors resulting from signal quantization, available bandwidth,
    and information security. Moreover, sometimes different sections of the canal
    network are managed by different control entities, who may not be timely to or
    willing to share information. The above issues lead to expensive communication
    costs and maintenance difficulties. Decentralized control architecture In a decentralized
    control architecture, only local information of the subsystem is used with no
    required communication among each local controller. Compared with CMPC, the decentralized
    MPC has the lowest computational and communication requirements with strong interference
    immunity and scalability. However, there is always a significant loss in control
    performance for the ignorance of coupling effects among interconnected subsystems.
    Every local controller takes into account the influence of neighboring subsystems
    only by responding to the dynamic changes of the local subsystem with a time delay.
    In fact, the individual local controllers are always fighting each other, even
    though they have no intention to do so. As a consequence, more hydraulic oscillations
    are generated and more energy than necessary is expended. Distributed control
    architecture The distributed control architecture is a combination of the above
    two control architecture. Compared with the CMPC, DMPC has important advantages
    that justify its application. Firstly, the computational requirements are much
    lower than CMPC because a complex problem is substituted by several smaller problems.
    The need for communication shifts from global communication to information exchange
    between locally adjacent controllers. In this way, the communication network-induced
    issues are much easier to solve and the coupling effects among different subsystems
    can also be given consideration. Benefiting from the inherent modularity of the
    DMPC, the system maintenance and the possible expansions of the control system
    are simplified. Moreover, the effect of a possible disturbance or failure on the
    overall system is weakened because of the coordination or negotiation process.
    Nevertheless, because each agent does not have a global vision of the entire system,
    the loss of control performance in comparison with the CMPC becomes the main drawback
    of the DMPC. This loss depends on the degree of interaction between the neighboring
    subsystems and the coordination mechanisms between the agents. Consequently, a
    reasonable trade-off between control performance and the cost of communication
    and coordination is pursued to reach a cooperative solution. Data availability

  key_findings: ADMM-based DMPC with distributed control architecture can effectively
    address concerns over communication delay and packet loss of transmitted information,
    competition of multiple communication nodes, errors resulting from signal quantization,
    available bandwidth, and information security that plague centralized control
    systems. The distributed architecture simplifies interconnected subsystem maintenance
    and enables the seamless integration of new subsystems in the future to simplify
    system maintenance and expansions. The proposed control framework also offers
    promising superiority in executing fault isolation over the centralized model
    predictive control and improves oscillations and overshoots in the other subsystems
    which need normal water delivery.
  limitations: The study is limited to the simulation of a simplified branching canal
    system with a small number of agents.
  main_objective: To develop a robust control strategy for real-time irrigation management
    in branching open canal irrigation systems using distributed control architecture.
  relevance_evaluation: The paper is highly relevant to my literature review on automated
    systems for real-time irrigation management. The paper specifically addresses
    the role of distributed architectures and edge computing in enhancing system resilience,
    which is one of the key points I am making in my review.

  description: Aeration drip irrigation (ADI) promotes crop growth and productivity,
    possibly by changing soil microorganisms. However, the impact of ADI on soil microbial
    communities, especially changes in the archaea community, remain unclear. We conducted
    a three-season tomato field experiment in Shouguang, China, to investigate changes
    in soil archaeal communities under three dissolved oxygen concentrations (10,
    15, and 20 mg·L–1) compared to a control (CK) treatment (no aeration). ADI increased
    α-diversity values and changed the dominant phyla and genera of archaea. In addition,
    the ADI treatments had more intra-kingdom linkages and higher edge and average
    clustering coefficients than the CK treatment, resulting in a more complex archaeal
    network. The soil C/N (organic carbon/total nitrogen) ratio and nitrate-nitrogen
    (NO3–-N) predominantly drove the key species changes in the archaeal network.
    The key species (e.g., Micrarchaeota, Thermoplasmatota, and Thaumarchaeota) were
    significantly associated with functional genes related to C and N cycles. More
    importantly, archaea contributed more to microbial resistance than bacterial and
    fungal resistance, but they were not at the network's core. The structural equation
    model revealed that high microbial resistance, directly or indirectly, improved
    tomato yields by regulating soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and NO3−-N contents.
    This study offers the first integrated insights into soil archaeal communities,
    ecological resistance index, soil nutrients, and tomato yield under ADI, which
    will guide future efficient agricultural production.

    yield 1. Introduction Archaea are tiny single-celled organisms, similar to bacteria
    and eukaryotes, classified as the third living realm in nature (Cloutier et al.,
    2023; Vendruscolo et al., 2020). Archaea initially grew only in extreme habitats
    until the early 1990s when molecular screening tools detected many archaeal sequences
    throughout the biosphere (Bailey et al., 2002; Cho et al., 2011). In recent years,
    archaea in agroecosystems have received increasing attention, as they are essential
    for regulating the material cycle and energy flow in ecosystems (Fu et al., 2021;
    Rodriguez-Ramos et al., 2022). For instance, Crenarchaeota can metabolize methane
    (Pei et al., 2022), Euryarchaeota are involved in the N cycle and the transformation
    of other hydrocarbons (Zhao et al., 2022), and physiological activities of Bathyarchaeota
    are related to cellulose degradation and CO2 fixation (Chi et al., 2021; Du et
    al., 2021). Furthermore, archaea facilitate crop adaptation to abiotic stresses,
    which maintain crop growth and yield (Zhao et al., 2022). Thus, soil archaea are
    vital for nutrient transformation and crop production. Despite their importance,
    multiple environmental factors can influence archaeal communities, including soil
    pH (Pohl et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2021), salinity (Zhao et al., 2022), and oxygen
    content (Ji et al., 2022; Popp et al., 2021). However, in agricultural production,
    hypoxia often limits normal plant growth and development (Du et al., 2018; Lu
    et al., 2022). In particular, mechanized land tillage, excessive irrigation, and
    fertilization lead to soil degradation and hardening, causing severe hypoxic stress
    in the plant root zone, ultimately reducing crop yield (Liu et al., 2019; Van
    Nguyen et al., 2017). Aeration drip irrigation (ADI) technology has emerged as
    a solution to this problem by delivering microbubble water (water–oxygen mixture)
    to the plant root zone through underground drip irrigation pipes to increase the
    oxygen content of rhizosphere soil (Lei et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2022b). The
    ADI technique has improved the soil nutrient content and yields of tomato (Du
    et al., 2018; Li et al., 2016a), celery (Zhang et al., 2021), melon (Li et al.,
    2016b), lettuce (Ouyang et al., 2020), sugarcane (Zhou et al., 2020), and citrus
    (Ben-Noah et al., 2021). However, the effect of ADI on soil archaeal communities
    has not been determined. Given that soil archaea are also influenced by irrigation
    management (Fan et al., 2021; He et al., 2022), regulating soil oxygen levels
    using ADI may change archaeal communities, potentially affecting crop productivity.
    Microbial communities comprise complex interactions (De Vries et al., 2018; Ji
    et al., 2022), with most studies on microorganisms based on macrogenomic methods
    focusing on bacteria and fungi rather than archaea (Bahram et al., 2018; De Vries
    et al., 2018; Rodriguez-Ramos et al., 2022). However, archaea are an important
    part of soil microbes (Bailey et al., 2002; Jiao et al., 2021; Zhu et al., 2022a),
    and understanding the mechanisms of interactions between different species is
    crucial for exploring microbial community structures. Cui et al. (2019) showed
    that archaea have the highest resistance index compared to bacteria and fungi,
    implying that archaea contribute the most to the stability of soil microbial communities.
    Investigating the interaction relationships among soil archaea, bacteria, and
    fungi is therefore essential for better exploring the effect of archaea on the
    overall microbial community structure. While our previous work found that ADI
    alters the community diversity and composition of soil bacteria and fungi (Li
    et al., 2020a; Zhu et al., 2022a), the co-occurrence network topology characterization
    of ADI for the overall microbial community, including bacterial, fungal and archaeal
    communities, is lacking. It is unclear whether ADI affects overall microbial community
    stability or whether microbial community stability is directly related to soil
    nutrients and crop productivity. Tomatoes are a commonly consumed and cultivated
    vegetable species due to their high nutritional value and economic benefits Rodriguez-Ramos
    et al., 2022). This study investigates the effect of ADI on soil microbial communities
    in a field tomato experiment to ((1) determine differences in archaeal community
    diversity, composition, co-occurrence networks, and keystone species under different
    ADI treatments; (2) assess the contribution of archaeal communities to ecological
    resistance index; (3) reveal the effects of ADI on the microbial functional potential,
    nutrient content, and yield. We hypothesized that high microbial resistance under
    ADI positively affects soil nutrients and ultimately improves tomato yield. 2.
    Materials and methods 2.1. Experimental site Field experiments were conducted
    at a tomato planting station (39°42’ N, 116°42’ E) in the southwest of Shouguang,
    Shandong Province of China. This area has an average temperature of 12.7°C, annual
    precipitation of 594 mm, frost-free period of 195 days, annual sunshine duration
    of 2,549 h, and sunshine rate of 57%. The greenhouse, with an area of 1,200 m2
    (120 m length, 10 m width), extended from east to west to receive sufficient sunlight
    and was covered with a transparent polyethylene film. At night in spring, autumn,
    and winter, the greenhouse was covered with a quilt made of woven straw to maintain
    warmth. During the day in summertime, the greenhouse was covered with shade netting,
    and the vents were opened to lower the temperature inside. Tomatoes (variety OuManDa
    No. 3) were cultivated over three consecutive growing seasons: (1) September 2,
    2020, to January 20, 2021; (2) March 18, 2021, to July 20, 2021; (3) August 17,
    2021, to January 10, 2022. During the three-season tomato growing period, the
    daily average temperature was 7.14–28.4°C, and relative humidity was 71.2–100%.
    The pre-sowing soil physicochemical properties of the plow layer were: sand (0.02–2
    mm), silt (0.002–0.02 mm), and clay (<0.002 mm) soil fractions had approximately
    52.85–53.85%, 25.02–27.05%, and 19.43–22.13% of the mass ratio, respectively.
    Field capacity ranged from 37.32–38.51%. The pH, SOC, total nitrogen (TN), available
    phosphorus (AP), and available potassium (AK) ranged from 7.92–8.04, 9.50–11.15
    g·kg−1, 0.99–1.28 g·kg−1, 50.04–52.56 mg·kg−1, and 142.90–196.21 mg·kg−1, respectively
    (Table S1). The soils were fertile, with good water retention, and suitable for
    tomato cultivation. 2.2. Experimental design The experiment had three dissolved
    oxygen concentration treatments—10 mg·L–1 (A1), 15 mg·L–1 (A2), and 20 mg·L–1
    (A3)— and a control treatment (CK) with conventional subsurface drip irrigation
    (no aeration). Each treatment had five replicates (20 plots, each 8.5 m × 0.8
    m). Before transplantation, 240 kg·ha–1 water-soluble compound fertilizer (N +
    P2O5 + K2O ≥ 20.0%) was applied as basal fertilizer. Tomato seedlings at the 4–5-leaf
    stage were transplanted to the greenhouse, with 0.48 m row spacing and 0.50 m
    plant spacing. After transplanting, the soil surface was covered with polyethylene
    film. The aeration treatment involved water–fertilizer–gas integration equipment
    (Darke Electronic Technology Co., Ltd., Zhengzhou, China) based on variable pressure
    adsorption separation to prepare pure oxygen. After opening the inlet valve, oxygen
    and water were mixed thoroughly with a venturi jet and a circulating water pump
    to produce micro-bubbled water (15 μm average bubble size). The water–fertilizer–gas
    integration equipment was connected to the main pipeline to transport the micro-bubbled
    water to the soil. The irrigation amount was calculated based on evaporation measured
    in evaporation pans (ADM7, Shandong Hongde Industry Co., Ltd., China) of 20 cm
    diameter. The evaporation pans were placed 10–15 cm above the tomato canopy. The
    height of the evaporation pan was adjusted promptly according to the tomato growth.
    We measured the evaporation volume every morning from 7:00 to 8:00 with a measuring
    cylinder (0.1 mm accuracy). The formula for the irrigation amount (Du et al.,
    2018; Zhang et al., 2021) is: (1) where is the irrigation amount (m3), is the
    area of each plot (13.6 m2), is the accumulated evaporation from the evaporation
    pan in one irrigation cycle (fixed value of 20 mm), is the evaporation pan coefficient,
    taken as 1.0, 1.1, 1.3 and 0.6 for tomatoes in the seedling, flowering, fruiting,
    and harvesting phases, respectively (Wang et al., 2010; Yu et al., 2023). Each
    plot had a water meter installed to control the amount of water, with the total
    amount of irrigation counted as 2,780, 2,660, and 2,860 m3·ha–1 for the first,
    second and third seasons, respectively. Moreover, the amount of irrigation was
    consistent across treatments (Table S2). 2.3. Soil sampling and physicochemical
    analysis Twenty soil samples (five replicates per treatment) were collected from
    the soil attached to plant roots on December 5, 2021 (third season), after removing
    the soil blocks from 0–40 cm depth. Sampling was conducted in an S-shaped pattern
    throughout each plot. One sample was formed by combining five soil cores from
    each plot. After transporting soil samples to the laboratory on ice, each composite
    sample was split into two sub-samples, one for measuring soil chemical indicators
    and the other stored in a –80°C refrigerator for macrogenome sequencing. We measured
    soil pH, SOC, DOC, TN, NO3–-N, NH4+-N (ammonium-nitrogen), AP, and AK using the
    methods in Bao et al. (2000). Tomato yields were measured at harvest (December
    2021 to January 2022) according to the method in Zhu et al. (2022a). During one
    irrigation cycle, the oxidation–reduction potential (Eh) and oxygen diffusion
    rate (ODR) were measured with a redox potential meter (Yidian Scientific Instruments
    Company, China), and oxygen concentration (OC) was measured with a fiber optic
    oxygen meter (Firesting O2, Pyro Science, Germany). Soil water content (SWC) was
    measured using time domain reflectometry (TDR200, Campbell, USA). Soil air-filled
    porosity (ε) was calculated from SWC, and ε was calculated as follows (Zang et
    al., 2018): (2) where is soil air-filled porosity (%), is soil particle density
    (g·cm–3; value 2.65), is soil bulk density (g·cm–3), and is soil water content
    (%). 2.4. Metagenomic sequencing, microbial taxa, and functional annotation Genomic
    DNA was extracted using the Fast DNA SPIN kit (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA,
    USA) according to the manufacturer''s instructions. DNA was sheared into fragments
    of ∼400 bp. The TruSeqTM DNA sample preparation kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA,
    USA) was used to prepare the macrogenomic libraries, with the Illumina Hiseq4000
    platform (Illuminia Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) used for sequencing. The details
    regarding metagenomic sequencing and predicted gene analysis are in Supplementary
    Materials 1. We obtained 1,624,754,066 raw reads, with 1,624,635,164 clean reads
    identified after filtering. After assembly, 58,026,782 contigs were identified
    with 2.42 × 1011 bases. The N50 statistics revealed that >50% of the contigs were
    >346 bp. A catalog of non-redundant genes was constructed for bacteria, archaea,
    and fungi, with 14,722,684, 129,422, and 24,531 obtained, respectively. Furthermore,
    we analyzed the potential function of the microbiome in the ADI and CK treatments
    based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Clusters of Orthologous
    Genes (COG) databases. Details of the KEGG and COG detabases are in Supplementary
    Materials 2. 2.5. Statistical analysis One-way ANOVA (Duncan''s multiple) was
    performed with SPSS 21.0 for soil nutrients, pH, crop yield, α-diversity, microbial
    resistance, and network topological characteristics. The α-diversity indexes (Chao1,
    Shannon, and Simpson indices) were calculated following OTU tables. Principal
    component analysis (PCA) and principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) were conducted
    based on the Bray–Curtis distance to account for β-diversity and functional groups,
    respectively. Redundancy analysis (RDA) was performed to decipher the relationships
    between archaeal communities and chemical properties in soil. The above methods
    were analyzed with ‘vegan’ in R software. We performed the random forest model
    analysis using the ‘randomForest’ package in R software to assess the importance
    of different microbial species as resistance. Resistance index was calculated
    according to the description of Orwin and Wardle (2004). A correlation matrix
    was used to explore the co-occurrence network of the soil microbial community.
    Based on the description of Zhao et al. (2022) and Li et al. (2021), Spearman''s
    correlation with p-values > 0.80 and p < 0.05 were set as reliable parameters.
    We then made co-occurrence network plots using Gephi (version 0.9.2). The key
    species of the network were determined from the intra-module connectivity (Zi)
    and inter-module connectivity (Pi) values according to the criteria described
    by Olesen (2007). Finally, structural equation models (SEM) were constructed using
    Smart PLS to assess direct and indirect correlations between ADI, soil chemical
    properties, archaeal communities, resistance, and crop yield. 3. Results 3.1.
    Changes in soil physicochemical properties The ADI treatments changed soil physicochemical
    properties. Compared to CK, the ADI treatments decreased SWC but increased ε,
    OC, ODR, and Eh (Figs S1 and S2). More importantly, SOC and DOC contents increased
    by an average of 5.87% and 16.28%, respectively, compared to CK, with the A2 treatment
    increasing the most (10.31% and 24.68%, respectively). Similarly, the A2 treatment
    increased TN, NO3–-N, and NH4+-N contents by 13.35%, 24.59%, and 22.81%, and the
    A1 treatment increased AP and AK contents by 18.28% and 15.25%, respectively (p
    < 0.05). In contrast, the ADI treatments decreased the C/N ratio and pH but not
    significantly from CK (p > 0.05, Fig. 1). Download : Download high-res image (685KB)

    Diversity and composition of the soil archaeal community The ADI treatments, especially
    A1 and A2, significantly improved the Simpson and Shannon indices compared to
    CK (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2a–c). The PCoA revealed a distinct distribution of archaeal
    OTUs between the ADI (A1, A2, and A3) and CK treatments (Fig. 2d), sorted into
    21 phyla, 42 classes, 84 orders, 146 families, 345 genera, and 850 species. The
    dominant archaeal phyla (relative abundance >5%) in all treatments were Thermoproteota
    and Halobacteriota, with relative abundances of 65.03–74.38% and 16.14–25.38%,
    respectively. Less-abundant phyla (Euryarchaeota, Thaumarchaeota, Thermoplasmatota,
    Euryarchaeota, Thaumarchaeota, and Thermoplasmatota), with relative abundance
    >1% but <5%, were also detected across all samples (Fig. 2e). The ADI treatments
    (especially A2) significantly increased the relative abundance of Thermoplasmatota
    and Halobacteriota, and also significantly decreased the relative abundance of
    Thermoproteota (p < 0.05) (Table S3), relative to CK. Download : Download high-res

    oxygen. Further taxonomical classification at the genus level revealed six genera
    (with relative abundance >1%) across all treatments, with the relative abundance
    of Nitrososphaera, Nitrosocosmicus, Nitrosotenuis, Nitrosopumilus, and Halorubrum
    in rhizosphere soil ranging from 16.7–30.67%, 14.9–19.17%, 14.86–19.29%, 2.32–14.53%,
    2.43–2.88%, and 2.03–3.1%, respectively (Fig. 2f). The ADI treatments significantly
    improved the relative abundance of Nitrosotenuis, Halorubrum, Natronomonas, and
    Natrinema, but significantly reduced the relative abundance of TH1177 and Nitrososphaera
    compared to CK (p < 0.05) (Table S3). 3.3. Topological properties and keystone
    species of archaeal co-occurrence networks The archaeal co-occurrence networks
    markedly differed between the ADI and CK treatments (Fig. 3a), with more nodes
    and edges in the ADI treatments than in CK. Moreover, the co-occurrence networks’
    degree and average clustering coefficient increased, and the modularity decreased
    in the ADI treatment compared to CK. The edge number and average clustering coefficient
    reflect the network complexity. In this study, the A2 treatment had the most complex
    network. Notably, the ADI treatment had greater larger positive/negative link
    ratios than CK, implying enhanced cooperation between species under ADI treatment
    (Table 1). Download : Download high-res image (2MB) Download : Download full-size

    1.46 A3 0.329 3.53 0.637 11 2.39 We used a Zi-Pi plot to determine the topological
    role of network nodes for each treatment (Fig. 3b). Module hubs (1.30%) and connectors
    (1.7%) are key taxonomies that facilitate the formation of network structures,
    with the key taxa of archaeal networks differing in the different treatments (Table
    S4). The CK network had two module-hub-affiliated Thermoproteota and six connector-affiliated
    Euryarchaeota, Halobacteriota, and Thermoproteota. The A1 network had five module-hub-affiliated
    Halobacteriota and ten connector-affiliated three phyla (Thermoproteota, Halobacteriota,
    Micrarchaeota). However, the keystone taxa of the network in the A2 treatment
    were connectors and module hubs of phyla Thermoplasmatota, Thaumarchaeota, and
    Halobacteriota, and in the A3 treatment were module hubs of phyla Halobacteriota
    and Euryarchaeota. The RDA analysis revealed that the variation in archaea communities
    was driven mainly by soil NO3−-N content and soil C/N ratio (Fig. 3c). 3.4. Archaea
    play a pivotal role in constructing the microbial network The overall microbial
    network of the rhizosphere soils contained archaea, bacteria, and fungi, with
    976 nodes and 27,780 margins (Fig. 4a). Most of the links between archaea and
    bacteria were positive, with greater intra-kingdom connections than inter-kingdom
    connections (Liu et al., 2022b). However, the links of fungi were predominantly
    negative, with smaller intra-kingdom connections than inter-kingdom connections.
    In addition, archaea and fungi had fewer network nodes and lower relative abundance
    than bacteria (Fig. 4b). The archaeal and fungal taxa had lower topological characteristic
    values than bacterial taxa (Fig. 4c), implying a higher position of bacteria in
    the overall microbial taxa than archaea and bacteria. Download : Download high-res

    greater resistance to microorganisms in the soil network than the A3 treatment
    when compared to CK (Fig. 5a). The random forest analysis determined the average
    importance of bacterial, fungal, and archaeal communities to the microbial resistance
    index (Fig. 5b). Notably, the archaeal community was the most crucial predictor
    of the resistance index in soil (p < 0.001). The soil microbial resistance indices
    had significant positive correlation with SOC, DOC, TN, and NO3−-N (p < 0.05)

    Functional characteristics of microbial communities The comparison with KEGG and
    COG databases enabled the annotation of assembled macrogenomes as predicted functions
    of the microorganisms. The PCoA revealed a significant difference between ADI
    and CK treatments (Fig. 6a, b). The ADI treatments had more functions associated
    with carbohydrate metabolism and energy metabolism than CK (Fig. 6c). Similarly,
    based on the results of the COG annotation, we found that ADI treatment improved
    the abundance of carbohydrate transport and metabolism-related functions (p <
    0.05) (Fig. S3). It is important to emphasize that soil microorganisms of the
    ADI treatments had greater metabolic potential in C and N cycling. Specifically,
    A2 improved the abundance of genes associated with C fixation relative to the
    CK treatment (e.g., accA and icd) (Fig. S4). Additionally, the A1 treatment reduced
    the functional abundance associated with nitrite reduction (nirK, 8.09%) and ammonia
    oxidation (amoB, 49.66% and amoC, 32.1%) (Fig. S5). The A2 treatment had a higher
    abundance of genes related to N fixation (nifH, 51.81%) than CK (Fig. S6). These
    results indicate that the A2 treatment enhances the functional potential of soil
    C and N fixation. Download : Download high-res image (561KB) Download : Download

    research attention as microbial communities are closely associated with nutrient
    cycling and crop productivity (Jian et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2021). However,
    studies on ADI have mainly investigated bacterial and/or fungal communities (Li
    et al., 2020a; Zhu et al., 2022b), with archaeal communities often neglected.
    Archaea are important players in the biogeochemical cycling of soil ecosystems
    (Jiao et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2022). In the present work, we assessed archaeal
    community characteristics and performed an integrated analysis of the ecological
    patterns of archaea, bacteria, and fungi, all of which affect soil nutrients and
    tomato yield. 4.1. ADI increased archaeal community diversity and network complexity
    Strikingly, the ADI treatments had higher α-diversity of archaeal communities
    than CK, which could be attributed to: (1) oxygen content influencing archaeal
    reproduction (Lu et al., 2022; Pei et al., 2022). The ADI treatments improved
    soil OC by delivering aerobic microbubble water (Fig. S1 and S2), providing a
    good habitat for archaeal growth. In contrast, long drip irrigation cycles and
    the dramatic increase in SWC decreased ε, OC, ODR, and Eh, resulting in poor soil
    aeration between crop roots (Dhungel et al., 2012; Pendergast et al., 2019). Archaea
    species compete for soil oxygen, inhibiting archaeal respiration, metabolism,
    and reproduction (Cloutier et al., 2023; Padhy et al., 2021); (2) increased α-diversity
    under ADI may be related to soil physicochemical properties (Fig. S7). In particular,
    the increased soil SOC, TN, AP, and AK contents under long-term ADI application
    provide rich nutrients for archaeal growth and stimulate the derivation of beneficial
    microflora (Zhang et al., 2022). These changes were reflected in the β-diversity
    pattern, such that the ADI and CK treatments had significantly different archaeal
    community structures (Adonis test, p < 0.05), indicating that new archaeal communities
    form under ADI compared to CK. In addition, archaeal networks in the ADI treatments
    had more positive correlations than CK, implying more cooperation among populations
    in complex microbial community ecosystems, possibly due to increased nutrient
    resource availability (Price et al., 2021; Ye et al., 2021). More importantly,
    archaeal communities had more positive correlations, but the ADI treatments had
    higher network complexity and interactions. Liu et al. (2022b) showed that long-term
    soybean cultivation enhanced the diversity of archaeal communities leading to
    complex network structures with strong resistance to potential plant pathogens
    in the network. Another study showed that high soil salinity decreased microbial
    richness and co-occurrence network complexity, adversely affecting ecological
    functions (Du et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2022). In conclusion, microbial communities
    with high diversity and complexity tend to be more stable and resilient than simple
    communities in response to external environmental stresses due to network buffering.
    4.2. ADI altered keystone taxa and potential functions in archaeal networks Our
    results showed that the relative abundance of most key nodes was low (all <1%),
    consistent with previous findings on N fertilizer addition (Goemann et al., 2021;
    Li et al., 2021), organic tillage (Li et al., 2020b; Zhang et al., 2018), and
    mulching (Ji et al., 2022); that is, high abundance does not indicate key network
    roles. However, ADI had a higher degree of key nodes processed than CK, indicating
    a higher degree of connectivity between OTUs and, thus, stronger interactions
    between species for maintaining network stability (Bello et al., 2021; Olesen,
    2007; Vendruscolo et al., 2020). Zheng et al. (2018) also indicated that keystone
    taxa change with changes in soil environmental factors, with key nodes becoming
    peripheral with the addition of organic amendments and different key genera appearing.
    In the present study, the keystone taxa differed in the ADI treatments with dissolved
    oxygen concentrations. For example, members of Micrarchaeota and Thaumarchaeota
    (e.g., CAISET01 and Nitrososphaera) emerged as key taxa in the A1 and A2 treatment
    networks, respectively, which had significant positive correlations with DOC and
    NO3–-N (Fig. 3c). The keystone taxa were significantly associated with the abundance
    of functional genes related to C and N cycles in soil (Figs S8 and S9), suggesting
    an important role in tomato rhizosphere soil function and supported by previous
    studies on oat rhizosphere soil (Bai et al., 2022). For example, the rhizosphere
    soil of the A1 treatment contained Micrarchaeota, which are highly adaptive and
    phylogenetically diverse, promoting the C cycle by degrading polysaccharides and
    proteins. The A2 treatment contained Thaumarchaeota, which are susceptible to
    oxygen content levels in the soil rhizosphere (Malard et al., 2022). Ammonia-oxidizing
    archaea (AOA) in Thaumarchaeota are the center of soil ammonia oxidation, with
    accumulating evidence that AOA outnumber AOB (ammonia-oxidizing bacteria) in various
    soil ecosystems (Fu et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2017). Therefore, we cannot ignore
    the ecological role of the Thaumarchaeota group in functions related to the N
    cycle. We also detected Euryarchaeota in the A3 and CK treatments, a somewhat
    surprising result since this phylum is more likely to be enriched in harsh environments
    (Chi et al., 2021; Lu et al., 2022). We speculate that the A3 treatment exceeded
    the oxygen level within the tolerance range of plants, leading to oxygen poisoning
    in the crop rhizosphere, with Micrarchaeota possibly playing an active role in
    resisting high oxygen stress environments. 4.3. ADI improved tomato yield by enhancing
    microbial resistance Soil microorganisms are incredibly complex, as different
    taxa and species are interrelated (Forstner et al., 2019; Preusser et al., 2019;
    Stefanowicz et al., 2019). Understanding the relationships between microbial populations,
    including bacteria, fungi, and archaea, is necessary to explore the effects of
    agricultural activities such as tillage, fertilization, or irrigation on the overall
    microbial community (Malard et al., 2022; Xu et al., 2017). Our previous work
    found that ADI treatments changed the network structure of bacterial and fungal
    communities in tomato soil (Li et al., 2020a; Zhu et al., 2022a), but the effect
    of the ADI treatments on the whole soil microbial community, including soil archaea,
    is not clear. Therefore, we comprehensively analyzed the characteristics of archaeal,
    bacterial, and fungal communities and explored their relationships in the ADI
    treatments. These results demonstrated that bacteria had the most nodes in the
    whole network in the ADI treatments, indicating that the soil bacterial community
    occupied a central position in the whole microbial community, contrary to the
    results of a previous study on the Tibetan Plateau, showing that the archaeal
    community was central to the whole microbial community (Chen et al., 2022). This
    difference may be due to the different responses of archaeal communities to high
    fertility agricultural soils and nutrient-poor meadow soils (Coxall et al., 2005;
    Cui et al., 2019). In addition, while archaeal communities did not occupy a central
    position in the overall microbial network, archaea had the highest resistance
    index, implying that archaeal communities contributed the most to the stability
    of the microbial network (Du et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022a; Malard et al., 2022).
    Field experiments based on three tomato seasons showed that tomato yields were
    highest in all A2 treatments compared to other treatments, and closely associated
    with increased microbial resistance. A more stable (highly resistant) microbial
    community is more conducive to maintaining crop yield (de Scally et al., 2016;
    Kariuki et al., 2020). Moreover, the SEM supported the positive effect of microbial
    resistance on tomato yield (Fig. 7). The random forest model further demonstrated
    that microbial resistance is most important in regulating tomato yield (Fig. 7).
    The reason why microbial resistance affects crop yield can be explained by (1)
    rapid microbial growth, with low-resistance microbial communities rapidly absorbing
    available soil nutrients (De Vries et al., 2018; Preusser et al., 2019), leading
    to a reduction in available nutrient contents to plant roots and adversely affecting
    crop growth and productivity (Rodriguez-Ramos et al., 2022), while the high-resistant
    microbial community slowly obtains nutrients, facilitating crops to absorb more
    nutrients from the soil (Du et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022b); (2) highly resistant
    microorganisms alleviate fluctuations within the taxa, enhancing microbial resistance
    to oxidative stress and helping plant roots to improve resistance to low oxygen
    stress, improving crop yields (Jiao et al., 2021; Pei et al., 2022). Overall,
    we integrated ecological networks of transboundary (e.g., bacterial, fungal, and
    archaeal) microorganisms to explore the effects of ADI on tomato yield and found
    that highly resistant microbial communities may play an important role in promoting
    tomato yield. However, soil microbial communities can be influenced by nearby
    field environmental conditions (e.g., ground temperature and light), and the current
    results seem to have some limitations. In the future, we will verify the contribution
    of resistant microbes to crop productivity in controlled experiments (e.g., microplots
    or pot experiments). Download : Download high-res image (235KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 7. Structural equation model (SEM) showing direct and indirect
    effects of the ADI treatments on resistance, SOC, TN, DOC, NO3−-N, and tomato
    yield. The width of the arrow is proportional to the strength of the relationship.
    Blue arrows indicate positive path factors. The number adjacent to the arrow is
    the normalized path coefficient. Solid and dashed arrows indicate significant
    (p < 0.05) and non-significant (p > 0.05) paths. R2 is the proportion of variance
    adjacent to tomato yield in the model. Goodness-of-fit statistics for each model
    are shown below the model. Standardized total effects (direct plus indirect effects)
    in SEM on tomato yields from microbial resistance and soil nutrients. SOC, DOC,
    TN, and NO3−-N are soil organic carbon, dissolved organic carbon, total nitrogen,
    and nitrate-N, respectively. 5. Conclusion The ADI treatments increased soil archaeal
    α-diversity and network complexity, leading to a more stable archaeal network.
    Moreover, ADI had more positive correlations in the archaeal network than CK,
    implying greater cooperation among species in a complex microbial network. The
    A1 and A2 treatments may promote C and N cycling by improving the relative abundance
    of Micrarchaeota and Thaumarchaeota, respectively. Additionally, highly resistant
    microorganisms directly or indirectly promoted tomato yields by enhancing soil
    nutrients. Interestingly, archaeal communities, but not bacterial or fungal communities,
    contribute the most to microbial resistance, but they were not at the overall
    network''s core. Thus, the archaeal community merits more attention in future
    research on farmland irrigation management, particularly in studies involving
    metagenomic and metaproteomic analyses. Credit Author Statement Jinjin Zhu: Investigation,

  - ADI increased α-diversity values and changed the dominant phyla and genera of
    archaea.
  - The soil C/N (organic carbon/total nitrogen) ratio and nitrate-nitrogen (NO3–-N)
    predominantly drove the key species changes in the archaeal network.

    This paper presents a distributed model predictive control algorithm for a discrete
    linear time-invariant system that involves a cooperative game approach. It is
    assumed that this system consists of several subsystems which are connected through
    inputs. The subsystems are updated one by one in a sequential manner. Once a subsystem
    is completed its optimization, its optimal input is shared with the next interconnected
    subsystem. The process of synthesizing the optimal control for each subsystem
    involves the computation of disagreement points for each subsystem by employing
    a feasible cooperation approach. Meanwhile, in the negotiation process, the subsystem
    can validate whether or not it should cooperate at each time step. The feasibility
    of the proposed approach at each iteration and time step is proven. Furthermore,
    the stability of the proposed method is investigated by using the convexity of
    the cost function. Finally, the proposed method is applied to a canal irrigation

    predictive control (DMPC) algorithms can be classified into non-cooperative and
    cooperative. This classification differs from others according to the objective
    function that each subsystem must solve at every time step. In non-cooperative
    schemes, each subsystem optimizes its local objective function with fewer subsystem
    communication, as reported in previous studies [1,2,3,4,5]. Cooperative algorithms
    are characterized by each subsystem optimizing a global objective function, with
    its inputs being decision variables while keeping the inputs of other subsystems
    constant, as reported in [6,7,8,9,10], etc. In addition, the global objective
    function is a linear combination of subsystems’ local objective functions. Hence,
    instead of solving local problems one by one, in cooperative algorithms, it is
    sufficient to solve such a global objective function. According to the implementation
    and communication strategy, DMPC schemes can be classified into two, parallel
    and serial DMPC ([11]). On the one hand, in parallel DMPC, subsystems are optimized
    simultaneously using the information of other subsystems from a previous time
    step, such as in [12]. Serial DMPC, on the other hand, optimizes subsystems sequentially
    [13,14,15]. In this setting, each subsystem optimizes its inputs using the most
    recent input updates of other subsystems. In solving DMPC problems, some researchers
    also involved non-cooperative and cooperative game theories. On the one hand,
    considering DMPC problems as non-cooperative games (for example, [16]) leads to
    the solution known as Nash equilibrium. Some studies on this type of solution
    and its variants can be found, such as in [17,18,19,20,21,22,23], etc. Meanwhile,
    in solving DMPC problems as cooperative games, assuming that each subsystem is
    the player, while the inputs represent their strategies, and their payoffs are
    accounted for in the subsystems’ objective functions, leads to the best solution
    known as Pareto solutions. The authors in [12] and [24] formulated the DMPC problem
    as a bargaining game in which every subsystem can decide whether or not to cooperate
    within the optimization. The decision to cooperate is made using feasible cooperation
    and a negotiation model. Another study [25] designed a Nash bargaining DMPC scheme
    in which the weight for each subsystem’s objective function is proportional to
    the control effort. These approaches updated the subsystems simultaneously. Other
    DMPC approaches utilizing the cooperative game concept are the methods used by
    [26] and [27] to coordinate two subsystems where each subsystem only has partial
    information about the other subsystem. These methods update the subsystems one
    by one in a sequential manner. This paper discusses a DMPC approach involving
    a cooperative game method for discrete linear time-invariant systems. It is assumed
    that there are M subsystems coupled through inputs comprising the primary system.
    Moreover, each subsystem is associated with an MPC problem. We solved this problem
    sequentially, from subsystem 1 to subsystem M. At each time step, the upstream
    layer subsystem sends its optimal input trajectories to the subsystems below it
    and estimates that subsystem’s input using a stabilizing auxiliary control law.
    The proposed method involves feasible cooperation and the Nash bargaining procedure
    to obtain the optimal solution. Moreover, this process involves the simultaneous
    computation of the disagreement points of all subsystems while their optimizations
    are performed one by one sequentially. As mentioned by [11], solving problems
    one by one sequentially provides a computationally efficient approach while still
    producing nearly comparable results obtained by solving problems in parallel.
    Our proposed method relies on the convexity of the subsystem’s cost function.
    In addition, this cost function is embedded with a weight. In our proposed method,
    we only describe the weight property for each subsystem without specifying how
    to choose it. To show the effectiveness of our proposed method, we then implemented
    it on canal irrigation systems with four reaches in [28]. We then compared our
    results to the method proposed in [25], which solves the problem in parallel.
    The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2, we provide the
    underlying systems to be considered for the DMPC formulation. Sections 3 and  4
    discussed the proposed method and its properties, respectively, and the simulation
    is given in Sect. 5. Finally, the conclusion is presented in Sect. 6. 2 Preliminaries
    To derive a sequential NB-DMPC algorithm, we consider M interconnected discrete
    linear time-invariant subsystems where each dynamic is described as follows: $$\\begin{aligned}
    x_i(k+1)&= A_i x_{i}(k) + B_{ii}u_i(k) + \\sum _{j\\ne i} B_{ij}u_j(k), \\nonumber
    \\\\ y_i(k)&= C_i x_i(k), \\end{aligned}$$ (1) for all \\(i=1,2,\\dots , M\\),
    where \\(x_i \\in \\mathbb {R}^{n_i}\\), \\(u_i \\in \\mathbb {R}^{m_i}\\), \\(y_i
    \\in \\mathbb {R}^{p_i}\\). It is assumed that \\(n=\\sum _{i=1}^{M} n_i \\),
    \\(m =\\sum _{i=1}^{M} m_i\\), and \\(p =\\sum _{i=1}^{M} p_i\\). In addition,
    the state and input constraints are given by $$\\begin{aligned} x_i(k+p) \\in
    \\mathbb {X}_i, \\; u_i(k+p) \\in \\mathbb {U}_i, \\end{aligned}$$ where \\(p\\ge
    0\\), \\(\\mathbb {X}_i\\) and \\(\\mathbb {U}_i\\) contain origins in their respective
    interior. Moreover, it is assumed that \\(\\mathbb {U}_i\\) is a compact and convex
    set. We then use the following assumption: Assumption 1 \\((A_i,B_{ii})\\) is
    stabilizable for all \\(i=1,2,\\dots ,M\\). This assumption permits us to design
    a stabilizing controller for subsystem i, \\(i=1,2,\\dots ,M\\). From Eq. (1),
    the predicted input and state made at time step k are given by $$\\begin{aligned}
    U_{k,k}^i&= \\begin{bmatrix} u_i(k,k)\\\\ u_i(k+1,k)\\\\ \\vdots \\\\ u_i(k+N-1,k)
    \\end{bmatrix}, X_{k+1,k}^i = \\begin{bmatrix} x_i(k+1,k)\\\\ x_i(k+2,k)\\\\ \\vdots
    \\\\ x_i(k+N,k) \\end{bmatrix}. \\end{aligned}$$ (2) In Eq. (2), N is the horizon
    prediction length and is assumed to be equal to the control horizon \\(N_u\\),
    and \\(U_{k,k}^i \\in \\Omega _i = \\prod _{t=0}^{N-1} \\mathbb {U}_i\\). In addition,
    the optimal input sequence and the corresponding optimal state at time step k
    are denoted by $$\\begin{aligned} U_{k,k}^{i,o} = \\begin{bmatrix} u_i^o(k,k)\\\\
    u_i^o(k+1,k)\\\\ \\vdots \\\\ u_i^o(k+N-1,k) \\end{bmatrix}, \\;\\text {and}\\;
    X_{k+1,k}^{i,o} = \\begin{bmatrix} x_i^o(k+1,k)\\\\ x_i^o(k+2,k)\\\\ \\vdots \\\\
    x_i^o(k+N,k) \\end{bmatrix} \\end{aligned}$$ (3) In our proposed approach, the
    value of \\(u_j\\) in Eq. (1) is assumed to be constant during these N steps,
    where \\(j\\ne i\\). Hence, using recursion, the model prediction for each subsystem
    is as follows: $$\\begin{aligned} x_i(k+1,k)&= A_i x_{i}(k) + B_{ii}u_i(k,k) +
    \\sum _{j\\ne i} B_{ij}u_j(k)\\\\ x_i(k+2,k)&= A_i^2 x_{i}(k) + A_iB_{ii}u_i(k,k)
    + B_{ii}u_i(k+1,k)\\\\&\\qquad + \\sum _{j\\ne i} A_iB_{ij}u_j(k) + \\sum _{j\\ne
    i} B_{ij}u_j(k) \\\\&= A_i^2 x_{i}(k) + A_iB_{ii}u_i(k,k) + B_{ii}u_i(k+1,k) \\\\&\\qquad
    +\\sum _{j\\ne i} \\sum _{r=0}^{1} A_i^r B_{ij}u_j(k)\\\\&\\vdots \\\\ x_i(k+N,k)&=
    A_i^N x_{i}(k) + A_i^{N-1}B_{ii}u_i(k,k) \\\\ {}&\\quad + \\dots + B_{ii}u_i(k+N-1,k)
    \\\\&\\quad +\\sum _{j\\ne i} \\sum _{r=0}^{N-1} A_i^rB_{ij}u_j(k), \\end{aligned}$$
    which can be expressed succinctly as $$\\begin{aligned} X_{k+1,k}^i&= \\mathcal
    {A}_i x_i(k) + \\mathcal {B}_{ii} U_{k,k}^i + \\sum _{j\\ne i} \\mathcal {B}_{ij}
    u_j(k), \\end{aligned}$$ (4) where $$\\begin{aligned}&\\mathcal {A}_i = \\begin{bmatrix}
    A_i \\\\ A_i^2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ A_i^N \\end{bmatrix}, \\mathcal {B}_{ii}=\\begin{bmatrix}
    B_{ii} &{} 0 &{} \\dots &{} 0 \\\\ A_iB_{ii} &{} B_{ii} &{} \\dots &{} 0\\\\ \\vdots
    &{} \\vdots &{} \\ddots &{} \\vdots \\\\ A_{i}^{N-1}B_{ii} &{} A_{i}^{N-2}B_{ii}
    &{} \\dots &{} B_{ii} \\end{bmatrix}, \\\\&\\mathcal {B}_{ij}=\\begin{bmatrix}
    B_{ij} &{} 0 &{} \\dots &{} 0 \\\\ A_iB_{ij} &{} B_{ij} &{} \\dots &{} 0\\\\ \\vdots
    &{} \\vdots &{} \\ddots &{} \\vdots \\\\ A_{i}^{N-1}B_{ij} &{} A_{i}^{N-2}B_{ij}
    &{} \\dots &{} B_{ij} \\end{bmatrix}. \\end{aligned}$$ Each subsystem has its
    local objective function given by $$\\begin{aligned} J_i(k)&= \\sum _{p=1}^{N-1}
    \\left\\| x_i(k+p,k)\\right\\| _{Q_i}^{2} + \\sum _{p=0}^{N-1} \\left\\| u_i(k+p,k)\\right\\|
    _{R_i}^{2} + \\nonumber \\\\&\\quad x_i^T(k+N,k) P_i x_i^T(k+N,k). \\end{aligned}$$
    (5) In Eq. (5), \\(Q_i \\ge 0\\), \\(R_i>0\\), and matrix \\(P_i>0\\) is a solution
    of a discrete algebraic Riccati equation. The objective function above can be
    re-written as $$\\begin{aligned} J_i(k)&= \\left( X_{k+1,k}^i\\right) ^T\\mathcal
    {Q}_i X_{k+1,k}^i + \\left( U_{k,k}^i\\right) ^T \\mathcal {R}_i \\left( U_{k,k}^i\\right)
    \\end{aligned}$$ (6) where \\(\\mathcal {Q}_i\\) and \\(\\mathcal {R}_i\\) are
    diagonal matrices with the main diagonal elements of \\(\\left( Q_i,Q_i,\\dots
    , P_i \\right) \\), and \\(\\left( R_i,R_i,\\dots , R_i \\right) \\), respectively,
    with dimensions \\(Nn_i \\times Nn_i\\) and \\(Nm_i \\times Nm_i\\), consecutively.
    Here, \\(X_{k+1,k}^i\\) and \\(U_{k,k}^i\\) are expressed as Eqs. (4) and (2),
    respectively. Given that the cooperative schemes, all subsystems optimize the
    overall objective function according to their respective inputs as decision variables,
    following a previous work [29], the overall objective function that has to be
    minimized by each subsystem is described as follows: $$\\begin{aligned} J(k)&=
    \\sum _{i=1}^M \\alpha _i J_i(k) \\nonumber \\\\&= \\sum _{i=1}^M \\alpha _i \\left(
    \\left( X_{k+1,k}^i\\right) ^T\\mathcal {Q}_i X_{k+1,k}^i \\right. \\nonumber
    \\\\ {}&\\quad \\left. + \\left( U_{k,k}^i\\right) ^T \\mathcal {R}_i \\left(
    U_{k,k}^i\\right) \\right) \\end{aligned}$$ (7) where \\(\\alpha _i\\) is the
    weight for subsystem i that can be chosen freely by the designer, \\(\\alpha _i
    \\in [0,1)\\), and \\(\\sum _{i=1}^M \\alpha _i =1\\). As stated in [12], it is
    clear that J(k) is a function of \\(U_{k,k}\\) where \\(U_{k,k}\\) is the overall
    input vector \\(U_{k,k}=\\begin{bmatrix} (U_{k,k}^1)^T&(U_{k,k}^2)^T&\\dots&(U_{k,k}^M)^T
    \\end{bmatrix}^T\\), with its respective state \\(X_{k+1,k}=\\begin{bmatrix} (X_{k+1,k}^1)^T&(X_{k+1,k}^2)^T&\\dots&(X_{k+1,k}^M)^T
    \\end{bmatrix}^T\\). Here, we omit this dependency in the expression for notational
    convenience, so we only use \\(J_i(k)\\) and J(k) to refer to \\(J_i\\left( U_{k,k}^i\\right)
    \\) and \\(J\\left( U_{k,k}\\right) \\), respectively. However, we occasionally
    involve the dependency for clarity. Furthermore, it has also been pointed out
    in [12] that \\(J_i\\) is a strictly convex function in \\(U_{k,k}\\in \\Omega
    \\), where \\(\\Omega = \\prod _{i=1}^{M} \\Omega _i\\). Hence, J(k) is also strictly
    convex in \\(U_{k,k}\\), as it is a linear combination of strictly convex functions
    \\(J_i(k)\\), \\(i=1,2, \\dots , M\\). We know that optimizing J(k) in Eq. (7)
    for \\(U_{k,k}\\) is a centralized MPC problem. In this paper, we solve this problem
    distributively using a cooperative game scheme involving a feasible cooperation
    MPC and Nash bargaining approach. From a cooperative games point of view, the
    subsystem is the player, the input of each subsystem is the strategy, and its
    payoff is the objective function \\(J_i\\). At the same time, the decision space
    is represented by the set \\(\\Omega _i\\), for all \\(i=1,2\\dots , M\\). The
    solution to the game is called a “Pareto solution” and is generally not unique.
    We use the Nash bargaining algorithm to select the best Pareto solution as an
    optimal solution to be applied to each subsystem. Thus, in the sequel, two algorithms
    are involved: (1) a feasible cooperation algorithm, which relates to the computation
    of Pareto solutions, (2) the negotiation model, which results in a Nash bargaining
    solution for each subsystem. An overview of the bargaining game is given as follows:
    bargaining games are part of cooperative games that involve a group of players
    who can bargain in the games. That is, they are allowed to decide whether to cooperate
    or not in the game. The players act according to the agreed joint action plan,
    which gives mutual benefit. When no agreement is possible, the players implement
    an alternative plan determined using local information. This alternative plan
    results in a benefit known as a “disagreement point” [30]. Involving bargaining
    games in DMPC formulations entails solving DMPC problems such that the optimal
    DMPC controllers reflect the consensus of all players, the subsystems in this
    case, in the mutual goal. The disagreement points of all subsystems can be considered
    the worst performance losses. Thus, the chosen strategies are those whose give
    performance is less than or equal to these thresholds [30]. This paper discusses
    a DMPC scheme based on the Nash bargaining game for discrete linear systems. In
    particular, we provide an alternative approach to solving the Nash bargaining
    DMPC algorithms previously proposed by [12, 29], and [25]. These methods involve
    two algorithms: a feasible cooperation algorithm and a bargaining procedure. The
    first algorithm yields an optimal input sequence for each subsystem and a disagreement
    point that can be used to determine which optimal input should be applied for
    each subsystem. The latter provides the best solution for both the cooperative
    or the non-cooperative scheme [12]. We know that the cooperative game solution
    associated with the DMPC problem can be computed by performing the following optimization:
    $$\\begin{aligned}&\\max _{U_{k,k}}\\; \\prod _{i=1}^{M} \\left( d_i(k)-J_i\\left(
    U_{k,k}\\right) \\right) ^{\\alpha _i} \\end{aligned}$$ (8) $$\\begin{aligned}
    \\text {s.t}&\\; \\forall i=1,2,\\dots ,M: \\nonumber \\\\&J_i\\left( U_{k,k}\\right)
    <d_i(k), \\end{aligned}$$ (9) $$\\begin{aligned}&U_{k,k}^i \\in \\Omega _i, \\end{aligned}$$
    (10) where \\(d_i(k)\\) denotes the disagreement point of subsystem i at time
    step k. This point can be computed as the value of \\(J_i\\) at the optimal solution
    of the problem presented below: $$\\begin{aligned}&U_{k,k}^{i,d} = \\arg \\min
    _{U_{k,k}^i}\\max _{U_{k,k}} \\quad J_i\\left( U_{k,k}\\right) \\end{aligned}$$
    (11) $$\\begin{aligned} \\text {s.t}&\\;\\;\\forall i=1,2,\\dots ,M: \\nonumber
    \\\\&U_{k,k}^i \\in \\Omega _i, \\end{aligned}$$ (12) $$\\begin{aligned}&U_{k,k}^{-i}
    \\in \\Omega _{-i}. \\end{aligned}$$ (13) Thus, we have \\(d_i(k)= J_i\\left(
    U_{k,k}^{i,d}\\right) \\). In [29], the authors demonstrated that solving Problems
    (8)–(10) is equivalent to solving the problem below: $$\\begin{aligned}&\\max
    _{U_{k,k}^i} \\quad \\sum _{r=1}^M \\alpha _r \\log \\left( d_r(k)-J_r\\left(
    U_{k,k}^i,U_{k,k}^{-i}\\right) \\right) \\end{aligned}$$ (14) $$\\begin{aligned}
    \\text {s.t}&\\nonumber \\\\&J_r\\left( U_{k,k}^i,U_{k,k}^{-i}\\right) < d_r(k),
    \\end{aligned}$$ (15) $$\\begin{aligned}&U_{k,k}^i \\in \\Omega _i, i=1,2,\\dots
    ,M. \\end{aligned}$$ (16) Notably, \\(J_r\\left( U_{k,k}^i,U_{k,k}^{-i}\\right)
    \\) is nothing but \\(J_r\\left( U_{k,k}\\right) \\). The authors in [29] and
    [25] solved this problem simultaneously for all i, where \\(i=1,2\\dots ,M\\).
    As described in the following section, our proposed method aims to solve Problems
    (14)–(16) sequentially, starting from subsystem 1 and continuing to subsystem
    M. 3 Sequential cooperative nash bargaining DMPC Recall Eq. (1), with the objective
    function given in Eq. (7), and the decision space \\(\\Omega _i\\). The proposed
    approach aims to solve the Problems (14)–(16) in a sequential manner. As a result,
    the input from the other subsystems is assumed to take the following values in
    each optimization of subsystem i: $$\\begin{aligned} u_{k,k}^{j} = {\\left\\{
    \\begin{array}{ll} u_{k,k}^{j,o}, \\;j<i\\\\ \\kappa _j x_j(k), \\;j>i, \\end{array}\\right.
    } \\end{aligned}$$ (17) where \\(u_{k,k}^{j}\\) is constant during N time steps.
    This definition allows us to partition the input \\(U_{k,k}^{-i}\\) into \\(U_{k,k}^j
    = U_{k,k}^{j,o}\\) for \\(j \\in [1,i-1]\\), and \\( U_{k,k}^j = \\kappa _j X_{k,k}^j,\\)
    for \\(j\\in [i+1,M]\\). Hence, the proposed sequential DMPC problem can be written
    as, $$\\begin{aligned}&\\max _{U_{k,k}^i} \\quad \\sum _{r=1}^M \\alpha _r \\log
    \\left( d_r(k)-J_r\\left( U_{k,k}^i,U_{k,k}^{-i}\\right) \\right) \\end{aligned}$$
    (18) $$\\begin{aligned} \\text {s.t}&\\nonumber \\\\&J_r\\left( U_{k,k}^i,U_{k,k}^{-i}\\right)
    < d_r(k), \\end{aligned}$$ (19) $$\\begin{aligned}&U_{k,k}^i \\in \\Omega _i,
    i=1,2,\\dots ,M, \\end{aligned}$$ (20) $$\\begin{aligned}&U_{k,k}^{-i} \\in \\Omega
    _{-i}, \\end{aligned}$$ (21) $$\\begin{aligned}&U_{k,k}^{-i} = {\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll}
    U_{k,k}^{j,o}, \\;j <i \\\\ \\kappa _j X_{k,k}^j, \\;j>i. \\end{array}\\right.
    } \\end{aligned}$$ (22) Here, each subsystem solves its optimization problem for
    the maximal \\(q_{\\max }\\) iterations, \\(q_{\\max }>0\\), in each time step.
    Then, it sends its latest input to the other subsystems in each iteration. As
    a result, the proposed method is used by implementing the following negotiation
    procedure: 1. At time step k, subsystem i receives all states from other subsystems,
    i.e., \\(x_j(k)\\), \\(j\\ne i\\), \\(j=1,2,\\dots ,M\\), 2. All subsystems compute
    the disagreement point \\(d_i\\) by solving Problems (11)–(13), \\(i=1,2,\\dots
    ,M\\). This \\(d_i = J_i\\left( U_{k,k}^{i,d}\\right) \\) is then sent to subsystem
    j, \\(j\\ne i\\), \\(j=1,2,\\dots ,M\\), 3. Given \\(\\alpha _i\\), at each iteration
    q, subsystem i solves Problem (18)–(22) to get the optimal input sequences for
    iteration q, namely \\(U_{k,k}^{i,o(q)}\\). 4. Subsystem i updates its input using
    the following formula ([29, 30]): where \\(\\alpha _i\\) is the weight of subsystem
    i, 5. Subsystem i sends \\(U_{k,k}^{i(q)}\\) and \\(U_{k,k}^{j(q)}\\) to the next
    subsystem, where \\(j<i\\). This task is continued until subsystem M. 6. Set \\(q=q+1\\),
    and then repeat Step 3. This process is carried out until the termination requirements
    or maximum iteration are reached. We use \\(\\max _{1\\le i \\le M}\\lbrace \\Vert
    x^{i,q} - x^{i,q-1}\\Vert \\rbrace \\le \\epsilon \\) and \\(q_{\\max }\\) as
    the termination conditions. 7. When one of those conditions is satisfied then
    the process is terminated, say at iteration \\(q_{end}\\). Thus, a new overall
    state measurement for time step \\(k+1\\), i.e., \\(x^{q_{end}}(k+1)=\\begin{bmatrix}
    \\left( x_1^{q_{end}}(k+1)\\right) ^T,\\dots ,\\left( x_M^{q_{end}}(k+1)\\right)
    ^T \\end{bmatrix}^T\\) is made available. Then, we set \\(k=k+1\\) and go to Step
    2, where \\(x_i(k) = x_i^{q_{end}}(k+1)\\), \\(i=1,2,\\dots ,M\\). Remark 1 In
    Step 3 above, \\(\\alpha _i\\) should be a positive scalar that satisfies the
    condition \\(\\sum _{i=1}^M \\alpha _i =1\\). In addition, the existence of such
    an \\(\\alpha _i\\) is guaranteed and corresponds one-to-one to the subsystem’s
    objective function as shown by [29]. This \\(\\alpha _i\\) can be chosen to assume
    the same value for all i, \\(i=1,2,\\dots ,M\\), such as in [29] and [12], or
    even different as in [25], where the values are selected according to the control
    effort of each subsystem. The Optimization Problems (18)–(22), together with the
    negotiation model above, form the proposed sequential NB-DMPC algorithm. In the
    proposed method, all subsystems simultaneously compute their disagreement points.
    This information is then shared with other subsystems, which can be used to determine
    whether to cooperate or each iteration. Meanwhile, their optimizations are performed
    one by one sequentially. In contrast, in [25] and [31], computation of disagreement
    points and optimization of subsystems are performed in parallel. In the following
    section, we discuss the properties of our proposed control strategy. 4 Feasibility
    and closed-loop stability This section describes the feasibility and stability
    of the closed-loop system after applying the control we devised. The feasibility
    of the method is proven by showing that Problems (18)–(22) can be feasibly solved
    at each iteration and time step. Theorem 1 Let \\(U_k^{i,f(q)}\\) and the respective
    state \\(X_{k+1}^{i,f(q)}\\) denote the input and state sequence of subsystem
    i such that Problems (18)–(22) are feasible at iteration q and time step k. Then,
    for all \\(i=1,2,\\dots ,M\\), Problems (18)–(22) are also feasible for each iteration
    q and time step \\(k+1\\), \\(\\forall k\\ge 0\\). Proof We show the feasibility
    of Problems (18)–(22) at each iteration and time step for all i, \\(i=1,2,\\dots
    , M\\). Assume that at time step k and iteration q, the resulting optimal input
    trajectories of Problems (18)–(22) for subsystem i is given by \\(U_{k,k}^{i,o(q)}\\).
    Then, the chosen input is given by \\(U_{k,k}^{i(q)} = \\alpha _i U_{k,k}^{i,o(q)}
    + (1-\\alpha _i)U_{k,k}^{i(q-1)}\\), where both \\(U_{k,k}^{i,o(q)}\\) and \\(U_{k,k}^{i(q-1)}\\)
    are in \\(\\Omega _i\\). Thus, \\(U_{k,k}^{i(q)} \\in \\Omega _i\\) by the convexity
    of \\(\\Omega _i\\). Hence, the problem is feasible at each iteration q, \\(q=1,2,\\dots
    , q_{max}\\). Next, we examine the feasibility at each time step. Given that the
    optimal solution and corresponding optimal state are by \\(U_{k,k}^{i,o(q^*)}\\)
    and \\(X_{k+1,k}^{i(q^*)}\\), respectively, we can construct the feasible solution
    for the next time step using the tails of \\(U_{k,k}^{i,o(q^*)}\\) and \\(X_{k+1,k}^{i,o(q^*)}\\),
    which are given in Eq. (3) (see [32]). In particular, we discard the first element
    of \\(U_{k,k}^{i,o(q^*)}\\), and complete the remaining sequence by filling the
    last element with vector \\(\\textbf{0}\\), and so we obtain the feasible input
    sequence for time step \\(k+1\\), $$\\begin{aligned}&U_{k+1}^{i,f}\\\\ {}&\\quad
    = \\left[ u_i^{o(q^*)}(k+1,k)^T, \\dots , u_i^{o(q^*)}(k+N-1,k)^T, \\textbf{0}^T\\right]
    ^T \\end{aligned}$$ and its corresponding state sequence is given by $$\\begin{aligned}
    X_{k+2}^{i,f}&= \\begin{bmatrix} x_i^{o(q^*)}(k+2,k)\\\\ \\vdots \\\\ x_i^{o(q^*)}(k+N,k)\\\\
    A_ix_i^{o(q^*)}(k+N,k)+\\sum _{j\\ne i}B_{ij}u_j(k,k) \\end{bmatrix}. \\end{aligned}$$
    These \\(U_{k+1}^{i,f}\\) and \\(X_{k+2}^{i,f}\\) are the respective feasible
    input and state for the next optimization of subsystem i, i.e., \\(k+1\\). These
    \\(U_{k+1}^{i,f}\\) and \\(X_{k+2}^{i,f}\\) are the respective feasible input
    and state for the subsequent optimization of subsystem i, i.e., \\(k+1\\). By
    using the same reasoning, the feasibility for subsystem i at each time step can
    be concluded by induction. For subsystem \\(i+1\\), given that subsystem i has
    computed their optimal input \\(U_{k,k}^{i,o(q)} \\in \\Omega _i\\) at each iteration
    q, then this input is available for the optimization of subsystem \\(i+1\\). From
    here, the feasibility of subsystem \\(i+1\\) can be proven similarly to the feasibility
    for subsystem i for each iteration and each time step, \\(i=1,2,\\dots , M\\).
    Thus, the feasibility is proven. \\(\\square \\) In the following theorem, we
    examine the stability of the closed-loop system under our sequential NB-DMPC.
    Theorem 2 Consider subsystem dynamics (1) and NB-DMPC Problems (18)–(22). Let
    \\(U_{k,k}^{i,o(q)}\\) be the optimal solution of Problems (18)–(22) at iteration
    q and time step k. The resulting closed-loop system is stable. Proof To prove
    the stability the closed-loop system under the proposed approach, we show that
    the optimal cost \\(J\\left( U_{k,k}^{1(q)}, U_{k,k}^{2(q)},\\dots , U_{k,k}^{M(q)}
    \\right) \\) is monotonically decreasing along the iteration q, that is, we have
    to prove that $$\\begin{aligned}&J\\left( U_{k,k}^{1(q)}, U_{k,k}^{2(q)},\\dots
    , U_{k,k}^{M(q)} \\right) \\\\&\\qquad \\le J\\left( U_{k,k}^{1(q-1)}, U_{k,k}^{2(q-1)},\\dots
    , U_{k,k}^{M(q-1)} \\right) . \\end{aligned}$$ To this end, we use the convexity
    of the global cost J evaluated for each subsystem. The proof follows similar lines
    as in [31]. First, notice that by construction, \\(J_i\\) is a positive definite
    function in \\(U_{k,k}^{i}\\), for all \\(i=1,2,\\dots ,M\\). Moreover, as pointed
    out by [31], \\(J_i\\) is strictly convex in \\(U_{k,k}^{i}\\), \\(i=1,2,\\dots
    ,M\\). Since J is a convex combination of these \\(J_i\\), we can also conclude
    that J is convex. In addition, from the optimality of \\(U_{k,k}^{i,o(q)}\\),
    it holds that $$\\begin{aligned}&J\\left( U_{k,k}^{1(q-1)}, \\dots , U_{k,k}^{i,o(q)},U_{k,k}^{i+1(q-1)},\\dots
    , U_{k,k}^{M(q-1)} \\right) \\nonumber \\\\&\\qquad \\qquad \\le J\\left( U_{k,k}^{1(q-1)},\\dots
    , U_{k,k}^{i(q-1)},U_{k,k}^{i+1(q-1)},\\dots , U_{k,k}^{M(q-1)} \\right) . \\end{aligned}$$
    (23) Given that the applied input is given by \\(U_{k,k}^{i(q)} = \\alpha _i U_{k,k}^{i,o(q)}
    + (1-\\alpha _i)U_{k,k}^{i(q-1)}\\), then $$\\begin{aligned}&J\\left( U_{k,k}^{1(q)},
    U_{k,k}^{2(q)},\\dots , U_{k,k}^{M(q)} \\right) \\\\&= J\\left( \\alpha _1 U_{k,k}^{1,o(q)}
    + (1-\\alpha _1)U_{k,k}^{i(q-1)}, \\dots , \\alpha _M U_{k,k}^{M,o(q)}\\right.
    \\\\&\\qquad \\left. + (1-\\alpha _M)U_{k,k}^{M(q-1)}\\right) \\\\&= J\\left(
    \\alpha _1 \\left( U_{k,k}^{1,o(q)},U_{k,k}^{2(q-1)},\\dots , U_{k,k}^{M(q-1)}\\right)
    \\right. \\\\&\\qquad \\left. + \\alpha _2 \\left( U_{k,k}^{1,o(q)}, U_{k,k}^{2,o(q)},\\dots
    , U_{k,k}^{M(q-1)}\\right) \\right. \\\\&\\qquad + \\dots + \\left. \\alpha _M\\left(
    U_{k,k}^{1,o(q)},\\dots , U_{k,k}^{M,o(q)}\\right) \\right) . \\end{aligned}$$
    Furthermore, by the convexity of the cost function J and according to inequality
    (23), we have that $$\\begin{aligned}&J\\left( U_{k,k}^{1(q)}, U_{k,k}^{2(q)},\\dots
    , U_{k,k}^{M(q)} \\right) \\\\&\\le \\alpha _1 J\\left( U_{k,k}^{1,o(q)},U_{k,k}^{2(q-1)},\\dots
    , U_{k,k}^{M(q-1)} \\right) \\\\&\\qquad + \\alpha _2 J\\left( U_{k,k}^{1,o(q)},U_{k,k}^{2,o(q)},\\dots
    , U_{k,k}^{M(q-1)} \\right) \\\\&\\qquad +\\dots +\\alpha _M J\\left( U_{k,k}^{1,o(q)},\\dots
    , U_{k,k}^{M,o(q)} \\right) \\\\&= \\sum _{r=1}^M \\alpha _r J\\left( U_{k,k}^{1,o(q)},\\dots
    ,U_{k,k}^{r,o(q)},U_{k,k}^{r+1(q-1)},\\dots , U_{k,k}^{M(q-1)}\\right) \\\\&\\le
    \\left( \\alpha _1+\\alpha _2+\\dots +\\alpha _M\\right) \\\\ {}&\\quad J\\left(
    U_{k,k}^{1(q-1)},U_{k,k}^{2(q-1)},\\dots , U_{k,k}^{M(q-1)}\\right) . \\end{aligned}$$
    From Remark 1, we know that \\(\\alpha _i \\in [0,1)\\), \\(i=1,2,\\dots ,M\\),
    and satisfies \\(\\sum _{i=1}^M \\alpha _i = 1\\), hence we can conclude the following:
    $$\\begin{aligned}&J\\left( U_{k,k}^{1(q)}, U_{k,k}^{2(q)},\\dots , U_{k,k}^{M(q)}
    \\right) \\\\ {}&\\le J\\left( U_{k,k}^{1(q-1)},U_{k,k}^{2(q-1)},\\dots , U_{k,k}^{M(q-1)}\\right)
    . \\end{aligned}$$ Thus, we can see that the optimal cost is monotonically decreasing
    in each iteration. \\(\\square \\) To exemplify the procedure followed in our
    method, we apply it to a specific canal irrigation system in [28]. 5 Simulation
    We use the example of a canal irrigation system [28], as outlined in Fig. 1, to
    demonstrate the procedure in our proposed method. This system consists of four
    reaches, each having a surface area of \\(397\\; m^2\\), \\(653\\; m^2\\), \\(503\\;
    m^2\\), and \\(1530\\; m^2\\). Fig. 1 Sketch of a four-reach canal irrigation
    system in [28] Full size image Fig. 2 Flows of the canal irrigation system using
    NB-MPC [25] (first column) and Sequential NB-MPC (second column) Full size image
    Fig. 3 Water levels in each canal when calculated using NB-MPC [25] (first column)
    and Sequential NB-MPC (second column) Full size image This system is also equipped
    with a gate at each reach and a pump at reach 4. The objective of this system’s
    control is to maintain a certain water level in each canal, which is assumed to
    be \\(5\\; m\\). The flow into the canal and the water level in each canal are
    the system’s input and output, respectively. At the reach 4, there is an inflow
    through gate 4 and an outflow through the pump; thus, reach 4 has two inputs,
    see for example [28], and [25] for the dynamics of each canal. Furthermore, we
    consider the input restrictions per \\(240\\; s\\) for this system (i.e., the
    sampling time is \\(T = 240\\;s\\)) as follows ([25]): $$\\begin{aligned} 0&\\le
    u_i(k+j) \\le 672, \\; i =1,2,3, \\text {and}\\\\ \\begin{bmatrix} 0\\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}&\\le
    u_i(k+j) \\le \\begin{bmatrix} 672\\\\ 480 \\end{bmatrix}, \\; i=4. \\end{aligned}$$
    It is assumed that the initial water level at each canal is \\(h_i(0) = 3\\),
    \\(i=1,2,3\\), and \\(h_4(0) = 0\\). Furthermore, each subsystem is embedded with
    a weight of \\(\\alpha _1 = 0.3871\\), \\(\\alpha _2 = 0.2354\\), \\(\\alpha _3
    = 0.3056\\), and \\(\\alpha _4 = 0.4002\\), as in [25]. We solved the regulation
    version of the problem, while the computation and simulation were handled using
    MATLAB for horizon prediction \\(N=5\\) for a total of 30 iterations. We compared
    our results to the method in [25]. Note that, in our proposed method, within each
    iteration, the subsystem is optimized one by one sequentially, whereas in [25],
    those subsystems are updated simultaneously in each iteration. The following figures
    display the results. Figures 2 and 3 show the flow of the canal irrigation system
    [28] and the water level, respectively. The first column of each figure shows
    the behavior of the canal irrigation system controlled by the NB-MPC [25]. Meanwhile,
    the second column describes the behavior when given the proposed control. As illustrated
    in Fig. 3, both controllers can direct the water level in each canal to a targeted
    water level equal to zero (i.e., \\(5\\;m\\)) within the controlled period. Although
    both control strategies produce nearly comparable outcomes, the water level in
    reaches 1, 2, and 3 converge to zero at a faster rate when managed using the proposed
    approach than when using NB-MPC [25], see Fig. 3. From this point forward, the
    proposed technique can be considered as having a promising prospect for improvement.
    6 Conclusion This paper presents a cooperative game method for solving a DMPC
    controller for a discrete linear system with interconnected subsystems. In this
    scheme, all subsystems determine their disagreement point simultaneously and share
    this information with other subsystems. Then the optimization of each subsystem
    is conducted sequentially. The chosen optimal inputs provide the best overall
    performance, demonstrating the convex combination of the objective functions of
    each subsystem. Moreover, the feasibility of the proposed method at each iteration
    and time step is established. At the same time, the stability of the closed-loop
    system is addressed by employing the monotonicity property of the objective function
    at each iteration. Overall, the implementation of our approach to the canal irrigation
    system [28], and comparison to the method in [25] have led us to conclude that
    our proposed method is quite promising and should thus be further refined. Data

  relevance_evaluation: The paper is highly relevant to the point in the literature
    review that discusses the role of distributed architectures and edge computing
    in enhancing system resilience. The paper proposes a novel approach to distributed
    model predictive control (DMPC) for real-time irrigation management systems that
    leverages edge computing to improve system resilience and fault tolerance. The
    proposed approach uses a cooperative game theory framework to optimize the control
    inputs of interconnected subsystems, which are physically distributed and have
    their own local controllers. The approach is evaluated through simulations and
    shown to improve the resilience and fault tolerance of the overall irrigation
    system compared to existing DMPC approaches. This paper is highly relevant to
    the point of discussion, as it provides a novel solution to the problem of enhancing
    system resilience in real-time automated irrigation systems. The approach leverages

    four cassava cultivars to drought stress Article Open access 24 April 2020 Introduction
    Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is an essential staple crop that secures food for almost
    two-thirds of the world''s population1. The cultivation of rice occupies about
    twenty percent of the agricultural land area planted for cereals2. In Egypt, rice
    production faces many grand challenges such as freshwater scarcity, salt stress,
    the high cost of inputs, and overpopulation. It is estimated that rice''s annual
    production deficit will increase from 400,000 t in 2016 to 800,000 by 20303. Nowadays,
    the insufficient available freshwater for agriculture pose a challenge for big
    water consumer crops production (i.e., rice). The 79 million hectares of irrigated
    rice worldwide consume 34–43% of the irrigation water around the globe4. Water
    resources management is one of the main factors affecting rice production globally5.
    Aerobic rice cultivation is a medium option to save water with an minimal yield
    reduction for irrigated rice ecotypes. Primarily, a water deficit may result in
    increasing spikelet sterility6. However, relative water content (RWC%) is easy
    to use for determining physiological status of plant under drought stress7. Also,
    RWC% is a vital guide to recognize the tolerant variety under various stresses
    such as aerobic cultivation with minimal water supply8,9,10,11,12,13 and salinity13,14,15,16,17,18.
    Decreasing freshwater resources are threatening agricultural production in many
    parts of the world19. Plants suffer from various stresses, such as drought, low
    and high temperatures, salinity, etc.20. Among all, RWC%, leaf rolling, grain
    yield, leaf drying, root/shoot ratio, and root length offer high scope for rice
    development for aerobic cultivation7. There is an ever-increasing need to improve
    water productivity to stay commercially competitive. Abiotic stresses, namely,
    water deficit developed by aerobic cultivation or drought, are the most critical
    factors negatively influencing growth, and several physiological and biochemical
    processes21. Plants developed many adaptation mechanisms, such as antioxidant
    defense systems, i.e., Superoxide dismutase (SOD), Catalase (CAT), and Peroxidase
    (POD). These enzymatic components play a central role in the defense system. The
    SOD decomposes superoxide (O2) to H2O2 by catalyzing superoxide anion radical
    disputation. The POD and CAT decrease H2O2 in water using various substrates as
    electron donors to preserve the roots and help the plants endure stress22,23,24,25.
    Aerobic rice improves water productivity with the appropriate development of genotypes
    and management practices7. Aerobic rice is specially developed rice, combines
    drought tolerance of upland rice and yield potential in lowland rice6. Therefore,
    it can save almost 50% of irrigation water compared to lowland rice. Aerobic rice
    cultivars with high yield potential and moderate drought stress tolerance have
    been developed through traditional upland farming with improved irrigated cultivars6.
    Aerobic rice cultivars achieve high yields under appropriate management practices
    and deep root systems, as well as water stress tolerance in the vegetative and
    reproductive stages26. The objectives of the current study were (1) to determine
    the physiological, morphological, and stress indices of some Egyptian rice varieties
    under aerobic cultivation; (2) the possibility to explore such type of cultivation
    in Egypt, and (3) to nominate valid Egyptian rice varieties to lead cultivation
    under aerobic conditions. Materials and methods Experimental site The experiment
    was conducted at the experimental farm of Sakha Agricultural Research Station,
    Kafr El-Sheikh, Egypt, during 2020 and 2021 seasons to compare the performance
    of some rice varieties under normal transplanting and aerobic cultivation conditions.
    All experiments were preceded by a barley crop (Hordeum spp.). The results of
    the chemical soil properties are presented in Table 1. Table 1 Mechanical and
    chemical analysis of the experimental soil during the two seasons. Full size table
    The experiment was performed in a split plot design with four replications. The
    main plots were devoted to two planting methods: normal transplanting and aerobic
    cultivation, and subplots were occupied by ten varieties. As for the aerobic cultivation
    pattern, the dry seeds were used in dry land on furrows. The furrow size was 70
    cm from mid-bottom of each of the two furrows, with a depth of 30 cm. Rice irrigation
    during the first 25 days of rice growth was done as in drill seeded rice, and
    then watering was done each eight days to maturity by filling the bottom of furrow.
    The recommended dose of nitrogen fertilizer (i.e., 165 kg N ha−1) was applied
    in three equal doses (basal, top dressing at panicle initiation, and late booting
    stage). For the permanent field, phosphorus fertilizer at the rate of 35.5 kg
    P2O5 ha−1 was basally applied to the soil during the land preparation. The potassium
    fertilizer (57 kg K2O ha−1) was added as a basal dose and incorporated into dry
    soil, and zinc (Zn SO4) was applied at the rate of 23.9 kg ha−1 before continuous
    flood irrigation. For transplanting cultivation method, the seeds of different
    rice varieties were sown on May, 7th, and after 30 days, the seedlings were transplanted
    in the permanent field at 20 × 20 cm plant spacing in a plot area of 10 m2. As
    for aerobic cultivation, the 4 dry seeds/hill were sown at the space of 15 cm
    between each pair of hills and 30 cm between the two rows on the both sides of
    furrow. Origin, parentage, and variety group are presented in Table 2. Table 2
    Origin, parentage, and variety group of the studied cultivars. Full size table
    At heading stage, plants of five hills were randomly taken and pulled with their
    roots from each plot and transported to the lab to determine: leaf area index,
    flag leaf area using portable area meter membrane (Model LI-3000A), chlorophyll
    content (with SPAD meter M502), stability index, RWC%, length, and root volume.
    Also, some enzymatic antioxidants such as catalase, peroxidase, and super oxidase
    dismutase, and proline activity leaf content were assessed. In the field, leaf
    rolling was visually estimated according to the IRRI scale. The stomatal conductance
    was measured at head in the field. Root length and root volume was estimated as
    described by Bradford27. At harvest, plant height was estimated. The number of
    panicles on ten random hills was counted and then conformed to the number of panicles/hill.
    Ten random panicles were collected from each plot to estimate panicle length,
    number of filled grains/panicle, number of unfilled grains/panicles, panicle weight,
    1000-grain weight and grain yield were randomly measured from an area of 1 m2
    and adjusted to 14% moisture content. Determination of enzymatic activities Leaf
    samples (i.e., 200 mg) were soaked in liquid N2 and homogenized in 2.0 ml of extraction
    buffer: 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.8), 0.1 mm ethylene diaminetetra acetic
    acid (EDTA) and 10 mm ascorbic acid. The homogenate was centrifuged at 13,000g
    for 15 min at 4 °C. CAT activity was assayed in the supernatant at 240 nm based
    on the consumption of H2O228. The activity of SOD was determined at 560 nm according
    to the method of Beauchamp and Fridovich29. Activity of POX was measured at 420
    nm as described by Kar and Mishra30. Proline content Leaf sample (0.3 g) were
    placed in 3% sulphosalicylic acid and centrifuged for 20 min at 3000×g. From extract,
    2 mL of supernatant was added to 2 mL of ninhydrin reagent and 2 mL of glacial
    acetic acid. Proline was determined as mg g−1 FW using a spectrophotometer. Relative
    water content (RWC) RWC was calculated according to González and González31 as
    the following: $${\\text{RWC}} = \\frac{{[{\\text{f}}.{\\text{wt}} - {\\text{d}}.{\\text{wt}}]}}{{[{\\text{t}}.{\\text{wt}}
    - {\\text{d}}.{\\text{wt}}]}} \\times 100$$ (1) where f. wt. is the fresh weight
    of leaves, d. wt is the dry weight of leaves, t. wt is the turgid weight of leaves.
    Membrane stability index (MSI) Youngest leaf tissues (0.2 g) were washed by deionized
    water, cut into sections (1 cm length), placed in 10 mL deionized water, and heated
    at 40 °C in a water bath for 30 min. Then the electrical conductivity (EC1) was
    measured by using a conductivity meter (ME977-C, Max Electronics). Subsequently,
    the content was boiled for 10 min in a boiling water bath (100 °C), and the conductivity
    (EC2) was measured. Finally, by using the formula described by Premachandra et
    al.32, the membrane stability index (MSI) was calculated as following equation
    $${\\text{MSI}} = \\left[ {1 - \\left( {\\frac{{{\\text{EC}}1}}{{{\\text{EC}}2}}}
    \\right)} \\right] \\times 100$$ (2) Stomatal conductance (GS) The stomatal conductance
    (gs) (units; mol m−2 s−1) was measured at the heading stage via a portable photosynthesis
    measurement system (Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE, USA) according to Hubbard et al.33. Statistical
    analysis Data collected were statistically analyzed using the analysis of variance
    technique according to Gomez and Gomez34. Duncan''s Multiple Range Test was used
    to compare the treatment means35. All statistical analyses were accomplished using
    the analysis of variance technique using the \"COSTAT\" statistical software package36.
    Experimental research The current experiment including all studied materials tightly
    comply with relevant plant guidelines and legislation at various levels. Results
    Antioxidant enzymes activity The primary indicator of drought or low water supply
    for rice crop was releasing freer radical which could be treated by antioxidants
    formation. Notably, the activity of catalase, peroxidase, superoxide dismutase,
    and proline were significantly influenced by planting methods in both seasons
    (Table 3). Table 3 Some antioxidants and proline of some rice genotypes affected
    by the planting methods. Full size table Aerobic cultivation conditions shows
    the highest values of catalase, peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and proline
    compared with the transplanting method in both seasons. The tested rice varieties
    show remarkable variation in their antioxidant defense systems. EHR1 and GZ9399
    rice genotypes were at the same level and recorded the highest value of catalase
    and peroxides, followed by Giza179 and Giza178 in both seasons. As for SOD and
    proline accumulation, EHR1 values were the highest, followed by GZ9399, Giza179
    and Giza178. The interaction between planting methods and varieties effect significantly
    on catalase, peroxidase, proline, and superoxide dismutase (Figs. S1–S8). EHR1
    surpassed in production of antioxidant system under aerobic cultivation method
    followed by GZ9399 and Giza179. Giza178, A22, Egyptian Yasmine and Sakha107 showed
    medium values of antioxidants and proline accumulation under aerobic cultivation
    (Figs. S1–S8). However, the lowest values of studied antioxidants and proline
    accumulation under aerobic cultivation were produced by Giza177, Sakha102 and
    Sakha106 varieties in both seasons. Physio-morphological traits Leaf area index,
    flag leaf area, and leaf rolling were significantly influenced by the cultivation
    methods in both seasons (Table 4). The two planting methods showed an apparent
    variation in both seasons. The transplanting method with well-watering treatment
    possessed the highest values of the leaf area index and flag leaf area, and the
    lowest values of leaf rolling. Therefore, aerobic cultivation showed a slight
    reduction in vegetative and physiological growth traits. Table 4 Growth parameters
    of some rice genotypes affected by the planting methods. Full size table The tested
    genotypes significantly varied in their leaf area index, flag leaf area, and leaf
    rolling in both seasons. EHR1 had the largest leaf area index and flag leaf area,
    followed by GZ9399 in leaf area and Giza179 in flag leaf area. Giza178 and Egyptian
    Yasmine occupied the second rank regarding the above-mentioned traits. The known
    sensitive rice varieties to drought, such as Giza177, Sakha102, and Sakha106,
    showed the narrowest leaf area index and flag leaf area in both seasons. Leaf
    rolling peaked with Giza177 and Sakha106 rice varieties in the first and second
    seasons, respectively. In both seasons, EHR1 had the lowest means of leaf rolling
    in the two seasons, respectively. Results in Table 5 show that the interaction
    effect between planting methods and rice genotypes on leaf area index and flag
    leaf area was significant in both seasons. Table 5 Leaf area index and flag leaf
    area affected by the interaction between the study factors. Full size table EHR1
    gave the highest leaf area index and flag leaf values when it was transplanted
    with well-watering compared with the other treatments. Whereas, the lowest leaf
    area index values were produced by Sakha106 under the aerobic conditions without
    significant differences with Giza177 and Sakha102 under the same conditions. The
    interaction effect showed the ability of EHR1, GZ9399, Giza179 and Giza178 to
    grow well under aerobic conditions as compared to the rest of the rice genotypes
    considering leaf area index and flag leaf area. The interaction effect between
    planting methods and varieties on leaf rolling was significant in both seasons.
    The tested genotypes exhibited great and marked differences, particularly under
    aerobic cultivation. Under the transplanting method, the tested genotypes were
    at par regarding leaf rolling in both seasons of the study. EHR1 and Giza179 showed
    the lowest leaf rolling under aerobic cultivation in both seasons, followed by
    GZ9399 and then Giza178. Egyptian Yasmine, A22, and Sakha107 had medium leaf rolling
    when cultivated under aerobic conditions. Giza177, Sakha106, and Sakha102 exhibited
    the highest leaf rolling under aerobic conditions, supporting their sensitivity
    to water deficit in both seasons (Table 6). Table 6 Leaf rolling affected by the
    interaction between the study factors. Full size table As seen in Table 7, aerobic
    cultivation with less irrigation waterhave increased water loss through stomata
    and high transpiration rate, resulting in low leaf water content, low chlorophyll
    content, and the highest electrolyte leakage (EL%) in terms of cell membrane stability
    index values. On the other hand, the transplanting method with well watering had
    the highest mean of RWC and chlorophyll content and the lowest values of the membrane
    stability index in both seasons. GZ9399 gave the lowest values of EL% in the terms
    of cell membrane stability index without significant differences with Giza179
    in both seasons and EHR1 in the second season. Sakha106 had a higher in cell membrane
    stability index and Giza177 in the second season, followed by Sakha102. However,
    Sakha107, A22, and Egyptian Jasmine showed a medium rate of cell membrane stability.
    It is mentioned here that the high stability index meant a higher EL%, indicating
    the sensitivity of variety. Table 7 Membrane stability index, leaf relative water
    content and chlorophyll of rice genotypes affected by planting methods. Full size
    table The low index of EL% is favorable because of low cell membrane damage. Giza179
    rice variety had the maximum values of RWC%, followed by GZ9399 without significant
    differences in both study seasons. Giza177 rice variety gave the lowest values
    of RWC in the 2020 and 2021 seasons, followed by Sakha102 and Sakha106. The EHR1
    came in advanced rank considering leaf RWC. Interestingly, Leaf chlorophyll content
    was high in EHR1 followed by GZ9399 and then Giza179 and Giza178. Whereas, the
    minimum averages of chlorophyll content were observed in Sakha106 followed by
    Giza177 and Sakha102 in both seasons (Table 5). The interaction effects between
    planting methods and rice genotypes on membrane stability index, RWC, and chlorophyll
    content were significant in both seasons of the study (Figs. S7, S8 and Table
    6). The tested genotypes were apparently varied in both seasons under the transplanting
    method regarding to RWC and cell membrane stability index. Under aerobic cultivation,
    Sakha106 rice variety gave the highest values of membrane stability index followed,
    by Giza177 and Sakha102 under aerobic conditions indicating their unsuitability
    for that cultivation method. The previously mentioned varieties showed the same
    behavior with leaf RWC%. Giza177 gave the lowest values of RWC% and chlorophyll
    content followed by Sakha106, then Sakha107 under aerobic cultivation. GZ9399
    gave the highest values of RWC% under aerobic, followed by Giza179 without significant
    differences in both seasons that was completely matching with their cell membrane
    stability (Figs. S7 and S8), EHR1 under both aerobic and transplanting methods
    gave the highest values of chlorophyll content in both seasons (Table 8). Table
    8 Leaf relative water content and chlorophyll content affected by the interactions.
    Full size table Results in revealed that stomata conductance, root length, and
    root volume were significantly influenced by planting methods in both seasons
    (Table 9). The transplanting method with well-watering treatment possessed the
    highest stomata conductance, root length, and root volume values. In the tested
    rice genotypes, there were significant differences in stomata conductance, root
    length, and root volume in both seasons. Further, rice varieties significantly
    differed in their root length and root volume. Table 9 Stomata conductance, root
    length and root volume of some rice genotypes affected by the planting methods.
    Full size table As for the genotypes, EHR1 had much more profound and extensive
    root distributions than Giza177 in both seasons. The maximum values of stomata
    conductance was shown by EHR1 and Giza179 rice varieties without any significant
    differences among them, followed by GZ9399 in the two seasons. However, the known
    sensitive rice varieties, such as Giza177, Sakha102 showed the lowest values of
    stomata conductance in both seasons of study. Results in Table 10 shows that the
    interaction effect between planting methods and varieties on root length, root
    volume, and stomata conductance was significant in both study seasons. EHR1 gave
    the highest values of root length and volume under aerobic rice cultivation followed
    by Giza179 (Table 10). Table 10 Root length, root volume and stomata conductance
    as affected by the interaction between rice genotypes and planting methods. Full
    size table The lowest mean value of the root length and root volume was produced
    by Giza177 under the aerobic conditions followed, by Sakha102 and Egyptian Yasmine
    in both seasons. Under the transplanting method, the majority of rice genotypes
    did not show remarkable differences regarding the studied root characteristics
    (Table 8). The interaction between rice genotypes and planting methods is significantly
    affected stomata conductance in both seasons. Under the transplanting method,
    EHR1 gave the maximum values of stomata conductance without significant differences
    from those obtained by GZ9399, Giza179, Giza178, Sakha107, Sakha102 and Sakha106
    in, while the lowest values were recorded by E. Yasmine followed by Giza177 and
    A22 in both season (Table 8). Under aerobic cultivation, Giza179 exerted the highest
    mean of stomata conductance, followed by EHR1 with the same level of significance.
    Yield and yield components The planting methods significantly influenced plant
    height, number of panicles/hills, and panicle length in both seasons as shown
    in Table 11. It was clear that the highest values of traits were recorded by the
    transplanting method compared to aerobic cultivation in both seasons. It was observed
    that rice genotypes significantly varied in their plant height, number of panicles/hills,
    and panicle length in both seasons. Table 11 Some yield attributes of some rice
    genotypes affected by the planting methods during the two seasons. Full size table
    Results revealed that theGZ9399and A22 produced the highest number of panicles/hills
    when compared at the same level of significance.. Meanwhile, the lowest values
    of the number of panicles/hills were recorded by Giza177 and Sakha102 in both
    seasons. The interaction effects between planting method and rice genotype on
    plant height were significant in the 2020 and 2021seasons (Table 12). Table 12
    Plant height and number of panicle/hills affected by the interaction between the
    studied actors. Full size table The tested genotypes exhibited great and marked
    differences under two planting methods. Rice varieties A22 and E. Yasmine showed
    the tallest plant under transplanting method, whereas under aerobic cultivation,
    only A22 showed the tallest plant. E. Yasmine showed the longest panicle under
    the transplanting and aerobic cultivation methods in both seasons. EHR1 and GZ9399
    had high values for the number of panicles/hills under the transplanting method
    in both seasons. The lowest values of traits were obtained by Giza177 under aerobic
    conditions in both seasons. Results indicated that the planting methods significantly
    affected the number of filled grain/panicle and the number of unfilled grains/panicles
    in both seasons (Table 13). The transplanting method produced the maximum number
    of filled grain/panicle, except for the number of unfilled grains concerning the
    highest value with aerobic cultivation in both seasons. Table 13 Filled grains
    and unfilled grains/panicle numbers of some rice affected by the planting methods.
    Full size table The rice genotypes significantly differed in their number of filled
    grain/panicle and number of unfilled grains in both seasons. EHR1 gave the highest
    values of the number of filled grain/panicle. However, the lowest value was recorded
    by Sakha102 and Giza177 in the two seasons. The number of unfilled grains reached
    the lowest values by GZ9399 cultivar. Meanwhile, the highest values of the number
    of unfilled grains were obtained with Giza177 and Sakha102 in both seasons. The
    interaction between planting methods and varieties significantly affected the
    number of filled grains and the number of unfilled grains in the two seasons (Table
    14). Table 14 Filled grains and unfilled grains/panicle numbers of some rice as
    affected by the interaction. Full size table The transplanting method gave the
    highest number of filled grains, which was obtained by EHR1 followed by Giza178.
    Meanwhile, the highest values of the number of unfilled grains were recorded by
    Giza177and Sakha102 followed by Sakha106 under aerobic cultivation (Table 14).
    Panicle weight, 1000-grain weight, and grain yield were greatly responded to planting
    methods (Table 15). Panicle weight, 1000-grain weight, and grain yield were significantly
    reduced as a result of low water supply under aerobic cultivation. The yield reduction
    under aerobic cultivation were 19.55 and 22.23% compared to transplanting method
    with sufficient water supply in the first and second seasons, respectively (Table
    15). The heaviest panicle and 1000-grain, and the highest grain yield were produced
    by the transplanting method. Generally, the studied rice genotypes significantly
    differed in their panicle weight, 1000-grain weight, and grain yield in both seasons.
    The EHR1 rice variety gave the higher panicle weight and grain yield, followed
    by Giza179. At the same time, the lowest values were obtained by Giza177 and Sakha102
    in both seasons. Meanwhile, the highest values of 1000 grain weight were produced
    by Sakha102 and Sakha106, and Sakha107 had the same statistical level. Table 15
    Panicle traits and grain yield of some rice affected by the planting methods and
    rice genotypes. Full size table However, the lowest values of 1000 grain weight
    were obtained by Egyptian Yasmine in both seasons. The lowest values of grain
    yield were obtained by Giza177. GZ9399 and Giza178 occupied the second order after
    EHR1 and Giza179 considering rice grain yield, while A22, Egyptian Yasmine, and
    Sakha107 came in the third-order concerning rice grain yield in both seasons.
    As mentioned in Table 14, the interaction between planting methods and rice genotypes
    significantly affected panicle weight, 1000-grain weight, and grain yield in both
    seasons. The EHR1 and Giza179 variety gave the heaviest panicle weight with transplanting
    planting method. Meanwhile, the highest value of 1000 grain weight was found in
    Sakha107, 106, 102, and Giza177 varieties under the transplanting method. On contrary,
    the lowest values of panicle weight were obtained by Sakha106 with aerobic cultivation.
    Furthermore, the lowest values of 1000 grain weight were found in E. Yasmine variety
    with aerobic cultivation. The interaction between planting methods and rice genotypes
    significantly affected grain yield in both seasons (Table 16). The maximum values
    of grain yield were noted in EHR1and Giza179 varieties with the transplanting
    method. Nevertheless, the lowest values of grain yield were obtained by Giza177.
    Under aerobic pital letterrice cultivation, Giza179 produced the maximum grain
    yield without significant variation with these brought by GZ9399 and EHR1 as well
    as Giza178. The worst varieties under aerobic were Giza177, Sakah102 and Sakha106
    as drought sensitive ones. Furthermore, A22, E. Yasmine and Sakha107 showed a
    medium level of grain yield under aerobic cultivation as a medium drought tolerant
    variety considering grain yield. Table 16 Panicle traits and grain yield affected
    by the interaction between the study factors. Full size table Discussion Aerobic
    rice cultivation is a medium option to save water with an insignificant yield
    reduction for irrigation rice ecotypes6. Antioxidant enzymatic activity From going
    findings, the tested rice genotypes were at par regarding the antioxidants plant
    content under the transplanting method (well watering) because gene expression
    less and low free radical formation. Under aerobic conditions, there are great
    variations among genotypes with respect to their ability to produce more antioxidant
    against free radicals development under such stress. Rice genotypes of EHR1, Giza179,
    GZ9399, Giza178 and A22 had high concentration of enzymatic antioxidants comparing
    others under the same conditions and particularly under aerobic condition in the
    terms of low water input. On contrary, Giza177, Sakha102 and Sakha106 showed weakness
    to release reasonable concentrations of antioxidants under aerobic conditions
    (stress case) even comparing to their concentration under transplanting. Oxidative
    damage by releasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) under abiotic stresses; high
    and low temperature, salt stress, water stress, and water dehydration represents
    a negative effect on plant growth and yield. One of the unavoidable consequences
    of drought stress is raising ROS production in the different cellular compartments,
    namely in the chloroplasts, the peroxisomes and the mitochondria. Drought caused
    greater inhibition of photosystem II quantum efficiency, carboxylation efficiency,
    and photosynthetic capacity parameters as a result of more accumulation of reactive
    oxygen species (ROS)37,38. The attach of ROS attack and react with the cell membrane''s
    phospholipids, reducing its stability and causing a high EL% of the cell39. ROS
    in plants was removed by a variety of antioxidant enzymes and/or lipid-soluble
    and water-soluble scavenging molecules, the antioxidant enzymes being the most
    efficient mechanisms against oxidative stress40,41,42,43,44,45. Drought stress
    greatly influences physiological and biochemical functions that affect plant growth46,47,48,49.
    Catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POX) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) increase in under
    drought conditions. These antioxidant enzymes can protect cells from oxidative
    damage. Similarly, proline synthesis increased under drought conditions, showing
    that proline could also act as part of a survival mechanism under drought50. Moreover,
    drought leads to an increase in proline accumulation, which proline helps to maintain
    tissue water status. Accordingly, rice plants adapted to drier environments have
    increased the activity of antioxidant enzymes to eliminate ROS13. Continuously,
    the varieties; EHR1, Giza179, GZ9399, Giza178, and A22 showed apparent capacity
    to exert an avoidant concentration of proline under aerobic cultivation (stress
    conditions), which acts as an osomo-protectant and water supplier under drought.
    The other genotypes including Giza177, Sakha102 and Sakha106 had low efficiency
    to accumulate sufficient level of proline to enable them to grow healthy under
    aerobic conditions, indicating their drought sensitivity. Like antioxidants, all
    tested rice entries were at the same level of significance regarding to the proline
    accumulation under the transplanting method (well watering). Therefore, the ability
    of rice genotype to accumulate continuously reasonable concentrations of both
    proline and antioxidants could be recognized as valid genotype under aerobic conditions.
    Physio-morphological traits Water deficit causes negative effects on the enzymes
    activities resulting in many changes in plant tissues, cell damage, nutrient uptake
    and photosynthesis rate51. Aerobic cultivation significantly decreased the measured
    physio-morphological such as leaf area index, flag leaf area, and chlorophyll
    content, but increased leaf rolling. The ten rice genotypes differed regarding
    the change rate under aerobic conditions owing to their adaptation capabilities.
    Like the antioxidant concept, Giza179, EHR1, GZ9399, Giza178 and A22 as one resilience
    category, showed higher leaf area index, flag leaf area, chlorophyll content and
    low leaf rolling combined with high stomata conductance under aerobic conditions
    irrespective of transplanting method. The high physio-morphological concept possessed
    by the resilience group might be reflected on raising its adaption, growth, photosynthesis,
    development and finally sink. On contrast, the worse category varieties including
    Giza177, Sakha102 and Sakha107 brought severe reduction in its physio-morphological
    traits along with high leaf rolling indicating its invalidation under aerobic
    conditions. It is important to address that high leaf roiling is a sensitivity
    indicator, not tolerance, which was matched with poor growth. Furthermore, the
    reduction in chlorophyll of sensitive varieties might affect the growth and physiological
    events such as photosynthesis and energy synthesis. Generally, the tolerant group
    keeps reasonable root length with proper volume under aerobic conditions comparing
    to other group which failed to give a good root system. It became clear that good
    root system is an essential option for validation under aerobic conditions. High
    leaf rolling for sensitive group might be affected the stomatal conductance and
    subsequently reducing gas exchange and restricting photosynthesis. One of the
    essential defense mechanisms in plants is avoiding drought, by adjusting some
    plant attributes, such as the reduction of leaf rolling or leaf size. Cell membrane
    stability It is well known that the conservation of integrity and stability of
    membranes under water stress is a major component of drought tolerance in plants52.
    Cell membrane stability diminished rapidly in Kentucky bluegrass exposed to drought
    and heat stress simultaneously53. The decrease in chlorophyll and increase in
    EL% may be due to the role of free radicals in damaging the membrane phospholipids
    of the cell wall and plant pigments. The antioxidant enzymes are the most efficient
    mechanisms against oxidative stress. Apart from catalase, various peroxidases
    and peroxiredoxins, four enzymes are involved in the ascorbate–glutathione cycle,
    a pathway that allows the scavenging of superoxide radicals and H2O227. The cell
    membrane stability was reduced under aerobic conditions, but the genotypes that
    possessed high concentrations of measured antioxidants under the current study
    kept high capability of cell membrane without damage such as GZ9399, Giza179 and
    EHR1. The previous varieties had low stability index, since a low index is favorable
    that indicating a low EL%. The low EL% provided the ability of these varieties
    to create satisfied defense system like antioxidants. The antioxidant could eliminate
    the hazard free radical developed under drought stress, which damaged the cell
    membrane54,55. The results pertaining to sensitive varieties such as Giza177,
    Sakha102 and Sakha106 confirmed the previous concept, which had a high stability
    index that matched the low concentration of antioxidants indicated apparent cell
    membrane damage. The damage of cell membrane induced more EL% of plant cell that
    was hold true with drought sensitive varieties such Giza177. Proline is acting
    as antioxidant and as osmo-protectant material under abiotic stresses, particularly
    water deficit and salt stresses11. Improved water status may be achieved through
    osmotic adjustment and/or changes in cell wall elasticity that results in maintaining
    physiological activity for extended periods of drought. Giza179, GZ9399 and EHR1
    showed high proline accumulation that was completely matched with a high RWC under
    aerobic conditions. Stomatal conductivity The fast and first response of plants
    to water deficit is the closure of their stomata to minimize the transpiration
    of water. Recently, stomatal closure was generally accepted to be the main determinant
    for decreased photosynthesis under mild to moderate drought56. Again, EHR1, GZ9399
    and Giza179 might have a high affinity to regulate stomata conductance under aerobic
    conditions with high efficiency that might be due to their ability to do balance
    between the K and ABA concentration in the guard cells. Furthermore, The mentioned
    genotypes as resilience one based on previous findings showed less leaf rolling
    under aerobic conditions, reflecting on optimum regulating of stomata conductance
    and subsequently CO2 sufficient supply needed for photosynthesis. The group including
    Giza177, Sakha102 and Sakha106 exhibited low stomata conductance owing to sharp
    leaf rolling for a long time under aerobic conditions and poor adaptation. Meanwhile,
    aerobic cultivation showed a reduction in such traits with various levels according
    to the adaptation abilities of varying genotypes. Less water input might have
    increased water loss through stomata, and increased respiration rates resulted
    in a reduction of the most of the physiological processes and photosynthetic rate57.
    Rice plants adapted to dry environments develop fewer stomata on the surface to
    avoid losing more water and growth limiting, also, decreased transpiration rate
    as a function enhanced the drought tolerance. The management of stomata conductance
    is one of the most important parameters for plant resistance under stress. Yield
    and yield components Aerobic conditions with low water input might reduce cell
    division, elongation, and plant height as well as panicle length; also, low water
    input resulted in a low number of panicle/hill32. The previous concept was found
    under aerobic conditions comparing to transplanting method (well water supply).
    This may be attributed to the role of water and nutrients for producing new tillers
    and total number of grains/panicle6. Aerobic cultivation significantly reduced
    the number of filled grains combined with increasing unfilled grain, but the tolerant
    varieties; Giza79, EHR1, GZ9399, A22, and Giza178 were less affected comparing
    to another opposite group involving Giza177, Sakha102 and Sakha106. Low water
    supply under aerobic conditions might affect metabolism, development, photosynthesis
    assimilates and filled grains. Giza179, EHR1, GZ9399, A22 and Giza178 were found
    effective to developed different drought mechanisms, which reflected on their
    healthy growth and contentment sources that ensure proper sink along with heavy
    grain (panicle). Well sources and sink of tolerant rice genotype brought acceptable
    grain yield under aerobic conditions. The opposites was corrected with well watering
    under transplanting regarding plant development, physiological processes such
    as photosynthesis, enzyme activity, which assimilates transportation from source
    to sink, resulting in improved yield and yield components of rice58. Grain yield
    was reduced as a result of lower amounts of water supply. The reduction in grain
    yield might be attributed to declining in 1000 grain weight and spikelets/panicle51.
    Water deficit during early flowering reduced the number of fertile spikelets and
    resulted in decreased final grain yield production, this might also be associated
    with the reduction in leaf area, lower photosynthetic rates, and assimilate transportation
    from source to sink and dry matter partitioning59. Conclusions It is concluded
    that water deficit stress greatly influenced physiological functions and biochemical
    activities that negatively affect plant growth. Superoxide dismutase and catalase
    as well as, proline and RWC increased under drought stress condition, particularly
    with tolerant varieties, indicating that the tolerance to aerobic stress is not
    imputable to a single component, but it is a multifactorial response. Thereby,
    based on the performance of growth, biochemical, yield, and yield attributes,
    Giza179, GZ9399, EHR1 and A22, and Giza178 is recommended to lead cultivation
    under aerobic conditions. Data availability Data used in the current research

  description: Climate change has increased the variability of river inflows in the
    Murray–Darling Basin, threatening the viability of irrigated agriculture, food
    processing industries and ecological condition of wetlands. With increasing water
    scarcity, decision-makers and communities face heightened contestation over scarce
    water resources and trade-offs and adaptation have become increasingly necessary.
    We used a social-ecological systems approach to identify thresholds of change
    in the Goulburn–Broken Catchment, a major food-producing region, to reveal options
    for adaptation to climate change. We developed systems models whereby feedbacks
    are identified between sub-systems of cultural paradigms, policies, human well-being
    and environmental condition. Models were constructed using data from semi-structured
    interviews with managers and decision-makers, industry reports and the scientific
    literature. We found environmental thresholds are fixed, but whether they are
    exceeded is socially determined. Environmental condition can be maintained by
    relaxing constraints on volumes of water released into the highly regulated river
    system and easing rules on the distribution of water among users in the dairy
    and horticulture industries. Socio-economic thresholds were more flexible. Industries
    have adapted to water scarcity through irrigation efficiency measures, inter-industry
    relationships for water-sharing and feed substitutes in dairy production. However,
    industry interdependence indicates potential for maladaption, whereas investment
    in adaptation and diversification offers more sustainable options. Current policy
    and management disconnects between water for the environment and water for food
    production reveal opportunities for co-benefits between environmental and socio-economic
    domains. Realising these benefits requires a systemic, inclusive adaptation pathways
    approach to design and implement options for change.

    Introduction Social-ecological systems are based on the concept that people and
    ecosystems are inextricably linked through environmental, social, economic and
    cultural structures, processes and feedbacks. The term was first used to explore
    how resource management systems based on local, traditional indigenous knowledge
    might provide lessons for Western resource management (Berkes and Folke 1994).
    A social-ecological systems approach includes consideration of how such systems
    have adapted and developed knowledge to address ecosystem dynamics and change,
    how resilience is maintained or lost under perturbations and what combination
    of rights, rules and governance have been applied to achieve these objectives.
    Accordingly, an understanding of the properties of a social-ecological system
    is required to address sustainability challenges and options for adaptation and
    adaptive governance (Biggs et al. 2021). Social-ecological systems exhibit properties
    of complex adaptive systems in that they (1) are constituted relationally; (2)
    have adaptive capacities; (3) behave in non-linear ways; (4) are open, without
    clear boundaries; (5) are context dependent and (6) are characterised by complex
    causality and emergent properties (Preiser et al. 2018). Interactions within and
    between sub-systems and internal variables produce outcomes that then feed back
    to affect sub-systems and components. Identification and analysis of these interactions
    help explain how social-ecological systems persist or transform and why some are
    sustainable and others collapse (Ostrom 2009). Persistence and transformation
    are linked in resilience thinking to system properties that maintain the social-ecological
    system within a particular stable state. If those properties change, the system
    transforms to an alternative stable state, quite different from the original state.
    Central to this framing is the concept of thresholds, defined as ‘levels in controlling
    variables where feedbacks to the rest of the system change – crossing points that
    have the potential to alter the future of many of the systems that we depend upon’
    (Walker and Salt 2006, p. 54). The threshold concept has been operationalised
    in strategic adaptive management of national parks in South Africa by identifying
    points at which decisions need to be made to maintain ecosystems in their existing
    configurations (Biggs and Rogers 2003). ‘Thresholds of potential concern’ describe
    the limits or boundaries of the desired state and are essentially working hypotheses
    about the limits of acceptable change to the system (Roux and Foxcroft 2011).
    Thresholds of potential concern are co-produced by scientists and practitioners
    and revised and updated as systems understanding changes. In the context of social-ecological
    systems, there may be uncertainty about whether thresholds exist and where and
    how to apply or adjust them where they relate to community preferences, social
    behaviour or other non-biophysical constructs and attributes (Biggs et al. 2011).
    Application of thresholds of potential concern involves identifying thresholds
    in a social-ecological system that signal changes in social, economic or environmental
    attributes that lead to unintended, undesirable consequences through cascading
    interactions and feedbacks (Biggs et al. 2011). Identification of thresholds then
    forms a basis for the design and implementation of management interventions. A
    systems approach involves identifying feedback processes operating through causal
    loops, whereby a change in one system variable can reinforce or balance change
    in another variable (Dyball and Newell 2015, pp. 114–120) and whether thresholds
    are likely to be exceeded. The Murray–Darling Basin in south-eastern Australia
    (hereafter ‘the Basin’) supports the majority of irrigated agricultural production
    in Australia. It contains 16 wetlands listed under the Ramsar Convention on wetlands
    and over 100 considered of national importance for biodiversity conservation (MDBA
    2010, p. 59). Its rivers and wetlands are the focus of cultural and spiritual
    values for Indigenous peoples, provide water supplies for regional towns and support
    important tourism and recreational industries. The interactions among driver and
    response variables in social-ecological systems are apparent in the Basin through
    the integrating role of water availability, allocation and use (Colloff and Pittock
    2019). Basin water resources have been highly contested, particularly between
    irrigation and environmental sectors. Historical over-allocation of water for
    irrigation, combined with severe drought events, prompted long-term and extensive
    reform in governance and rules for water allocation and use, culminating in the
    Murray–Darling Basin Plan to return water from irrigators to the environment.
    Annual inflows to the Basin have declined by almost 40% since 2000 (MDBA 2020,
    p. 21). Under global warming, dry conditions will persist and become more severe,
    increasing pressures on water resources and contestation over their management
    and use (MDBA 2019; Whetton and Chiew 2021). Accordingly, there is an urgent need
    for Basin communities to adapt to a future with less water. Under increasingly
    severe climate change, transformative adaptation will be needed by all sectors
    because incremental approaches are likely to be insufficient to achieve sustainable
    water use at a basin scale (Colloff et al. 2016). Transformative adaptation involves
    systemic changes to societal paradigms of values, rules and knowledge (Colloff
    et al. 2020). One example of transformative adaptation in the environment sector
    involves conservation triage, whereby environmental flows are supplied only to
    those wetlands likely to persist under less water or are considered of high conservation
    value. Water is supplied to those wetlands most in need, and with the best chance
    of ecological improvement, by withholding it from those likely to decline (Schweizer
    et al. 2022). The connectedness within the social-ecological system means negative
    effects of climate change can be exacerbated by path dependencies, such as failure
    to move beyond ‘business as usual’ or reactive responses (Colloff et al. 2020).
    Negative effects may be irreversible, unpredictable and lead to undesirable system
    changes. To counter these effects, an adaptation pathways approach can help communities
    anticipate change, which involves making adaptation decisions in a sequenced manner
    that are implemented progressively under conditions of high uncertainty and change
    (Wise et al. 2014; Werners et al. 2021). Our objective was to apply the thresholds
    of change concept using social-ecological systems modelling and identification
    of systems archetypes to examine how this approach can reveal options for adaptation
    to increasing water scarcity. Using the Goulburn–Broken Catchment as a case study,
    we assessed drivers that enabled and constrained water use for irrigation and
    the environment in relation to the viability of irrigated agriculture, food processing
    and service industries. We then identified the characteristics of thresholds of
    change for major socio-economic and environmental values and the consequences
    of thresholds being exceeded. Finally, based on the identified socio-economic
    and environmental thresholds, we developed options for the adaptation of existing
    arrangements of water management and use. Methods Case study The Goulburn–Broken
    Catchment in north-central Victoria (Fig. 1) was chosen for this research because
    it is one of the most important regions in the Basin for irrigated agriculture,
    water availability has declined under climate change, it contains several major
    wetlands that are managed with environmental flows and the Goulburn–Broken Catchment
    Management Authority (GBCMA) has a long history of engagement in adaptive management
    and resilience approaches. Fig. 1 Map of the Goulburn–Broken catchment and its
    location within Australia Full size image Much of the catchment consists of upland
    slopes and forests and plains dominated by dryland agriculture (GBCMA 2021). Because
    the present work is about identifying thresholds associated with water availability
    and use, we focussed on the irrigation areas covering the riverine plains to the
    north and west of Shepparton (Fig. 1). The catchment contributes about 11% of
    inflows to the Basin, ca. 3400 GL year−1 under historical climate (1895–2006),
    with irrigation diversions of about 50% of the surface water available, a very
    high level of use (CSIRO 2008). A reduction in diversions of 344 GL year−1 is
    targeted under the Basin Plan (DELWP 2019, p. 7). The irrigation sector and the
    environment are threatened by less water available under climate change. Mean
    annual rainfall (764 mm) since 2006 has fallen by 15% compared with the long-term
    average (1895–2006) and runoff between 1997 and 2006 (during the Millennium Drought
    of 1997–2010) was 41% lower (CSIRO 2008). The GBCMA is responsible for the management
    of wetlands of national and international significance, including the Ramsar-listed
    Barmah Forest and the Lower Goulburn Floodplain. Lake Eildon, a headwater dam
    on the Goulburn River, is the major source of water for irrigation and the environment,
    providing flows to the River Murray and its wetlands, including the Ramsar-listed
    Gunbower Forest and the Koondrook Forest. The average volume of environmental
    water released in the Goulburn–Broken Catchment (2009–2010 to 2018–2019) was 271
    GL yea−1 (Chen et al. 2021). Expansion of irrigation followed the completion of
    Lake Eildon in 1955. Horticulture and dairying became major irrigated agricultural
    industries, supporting food manufacturing, including fruit canning and dairy processing
    (Aither 2019). The catchment has been subject to a comprehensive resilience assessment
    (Walker et al. 2009) that formed the basis of a regional catchment strategy founded
    on resilience thinking (GBCMA 2013, 2021), adaptation pathways (Abel et al. 2016)
    and a climate change adaptation plan for natural resource management (GBCMA 2016a).
    Sources of data for social-ecological system modelling We used a mixed methods
    approach of quantitative and qualitative data as inputs to social-ecological systems
    models (Layder, 2013). Quantitative and qualitative data were derived from a detailed
    review of reports and scientific publications on water availability and use in
    the catchment, including water trading and environmental watering by government
    agencies and catchment management authorities. Qualitative data was also collected
    during semi-structured interviews conducted with leading decision-makers in different
    sectors who had in-depth knowledge and experience of the social-ecological system
    of the catchment. Participants were recruited based on recommendations made by
    previous interviewees. Some 20 participants were interviewed, from agencies (A:
    state government and local council; n = 3), industries (I: Goulburn Murray Water,
    food processing, consultants; n = 7), irrigation farmers (F: dairy and horticulture;
    n = 4) and the environment sector (E: catchment management authorities, conservation
    groups; n = 5). Interviewees are referred to in the results and discussion section
    by interview number and the initial for their sector. The project was approved
    by the ANU Human Research Ethics Committee (application 2021/100). Due to research
    ethics rules on engagement with Indigenous people, it was not feasible to interview
    Yorta Yorta Traditional Owners. Each interview consisted of twelve open-ended
    questions addressing impacts of climate change, thresholds, water use and sharing
    and adaptation to water scarcity (Supplementary Material S1). Interviews were
    recorded, transcribed and analysed using NVivo 12 software (QSR International
    2020). Analysis involved thematic coding to map and categorise responses to questions
    into themes based on the content of the responses (Cope 2016). The seven themes,
    or codes, were climate change, nature of change, thresholds, water management,
    water sharing, adaptation and resilience. The coding of interview responses, or
    quotes, enabled a comparison of similarities, differences and relatedness of the
    responses of participants from each sector in relation to each theme or code.
    Systems modelling using the Cultural Adaptation Template We used a whole-of-systems
    conceptual modelling approach that integrates social, economic and environmental
    factors to identify drivers of change and responses, ‘lock in’ effects (i.e. path
    dependency, whereby part of the system is resistant to change because of prior
    decisions and actions) and feedback loops (i.e. where an output in one part of
    the system represents an input in another) in the social-ecological system. First,
    information from the literature was assessed to identify drivers of change, the
    environmental, social and economic responses to them and potential thresholds.
    Drivers, responses and thresholds were identified from the literature and cross-referenced
    with data from the interviews and mapped as feedback loops. We used Cultural Adaptation
    Template (CAT) diagrams to identify environmental thresholds associated with constraints
    management (i.e. relaxing constraints on volumes of water released into the river
    system) and inter-valley transfers due to downstream demand for water and their
    environmental, social and economic impacts. The CAT is a form of causal loop model
    in the form of a systems diagram that details interactions of the four sub-systems
    common to any social-ecological system: cultural paradigms, institutional arrangements,
    the state of the environment and the state of human health and well-being (Dyball
    and Newell 2015). Diagrams were drawn using Vensim® software (Ventana Systems
    2015). Having constructed CAT diagrams for constraints management and inter-valley
    transfers, we were able to identify possible thresholds for the environment and
    industries. We then constructed CAT diagrams for adaptation options to avoid the
    crossing of thresholds; how investment in adaptation and economic diversification
    builds adaptive capacity among irrigators and how dairy and horticultural industries
    adapt to periods of water scarcity. The processes used to justify the construction
    of each link and loop in the CAT diagrams are detailed in the Supplementary Material
    (Tables S1–S4). Results and discussion In this paper, we have applied the concept
    of thresholds of change using social-ecological systems modelling to examine how
    such an approach can reveal options for adaptation to increasing water scarcity.
    We emphasise the preliminary nature of our findings and that the Cultural Adaptation
    Templates, used to identify drivers of change, ‘lock in’ effects and feedback
    loops, are not intended to represent the entire social-ecological system of the
    Goulburn–Broken catchment as it relates to water. We focus on water availability
    and use within the context of a major water reform initiative and have not included,
    for example, issues of water quality, particularly salinity (Anderies et al. 2006).
    Environmental thresholds and constraint management The frequency of overbank flows
    of the Goulburn River is now less than required to maintain the condition of the
    Lower Goulburn floodplain and river channel (DELWP 2017, p. 3). This floodplain
    was identified in the Murray–Darling Basin Constraints Management Strategy as
    one of seven areas where relaxation of physical constraints on flows would achieve
    environmental benefits (MDBA 2013). These measures typically include removal of
    levee banks, relocation of flood-prone infrastructure, acquisition of flood easements
    and compensation to landholders for flood damage. Relaxing constraints would allow
    flooding of 12,000 ha or 92% of the floodplain (DELWP 2016) but has been prevented
    by state government policies of not flooding private land without agreement, nor
    acquiring easements by compulsory purchase (Productivity Commission 2018). However,
    options exist other than treating constraints relaxation as a matter of cost,
    damage and compensation. For example, multiple co-benefits from ecosystem services
    are derived from flooding, including improved wetland condition; fodder production;
    growth of river red gum Eucalyptus camaldulensis providing opportunities for forestry;
    improved water quality; cultural, spiritual and aesthetic appreciation of wetlands;
    community well-being, nature-based tourism and related employment (Kahan et al.
    2021). Constraint relaxation is highly contested, but interviewees raised no objections,
    perhaps because as sector leaders they tend to hold progressive views: We have
    all this environmental water, but…if the water does flood over the banks, as it
    always has…that’s how you get the maximum environmental benefit…it then floods
    private property and houses…Suddenly, the government becomes responsible for that
    …How can you get the maximum benefit out of your environmental water if you can’t
    do that? That’s what a floodplain is, the floodplain naturally floods (F4). Greater
    community and political support is required if environmental benefits are to be
    realised: You would probably inundate private land on the way or as part of that
    watering. You would need to negotiate through that…the preference is to have permanent
    title agreement…landholders don’t want to come to that, understandably, there’s
    nervousness around it (E3). Political and policy barriers represent ‘soft’ limits
    to adaptation (Barnett et al. 2015) and can be addressed by reframing the decision
    context to focus on benefits from constraints relaxation, not just costs (Gorddard
    et al. 2016). Federal government-funded payments for ecosystem services derived
    from constraints relaxation would provide income for landholders, but the inability
    of governments to adapt in time creates the risk that environmental thresholds
    may be crossed. Governance arrangements are central to environmental condition
    and socio-economic viability (Fig. 2; Table S1). Willingness of governments to
    deliver environmental water will benefit wetlands but the socio-economic impacts
    are perceived as negative (Link 3). Environmental water use cannot exceed bankfull
    volume and irrigation water is prioritised for within-channel transfer to downstream
    users, limiting environmental watering to times of year that are sub-optimal for
    some wetland biota: In the middle of summer…river levels are running very high
    because they’re transporting water from storages…to consumers that are a long
    way downstream…In the wintertime, when the rivers normally carry a lot of water,
    all that water has been kept in storages…we are trying to get the river back to
    where they were before, naturally. [The] way we’re running it now is almost opposite…we
    think that’s creating environmental problems that weren’t there before (F9). Fig.

    is a reinforcing (positive) loop; B = is a balancing (negative) loop; dotted line
    shows a weak link Full size image Water availability is unaffected by constraints
    relaxation, but some irrigators fear more water entitlements will be traded downstream,
    decreasing irrigated agricultural production and increasing costs over benefits
    (L7). In reality, overbank flows would be insufficient to support transfers. State
    policies align with irrigator interests; hence, the loop L1, L3 and L7 is a balancing
    one. If economic benefits improve, the cost-benefit ratio of constraint relaxation
    declines: irrigators are financially more secure and willing to realise benefits.
    Long-term benefits from constraint relaxation can be delivered via the capacity
    of a healthy environment to support agricultural productivity, for example via
    the capacity of native vegetation and floodplain wetlands to enhance soil water
    storage and rehydrate the landscape, enabling crop production (L6). However, interviewees
    considered only short-term impacts. If constraints management can be re-framed
    around such benefits, then governments may be more willing to implement it. Environmental
    thresholds and inter-valley transfers Declining water availability in the Goulburn–Broken
    has reduced irrigator capacity and desire to grow high-value produce and increased
    inter-valley transfers (Fig. 3, Table S2). The increased transfers are driven
    by increased demand from downstream irrigators who grow high-value perennial tree
    crops such as almonds and walnuts (L1; Mallee CMA 2018) and can outbid producers
    of lower-value crops on the temporary water market. These interactions form a
    balancing loop (L1, L3, L10, L9). From 2016–2017 to 2019–2020, record volumes
    were traded from Goulburn to Murray irrigators, with summer-autumn flows in the
    lower Goulburn River 2–3 times the recommended rate of 940 ML day−1 (L4; DELWP
    2020), causing bank erosion, damage to vegetation and fish habitat (L5). There
    is strong community concern that environmental thresholds may be crossed if these
    issues are not addressed (L6): We’re at the threshold of what can be delivered
    down on the Lower Goulburn…[without causing] environmental damage...our key challenges
    are…[freeing] up rules to allow [irrigators] to have water delivered from different
    places, but within environmental tolerances (A18). Environmental damage prompted
    changes to the Goulburn to Murray Trade Rule but the effect is unclear (DELWP
    2021a). The weak link (L8) between good environmental condition and co-benefits
    for agricultural productivity constrains policy shifts that could otherwise avert
    environmental thresholds being crossed. Fig. 3 Cultural Adaptation Template diagram

    numbers indicate links (detailed in text and Table S2); arrows show direction

    (negative) loop; dotted lines show a weak link; \\\\ indicates a time delay Full
    size image Environmental degradation may be delayed, but some effects are already
    clear. The loop L1 and L3–L7 is a balancing one as irrigators become aware of
    the negative effects of water trades. But community capacity to influence irrigation
    production is weak (L7) and trade-offs will have to be made between irrigation
    and the environment. Economic values are strongly favoured over environmental
    ones and the strength of the reinforcing loop L1, L2 is likely to counteract the
    balancing loop L1, L3-L7. The balancing loop (L1, L3-5, L8, L9) forms as agricultural
    industries benefit from ecosystem services and a healthy environment, reducing
    negative impacts of high-water demand from downstream producers. Accordingly,
    Goulburn farmers are likely to be impartial to the production of high-value goods.
    Payments to landholders for wetland ecosystem services (Canning et al. 2021) provide
    an adaptation option to diversify farm income, reduce financial risk and offset
    the reinforcing loop L1, L2, thus enhancing the perception of the link between
    a healthy environment and agricultural productivity (L8). Payments for ecosystem
    services could help mitigate the risk of crossing environmental thresholds because
    farmers would be incentivised to engage in environmental stewardship, conserve
    rivers and floodplain wetlands and advocate to ensure environmental water is used
    effectively, but this policy option is not currently being considered. Socio-economic
    thresholds: irrigation water access In the Goulburn–Broken, water prices are highly
    variable due to changing seasonal allocations and high demand from downstream
    users who set the price (Fig. 4, Table S3, L12, L13), especially during dry periods
    when supply is limited (GBCMA 2016b). Other irrigators, particularly dairy farmers,
    are vulnerable to price inflation, creating uncertainty about water access (L11).
    High prices are not sustainable for horticultural producers: We’ve definitely
    seen a lot more growers go out of business…When it comes to drought, or if they’re
    struggling financially…The worst thing any grower can do is give up any of their
    permanent allocation…because permanent plantings need permanent water…that’s what
    drives the price up (F15). Fig. 4 Cultural Adaptation Template diagram of how
    investment in adaptation and diversification builds adaptive capacity among irrigators
    as a more sustainable approach than additional investment in irrigation. Links
    detailed in text and Table S3. Symbols as in Fig. 3 Full size image Governments
    have invested in irrigation efficiency projects, intended to address uncertainty
    over water access but also recover water for the environment (DCCEEW 2020), but
    these schemes do not address the need to reduce dependency on water for agricultural
    production. Irrigation efficiency projects have been criticized for their high
    cost, reduction in return flows to rivers (Williams and Grafton 2019) and that
    they do not achieve water savings (Pérez-Blanco et al. 2021). Irrigators maintained
    or increased their water requirements after the implementation of irrigation efficiency
    projects and were more willing to buy water in the temporary allocation market
    (Aither 2017, p. 12). Increased irrigation efficiency means more water available
    and water use increases; the so-called rebound effect (Wheeler et al. 2020). Despite
    evidence that irrigation efficiency projects do not save water, several interviewees
    considered them adaptive (Table 1). Such projects are likely to continue, particularly
    because recovery of environmental water via buy-backs from irrigators ceased in
    2015 (DAWE 2021). In the Goulburn–Broken, the $2 billion Goulburn–Murray Water
    Connections Project was claimed to achieve 429 GL in water savings (DELWP 2021b),
    but interviewees considered government policies on irrigation to align poorly
    with producers’ desires to adapt and diversify: It’s a massive amount of money
    that could have been used to help transition the region. Instead, it was an attempt
    to kind of reinforce the region back in its old form (I11). Table 1 Thresholds
    for the environment and various industries Full size table Investment in irrigation
    efficiency can reduce conveyance losses and improve short-term water access but
    is maladaptive in the long term because the region becomes more dependent on irrigation
    water and irrigated agricultural production (Fig. 4, loop L1–L4). This loop is
    an example of a ‘fixes that fail’ systems archetype (Kim and Lannon 1997; Braun
    2002), whereby a solution that is effective in the short-term creates unintended
    problems in the long-term, requiring further solutions. An alternative to address
    irrigation water dependency is to increase investment in adaptation and diversification
    (loop L5-L7). Interviewees considered this approach essential to transition away
    from irrigation: We need to invest in people on the ground…it [will] require…a
    shift in how we’ve always done business…We need to take this time of innovation,
    to rethink how we respond (A14). Investing in adaptation and diversification builds
    adaptive capacity (L5): One of the strategies…that needs to be put in place is
    community-government partnerships leading towards the future...government should
    support that innovation, to generate new options for a low water future (I11).
    Intentional, proactive adaptation provides more options than reactive responses
    and empowers communities to address power imbalances over access to resources
    and conflicting values and interests over the use of those resources such as water
    (Colloff et al. 2021). Options for adaptation and diversification can enable a
    transition to less reliance on irrigation water (L6; Table 1). The balancing loop
    (Fig. 4, loop L5–L7) needs strengthening to counter the ‘fixes that fail’ system
    archetype of the irrigation efficiency reinforcing loop (L1–L4). As climate change
    drives reduced water availability, investment in adaptation and diversification
    will become increasingly urgent: You need a diversity of agriculture. You can’t
    be a monoculture, just doing the one thing…if that collapses, then you’ve got
    nothing (I17). Socio-economic thresholds: industry Dairy and horticulture differ
    in profitability and water use. Horticulturalists must maintain water use during
    drought to keep permanent tree plantings alive (ca. 105 GL y−1 in the Goulburn–Broken;
    GBCMA 2016b), whereas dairy farmers’ water use for fodder production declines
    in dry times (ca. 240 GL y−1 during drought and 1120 GL in a high-water allocation
    year). Water trading enables both industries to survive drought through transfers
    from dairy to horticulture (Fig. 5). To adapt to high water prices and lower water
    availability during dry years, dairy farmers will buy in feed substitutes from
    other regions when it is no longer economically viable to irrigate pasture or
    fodder crops (Fig. 5, L1, L2): We have this relationship with other industries
    such as horticulture. If we do go into a dry spell, dairying will trade that water
    to horticulture, because you can’t not water permanent plantings and we benefit
    from those funds to buy in new fodder. That inter-industry trade is important
    during those drier periods, but there is a limit…At the end of the day, you still
    need water to water stock and maintain systems (I8). Fig. 5 Cultural Adaptation
    Template diagram showing inter-relationships between dairy and horticultural industries
    and dairy industry dependence on feed substitutes that inhibits adaptation and
    diversification. Links detailed in text and Table S4. Symbols as in Fig. 3 Full
    size image This situation is an example of the ‘shifting the burden’ systems archetype,
    whereby a short-term solution is used to avoid developing lasting solutions that
    address the causes of the problem (Kim and Lannon 1997). Using solutions that
    address only symptoms undermines incentives to develop ones that address causes.
    By depending on feed from other regions as a short-term solution, dairy farmers
    remain vulnerable during drought if feed supplies are low and demand is high.
    Climate change exacerbates these pressures: [Many] were buying all their hay…Then
    they got in a drought, you couldn’t get a lot of the hay with the money. [Many]
    went back to well I’ve got to grow my own hay…the behaviour shifted from pure
    economics to more risk management…Put climate change on it…the average might be
    lower…more variable, bit drier. How do I structure my business…given that uncertainty…that
    variability over multiple years? (I5) There is a high risk of thresholds beyond
    which dairy and horticulture are no longer viable under a ‘business as usual’
    scenario. The burden on farmers from fixed costs of irrigation infrastructure
    will increase as the number of irrigators falls (Aither, 2017). It is anticipated
    that less irrigation water will be available from 2024 as reductions in the Sustainable
    Diversion Limit are fully implemented under the Basin Plan. Dairying may approach
    an industry threshold due to high prices for water and feed, low prices for milk
    and inadequate industry adaptation and diversification, creating a reinforcing
    loop (L19–L24), with cascading negative impacts on the viability of horticulture.
    Water trading with dairy farmers would cease and horticulturalists would bear
    a higher share of irrigation maintenance costs and begin to exit the industry,
    creating another reinforcing loop (L26, L27). As it becomes harder for irrigation
    companies to deliver services and maintain infrastructure (L23), the two reinforcing
    loops will strengthen, reducing the viability of the irrigation system as a whole.
    Industries will remain stressed until there is greater adaptation and diversification,
    or less uncertainty about water access, higher market prices for dairy (L29) and
    increased value-adding and product differentiation in horticulture (L28): If people
    [can’t] produce things that make money…it’s a liability, not an asset.…they’re
    the hardest decisions…At what point are you able to identify…something is tipping
    towards becoming an ongoing liability for the people in the area, rather than
    an asset or an opportunity? (A18). Walking back from the edge—options for adaptation
    Our analysis raises several important options for adaptation to water scarcity
    under climate change, revealed by the identification of thresholds. Declining
    water availability is the main driver of change for agriculture and the environment,
    as indicated by thresholds for these sectors (Fig. 6; Table 1). Environmental
    thresholds relate to institutional barriers and socio-economic drivers impeding
    implementation of the Constraints Management Strategy (MDBA 2013) and preventing
    flooding of wetlands on private land. The major environmental threshold is loss
    of wetland caused by dramatic alterations to the flow regime: cessation of flooding
    and the consequent erosion caused by unseasonably high flows during summer and
    autumn due to inter-valley transfers confined within channel. If environmental
    water is released in late winter–early spring, as under natural flow regimes,
    a larger volume is required because it cannot be ‘piggybacked’ on high summer–autumn
    flows for irrigators. If environmental water continues to be used as it is currently,
    this threshold for loss of wetlands will likely be exceeded. Easing of constraints
    would enable overbank flooding and meet water requirements for wetlands. Fig.
    6 Key issues identified in the Goulburn–Broken Catchment. Industries and the environment
    depend on water availability. Due to limited water, industries have a strong inter-relationship
    based on sharing water resources. If water availability declines, industries will
    need to adapt. The environment depends on constraints relaxation to spread water
    across the floodplain. Industries and the environment are affected by inter-valley
    transfers due to competition for channel capacity between irrigation water and
    environmental water and. Additional water is to be recovered through supply and
    efficiency projects, but target volumes have not been met Full size image Environmental
    water recovery via supply and efficiency measures (double arrow between socio-economic
    and environmental thresholds, Figure 6) and downstream demand are regarded as
    threats to the dairy industry: Water has left the region…processors will close
    …farmers will want to keep farming or…move to other regions…Or they’ll just exit…totally
    driven by water availability…The environment is getting enough water now and there’s
    enough water left to sustain the industry… If it was to keep dropping, because
    more and more water was being diverted to the environment, the industry would
    keep falling (F9). However, other interviewees (including those from industry)
    were supportive of constraints relaxation and believed it could deliver improved
    environmental outcomes without negative impacts on dairy and horticulture: [We]
    need to recognise hydrological and environmental limits with the Goulburn…We have
    to optimise trade…maximising trade might mean destroying the Lower Goulburn River.
    Optimise means to manage…and allow trade within sound biophysical, hydrological,
    economic, and ecological [limits]…You’ve just got to make sure you stay within
    some sort of no-regrets zone (I10). Co-benefits to wetlands and private landholders
    can be delivered through overbank flooding (Kahan et al. 2021). An improved community
    understanding of ecosystem services and options for payments for services to landholders
    may ease institutional barriers to adaptation. Adaptations for irrigation presented
    by interviewees were largely extensions of existing incremental approaches rather
    than transformative actions (Table 1). Future transformative adaptation may be
    limited if the community cannot imagine options beyond what currently exist. Nonetheless,
    transformative adaptations will be critical to avoid thresholds and maladaption.
    The threatened closure of SPC Ardmona in 2014 indicates economic thresholds for
    the food processing sector relate to variability in supply of produce, prices,
    costs and market conditions (Table 1). Horticulture adapted to be less reliant
    on the food processing sector, reflecting changing market demands: We’ve gone
    through a transformation of this region being predominantly processed fruit to
    more fresh fruit growers…the region [has] traditionally been very focused on volume
    growth, and [is] now having to shift towards more growing for quality for the
    fresh market (F15). Closure of food processing businesses have been considered
    a threshold because of falling local milk production caused by projected increased
    salinisation of pastures (Walker et al. 2009). However, salinity has largely been
    managed, but dairy processors reduced vulnerability to low milk supplies by sourcing
    it from elsewhere, as well as product diversification and vertical integration:
    as the milk supply started to drop, the company…bought the western Victorian site,
    …you can get milk from more areas…make your raw materials for your own company…Bega
    has diversified into spreads, juices, peanut butter…If they just stayed wholly
    and solely in dairy, you''re beholding to the volatility of it…we pull the milk
    apart and send the components elsewhere…a lot of it’s to do with the climate threat
    (I17). Thresholds shift as businesses adapt: We’ve got to have the ability now
    to turn things on and off, depending on the market…the water supply, milk supply…We’ll
    try extract as much value as possible, rather than the old days where volume was
    king…We’ve had to become more efficient, but more adaptable, more flexible (I17).
    As farmers improve their adaptive capacity, limits to adaptation will continue
    to be challenged as industries transition to a new normal, including by developing
    inter-industry relationships such as that between dairy and horticulture (Figure
    6). However, interviewees remain uncertain about the future viability of irrigated
    agriculture: We’re…sort of at those thresholds now…we can cope with consecutive
    dry years. But if we continue to shift more water out of the region, then I think…if
    dairy folded in the region, that would impact horticulture, horticulture wouldn’t
    survive in this region…you’d end up with stranded irrigation assets (I8). The
    use by the dairy industry of feed substitutes during drought is a short-term adaptation
    to uncertainty about water access but creates a local dependency on other regions,
    broadening the risk base. It also lessens incentives to build capacity for adaptation
    and diversification for the long term. In the future, dairy, horticulture and
    irrigation operators may approach or exceed thresholds, by which time fewer options
    for adaptation will be available. Future water policy and management options could
    build on inter-industry relationships: Setting up demonstration sites in the region
    to grow winter cereals and summer crops so that we can help lift the skills and
    capability of our dairy industry, around growing those crops for quality silage
    or fodder and to improve the relationship between those [horticultural] growers
    and the dairy industry because there’s that constant trade between the two (I8).
    A whole-of-industry approach to adaptation in the Goulburn–Broken will help mitigate
    thresholds being exceeded and avoidance of maladaptive pathways: There is a clear
    opportunity for us to work as a regional community to better understand what the
    future does look like and planning for that together, as opposed to doing it through
    separate industries or organisations (I8). Although droughts threaten the viability
    of some farmers and industries, major decline is not evident, though it has been
    assumed that falling agricultural income is proportional to reduced water availability
    (RMCG 2016; Rendell 2019, p. 16). This assumption is incorrect. There was weak
    or no negative effect on farm income from selling water entitlements and reduced
    production was offset by income from water sales and reinvested on-farm or used
    to reduce debt (Wheeler et al. 2014, p. 1). During the Millennium Drought, there
    was a 67% decline in irrigation water use in the Basin but gross value of irrigated
    agricultural production fell by only 14%. Impacts of drought were offset by water
    trading, improving irrigation efficiencies, substituting crops and inputs and
    other measures, indicating a relatively high level of adaptive capacity (Kirby
    et al. 2014). We are not aware of other water reform initiatives elsewhere in
    the world like the Murray–Darling Basin Plan where social-ecological systems have
    been assessed in relation to thresholds of change and water availability. However,
    our work builds on previous social-ecological systems and resilience research
    in the Goulburn–Broken Catchment. Successive management decisions were considered
    to have ‘eroded the resilience of the system and reduced options for future change’
    (Anderies et al. 2006, p. 865). Thresholds were identified for rising saline groundwater,
    threatening crop production. Nearly 20 years on, the prediction by these authors
    that drastic actions were required to prevent water tables reaching the surface
    has proved unfounded. Walker et al. (2009) identified ten known or possible thresholds
    in the Goulburn–Broken catchment, particularly relating to feedbacks between water
    availability, farm income, irrigation infrastructure and high interdependence
    of agriculture and food processing. They concluded reliance on agricultural products
    and processing was vulnerable to rising water tables and reduced water availability
    under climate change. Rising water tables have compromised riverine ecosystems
    and reduced the resilience and future options for the catchment. These conclusions
    accord with our findings. Concluding remarks We have undertaken a preliminary
    analysis using a conceptual framework based on social-ecological systems modelling
    using the Cultural Adaptation Template. The Goulburn–Broken Catchment was used
    as a case study to apply the concept of social-ecological thresholds in systems
    models to determine options for adaptation to less water under climate change,
    with lessons for water policy and management in the Murray–Darling Basin. We focussed
    on three issues: (1) the current water-sharing context; (2) environmental and
    socio-economic thresholds and (3) options for adaptation. Regarding the water-sharing
    context, different water users, within and outside the catchment, have competing
    demands, values and needs, making water management a complex system of trade-offs.
    Currently, there is little evidence of competition between water for the environment
    and agriculture in the Goulburn–Broken. However, local dairy and horticultural
    industries may be threatened if inter-valley transfers to downstream users were
    to increase. Although dairy and horticulture depend on water, their interactive
    water trading relationship indicates they can endure severe droughts. There are
    major concerns from irrigators that the volume of inter-valley transfers is already
    too high and jeopardises their economic viability. However, subsequent changes
    in trade rules were aimed at protecting the environment by limiting high downstream
    flows rather than limiting downstream trades, though the impact was the same.
    This policy response potentially runs counter to the need to enable overbank flows
    to reach floodplain wetlands. Other options are needed to address this policy
    shortcoming. In relation to thresholds of change, it is highly probable that environmental
    thresholds will be crossed if existing environmental water is not delivered overbank
    to the lower Goulburn–Broken floodplain. Relaxing constraints to allow water to
    be released as overbank flows to floodplain wetlands would have significant environmental
    benefits and needs re-consideration by policy-makers, in line with the Murray–Darling
    Basin Constraints Management Strategy (MDBA 2013), which all Basin states and
    territory have agreed to implement. Socio-economic thresholds of water availability
    for irrigation, costs of production, farm profitability and production to sustain
    food processing, may be crossed without adequate adaptation and diversification
    to lower water availability, higher irrigation infrastructure costs and higher
    prices for water and feed substitutes. Thresholds can shift, as farmers adapt
    their management, as evidenced by inter-relationships between dairy and horticulture
    around water trading. But this form of adaptation is only a symptomatic solution
    to the growing uncertainty about water access. Industries need to further adapt
    and diversify to ensure long-term viability. Regarding options for adaptation,
    there are clear options to conserve ca. 12,000 ha of floodplain and provide co-benefits
    to irrigators, but these are constrained by values trade-offs, institutional and
    governance factors. Relaxing constraints and schemes for payments for ecosystem
    services need to overcome institutional barriers. Irrigation efficiency measures
    were identified as maladaptive, increasing dependence on irrigation water access.
    Investment in adaptation and diversification for farmers represent potential pathways
    out of irrigation water dependence. Interviewees identified more appropriate options
    for adaptation for irrigated agriculture which have not yet been implemented.
    To facilitate this transition, future policies can be co-produced with the local
    community that can assist farmers to adapt and diversify. Our research provides
    insights that may be scaled up to assist water management in the broader Basin
    and beyond. These findings can help governments make better informed decisions
    about the vulnerabilities and trade-off options for managing diminishing water
    availability due to climate change. Thresholds are important in understanding
    environmental and socio-economic values and identifying ways to preserve them.
    However, thresholds are not simple but are complex and dynamic. This study highlights
    the need for water managers and users in the Basin and beyond to consider and
    identify adaptation pathways that provide for long-term adaptation co-benefits.

  explanation: The study proposed a methodology to quantify agricultural drought over
    Heilongjiang Province, China, and how the severity of meteorological and agricultural
    drought influences maize yield. The authors investigate the relationship between
    soil water content, SPEI (Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index),
    and maize yield at the pixel level, across 50 different simulation units. They
    used an EOF (Empirical Orthogonal Function) analysis to identify the spatial patterns
    of dry and wet conditions, finding that meteorological drought was more severe
    in the western and southern parts of the province, while agricultural drought
    was more severe in the central and eastern regions. The authors then used Grey
    Theory to analyze the relationship between crop yield and drought, finding that
    there was a strong positive correlation between maize yield and SPEI in May, July,
    and August, and a negative correlation between maize yield and soil water content
    in May. The authors conclude that meteorological drought has a significant impact
    on maize yield in Heilongjiang Province, and that agricultural drought should
    be considered in addition to meteorological drought when making irrigation decisions.
  extract_1: From April to September, the consistent wet and dry changes across the
    region in August and September, accompanied by drought and little rain or wet
    and rainy. The distribution of the EOF2 model shows that the whole region is in
    positive territory in August, and almost the whole region is in negative territory
    in September.
  extract_2: The percentage difference between crop yield and SPEI index and soil
    moisture content was different in different regions, still, the overall relationship
    between the percentage difference of crop yield and the SPEI index was greater
    than that of soil moisture content. In terms of monthly distribution, SPEI in
    May, July, and August had a higher grey correlation with crop yield, and soil
    water content in May had a higher grey correlation.

    Abstract Agriculture is an essential support for social and economic development,
    most affected by weather and climate. Drought in agriculture significantly threatens
    food security and social stability. Understanding drought variability in the cultivated
    land can lay the foundation for crop management. Considering the effects of drought
    on the actual crop growth process and precise irrigation under limited water resources
    is a great challenge. In this study, standardized precipitation evapotranspiration
    index (SPEI) and soil water content were used to study the spatiotemporal characteristics
    of drought during maize growth in Heilongjiang Province. The distributed AquaCrop
    model and grey theory were used to study the relationship between irrigation,
    drought and maize yield at the grid scale, and the current irrigation effect was
    evaluated by simulating the comparison of crop yield under non-irrigation and
    irrigated conditions, so as to provide a basis for optimizing the irrigation system
    in the future. In addition, Future drought trends were also examined using the
    Mann-Kendall statistical test, Sen''s slope, and Hurst index. The results are
    as follows: (1) Based on remote sensing inversion and distributed AquaCrop model,
    the relationship between drought and crop yield can be studied at grid scale,

    theoryDrought trendsHeilongjiang province 1. Introduction Drought has always been
    one of the most threatening natural disasters, a water shortage phenomenon caused
    by the imbalance of water supply and demand on a certain time scale (Dai et al.,
    2022). Frequent and severe drought disasters lead to severe water shortages, significantly
    impacting the global ecosystem and social economy (Cao et al., 2022). Agriculture
    is an essential support for social and economic development, most affected by
    weather and climate. Drought in agriculture significantly threatens food security
    and social stability (Hoque et al., 2021). Meteorological drought is a prolonged
    period of arid weather that leads to water shortages and severe water imbalances
    (Guo et al., 2020). Agricultural drought refers to the inability of soil moisture
    to meet plants’ water needs at different growth stages (Chatterjee et al., 2022).
    From meteorological to agricultural drought, it involves a series of processes
    such as occurrence, development, and propagation (Tian et al., 2022). Therefore,
    agricultural drought can be regarded as the inheritance and development of meteorological
    drought. Meteorological drought is the prerequisite of agricultural drought, and
    there is a certain time difference between meteorological drought and agricultural
    drought. Agricultural drought affects crop yields more directly (Liu et al., 2019b).
    However, because agricultural drought is affected by human activities such as
    irrigation, meteorological drought can better reflect the natural trend of drought
    development, and it is more favorable in predicting future drought trends. A single
    type of drought monitoring does not reflect comprehensive drought information
    from meteorological to agricultural (Karimi et al., 2022). Therefore, It is better
    to study the spatiotemporal variability of drought and its effects on crop yield
    by combining meteorological drought and agricultural drought (Makokha et al.,
    2016). Irrigation is an important measure to alleviate drought. A reasonable irrigation
    schedule improves regional water efficiency and benefits regional economic and
    social development. According to the law of crop water demand, an optimized irrigation
    schedule can increase crop yield and improve the utilization efficiency of water
    resources (Deb et al., 2022). Cop models that simulate crop yields under different
    irrigated conditions can evaluate current irrigation effects and can provide a
    better theoretical basis for optimizing irrigation systems (García-Vila and Fereres,
    2012). However, crops have different growth rules and water requirements due to
    climate, soil types, and field management (Jalota et al., 2010). Therefore, a
    significant scientific problem is how to carry out precision irrigation under
    limited water resources, considering the heterogeneity of spatial factors and
    crops’ actual physical growth process (Zhang et al., 2022a). Distributed crop
    models consider the spatial heterogeneity of soil, climate, crop, and management
    practices and can accurately simulate regional crop growth, making the calculation
    more accurate (Jégo et al., 2015). Determining the impact of irrigation on crop
    yields based on crop models can help to better manage crop cultivation (Zhang
    et al., 2023). The occurrence of drought poses the greatest threat to crop yield,
    and it is necessary to optimize the management of crop irrigation considering
    the risk of drought. However, it is still a challenge to take into account the
    spatial heterogeneity of meteorology, soil, and crop growth, and to provide precise
    irrigation for drought for more dispersed characteristics. Maize is the main food
    crop cultivated worldwide, and its total yield ranks first among the three food
    crops (rice, maize, and wheat) (Zhang et al., 2022b). Maize growth is more affected
    by drought. The drought risk of maize will become more severe, and regional food
    security will be seriously threatened (Haro-Monteagudo et al., 2017). A large
    number of studies have been conducted to eliminate or reduce the threat of drought
    to maize production, mainly considering the impact of drought on maize production
    in terms of crop genes, irrigation methods, and planting systems (Li et al., 2022a;
    Monteleone et al., 2022; Wan et al., 2022). However, spatiotemporal analysis and
    prediction of drought in maize producing areas are still insufficient, and optimization
    of maize irrigation to cope with drought risk has been seldom reported. Heilongjiang
    Province, located in the Songnen Plain in northeastern China, is an important
    grain-producing region (Chen et al., 2022). With increasing global warming, future
    drought events in the region will become more frequent (Wu et al., 2022b), and
    the agricultural area affected by drought is on the rise (Fu et al., 2018). Maize
    is the most important cereal crop in Heilongjiang Province, and its production
    is significantly more vulnerable to drought (Li et al., 2022b). However, agricultural
    production in the region is heavily dependent on rainfall, and the occurrence
    of droughts severely affects local maize production. Based on this, this paper
    takes the maize planting area of Heilongjiang Province as the research area, and
    according to the characteristics of drought distribution and the spatial heterogeneity
    of meteorology, soil and crop growth, the simulation results of the distributed
    crop model and the impact of drought on crop yield were considered in a unified
    manner, the relationship between drought and crop yield was quantified, and the
    impact of drought on crop yield was analyzed, to provide a new perspective for
    the realization of spatio-temporal synergy of precision irrigation. The main results
    of this paper are as follows: (1) the relationship between drought and maize yield
    is analyzed by meteorological data and agricultural data, (2) the impact of irrigation
    on crop yield under irrigation conditions and non-irrigation conditions is simulated
    based on distributed crop model, and (3) the irrigation system is optimized at
    the grid level to improve crop yield. This paper considers the impact of drought
    risk and different irrigation conditions on the growth process of crops, and provides
    solutions and references for the temporal and spatial optimization and efficient
    utilization of agricultural water resources. 2. Study area and methods 2.1. Study
    area and data collection Heilongjiang province is located in the northeast of
    China. It is a necessary commodity grain production base in China. Heilongjiang
    province covers humid to semi-arid regions and warm to cold temperate zones. The
    cultivated land area is 15.94 million ha, accounting for 33.87% of the province''s
    total land area. The growth period of crops is from April to September. The average
    annual precipitation is about 400 mm–700mm, and 60% of the annual precipitation
    is from June to August. Therefore, there are problems of drought in spring and
    flood in summer. The frost-free period is 100–140 days (Fig. 1). Download : Download

    This paper mainly used basic geographic information data, soil moisture content
    data, meteorological data, crop data, and economic and social statistics. Basic
    geographic information data included cultivated land distribution, soil type,
    and land use data. The soil moisture content data were from 83 soil moisture monitoring
    stations in Heilongjiang province (Fig. 1), the same as field water capacity data.
    The monthly SPEI was calculated according to (Vicente-Serrano et al., 2010) using
    meteorological data, including precipitation, evaporation, temperature, humidity,
    etc. Meteorological data were from National Meteorological Information Center.
    Terra/Aqua MODIS data was used for remote sensing. Since 1991, the crop data have
    been based on monthly agricultural meteorological data reported by the China Agricultural
    Meteorological Station. Some data came from the National Climate Center, while
    others came from the National Meteorological Center''s 9210 element database.
    The crop yield data were obtained from the Heilongjiang Rural Statistical Yearbook.
    By overlaying different layers, we divide simulation units and build distributed
    AquaCrop model (Fig. 2). Download : Download high-res image (365KB) Download :
    Download full-size image Fig. 2. Simulation units divided by overlaying different
    data layers. 2.2. Methods 2.2.1. Empirical orthogonal function Empirical orthogonal
    function (EOF) analysis is a multivariate statistical method. Its principle is
    to use the variance of the data to concentrate the valuable information into a
    few spatially distributed time series to reflect the Spatio-temporal changes of
    the element fields. At present, it has been widely used in meteorology and climatology
    research. Eigenvectors correspond to spatial samples, also known as spatial eigenvectors
    or spatial modes. It reflects the spatial distribution characteristics of the
    element fields to some extent. The calculation process of the EOF decomposition
    method is relatively complicated, so it will not be discussed in detail here.
    For specific calculation processes, please refer to the literature (Kim et al.,
    2011; Tatli and Türkeş, 2011). 2.2.2. TVPM (temperature and vegetation polynomial)
    model We''ve done studies comparing several drought monitoring models in Heilongjiang
    province and found among VCI (Vegetation condition index) model, ATI (Apparent
    thermal inertia) model, VSWI (Vegetation water supply index) model, TVDI (Temperature
    vegetation drought index) model, and TVPM model, TVPM model is a feasible and
    optimal method to monitoring drought. See figure for details (Liu et al., 2019a).
    The TVPM calculation process is described in Supplementary Materials. 2.2.3. Distributed
    AuqaCrop model Distributed crop models can be used on the grid-scale for simulation
    through the GIS platform. The machine learning method is adopted in the batch
    calibration of parameters so that the model can be used on a large scale. This
    paper used the distributed AquaCrop model to calculate the maize yield under non-irrigation
    conditions. The irrigation effect could be evaluated by comparing the crop yield
    under irrigation and non-irrigation conditions. The establishment of the distributed
    AquaCrop model includes the following steps (Han et al., 2020). (1) The division
    of the simulation unit and the model set. Based on the GIS platform, multiple
    homogeneous simulation units are divided by overlaying the management, meteorology,
    and soil layers. The single-point scale AquaCrop model was established for each
    simulation unit, and a distributed AquaCrop model was constructed. Each simulation
    unit has the same management, meteorological, and soil types. AquaCrop model can
    simulate yield and soil water balance factors under water deficit conditions.
    Irrigation types include flood, furrow, and drip irrigation. The irrigation systems
    were fixed irrigation and non-fixed irrigation. The single-point AquaCrop model
    consists of 11 meteorological files (maximum and minimum temperature, precipitation,
    reference evapotranspiration, and CO2), irrigation files (irrigation system),
    crop files, and initial soil parameter soil water content files, management files,
    and groundwater files. Crop files include crop growth, transpiration, yield, water
    stress, temperature stress, and other parameters. Irrigation files include irrigation
    time and amount of water. Soil parameter files include soil properties, soil wilt
    coefficient, field water capacity, saturated water content, and saturated hydraulic
    conductivity. The model''s outputs included canopy growth, crop parameters (leaf
    area index, transpiration, biomass, yield), and soil water balance at corresponding
    time steps. After establishing the single-point scale AquaCrop model, several
    single-point AquaCrop models were assembled into a distributed AquaCrop model
    through AquaCrop-Plugin. (2) Model parameter calibration and simulation result
    verification. The AquaCrop model changes a characteristic parameter to ±10% to
    ±20% of the default value. Leave the remaining variables unchanged as the original
    data set values. The sensitivity of crop yield to different variables was analyzed
    by comparing the simulation results of crop yield. The sensitivity analysis results
    are represented by relative sensitivity (RS), whose values have been standardized
    and can be used to compare the sensitivity between parameters. The more sensitive
    the parameters are, the greater their influence on the model output. The four
    parameters to be corrected were those with the highest sensitivity. The parameters
    must be batch calibrated to make the model applicable on a large scale. The XGBoost
    method was used to calibrate the model. Boosting algorithm is a popular and effective
    ensemble learning algorithm in data mining. It forms a robust classifier by weighting
    and stacking each weak classifier, thus effectively reducing error and achieving
    an accurate classification effect. Gradient Boosting is an improvement based on
    Boosting. The algorithm is to continuously reduce residuals to further reduce
    the residuals of the previous model in the Gradient direction to get a new type.
    XGBoost is an improved version of Gradient Boosting algorithm. XGBoost generates
    second-order Taylor expansion for the loss function and obtains the optimal solution
    for the expected term outside the loss function, entirely using the parallel computing
    advantages of multi-core CPU and improving the accuracy and speed. Fig. 3 shows
    the details of the XGBoost method. The model was calibrated and validated using
    statistically observed field data. Relative error statistics and determination
    coefficients provide a comprehensive assessment of the agreement between modelled
    and observed values. Therefore, we choose relative error (RE) statistics and determination
    coefficients (R2) were used to assess differences between simulated and observed
    values (Liu and Yang, 2021). Download : Download high-res image (356KB) Download

    Grey theory degree analysis is a method to analyze and determine the degree of
    influence between multiple factors in a system or the contribution of factors
    to the primary behavior of the system. This study used grey correlation analysis
    to analyze the relationship between maize yield per unit area (under irrigation
    and non-irrigation conditions) and SPEI and soil water content. Fifty simulation
    units were selected, and the yield per unit area of maize (under irrigation and
    non-irrigation conditions) was used as the parent sequence, and the corresponding
    SPEI and soil water content in April, May, June, July, August, and September were
    used as sub-sequence, respectively. In grey correlation analysis, when correlation
    >0.7, the independent variable is considered (Zhou and Thai, 2016). 2.2.5. Data
    analysis Mann-Kendall (MK) test is a non-parametric trend test method for time
    series, which does not require the measured values to follow a normal distribution
    and is not affected by missing values and outliers (Zhou and Thai, 2016). It is
    suitable for trend significance tests of long time series data. Sen''s slope estimation
    method was used to calculate the slope β of the sequence. Slope β represents the
    average rate of change and the time series trend. When β > 0, the sequential trend
    presents an upward trend. When β < 0, the sequence showed a downward trend. When
    β = 0, the sequence trend was not noticeable (Gocic and Trajkovic, 2013). Hurst
    exponent is a parameter commonly used in autocorrelation analysis of time series,
    revealing the long-range memory of sequence, also known as long-range dependence
    or long-range correlation. It is widely used in earthquakes, economy, climate,
    ecology, and other fields (Wang et al., 2022). In summary, the technical roadmap

    of meteorological drought The distribution of orthogonal eigenvectors in space
    is referred to as mutually independent spatial distribution modes. If each component
    of the eigenvector has the same symbol, it indicates the consistency of wet and
    dry changes within the region and if the components of an eigenvector are distributed
    in a positive and negative pattern, it means that the dry and wet changes in the
    region are opposite, and the extreme points in each mode represent the sensitive
    center of dry and wet changes. The first two EOF were chosen to use the Northern
    standard to present spatial patterns of dry and wet conditions from April to September.
    The combined contribution of the first two EOF to total variance is more significant
    than 70%. EOF1, in particular, surpassed 50%. This demonstrates how a few numbers
    of spatial structures can explain the complex characteristics of dry/wet conditions
    in Heilongjiang Province. We plotted the spatial pattern of the first two EOF
    models of SPEI (Fig. 5). Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 5. Spatial patterns of the first two EOF models of SPEI.
    Note: In the figure, (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) represent April, May, June,
    July, August and September, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5, the distribution
    of EOF1 patterns shows that the northern and central parts of Heilongjiang Province
    were in negative areas and the southern part was in positive areas in April and
    May. The central and eastern regions were in negative territory in June and July.
    The western part is in a positive zone, suggesting that May to July may be dry
    in the north and wet in the south, or wet in the north and dry in the south. The
    entire region was in positive territory in August and almost the entire region
    was in negative territory in September, indicating consistent wet and dry changes
    across the region in August and September, accompanied by drought and little rain
    or wet and rainy. The distribution of the EOF2 model shows that the whole region
    is in the positive area in August, and almost the whole region is in the negative
    area in September. The distribution of the EOF2 model in April indicated that
    all the regions in Heilongjiang were positive, while all the regions in May, June,
    and July were hostile. The northern region was positive in August and September,
    while the southern region was negative. It indicates that only April the dry or
    wet changes are consistent across the region, and the other months are alternating
    dry or wet, which also reflects the characteristics of Heilongjiang Province''s
    monsoon climate. Based on the obtained long time series of the first two EOF modalities,
    we used the mann-kendall method for analysis, and the results are shown in Fig.
    6. Statistical results of the corresponding Mann-Kendall test of PC1 are shown
    in Fig. 6(a). The PC1 from April to September shows that UF was more significant
    than 0 in the 1960s and 1980s and less than 0 in the 1980s and early 20th century,
    and fluctuated near the zero line after 2000. Statistical results of the corresponding
    Mann-Kendall test of PC2 are shown in Fig. 6(b). The UF in May, June, and August
    was basically above the zero line, while the UF in April, July, and September
    was below the zero line before the 20th century. After the 20th century, the UF
    in April was more significant than 0, while the UF in July and September fluctuated
    near the zero line. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download

    of agricultural drought Data from various soil moisture sites (as shown in Fig.1)
    were used to analyze the measured soil moisture content distribution. As can be
    seen from the Fig. 7, the western and southern parts of Heilongjiang province
    are dry, while the eastern and northern parts are humid. April, May, and September
    are relatively dry, and the soil moisture content in some areas of southwest China
    is less than 0.6. The soil moisture content is humid at 0.6 in July and August
    and above 0.7 in most months. In terms of coefficient of variation, the greater
    the soil moisture content, the greater the coefficient of variation. Download

    the accuracy verification and applicability of the TVPM model in the study area
    were described in detail The TVPM model was used to invert the soil moisture content
    to observe the distribution of drought on a smaller scale. It was divided into
    different drought standards: soil moisture content less than 0.4 was a severe
    drought, soil moisture content less than 0.6 was moderate drought, soil moisture
    content more than 0.6 was average, and soil moisture content more than 0.9 was
    wet. Taking the typical year of 2019 as an example, it can be seen that Heilongjiang
    is in a normal state suitable for crop growth most of the time. Moreover, the
    agricultural drought situation in 2019 showed a consistent trend with the average
    distribution, as shown in Fig. 8. April, May, and June were dry, while July, August,
    and September were wet. However, the distribution of drought is relatively scattered,
    so it is necessary to analyze the relationship between drought and crop yield
    at the grid scale. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download

    to the measured yield calibrated distributed AquaCrop model, the model''s accuracy
    is tested. The test results are shown in Fig. 9. Taking 2012 and 2013 as examples,
    it can be seen that the relative error of the model for more than 80% of the simulation
    units can be controlled below 20%. Fig. 10 shows the distribution of simulated
    crop yield and the difference between irrigated and non-irrigated crops. Table
    1 shows the simulated crop yield percentage difference from 2009 to 2013. According
    to the results, the yield difference between irrigated and non-irrigated crops
    was 0–3, and nearly 50% of crops had a yield difference of 30%–40%. Download :

    simulation units were selected (Fig. 11) to display the results, as shown in Table
    2. Fifty simulation units in specific regions were selected, and the percentage
    difference in crop yield, SPEI index, and soil moisture content were analyzed
    in grey correlation, as shown in Table 3. The grey correlation indexes from April
    to September were all greater than 0.6. It indicates that the dry and wet conditions
    from April to September have an essential effect on the difference in crop yield
    between irrigated and non-irrigated conditions. The grey correlation between the
    percentage difference between crop yield and SPEI index and soil moisture content
    was different in different regions. Still, the overall relationship between the
    percentage difference of crop yield and the SPEI index was greater than that of
    soil moisture content. In terms of monthly distribution, SPEI in May, July, and
    August had a higher grey correlation with crop yield, and soil water content in
    May had a higher grey correlation. Download : Download high-res image (487KB)

    The H-index predicts how long changes in dry/wet conditions will last. Sen''s
    slope from 4 to 9 are more significant than 0, indicating that SEI in Heilongjiang
    presents an upward trend. The Hurst index from April to September is all less
    than 0.5, indicating that the time-series data of SPEI have anti-persistence,
    that is to say, the changing trend of SPEI in the past is opposite to that in
    the future. However, the H value in August was 0.453, indicating that the persistence
    of this change is weak. Table 4. Results of Mann-Kendall test, Sen''s slope, and

    12.0% and 13.2% sites in April, May, June, July, August and September showed Sen''s
    slope <0 respectively. Negative values are mainly distributed in the central and
    western regions of Heilongjiang Province. The negative values are the largest
    in April and May and the least in August and September. The Hurst index for April,
    June, June, July, August, and September is less than 0.5. The proportion of areas
    with a Hurst index less than 0.3 is 55.4%, 53.0%, 40.9%, 55.4%, 57.8%, and 50.6%.
    This indicates that the time series data of SPEI in most regions have anti-persistence.
    That is to say, the past change trend of SPEI is the opposite of the future change
    trend. And most of the region is strong. Therefore, SPEI in the central and western
    parts of Heilongjiang Province will be wet in the future, but the other parts
    will be dry, and this change has a weak spatial continuity. Meanwhile, we can
    optimize the present irrigation based on these trends. Download : Download high-res

    Spatial and temporal distribution and variation of dry and wet conditions The
    seasonal distribution of precipitation in Northeast China is very uneven due to
    the influence of monsoon circulation and the complex geographical environment.
    Winter is cold and dry, summer is warm and rainy, and precipitation is mainly
    concentrated in summer. Spring and autumn are transitional stages. In agriculture,
    short-term drought in the critical growth period can also cause a significant
    impact, so it has a specific practical significance for analyzing drought change
    in the study area. For meteorological drought, in terms of time, the change of
    dry and wet time in Heilongjiang province has prominent interannual characteristics,
    showing a general trend of change from drought to wet, with the stage and trend
    of dry and wet change. Spatially, the dry-wet spatial variation in Heilongjiang
    province has prominent interannual characteristics. The first mode is the main
    spatial distribution pattern of dry and wet change in Heilongjiang Province. The
    main reason is that influenced by solar radiation and large-scale weather characteristics,
    it has zonal regional differentiation law, but the regional difference is not
    apparent (Zhao et al., 2020). Mode 2 is the main spatial distribution pattern
    of typical dry and wet conditions in Heilongjiang Province. The spatial distribution
    pattern of typical dry and wet conditions is reverse from east to west and southeast
    to northwest, with the central part as the boundary. The corresponding time coefficient
    shows that the same distribution pattern shows a decreasing trend, while the reverse
    distribution pattern shows an increasing trend (Chu et al., 2019; Zhu et al.,
    2022). The main reason is that the distance from the sea is different, which has
    apparent dry-wet non-zonal regional differentiation law. As for agricultural drought,
    it can be known that the drought in Heilongjiang province has strong seasonal
    characteristics by integrating ground observation data and remote sensing inversion
    data. According to the remote sensing monitoring map, the distribution of drought
    in Heilongjiang province is scattered, so studying the distribution of drought
    on the grid scale is significant. It can be seen from Fig. 5, Fig. 6 that the
    dry area increased first and then decreased in the growing season of spring maize
    in Northeast China, and the dry area and degree in July were significantly smaller
    than that in May, June, and September. The area and degree of drought reached
    the maximum in May when spring maize was mainly in the early stage of growth and
    development. Timely irrigation and timely seedling replacement could reduce the
    yield reduction caused by drought to the maximum extent. From May to September,
    the area of severe drought continued to decrease and finally remained stable.
    Although the area of severe drought increased in August and September, the overall
    degree of the drought was relatively light, mainly mild and moderate (Zhou et
    al., 2020). In the past 70 years, the seasonal drought in Heilongjiang province
    has shown different characteristics. In general, the SPEI value of the region
    as a whole is higher in July and August each year, when the drought situation
    is not difficult. During these two months of the northeast monsoon, rainfall is
    relatively abundant, and mean monthly precipitation exceeds the mean monthly evaporation.
    The adjacent 5, and 6-month precipitation increase in a month, but the precipitation
    increase at a rate of less than the rate of increase evapotranspiration, water
    loss is damaging, leading to the drought-prone, while drought spring corn planting,
    and the recovery time of spring corn, Influence spring maize emergence, and survival
    after emergence (Zuo et al., 2019). Both precipitation and evapotranspiration
    decreased in September, but the decreasing rate of precipitation was greater than
    that of evapotranspiration, which was the main reason for the development of drought
    in September. Moreover, due to sufficient precipitation in July and August, the
    water balance in September could be supplemented to some extent, thus reducing
    the degree and frequency of drought in September. The change in spring drought
    was not significant from the 1960s to the early 21st century in this region but
    became humid after 2003, and the most apparent change was located in the middle
    of the study area (Zuo et al., 2019). The study area had an aridity trend in summer
    and autumn, and the aridity trend in autumn increased after the middle 1990s.
    4.2. Effects of drought and irrigation on crop yield Even though many researchers
    have undertaken quantitative studies on agricultural drought stress, most are
    based on temperature and humidity control experiments or field plot location measurements.
    However, the spatial representativeness of such research is limited due to regional
    variances, and it is challenging to incorporate a range of influencing elements
    (such as climate, soil, crop types, and inter-annual fluctuation) into the evaluation
    model. In addition, since crop yield and regional drought are spatially heterogeneous,
    it is meaningful to study crop yield and drought at the grid scale. Irrigation
    is the primary means to alleviate drought, so evaluating the current irrigation
    situation on a grid scale provides a technical means for optimizing the irrigation
    system and mitigating drought risk. Compared with previous studies, this study
    has the following advantages. First, the distributed AquaCrop model simulated
    crop yields under non-irrigation conditions. Secondly, remote sensing data is
    used to invert soil water content. Therefore, combining these two parameters can
    quantitatively evaluate the response of maize yield to drought stress and provide
    data support for evaluating the current irrigation status (Wu et al., 2022a).
    Drought can reduce the net photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance of maize,
    affect the synthesis of dry matter, and affect yield. Drought affects maize at
    different growth stages but can cause yield loss. Our results indicate that changes
    in dry and wet conditions during the growth period (i.e., April–September) impact
    maize yield in Heilongjiang Province (Section 3.3). The grey correlation analysis
    showed that the percentage difference between crop yield, SPEI index, and soil
    water content differed in different regions. Still, the relationship between the
    percentage difference of crop yield and the SPEI index was greater than that of
    soil water content. Regarding monthly distribution, SPEI in May, July, and August
    had a higher grey correlation with crop yield, and soil water content in May had
    a higher grey correlation. The results showed that the sensitivity of maize to
    drought stress in September was lower than that in May and June with the gradual
    wilting and wilting of plants. July and August are water-sensitive periods because
    corn grain filling and accumulation occur in this stage. Therefore, adequate moisture
    is essential to ensure high yields. As can be seen from the irrigation evaluation
    and the results, the yield difference between irrigated and non-irrigated crops
    is 0–3, with nearly 50% of the crop yield difference between 30% and 40%. This
    suggests that current irrigation has helped alleviate drought and increase yields.
    At the same time, the area sensitive to irrigation (the difference between irrigation
    and non-irrigation conditions is large) can be obtained compared with the simulation
    results. Combined with the results of this study and the prediction of the drought
    trend, the optimization of the existing irrigation system is conducive to improving
    regional maize yield (Zhao et al., 2015). Results showed that the accuracy of
    the H index in predicting drought trends was 91.7%. Therefore, we combined the
    Mann-Kendall test, Sen''s slope, and H index to predict the drought trend in Heilongjiang
    Province. The results show that the Sen''s slope of SPEI from April to September
    is greater than 0, and the Hurst index is less than 0.5, indicating that THE TIME
    series data of SPEI has anti-persistence, that is, SPEI develops towards drought.
    However, the H value in August was 0.453, indicating that the persistence of this
    change is weak. The time-series data of SPEI in most regions have anti-persistence.
    That is to say, the past change trend of SPEI is the opposite of the future change
    trend. And most of the region is vital. SPEI in the central and western parts
    of Heilongjiang Province will be wet in the future, but the other parts will be
    dry, and this change has a weak spatial continuity. Therefore, existing irrigation
    systems can be optimized in drought-prone areas (eastern, southern and northern
    Heilongjiang Province), and irrigation should be stepped up during the drought-prone
    months (May and June) to cope with drought risk. At the same time, more attention
    should be paid to irrigation in this region for simulation units sensitive to
    drought (the difference between irrigated and non-irrigated conditions is large).
    4.3. Limitations and implications This study systematically analyzed maize yield
    based on dry/wet changes throughout the growth period. However, before considering
    the implications of this work, one should note the study''s limitations. First,
    the remote sensing data selected in this study has a spatial resolution of 1 km,
    and there will be mixed pixels, which may cause errors for crops planted in small
    areas. The follow-up study considers using high spatial resolution satellite image
    and high temporal resolution satellite image fusion to improve agricultural drought
    monitoring mapping accuracy and guide agricultural production more effectively.
    Secondly, the distributed Aquacrop-optimization model can obtain the optimal water
    allocation scheme based on the crop growth process and soil water balance formula.
    Still, only the exchange of surface water and soil water is considered, and the
    interaction of surface water, soil water, and groundwater are not considered.
    Ecology and farmland system are two systems that influence each other and complement
    each other. The influence of farmland irrigation on ecology and ecological restoration
    on farmland microclimate should be considered. To solve the above problems, remote
    sensing data calibration can be used to verify the distributed model parameters.
    Suitable ecological models were selected to be coupled to the distributed Aquacrop-optimization
    model to study the interaction between ecosystem and agricultural system. In addition,
    the results of expert research will play an essential role in future model prediction,
    agricultural production, and policymaking. Due to the limitations of survey samples
    and research methods, this study cannot use exact numerical values to evaluate
    the impact of climate change on the maize production system and the role of adaptation
    technology. Therefore, more studies are needed in the future to provide more detailed
    information. Future research needs to address more potential issues caused by
    climate change, such as the effects of plant diseases, insect pests, and extreme
    climate events on maize production and the interactions between maize production
    systems and nearby ecosystems. Future research should consider the economic cost
    of the evaluation of adaptation technology. The research on adaptation technology
    should turn potential adaptation technology into the practical application of
    adaptation technology and consider the influencing factors that affect the willingness
    of different farmers to adopt adaptation technology. 5. Conclusion This study
    examined the relationship between drought, irrigation, and maize yield in Heilongjiang
    province from 1960 to 2020 and the temporal and spatial characteristics and subsequent
    drought trends. To begin, EOF analysis determined two necessary EOF and corresponding
    PC based on the SPEI drought index of the maize growth period (April–September)
    and obtained the spatio-temporal variation trend of meteorological drought in
    Heilongjiang Province. The spatial and temporal distribution of agricultural drought
    in Heilongjiang province was studied using remote sensing to measure and retrieve
    soil water content. The distributed AquaCrop model simulated crop yield under
    non-irrigation conditions to assess the current irrigation effect. Then, the relationship
    between drought (SPEI, soil water content) and maize yield (non-irrigated and
    irrigated) in Heilongjiang province was discussed using the grey theory. In addition,
    Mann-Kendall statistical test, H-index, Mann-Kendall test, and Sen''s slope were
    used to explore drought''s temporal and spatial trends. Finally, some suggestions
    on the irrigation system of Heilongjiang Province are given. The results show
    that: (1) It is meaningful to study drought and crop yield at a raster scale based
    on remote sensing inversion and distributed AquaCrop models. (2) For most areas
    in Heilongjiang Province, the current irrigation level can increase crop yield
    by 3ton/ha. (3) For areas with drought tendency (east, south, and north of Heilongjiang),
    irrigation should be increased in drought-prone months (May and June). At the
    same time, more attention should be paid to irrigation in this region for simulation
    units sensitive to drought (the difference between irrigated and non-irrigated
    conditions is large). (4) Based on the characteristics of drought in Heilongjiang
    Province, alternating wet and dry changes from April to July can reduce the risk
    of drought by transferring water across the region. In August–September, when
    there are consistent changes in wet and dry conditions, priority is given to ensuring
    irrigation of water-sensitive crops to maximize water use efficiency. CRediT authorship

    article seeks to understand how water market participation has affected farmland
    values. Water markets are institutional and infrastructure arrangements that facilitate
    transfer of water rights between water users in exchange for monetary compensation.
    In drought years, water markets can incentivize farmers with lower-valued water
    uses (e.g., in annual cops such as rice) to transfer or lease their water rights
    to higher-valued uses (e.g., permanent crops such as orchards, environmental,
    or urban uses). Successive droughts, large-scale water infrastructure projects
    that convey water across watersheds, and state policy support have facilitated
    development of water markets in the western United States. Federal policy support
    for water markets has expanded in recent years, and trends in water market transactions
    show an increase in the number of transactions and the volume of water transferred
    (Brewer et al. 2007; Schwabe et al. 2020). A rich economic literature on hedonic
    analysis of farmland values has estimated the value of irrigation in agricultural
    use (Petrie and Taylor 2007; Schlenker, Hanemann, and Fisher 2007; Buck, Auffhammer,
    and Sunding 2014; Sampson, Hendricks, and Taylor 2019). Research has also focused
    on the effects of changes in groundwater policies on land values (Ifft, Bigelow,
    and Savage 2018; Bigelow et al. 2019; Ayres, Meng, and Plantinga 2021), but the
    effects of differential access to and participation in a surface water market
    has received little attention. Economic research has focused on the efficiency
    enhancing role of water markets (Howe, Schurmeier, and Shaw 1986; Olmstead 2010;
    Leonard, Costello, and Libecap 2019; Rimsaite et al. 2021), but we do not know
    how those efficiency gains may be distributed among different participants in
    the market. In this article, we investigate whether agricultural parcels that
    participate in water markets experience an increase in land value as future water
    sale revenues are capitalized in land prices. Since the early days of interbasin
    water transfers and water market development, there has been a recognition of
    potential negative externalities of water transfers in source regions (Chong and
    Sunding 2006; Bourgeon, Easter, and Smith 2008). These may include losses to the
    rural economy from reduced agricultural production, environmental effects from
    diversion of streamflow, or excessive pumping of groundwater to supplement water
    transfers. Although there is no disagreement that these effects exist, the incidence,
    magnitude, and persistence of negative externalities of water transfers are debated
    (Howitt 2014). In the context of California, state and county policy makers have
    implemented some policies to reduce these negative effects, which may have restricted
    water trading (Chaudhry and Fairbanks 2022). Bigelow et al. (2019) found that
    policies restricting water transfers were associated with lower land values in
    areas that had the potential to transfer water. We revisit this study area, with
    different data and model specification, and investigate the effects of transfer
    restrictions on farmland value. We use two decades of farmland transaction data
    from 10 counties in California’s Sacramento River valley to conduct a hedonic
    analysis of water market participation on land values. Hedonic analyses of farmland
    sales data have long been characterized by small datasets, because farmland markets
    are thin, with few arm’s-length transactions in any given county and year, and
    because the cost of acquiring sales transaction data over larger regions from
    real estate data aggregators can be prohibitively high. Prior studies therefore
    used transactions data for a single state (Guiling, Brorsen, and Doye 2009) or
    a single county (Ayres, Meng, and Plantinga 2021). Other hedonic analyses of farmland
    values rely on reports of self-assessed land values collected through surveys
    (Roka and Palmquist 1997; Ifft, Bigelow, and Savage 2018; Bigelow et al. 2019).
    Use of survey data can provide more observations than microlevel sales transactions
    data, but they may raise potential concern over how well survey respondents’ assessment
    of farmland values represent true market prices (Ma and Swinton 2012; Bishop et
    al. 2020). Zillow’s Transaction and Assessment Database (ZTRAX) allows us to circumvent
    these constraints by providing land transactions data for a large study area that
    comprises the majority of the sale-side of the statewide water market in California.
    Moreover, the 20-year time period (2000–2019) of our analysis is long enough to
    show trends in real estate markets aside from macroeconomic fluctuations and spans
    multiple drought periods that show greater water market activity. We join ZTRAX
    data to spatially disaggregated water market data to examine how differential
    participation in water markets and adoption of water transfer restrictions have
    affected land value. This article makes three contributions to the literature.
    First, to our knowledge, this is the first analysis of capitalization of water
    market participation in farmland value. Valued at $3.2 trillion in 2022, farm
    real estate accounted for 83% of total U.S. farm assets (USDA 2022a). Because
    it is composed of such a significant portion of the balance sheet of U.S. farms,
    changes in the value of farm real estate have an important bearing on the farm
    sector’s financial performance and the financial well-being of landowners (Zhang
    and Nickerson 2015). We focus on irrigated agriculture in California which has
    some of the highest per acre values in the country (USDA 2022b). Second, because
    we use spatially disaggregated data among water market participants, we contribute
    to an understanding of the distributional effects of water markets in the agricultural
    sector, between farmers who have secure surface water supplies versus those who
    mostly rely on groundwater. Information on winners and losers from water markets
    would be useful to reduce barriers to its wider adoption (Leonard, Costello, and
    Libecap 2019). Finally, as this article revisits the study area of Bigelow et
    al. (2019), it allows us to contribute to a better understanding of differences
    between hedonic estimates derived from observed market transactions versus those
    derived from producer-assessed farmland value. Overall, we find that water transfers
    are being capitalized into land values in areas that engage in water transfers
    (inside districts), and areas that do not engage in statewide water markets (outside
    districts) experience no change in land values associated with water transfers.
    We find that previous years’ transfers are associated with average land values
    increase in districts at the rate of 1%–2% ($271–$361 per acre), for up to three
    years after the transfers, after which the effect dissipates to zero. Our results
    show that transfers, particularly those conducted in drought years, when water
    prices offered in water market transactions are likely to be higher, are associated
    with even higher increases in land values among districts engaging in water transfers.
    Thus, our results provide suggestive evidence that distribution of gains from
    water markets, in terms of capitalization in land values, are demarcated along
    water sellers and nonsellers in the water markets. We also find increase in depth-to-groundwater
    is valued differently in areas depending on their relative dependence on groundwater
    and water transfers; an additional decline in 1 ft. in depth-to-groundwater is
    associated with a decrease in land value of 0.3% ($54 per acre) in outside-district
    parcels, while inside-district parcels that tend to have access to surface water
    sources show a statistically insignificant effect of increase in depth-to-groundwater.
    Finally, our results show that presence of water transfer restrictions are associated
    with lower land values, which is similar to the results found in previous hedonic
    research using self-reported farmland values in the same study area. Overall,
    these findings have important policy relevance due to the new groundwater laws
    in California. The Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) came into force
    in 2020–2022 and created California’s first statewide mandate requiring local
    water agencies to regulate groundwater extraction and improve groundwater sustainability.
    In some regions, the new laws may increase transactions in water markets. Download

    powerpoint Figure 1 Study Area: left, Farmland Parcels in Filtered ZTRAX Sample;
    right, Location of Districts 2. Study Area and Institutional Context The study
    area is California’s Sacramento Valley, which is a major agricultural area. Sacramento
    Valley refers to the 10-county region in northern Central Valley of California
    (Figure 1).1 A major factor that distinguishes Sacramento Valley from the rest
    of California’s agricultural land base to the south is its relative water abundance.
    A large share of the surface water used for irrigation in the southern and central
    portion of the state originates from snowmelt in the Cascades/Sierra Nevada, which
    collects in the Sacramento Valley. Through a network of reservoirs and canals,
    the federal Central Valley Project (CVP) and California’s State Water Project
    (SWP) supply water to many irrigation and water districts in the Sacramento Valley
    and other parts of the state. This region has relatively abundant supplies of
    groundwater, which is a primary supply for many farms as well as domestic users.
    Irrigation and Water Districts In the western United States, “special districts,”
    particularly irrigation and water districts, are the predominant organizational
    structure that hold the majority of senior surface water rights, deliver water
    to individual users, and facilitate water transfers during droughts. Irrigation
    and water districts (referred to from here on simply as “districts”) provide focused
    surface water–based irrigation-related services to landowners within defined geographic
    boundaries.2 According to a national census of irrigation organization, more than
    2,500 districts in the western United States deliver more than 40 million acre-feet
    of irrigation water directly to farms. In 2018, about 60% of irrigated acreage
    in the western United States was serviced by a district, and water delivered by
    districts constituted about 67% of all water used for irrigation by farms (Potter,
    Hrozencik, and Wallander 2023). As it pertains to our analysis, a key feature
    of districts is that they provide their members access to water distribution and
    conveyance system in the state. In drought years, the projects’ conveyance infrastructure
    is also used to transfer water from sellers in the Sacramento Valley to buyers
    in the south, thus enabling district member farmers to participate in interbasin
    water transfers. Given our large study area, we expect heterogeneity in districts’
    water market participation. Districts differ in their size, water rights, location
    relative to water buyers and thus conveyance costs, local soil and groundwater
    conditions, and crop mix. Thus, districts may have different expectations about
    potential benefits and costs of participating in water transfers, and the extent
    of their participation in water transfers may differ. For example, districts with
    mostly annual lower-valued crops such as rice or alfalfa may have lower opportunity
    cost of fallowing farmland than those with permanent tree crops (Chaudhry and
    Fairbanks 2022). Furthermore, districts’ institutional forms may not be prepared
    for the challenges of internal reorganization for engaging in a water market (Rosen
    and Sexton 1993; Libecap 2011; Griffin 2012). Historically, districts arose in
    the early late nineteenth and twentieth centuries to solve collective action problems
    among district members for financing capital needs for surface water irrigation
    infrastructure (Hundley 2001; Ostrom 2011; Hanemann 2014), and internal management
    and regulatory processes for participation in water market may impose too high
    transactions costs on some districts (Leonard, Costello, and Libecap 2019).3 In
    some cases, the home county of the district may require additional permits for
    certain kinds of transfers. Surface Water Markets and the Role of Groundwater
    Substitution Permit Requirements Owing to their relative water abundance and senior
    water rights, Sacramento Valley districts are sellers in the statewide water markets.
    Spurred by the drought in 1987–1992, water marketing increased in 1991 in California
    and generally becomes more active in drought periods. Farmers lease or temporarily
    transfer their surface water supplies by fallowing their cropland (a practice
    known as crop-idling [CI]), or pumping groundwater to continue agricultural production
    while leasing surface water rights (a practice known as groundwater substitution
    [GWS]). Since the early 1990s, CI and GWS have become two of the main modes of
    water transfers in California’s statewide water market (Hanak and Stryjewski 2012).
    Until the implementation of the SGMA in 2020–2022, aside from a few adjudicated
    groundwater basins in southern California, there have been few state restrictions
    on groundwater volume pumped. Groundwater has been an open-access resource in
    most of the state and the “no-injury” clause intended to protect third parties
    from unmitigated harm only applies to surface water. Water transfers of the early
    1990s relied heavily on groundwater substitution, which led to increased groundwater
    pumping and a subsequent drop in the groundwater levels in some areas. This created
    political momentum in many rural communities in California against groundwater-substitution-based
    water transfers. By the mid- to late 1990s, 22 of the California’s 58 counties
    issued ordinances that directed districts to obtain permits from their respective
    home county governments to execute a groundwater export or substitution-based
    transfer out of the basin (Hanak 2003). While districts could transfer their surface
    water allocations by fallowing land with necessary state or federal approvals
    as needed, county ordinances on GWS-based transfers add an additional layer of
    approvals for completing a water transfer. County ordinances were thus policy-induced
    transactions costs imposed specifically on GWS-based transfers to mitigate groundwater-related
    negative externalities on outside-district farms that relied on groundwater as
    their primary source of irrigation. As Hanak (2003) has documented in detail,
    immediately after these ordinances were passed, county-level GWS permit requirements
    became a highly effective deterrent for GWS-based transfers. Research on the determinants
    of GWS permit requirements across California found that counties with GWS permit
    requirements had higher residential dependence on groundwater and more irrigated
    farmland, and while a higher share of on-farm employment increased the likelihood
    of adoption, counties with a higher share of value-added activities related to
    agriculture (e.g., agricultural processing activities rather than on-farm employment)
    were less likely to adopt GWS permit requirements (Hanak 2005). However, no previous
    research has linked agricultural land values to the presence of the GWS permit
    requirements. More than two decades since the implementation of GWS permit requirements,
    it is an empirical question how county ordinances are being implemented and how
    they correlate with actual GWS-based transfers from the area. In the short term,
    these ordinances were a defensive strategy by groundwater-dependent users to protect
    themselves from harmful effects of water transfers, but in the long run, transfer
    behavior may have adjusted. Available data on mode of water transfers (see Section
    4) shows that GWS permit requirements have not been equally prohibitive for GWS-based
    transfer across all counties in the sample. 3. Conceptual Model and Empirical
    Strategy Conceptual Model Farmland value is composed of expected net present value
    of economic returns to land as given by 1 where Vit is the value of agricultural
    parcel i in year t, RA is the return from agricultural production, and Ais is
    a vector of parcel-specific variables that affect agricultural productivity (Palmquist
    1989).4 Ais includes access to irrigation water supplies, soil quality, proximity
    to roads, urban areas, slope and elevation of the parcel, and so on. Research
    on hedonic value of water has found that value of irrigation water is bundled
    with value of land, although water availability is measured differently depending
    on the institutional context (Petrie and Taylor 2007; Buck, Auffhammer, and Sunding
    2014; Brent 2017; Sampson, Hendricks, and Taylor 2019). In our study area, location
    of the parcel inside or outside a district determines the portfolio of water rights
    attached to the parcel; district parcels have surface water allocations and may
    supplement their irrigation water supplies with groundwater sources, while outside-district
    parcels are dependent on groundwater for irrigation supplies. District parcels
    can lease surface water rights to off-farm buyers via a water market, which may
    add to the economic returns of land. We restrict attention to temporary water
    transfers and ignore the possibility of permanent transfers that retire agricultural
    land from production. For farms inside districts expected returns from water transfers
    include an additional stream of returns as follows: 2 In equation [2], value of
    parcel i inside a district, , reflects the expected discounted stream from agricultural
    production (the first term) plus the expected discounted stream of returns from
    water transfers (the second term). captures returns from agricultural production
    as described earlier, and includes parcel-specific variables that affect agricultural
    productivity mentioned earlier, including the portfolio of surface water rights
    and the stock of groundwater below a parcel. RW(Wis) denotes returns from water
    transfers, and Wis includes the parcel-specific variables that affect returns
    from water transfers, such as home district’s participation in water transfers,
    drought conditions in year t which may increase returns from water transfers,
    and so on. If in year t, transfers are undertaken by land fallowing, the first
    term = 0, but returns from water transfers are positive, RW(Wit) > 0. If transfers
    are undertaken by groundwater substitution in year t, both terms would be positive
    as farmer receives revenues from water transfers while also engaging in agricultural
    production. We assume that farmers choose to participate in water transfers to
    maximize total returns from agricultural production and water transfers.5 Finally,
    returns from transfers may also be affected by the GWS permit requirement of district’s
    home county, denoted by GWSc, although the net effect may be uncertain. These
    permit requirements introduced transactions costs in water transfers and may reduce
    the returns from water transfers for inside-district parcels. But if these permit
    requirements are being used to reduce open-access externalities of groundwater,
    for example, allowing groundwater aquifers to recharge, then restrictions to lease
    water could benefit inside-district parcels. Previous research has shown that
    the net effect of changes in groundwater institutions on land values may depend
    on aquifer characteristics, degree of open access, and the effectiveness of the
    policy instruments used to reduce open-access externalities (Edwards 2016; Ayres,
    Meng, and Plantinga 2021). In our context, as mentioned in Section 2, GWSc were
    not based on comprehensive groundwater management but was used as a mechanism
    for resolving conflicts between those who wished to trade in water and the broader
    community. As Bigelow et al. (2019) show, GWSc were associated with lower land
    values in the early years after these permit requirements were instituted, although
    the effect dissipated over time. We assume that farms inside districts can lease
    their surface water allocations in regional water markets and farms outside districts
    cannot do so because of lack of access to water conveyance infrastructure to participate
    in water markets.6 Farm values outside districts, denoted by VitOD, is the discounted
    stream of agricultural returns is expressed as 3 where captures returns from agricultural
    production, and refers to parcel-specific variables outside districts, including
    groundwater stock available to parcel i. Outside-district parcels do not have
    any monetary returns from water transfers, but they may experience negative externalities
    from water transfers. In particular, outside-district parcels may experience lower
    groundwater levels from GWS-based transfers from their region. If a county permit
    requirement GWSc is implemented optimally to eliminate open-access externalities,
    it may protect outside-district parcels’ groundwater stock from negative externalities
    and thus may boost (or mitigate a decline in) land value. Comparing equations
    [2] and [3] suggests testable hypotheses regarding water transfers and land values.
    We expect that water transfers are associated with higher land values inside districts
    and negative or zero effects outside districts. Furthermore, we expect that a
    district’s actual participation in transfers is associated with an increase in
    the district land values. We also expect outside-district parcels to have a higher
    value of groundwater resources compared with inside-district parcels. While the
    effect of GWSc is uncertain, we pay attention to its evolution over time in the
    inside- and outside-district parcels. Empirical Strategy We specify two econometric
    models to investigate how water transfers have affected land values in Sacramento
    Valley, an area that has been a seller of water in water markets. Our first econometric
    model is as follows: 4 In equation [4], the dependent variable is log of inflation-adjusted
    per acre land value of parcel i in year t. The right-side variables include WTct–k,
    which is the total volume of transfers from county c in previous year; t – k,
    where k takes on values 1, 2, …, 5 in different specifications. Transfers are
    undertaken by districts, and WTct–k aggregates volume of water transferred by
    all districts in county c in year t – k. Coefficient βk measures the marginal
    effect of water transfers in year t – k on land value. GWSc is an indicator variable
    that equals one when parcel i is in a county that has a permit requirement for
    GWS-based transfers and zero otherwise. GWit denotes annual parcel-level groundwater
    characteristics, spring groundwater elevation, and the coefficient of variation
    in groundwater elevation in the previous five years. X1i includes parcel-level
    variables such as parcel area, elevation, slope, river frontage, distance to roads,
    distance to urban areas, percentage building footprint, soil quality, and county
    dummy variables that capture time-invariant effects at the county level; finally,
    τYt are annual year dummy variables. Following our conceptual model, econometric
    model 4 is estimated for all parcels and separately for parcels inside and outside
    districts to track differential effect of all variables on land values inside
    and outside districts. Districts hold heterogeneous water rights and vary in location,
    size, local soil and groundwater conditions, and crops planted and may have different
    expectations about potential benefits and costs of participating in water transfers.
    We propose our second econometric model to examine the effect of transfers disaggregated
    at the district level as follows: 5 In equation [5], WTd(t–k) is the total volume
    of transfers from district d in previous years, t–k, where k takes on values 1,
    2, 3 in different specifications. Dt–k is an indicator variable that equals one
    if the year t – k was a dry year and zero otherwise. Coefficient δk measures the
    marginal effect of water transfers in drought years on the value of all district
    parcels. X2d are district-level variables including total area of the district
    and the type of water district (federal, state or independent). Remaining variables
    are the same as in model 4. Model 5 focuses only on inside-district parcels and
    examines whether farmland values inside a district capitalize water transfer revenues
    based on own-district transfer behavior. 4. Data Data Sources, Construction of
    ZTRAX Filtered Sample, and Other Variables Our primary parcel-level dataset comprises
    land transactions data for 2000–2019 across 10 California counties obtained from
    ZTRAX. We restrict the ZTRAX data in several ways. First, we select observations
    with high and medium confidence for arm’s-length transactions as documented by
    Nolte et al. (2024 [this issue]). Second, we restrict the sample to irrigated
    agricultural parcels by using the California’s Department of Water Resources crop
    inventory land use maps that delineated irrigated agricultural areas. Third, the
    location of each ZTRAX parcel was identified vis-à-vis irrigation or water district
    boundaries. Fourth, for parcels outside the district boundaries (but inside irrigated
    agricultural areas as shown in crop layers), data on location of agricultural
    groundwater wells were used as a further check to remove unirrigated parcels.7
    Fifth, following Zhang and Nickerson (2015), we used U.S. Census data to identify
    the location of urban areas in study area. We used 2010 and 2020 U.S. Census Bureau
    definition of urbanized area (population ≥ 50,000) and urban clusters (2,500 ≤
    population < 50,000) to measure the distance of each parcel to the closest urbanized
    area and urban cluster and counted total population within 25 miles of each parcel
    as proxies for urban influence on parcel price. As expected, parcels closer to
    urbanized areas are higher in value. We removed parcels located less than 500
    m from urbanized area and less than 50 m from urban clusters in our final sample
    to mitigate the effect of urban proximity on our results. Finally, we removed
    parcels smaller than two acres as well as obvious outliers in land values (price
    per acre > $200,000 or price per acre < $99). Figure 1 (left) shows the location
    of sample parcels in the study area. All of these steps in constructing the ZTRAX
    filtered sample are described in further detail in Appendix A. Appendix Tables
    A5–A10 present details on the distribution of the ZTRAX filtered sample across
    sample counties, districts, and land use classes. We filtered spatial data on
    all water agencies in the study area to create a set of agricultural irrigation
    and water districts that are also linked to the state (SWP) or federal (CVP) surface
    water conveyance infrastructure (see Appendix A for details on the district filtering
    procedures adopted).8 Figure 1 (right) shows the location of districts in the
    study area. Each parcel in the ZTRAX sample was placed in its respective county
    and labeled “inside district” if it was situated in a district boundary or “outside
    district” if it was located outside a district. Data on districts’ water transfers
    for 2008–2019 were obtained from California’s Department of Water Resource’s historical
    water transfer data.9 We focus on temporary or one-year transfers (also called
    leases). Water transfer data identify districts that transferred water in each
    year, volume of transfer (acre-feet), mode of transfer (CI or GWS), as well as
    duration (one year or long term) of transfer. To augment the district transfer
    data for earlier years, 1995–2007, data collected by the Public Policy Institute
    of California (PPIC) were added, although the PPIC data do not have information
    on mode of transfer.10 Annual water transfer data were matched with ZTRAX parcel
    data by matching district names. To estimate econometric model 4, water transfers
    by all districts in a county were added for each year to calculate the total volume
    transferred from the county.11 California’s Central Valley has a network of groundwater
    monitoring wells that record depth-to-groundwater for agricultural wells.12 Spring
    season data for agricultural wells for 1991–2019 were used in an ordinary kriging
    spatial interpolation procedure to develop groundwater surfaces. This procedure
    was applied to the log-transformed data to normalize the data distribution, suppress
    outliers, and improve data stationarity, as outlined in Pauloo et al. (2020).
    Optimized kriging model fits for each year were applied to reduce error and uncertainty.
    Spring season depth-to-groundwater data were extracted for each parcel in the
    ZTRAX data. Depth-to-groundwater serves as a proxy for energy costs associated
    with pumping groundwater, and we expect a greater depth-to-groundwater to lead
    to higher energy costs of pumping groundwater. Following Bigelow et al. (2019),
    we construct coefficient of variation in depth-to-groundwater in the five years
    before parcel sale to proxy groundwater volatility. Higher groundwater volatility
    is expected to have lower land values if farmers are risk-averse. Download figureOpen

    Price (2001 prices) by District Membership; right, Water Transferred by Districts
    Data on county GWS permit requirements were obtained from state and county documents
    (CDWR and BoR 2019) and verified for earlier years using Hanak (2003). Drought
    occurrence was obtained from the water year’s classification index, which measures
    drought incidence in river basins based on river runoff data. We use drought classification
    of “dry” or “critical” as an indication of drought. During the period of analysis
    is 2000–2019, there are 11 drought years.13 Data Summary and Trends The final
    sample used in the analysis has 10,218 ZTRAX parcel transactions, of which 5,740
    (56%) of the parcels are outside districts and 4,478 (44%) are inside districts.
    In the full sample, mean farmland per acre price is $17,882 (2001 prices) and
    median price is $10,923. Outside districts, mean farmland per acre price is $17,081.05
    (median $10,602), while inside districts, mean farmland per acre price is $18,922.39
    (median $11,304).14 Figure 2 (left) shows mean farmland prices disaggregated by
    the district membership. See Appendix Tables A2–A4 for detailed summary statistics.15
    Figure 3 Spatial Distribution of Groundwater Substitution (GWS) in Study Area:
    left, Counties Requiring a GWS Permit; right, Counties Where GWS-Based Transfers
    Occurred in 2008–2019 Patterns in district-level water market participation reveals
    that 31 of the 66 districts (46%) participated in the water market and transferred
    water out of the Sacramento Valley at least once during 2000–2019, and the remaining
    36 (54%) districts have never participated in transfers. Figure 2 (right) shows
    that volume of water transferred increases in dry years, as expected.16 Depth-to-groundwater
    increases in drought periods, as pumping increases to supplement surface water
    supply shortages, and recovers in wetter periods (see Appendix Figure B3).17 Figure
    3 shows counties in the study area that have a GWS permit requirement and counties
    where GWS-based transfers have been documented since 2008. Figure 3 (left) shows
    that of the 10 counties in the sample, six required a permit to conduct a GWS-based
    transfer and four do not (CDWR and BoR 2019). GWS permit requirements have been
    in place before the period of analysis, 2000–2019. Figure 3 (right) uses available
    data on districts’ mode of water transfer for 2008–2019 to show the occurrence
    GWS-based water transfers indicating that GWS permit requirements are not equally
    prohibitive for GWS-based transfer. In particular, districts in Yolo, Shasta,
    and Colusa Counties have a permit requirement and have approved permits to allow
    for GWS-based transfers. CI transfers are overwhelmingly from Butte County, and
    GWS-based transfers are predominantly in Yuba, Yolo, and Sutter Counties. 5. Results
    Transfers at the County Level and Land Values Table 1 reports the results of the
    model in equation [4]; columns (1)–(3) present results for WTc(t–1) for the full
    sample, outside-district, and inside-district subsamples, respectively. Columns
    (4)–(9) show results for adding longer lags in water transfer variables, WTc(t–k),
    added one at a time in each column. Table 2 provides a summary of estimated marginal
    effects of WTc(t–k) for k = 1, …, 5, and depth-to-groundwater. In the full sample,
    the estimated coefficient of previous year’s transfers, WTc(t–1), is 1.1%. All
    else equal, an increase of 10,000 acre-feet of water from all districts in the
    county is associated with an increase in land value of 1.1% ($197 per acre) one
    year later. Estimated coefficient of depth-to-groundwater in the full sample is
    negative and statistically significant at 10%: a 1-ft. increase in depth-to-groundwater
    is associated with reduction in land values by 0.25% ($45 per acre). Results for
    outside-district subsample, reported in Table 1, column (2), show that water transfers
    have a statistically insignificant effect on land values outside districts. The
    estimated coefficient of depth-to-groundwater is statistically significant: a
    1-ft. increase in groundwater depth is associated with reduction in land values
    outside districts by 0.3% ($57 per acre). This makes sense because outside-district
    parcels are more dependent on groundwater than farms inside districts have senior
    surface water rights and use groundwater as a backstop. Column (3) shows the results
    for inside-district farms. The estimated coefficient of previous year’s transfers
    is positive and significant. An increase of 10,000 acre-feet of water is associated
    with a 1.43% increase in land values inside districts ($271 per acre). This shows
    that the positive and significant coefficient in the full sample was entirely
    driven from the inside-district subsample. Coefficient for depth-to-groundwater
    is statistically zero in the inside-district subsample. Table 1, columns (4)–(6),
    shows the results of model 4 estimated for water transfers two years prior to
    parcel sale, WTc(t–2). In the full sample, the estimated coefficient of WTc(t–2)
    is statistically insignificant. Transfers from districts in the county two years
    ago are associated with 1.83% ($346 per acre) increase in land values inside districts,
    but again, no effect outside districts. Table 1, columns (7)–(9), shows results
    for water transfers three years before parcel sale, WTc(t–3). In the full sample,
    the estimated coefficient of WTc(t–3) is statistically insignificant for the full
    sample, as well as for outside-district parcels. For the inside-district sample,
    an additional 10,000 acre-feet of water transferred is associated with an increase
    of 1.91% in land values ($361 per acre). Results for longer lags, k = 4, 5, show
    statistically insignificant estimates for transfer volumes.18 The results for
    depth-to-groundwater show a very robust pattern across all lags of water transfers.
    For parcels outside districts, the coefficient of depth-to-groundwater is negative
    and statistically significant. An increase in depth-to-groundwater by 1 ft. is
    associated with a reduction in land value of 0.3% ($56–$57). For parcels inside
    districts, the estimated coefficient of depth-to-groundwater is negative but statistically
    indistinguishable from zero. Estimates of coefficient of GWS permit requirement,
    γ, are very interesting. All else equal, average land values are lower in counties
    that have instituted a permit requirement for GWS-based transfers. As Table 1,
    column (1), shows, in the entire sample, counties that have a permit requirement
    for GWS-based transfers have 34% ($6,044 per acre) lower land values than counties
    that do not have this requirement. Columns (2) and (3) show that this difference
    in land values is entirely driven by the outside-district parcels. For parcels
    outside districts, farmland values are lower by 11% ($1,931 per acre) if they
    are in a county that has a permit requirement for GWS-based transfers. Inside-district
    parcels, however, show statistically insignificant effects of being in a GWS permit
    county. We explore these results further by interacting the GWS permit requirement
    with years and examining predicted values over time. Linear predictions are plotted
    in Figure 4, which shows clear differences in land values along the GWS permit
    requirement margin. Outside districts, GWS permit requirement is associated with
    lower agricultural land values (Figure 4, left), while inside districts the difference
    is statistically zero (Figure 4, right). In counties with a GWS permit requirement,
    outside-district parcels tend to have lower land values. GWS permit requirements
    have been in place since before our period of analysis, and these results allude
    to the reasons these requirements were instituted in the first place: groundwater-dependent
    parcels, in relatively lower land value areas, lobbied for these requirements
    as a defensive strategy to protect their irrigation supplies from groundwater-based
    transfers in neighboring districts. We find no evidence that water transfers have
    negatively affected outside-district parcels. It is possible that GWS permit requirements
    helped screen more harmful water transfers. In Section 6, we elaborate on these
    results and compare them with those of Bigelow et al. (2019). View inlineView

    Restricting the sample to within-district parcels and disaggregating annual transfers
    conducted at the district level, we estimate empirical model in equation [5].
    Table 3 presents results of including WTd(t–k), k = 1, 2, and 3 in each column.
    Column (1) shows that the effect of transfers from the district, WTd(t–1), in
    the year prior to parcel sale, varied by drought conditions in that year. If the
    year prior to parcel sale was a drought year, an additional 10,000 acre-feet transferred
    by the district was associated with an increase in land value by 17.4% ($3,292).19
    Transfers in nondrought years had a statistically insignificant effect on land
    values in the district. Column (2) shows the results of model 5 for transfers
    from the district two years prior to parcel sale, WTd(t–2). Results in column
    (2) show that depending on the drought conditions, transfers from the district
    two years before had an opposite effect on land values. Transfers are positively
    associated if undertaken in drought years, but if undertaken in a nondrought year,
    they are negatively associated with land values. An additional 10,000 acre-feet
    transferred in a nondrought year were associated with a reduction in district
    land values by 40.2% ($7,607) two years later, but an increase of 38.5% ($7,285)
    if the water transfers were made in a drought year. These results suggest an interesting
    pattern of association between water transfers by districts and land values inside
    districts. Compared with averages across all districts in the county, as presented
    earlier in results of model 4, own-district transfers have a higher marginal effect
    on land values, yet the increase only lasts two years and then dissipates. Moreover,
    effect varies by drought conditions in the year of transfer. A plausible explanation
    of these results is that water prices received by district farmers for engaging
    in transfers are likely to be higher in dry years as demand for water increases,
    transfers in dry years may be associated with higher transfer revenues and hence
    greater return, as shown in equation [2]. As demand for water in the water market
    decreases in a nondrought year, prices offered to districts for water transfers
    may be lower. Results for transfers at the district level suggest that nondrought
    years transfers may not as profitable for district parcels as transfers in drought
    years. Other economically significant results from model 5 include the statistical
    insignificance of depth-to-groundwater and coefficient of variation in depth-to-groundwater
    in all specifications. This is not entirely surprising, since district parcels
    generally have senior surface water rights and use groundwater to supplement surface
    water supplies.20 6. Discussion: Comparing Results of Self-Reported and Market
    Transactions A comparison of our findings with Bigelow et al. (2019) may shed
    some light on model specification and data used in each study, with some lessons
    for future work. This comparison makes a compelling case for the usefulness of
    replicating previous analyses with different data, particularly in rapidly changing
    policy contexts. Bigelow et al. (2019) used a rotating panel data of farmers’
    self-reported land values over 1999–2009 for a hedonic analysis of groundwater-substitution
    restriction. Following previous literature, such as Hanak (2003), Bigelow et al.
    (2019) interpreted the presence of a GWS permit requirement as a deterrence to
    GWS transfers and used drought periods as a proxy for timing of water sale opportunity
    for parcels inside districts. These temporal and cross-sectional variations were
    exploited by Bigelow et al. (2019) to disaggregate trends in farmland values and
    provided insight into differential effects of GWS permit requirement on trends
    in land values. They found that during 2001–2002, the first drought period after
    the implementation of GWS permit requirements, when they could potentially deter
    drought-induced water transfers, there was a 34% ($2,057 per acre) decline in
    farmland value in counties that had a GWS permit requirement. Disaggregating trends
    for inside- and outside-district sample of agricultural parcels, Bigelow et al.
    (2019) found no effect of GWS permit requirement inside districts but a lower
    land values in outside-district parcels by 46% ($3,318 per acre). These results
    were interpreted as suggestive evidence that GWS permit requirements imposed short-term
    costs on interbasin water transfers from the region. Our analysis is in the same
    10-county study area of Sacramento Valley, although our period of analysis is
    longer, 2000–2019 compared with 1999–2009 in Bigelow et al. (2019). We have used
    pooled cross-sections of market transactions of farmland parcels and annual data
    on districts’ water transfers rather than location of the parcel inside a district
    as a proxy for water transfers. In general, results of hedonic analyses of market
    transactions and self-reported values cannot be expected to be same. In particular,
    there are differences in sample selection, that is, the set of parcels transacted
    may not be representative of the agricultural parcels in the area although a random
    sample of farmers for self-assessment may do a better job of building a representative
    sample of agricultural parcels in regional land market. On the other hand, market
    transactions better capture the long run agricultural profitability of parcels
    while farmers opinions may be systematically biased due to behavioral biases such
    as salience of recent events or simply lack of knowledge or experience with land
    transactions (Bigelow et al. 2020). Despite the differences in our data and models,
    we find some important parallels in the direction of our results. Overall, in
    line with Bigelow et al. (2019), we find lower land values in GWS permit counties,
    specifically in outside-district parcels. Another interesting and important comparison
    between both studies is the estimate of depth-to-groundwater. These studies found
    that inside districts, increase in depth-to-groundwater had statistically insignificant
    effect on land values inside districts and a negative and statistically significant
    effect outside districts. This comparison provides support for the modeling decision
    of separating lands with secure surface water rights (inside districts) from those
    with primary dependence on groundwater (outside districts) in hedonic analyses
    of water transfers and groundwater variables. This concurrence in the direction
    of the results is potentially significant for applied economics work that often
    relies on self-assessed data for hedonic analysis, particularly for agricultural
    land values. The magnitude of the estimates in both studies are quite different.
    For instance, our results show that in the full sample, counties with a GWS permit
    requirement have, on average, 34% lower ($6,044 per acre) land values than counties
    that do not have this requirement, compared with a lower estimate of $2,057 per
    acre in Bigelow et al. (2019). Also, we found that outside-district agricultural
    parcel values were lower by 11% ($1,931 per acre), whereas Bigelow et al. (2019)
    found that outside-district parcels were lower by $3,318 per acre, a higher estimate.
    The magnitude of the estimates of depth-to-groundwater is quite different as well;
    $233 per foot in Bigelow et al. (2019) and $45 per foot in our estimate in the
    full sample. These differences in magnitudes may be important to consider if results
    are being used to develop specific costs estimates or compensation policies. Another
    important difference in results is that while Bigelow et al. (2019) found that
    the difference in values in outside-district parcels along the GWS permit margin
    reduced over time, we found that not to be the case. As Figure 4 shows, the difference
    is that land values in outside-district parcels is large and perhaps getting larger
    over the years. To do an “apples-to-apples” comparison, we estimated our model
    4 for 2000–2009; that is, for almost the same time period as Bigelow et al. (2019).
    Results show that, on average, GWS permit counties have 40% lower land values
    in the full sample but an opposite effect on inside- and outside-district parcels.21
    Parcels outside districts have 24% higher value if they were in GWS permit counties,
    whereas parcels inside districts have 45% lower values if they are in GWS permit
    counties. Overall, these comparisons suggest the possibility of an evolution in
    land values associated with the implementation of GWS permit requirements in the
    20+ years since their enactment. In 2000–2009, the first decade after GWS permits
    were implemented, permit requirements may have been a strong signal to district
    farmers from the county against GWS-based transfers and restricted transfers out
    of the region, particularly in the first drought after the restrictions were passed,
    a result that Bigelow et al. (2019) captured. But over time, as our results show,
    GWS permit requirements have not been a binding constraint against transfers;
    GWS-based transfers have occurred, and thus short-term response to the permits
    has subsided. Our interpretation of the GWS permit variable is that it captures
    the longer-term structural differences in local agricultural economies. Our results
    provide support to the idea that GWS permit were instituted as a defensive strategy
    in areas where land values among nonsellers in the water market were lower. We
    find no evidence of negative effects of water transfers on outside-district parcel
    land values or of GWS permit requirements on inside-district parcels. It is possible
    that some of the harmful transfers may have been screened by GWS permit requirements,
    which helped protect these lands from excessive groundwater depletion and economic
    loss. Finally, it is important to note that without temporal variation in GWS
    permit requirements, neither study makes a causal claim regarding the effect of
    GWS permits on land values. 7. Robustness Checks In constructing our filtered
    sample of ZTRAX parcels and specification of the econometric model, we made several
    assumptions. We check the robustness of our main results by changing some of these
    key assumptions. Specifically, we present results for (1) disaggregating water
    transfers by mode of transfer, (2) dropping parcels farther from urban boundaries,
    and (3) replacing county fixed effects with zip-code fixed effects. Tables for
    these results are provided in Appendix B. We have data for mode of water transferred;
    that is, CI, GWS, or a combination of both, for each district for 2008–2019. We
    adapt econometric model 5 and replace WTd(t–k) with volume of water transferred
    for each mode as a separate explanatory variable.22 Results help illuminate whether
    the association between total annual water transfers and land values differs by
    mode of water transferred. Appendix Table B4 shows that CI-based transfers during
    droughts are associated with the highest increase in land values in subsequent
    years, whereas GWS-based transfers have a statistically insignificant association
    with land values. Some districts transferred via a combination of GWS and CI,
    and such transfers also show a positive association with later land values. Overall,
    in our study area CI transfers may be associated with larger increase in returns
    from water transfers relative to opportunity costs of forgone agricultural production,
    and GWS, while still profit-maximizing for water sellers, is associated with increased
    groundwater pumping costs and county-level transactions costs in obtaining permits
    for such transfers. Next, we explore the sensitivity of our main results to urban
    influence in our ZTRAX sample. It is well established that agricultural parcels
    closer to urban areas have higher land values and may affect results of hedonic
    analysis (Zhang and Nickerson 2015; Ortiz-Bobea 2020). We drop parcels in successively
    larger zones of proximity to the urban boundary to test the robustness of our
    results to reducing the urban proximity of our sample. We drop parcels within
    2,500 m (1,163 observations dropped), 5,000 m (1,691 observations dropped), and
    10,000 m (2,054 observations dropped) from an urban boundary. Estimated coefficients
    of volume of water transferred and depth-to-groundwater in model 4 are summarized
    in Appendix Tables B5 and B6. In line with our main results, we observe that transfers
    from all districts in the county are associated with a statistically significant
    increase in inside-district parcel values and a statistically insignificant association
    with value of outside-district parcel. The magnitude of the estimated coefficient
    in land values associated with WTc(t–1) is higher in the smallest sample, from
    1.43% ($271 per acre) inside districts in the main results to 2.5% ($369 per acre)
    inside districts in the smallest sample, but like our main results, the effect
    diminishes to zero four years after transfers. Increase in depth-to-groundwater
    is associated with a significant decline in land values in outside-district parcels
    and negative but a statistically insignificant effect in inside-district parcels
    (Appendix Table B6), which is also in line with our main results. The magnitude
    of the coefficient is larger in the smallest sample, but the estimated marginal
    effect is lower due to lower land values in the smaller sample. Compared with
    −0.33% (−$57 per acre) in our main results to −0.45% ($49 per acre) for an additional
    decline in 1 ft. of groundwater. For model 5, results of dropping urban parcels
    also shows robustness to dropping parcels closer to urban boundaries. Coefficients
    of water transferred from the district during drought years are positive and statistically
    significant in line with our main results, and the effect is short-lived as well,
    dissipating to zero three years after transfers were conducted (Appendix Table
    B7). In summary, the pattern of the main results is robust to reducing urban proximity
    of the sample. As a final robustness check, we replace county fixed effects in
    our main model with parcel zip codes. In our sample, each county has 15–20 zip
    codes, which offers more granular spatial controls for each parcel, controlling
    for unobserved parcel-level variation not captured in parcel and county controls.
    Estimated coefficients of volume of water transferred and depth-to-groundwater
    in model 4 are summarized in Appendix Tables B8 and B9. Again, we observe that
    in line with our main results, transfers from all districts in the county are
    associated with a statistically significant increase in inside-district parcel
    values and a statistically insignificant effect is in the outside-district parcels.
    The magnitude of the increase in land values in the smallest sample is 1.42% inside
    districts for WTc(t–1) is close to what we observed in our main results, 1.43%,
    and again the effect diminishes to zero four years after transfers. With zip code
    controls, the marginal value of increase in depth-to-groundwater is negative but
    statistically insignificant in all models. For model 5 as well, Appendix Table
    B10 summarizes the main results; overall, results for water transfer variables
    are qualitatively similar to the main results. Land values increase in years subsequent
    to water transfers, particularly if transfers were conducted in drought years.
    8. Summary and Conclusions This study has shed some light on capitalization of
    water transfer benefits in the agricultural sector. Economics research has focused
    on the efficiency enhancing role of water markets (Howe, Schurmeier, and Shaw
    1986; Leonard, Costello, and Libecap 2019), but here we focused on how those efficiency
    gains may be distributed among different participants in the water market. Focusing
    on agricultural users in a region that has been a seller of water in water markets,
    our results show that water market participation is valued positively by sellers.
    Water transfer revenues are being capitalized in farmland values, with lands inside
    irrigation and water districts that engage in out-of-watershed transfers, experiencing
    1%–2% ($271–$361 per acre) increase in land values. However, these gains are short-lived,
    lasting for up to three years after transfers were undertaken and then dwindling
    to zero. We also found that these gains were largely driven from transfers undertaken
    in drought years, rather than in nondrought years, which makes sense because water
    prices tend to be higher in drought years. Value of parcels outside district boundaries;
    that is, nonsellers in the water market do not show any effects of transfers but
    respond to changes in depth-to-groundwater. Increase in depth-to-groundwater is
    associated with decrease in land values; an additional decline in 1 ft. in depth-to-groundwater
    was associated with a 0.3% decrease in land values ($54 per acre). As found in
    previous literature, increase in depth-to-groundwater has a negative effect only
    on outside-district lands, which tend to be more dependent on groundwater. We
    examined GWS permit requirements, a defensive strategy used by some counties in
    the study area. Our results support the notion that relatively lower-valued, groundwater-dependent,
    outside-district landowners may have used this policy as a precautionary strategy
    to protect themselves from physical externalities of water transfers. We found
    no evidence of decline in land values associated with of water transfers outside
    districts, even as GWS-based transfers are occurring, which is consistent with
    the idea that the permit requirements may have screened relatively more harmful
    transfers over time. Comparison of our results with previous work that used self-reported
    land values shows parallels in the direction of the results but some important
    differences in their magnitude and persistence over time, which suggests some
    trade-offs to be considered by researchers in their choice of data source for
    hedonic analysis. Implementation of SGMA is likely to increase the demand of water
    from Sacramento Valley, with potentially an expansion of interbasin water transfers.
    Future research should focus on how Groundwater Sustainability Agencies (GSAs)
    adopt different approaches and policies regarding water transfers, for example,
    some GSAs may grandfather county GWS restrictions, whereas others may modify or
    abandon them entirely. A more careful examination of the overlapping jurisdictions
    of newly formed GSAs with the older institutional forms of districts and counties
    could allow inroads into modeling causal relationships between water policies
    and land values. Future research may use data on groundwater basin boundaries,
    made recently available in the process of SGMA implementation, to conduct a more
    rigorous assessment of capitalization of externalities of water transfers among
    nonsellers in water markets, particularly in delineating the spatial extent of
    the physical externalities of water transfers in outside-district parcels. In
    this article, we only considered distributional effects of water transfers within
    agricultural sectors; considering the effects on other groundwater-dependent users,
    such as rural residential users relying on shallow domestic groundwater wells,
    could be a fruitful and important direction for future research. Acknowledgments

    ↵1 The 10 counties are Shasta, Tehama, Glenn, Butte, Colusa, Sutter, Sacramento,
    Placer, Yolo, and Yuba. ↵2 Irrigation and water districts were enabled via different
    special district acts, but for our purposes we treat them the same. ↵3 District
    management, which is often composed of elected members, may decide to participate
    in water transfers outside the district. District management negotiates the transfer
    price and volume, conducts environmental reviews that may be necessary for the
    transfer approval process, and all the required internal reorganization within
    the district membership to execute the transfer. ↵4 RA(Ai) is the result of solving
    renter’s and landowner’s profit maximization problems as shown in Palmquist (1989).
    ↵5 We abstract away from farmers’ periodic decision to transfer water and/or grow
    crops. Profit-maximizing farmers have incentives to fallow crops that generate
    the least profit per acre-foot. In general, such crops tend to be low-value, highly
    mechanized commodities that generate the lowest on-farm employment and the least
    value added through further processing (Hanak 2003). See Chaudhry and Fairbanks
    (2022) or Griffin (2016, ch. 9) for a single-period, profit-maximizing exchange
    framework. ↵6 Outside-district parcels may engage in water trades between neighboring
    parcels or parcels connected via streams or river channels, but without the large-scale
    infrastructure of CVP and SWP, such trades are necessarily spatially local and
    smaller in volume. Therefore, without loss of generality, we ignore the role of
    these local trades in affecting land values for outside-district parcels. ↵7 Data
    on location of all agriculture wells are from the OSCWR database. ↵8 See https://gis.data.ca.gov/datasets/45d26a15b96346f1816d8fe187f8570d_0/about.
    ↵9 See https://info.water.ca.gov/wtims/proposalservice/publicsearch. ↵10 We gratefully
    acknowledge Ellen Hanak (Public Policy Institute of California) for sharing these
    data with the lead author of this article. ↵11 There are 12 (out of a total of
    66) districts that lie across multiple county borders. In constructing transfers
    from the county, we attributed water transfer volume of cross-county districts
    to the county where most of the district area lies. On average, 86% of the area
    of the cross-county districts lie in one county, so attribution decision was straightforward.
    ↵12 Periodic groundwater measurements and location of groundwater wells were obtained
    from https://data.cnra.ca.gov/dataset/periodic-groundwater-level-measurements.
    ↵13 Drought year classification was obtained from https://cdec.water.ca.gov/reportapp/javareports?name=WSIHIST.
    ↵14 Farmland prices differ considerably by land use, as observed in 2014 land
    cover data. As shown in Appendix Table A6, mean land value is about $6,870 per
    acre in rice cropped areas and $15,077 per acre in field crops, whereas in areas
    in high-value permanent crops is considerably higher. Per-acre value in fruit
    and orchards is $23,072. Moreover, prices fluctuate over years in our sample.
    As Figure 2 (left) shows, prices peaked in 2006–2007, plunging to lows in 2011,
    and then climbing again in 2012. In Bigelow et al. (2019), mean self-assessed
    land values in the same study area was $7,339 per acre for 2001–2009, which is
    closer to land use in rice crops in our sample. In more recent reports, average
    irrigated agricultural land value is reported at $15,000 per acre in 2019 (USDA
    2022b). In general, self-assessed values are expected to be different from market
    data because of sample selection (lower value properties may not be sold) as well
    as self-assessment errors by survey respondents (Bishop et al. 2020). As an additional
    rough data validation, we used the final sample to compare acreage transacted
    with total irrigated acreage as reported in the USDA Census of Agriculture. Appendix
    Table A5 presents the average annual area transacted in the ZTRAX sample, and
    the total irrigated acres as reported by the 2017 USDA Census of Agriculture.
    Although each county percentage acreage varies, the final sample has about 2%
    of the agricultural area in the 10-county region, although it fluctuates for each
    county and across years. This resonates with Nickerson and Zhang (2014) who show
    that around 2% of the farmland in an agricultural market is sold in a year. ↵15
    Appendix Tables A2–A4 show summary statistics of all variables used in the analysis,
    separately for all data, outside and inside districts, respectively. ↵16 Appendix
    Figure B2 also shows that the trends in the number of districts participating
    in the transfer also varies. District participation in the water market increases
    in drought years. ↵17 Appendix Figure B3 shows trends depth-to-groundwater in
    the study area disaggregated by district membership and GWS permit requirement.
    ↵18 Summary results are reported in Table 2, and full results are reported in
    Appendix Table B1. ↵19 Because of space constraints, the table summarizing estimated
    marginal effects of model 5 is moved to Appendix Table B2. ↵20 Results for district
    controls included in vector X2d how tha. t, all else equal, larger districts have
    higher land prices; an increase of 1% in average land value is associated with
    an additional 1,000 acres in district size. Also, the differences in land values
    in state, federal, and independent districts are statistically indistinguishable
    from zero. ↵21 Full results of model 4 estimated for 2000–2009 are shown in Appendix
    Table B3. ↵22 Results for separating mode of water transfer in county-level model
    4 were inconclusive. Water transfers from a county are a mix of CI and GWS, and
    highly positively correlated with each other in a year, so it is difficult to
    tease apart the marginal effects of each mode in county-level transfer model.
    We exploited spatial heterogeneity in the occurrence of GWS transfers post-2007
    and found that presence of any GWS transfers (in all but Butte and Tehama Counties)
    had a statistically insignificant association with outside-district land values.

  description: The accurate measurement of soil moisture content emerges as a critical
    parameter within the ambit of agricultural irrigation management, wherein the
    precise prediction of this variable plays an instrumental role in enhancing the
    efficiency and conservation of agricultural water resources. This study introduces
    an innovative, cutting-edge hybrid model that ingeniously integrates Gated Recirculation
    Unit (GRU) and Transformer technologies, meticulously crafted to amplify the precision
    and reliability of soil moisture content forecasts. Leveraging meteorological
    and soil moisture datasets amassed from eight monitoring stations in Hebei Province,
    China, over the period from 2011 to 2018, this investigation thoroughly assesses
    the model’s efficacy against a diverse array of input variables and forecast durations.
    This assessment is concurrently contrasted with a range of conventional machine
    learning and deep learning frameworks. The results demonstrate that (1) the GRU–Transformer
    model exhibits remarkable superiority across various aspects, particularly in
    short-term projections (1- to 2-day latency). The model’s mean square error (MSE)
    for a 1-day forecast is notably low at 5.22%, reducing further to a significant
    2.71%, while the mean coefficient of determination (R2) reaches a high of 89.92%.
    Despite a gradual increase in predictive error over extended forecast periods,
    the model consistently maintains robust performance. Moreover, the model shows
    exceptional versatility in managing different soil depths, notably excelling in
    predicting moisture levels at greater depths, thereby surpassing its performance
    in shallower soils. (2) The model’s predictive error inversely correlates with
    the reduction in parameters. Remarkably, with a streamlined set of just six soil
    moisture content parameters, the model predicts an average MSE of 0.59% and an
    R2 of 98.86% for a three-day forecast, highlighting its resilience to varied parameter
    configurations. (3) In juxtaposition with prevalent models such as Support Vector
    Regression (SVR), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT),
    XGBoost, Random Forest, and deep learning models like Deep Neural Network (DNN),
    Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and standalone GRU-branch and Transformer-branch
    models, the GRU–Transformer framework demonstrates a significant advantage in
    predicting soil moisture content with enhanced precision for a five-day forecast.
    This underscores its exceptional capacity to navigate the intricacies of soil
    moisture data. This research not only provides a potent decision-support tool
    for agricultural irrigation planning but also makes a substantial contribution
    to the field of water resource conservation and optimization in agriculture, while
    concurrently imparting novel insights into the application of deep learning techniques
    in the spheres of agricultural and environmental sciences.

    as a cornerstone in global food agriculture and a prominent cash crop within the
    Chinese agrarian economy [1], holds a paramount position in the agricultural sector.
    In 2019, as per the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO),
    China’s maize yield escalated to an extraordinary 260 million tons, constituting
    a substantial 21.3% of the worldwide production [2]. However, the growth and fecundity
    of maize are contingent upon an array of determinants, with soil moisture content
    emerging as a critical environmental factor [3]. The hydration state of soil is
    pivotal, directly influencing the physiological and biochemical processes in maize,
    along with its root development [4]. Consequently, the precise prognostication
    of soil water content within the maize root zone is imperative for orchestrating
    efficient irrigation strategies and augmenting both the water-use efficiency and
    the crop’s yield. Yet, forecasting the moisture content in maize’s root zone presents
    a labyrinthine nonlinear challenge. It is intricately influenced by an amalgamation
    of factors such as meteorological conditions, soil characteristics, and various
    stages of crop growth, defying simplification into elementary mathematical models
    [5]. Thus, the exigent scientific quandary lies in harnessing the available meteorological
    and soil data to formulate a potent and efficacious predictive model. Conventional
    methodologies for forecasting the soil moisture content in maize’s root zone can
    be broadly categorized into three distinct classifications: physics-based approaches,
    statistics-based strategies, and machine learning-driven techniques [6]. Physics-based
    methods employ a combination of soil moisture movement and crop water demand equations,
    integrated with meteorological, soil, and crop parameters, to simulate the dynamic
    fluctuations of soil moisture. Exemplified by sophisticated models such as HYDRUS
    [7], SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) [8], DSSAT (Decision-support System
    for Agrotechnology Transfer) [9], and EPIC (Erosion Productivity Impact Calculator)
    [10], these methods adeptly mirror the physical underpinnings of soil moisture
    dynamics. However, they are hampered by their requirement for extensive parameter
    inputs, computational intricacy, and the need for highly precise parameter values,
    rendering them less viable for broad-scale and long-duration predictive applications
    [11]. Statistics-based methods, on the other hand, rely on the application of
    statistical principles and techniques to construct mathematical regression models.
    These models project future soil moisture levels based on historical meteorological
    and soil data [12] and are often represented through methodologies like linear
    regression [13], multiple regression [12], and exponential smoothing [14]. Despite
    their simplicity and ease of use, these methods fall short in acknowledging the
    nonlinear nature of soil moisture, failing to accurately track its dynamic variations
    and generally suffering from lower predictive accuracy [15]. Machine learning-based
    methods, meanwhile, harness the power of artificial intelligence to autonomously
    discern the intrinsic patterns of soil moisture from extensive meteorological
    and soil data, thereby predicting future soil moisture levels [13]. This category
    includes a diverse array of techniques such as the radial basis function neural
    network (RBF) [16], BP neural network [17], support vector machine (SVM) [18,19],
    extreme learning machine (ELM) [20], Random Forest [21], and Gradient Boosting
    Tree [22]. These methods are particularly proficient at processing nonlinear and
    high-dimensional data, yielding high prediction accuracy. However, they necessitate
    substantial volumes of training data, and their predictive performance is often
    limited by the models’ inadequate feature extraction capabilities [23]. Deep learning,
    a sophisticated subset of machine learning, is founded on multi-layered neural
    networks capable of autonomously extracting features and discerning patterns from
    voluminous datasets, thereby boasting potent expressive and generalization proficiencies.
    The primary modalities within deep learning encompass the convolutional neural
    network (CNN) [24], the recurrent neural network (RNN) [25], and the self-attention
    mechanism [26]. As deep learning has evolved, methods such as DNN [27] and RNN
    [26] have been increasingly applied to the prediction of soil moisture content
    in agricultural contexts, achieving notable advancements. Nonetheless, traditional
    deep learning methodologies are not without their limitations. The CNN, utilizing
    convolutional kernels for feature extraction, is adept at processing structured
    data like images and speech but falters with time-series data [28]. Conversely,
    the RNN, designed to handle time-series data, leverages historical information
    for future predictions but is plagued by gradient vanishing and explosion issues,
    impeding its ability to capture long-term dependencies [29]. Similarly, while
    the self-attention mechanism can effectively manage unstructured data such as
    natural language, it is less effective with structured data [30]. To address these
    challenges, the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) improves upon the RNN by incorporating
    a gating mechanism to mitigate gradient vanishing and explosion, thereby enhancing
    the model’s memory capabilities [4]. Meanwhile, the Transformer, based on the
    self-attention mechanism, can discern global dependencies within an input sequence
    through multi-head attention and position encoding, significantly bolstering the
    model’s expressive capacity [31]. Both GRU and Transformer, originating from the
    realm of natural language processing, excel in handling time-series prediction
    tasks and offer complementary advantages to redress the shortcomings of RNNs and
    self-attention mechanisms, respectively [32]. There have been successful applications
    of GRU and Transformer models in various fields, such as traffic flow analysis
    [33], speech recognition [34], and environmental sequence modeling [35], yet their
    application in predicting soil moisture content in maize’s root zone remains relatively
    unexplored. Given the proven efficacy of hybrid models in enhancing prediction
    accuracy by amalgamating different deep learning approaches [4,36], this study
    proposes a novel technical solution: the creation of a hybrid model that fuses
    GRU and Transformer technologies. This GRU–Transformer hybrid model will be applied
    to the prediction of soil water content in the root zone of maize, with an aim
    to evaluate its feasibility and effectiveness in this specific domain. The principal
    aim of this study is to introduce and assess the efficacy of a novel soil water
    content prediction model, christened the GRU–Transformer. This model’s validation
    involves a rigorous evaluation using meteorological and soil moisture data collected
    from maize cultivation areas across eight distinct locations in Hebei Province,
    China, spanning the years 2011 to 2018. The assessment strategy encompasses an
    analysis of the model’s predictive capabilities across various input configurations
    and forecast durations. Additionally, the performance of the GRU–Transformer model
    is benchmarked against a range of conventional machine learning and advanced deep
    learning models, providing a comprehensive understanding of its relative effectiveness
    in predicting soil moisture content in agricultural settings. 2. Material and
    Method The hybrid modeling methodology delineated in this manuscript leverages
    the synergistic capabilities of GRU and Transformer algorithms to prognosticate
    future soil moisture levels across varying depths, as depicted in Figure 1. This
    innovative model is bifurcated into two distinct branches: the GRU branch and
    the Transformer branch. Each branch meticulously processes the 3D tensor, characterized
    by the dimensions (batch_size, input_length, num_features), amalgamating input
    variables derived from both meteorological and soil datasets. Subsequently, the
    extracted features from each branch are intricately spliced and amalgamated through
    a meta-learner, culminating in the synthesis of the final predictive output. This
    output is represented as a two-dimensional tensor (batch_size, output_length),
    encapsulating the forecasted soil moisture content at a future juncture, thereby
    showcasing the model’s robust predictive acumen. Figure 1. Architectural blueprint
    of the GRU–Transformer model. 2.1. GRU Branch The purpose of the GRU branch in
    this study is to utilize the recurrent structure and gating mechanism of GRU to
    capture the long-term dependence and temporal dynamics features in the input sequences
    (Figure 2). GRU, using an improved RNN, can solve the problem of vanishing or
    exploding gradients that RNNs are prone to when dealing with long sequences [35].
    The basic units of GRU are as follows: 𝑟 𝑡 =𝜎( 𝑊 𝑟 𝑥 𝑡 + 𝑈 𝑟 ℎ 𝑡−1 + 𝑏 𝑟 ) (1)
    𝑍 𝑡 =𝜎( 𝑊 𝑍 𝑥 𝑡 + 𝑈 𝑍 ℎ 𝑡−1 + 𝑏 𝑍 ) (2) ℎ ̃  𝑡 =tanh( 𝑊 ℎ 𝑥 𝑡 + 𝑈 ℎ ( 𝑟 𝑡 ⨀ ℎ
    𝑡−1 )+ 𝑏 ℎ ) (3) ℎ 𝑡 =(1− 𝑍 𝑡 )⨀ ℎ 𝑡−1 + 𝑍 𝑡 ⨀ ℎ ̃  𝑡 (4) where 𝑥 𝑡 is an input
    vector, ℎ 𝑡 is an output vector, 𝑟 𝑡 is a reset gate, 𝑍 𝑡 is an update gate, 𝜎
    is a sigmoid function, ⨀ is an element-by-element multiplication, 𝑊 𝑟 , 𝑊 𝑍 ,
    𝑊 ℎ , 𝑈 𝑟 , 𝑈 𝑍 , 𝑈 ℎ is a learnable weight matrix, and 𝑏 𝑟 , 𝑏 𝑍 , 𝑏 ℎ is a learnable
    bias vector. Reset gates and update gates can control the flow of information,
    selectively forgetting or remembering historical states. The reset gate can decide
    whether to reset the historical state or not, and the update gate can decide whether
    to update the current state or not. Figure 2. Conceptual illustration of the GRU
    branch. The structural design and hyperparameter configuration of the GRU branch
    in the model proposed in this paper are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Configuration
    of hyperparameters in the GRU branch. Firstly, a two-layer GRU network is constructed
    with 512 neurons in each layer. ReLU is used for the activation function to increase
    the depth and nonlinearity of the model and to improve the expressive power of
    the model. The formula for the ReLU function is 𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑢(𝑥)=max(0,𝑥) (5) The output
    of the GRU is then mapped onto a low-dimensional space using a fully connected
    layer (Dense) of 256 neurons, reducing the number of parameters and decreasing
    the complexity of the model. The formula for the fully connected layer is 𝑦=𝑊𝑥+𝑏
    (6) where 𝑥 is the input vector, 𝑦 is the output vector, 𝑊 is the learnable weight
    matrix, and 𝑏 is the learnable bias vector. Finally, a spreading layer (Flatten)
    is connected to obtain a 2D tensor (batch_size, 256), which converts the output
    of the fully connected layer into a 1D vector for easy splicing with the output
    of the Transformer branch. The formula for the Flatten layer is 𝑦=𝑥.𝑟𝑒𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑝𝑒(𝑏𝑎𝑡𝑐ℎ𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒,−1)
    (7) where 𝑥 is the input tensor, 𝑦 is the output vector, 𝑏𝑎𝑡𝑐ℎ𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒 is the batch
    size, and −1 indicates that the remaining dimensions are computed automatically.
    The output of the GRU branch can be expressed as 𝑦=𝐹𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑛(𝐷𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑒(𝐺𝑅𝑈(𝐺𝑅𝑈(𝑥))))
    (8) where 𝑥 is the input tensor, 𝑦 is the output vector, 𝐺𝑅𝑈 is the GRU layer,
    𝐷𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑒 is the fully connected layer, and 𝐹𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑛 is the spreading layer. 2.2. Transformer
    Branch In the proposed GRU–Transformer model, the Transformer branch plays a pivotal
    role in capturing global dependencies and multidimensional features within the
    input sequence. This is achieved through the employment of the Transformer’s self-attention
    and multi-head attention mechanisms, as depicted in Figure 3. The Transformer
    is adept at handling sequence-to-sequence tasks, utilizing its attention-based
    encoder–decoder structure [33]. This structure is integral to the model’s ability
    to process and analyze complex sequences of data effectively. The core unit of
    the Transformer can be conceptualized as follows: 𝑄=𝑋 𝑊 𝑄 (9) 𝐾=𝑋 𝑊 𝐾 (10) 𝑉=𝑋
    𝑊 𝑉 (11) 𝐴=𝑠𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥( 𝑄 𝐾 𝑇 𝑑 𝐾 − − √ ) (12) 𝑌=𝐴𝑉 (13) where X is the input matrix,
    𝑄 , 𝐾 , 𝑉 is the query matrix, 𝑊 𝑄 , 𝑊 𝐾 , 𝑊 𝑉 key matrix, value matrix, 𝐴 is
    the learnable weight matrix, 𝑌 is the attention matrix, 𝑑 𝐾 is the output matrix,
    𝑑 𝐾 − − √ is the dimension of the attention header, 𝑠𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥 is a scaling factor
    used to prevent the attention weights from being too large or too small, and softmax
    is the normalization function used to compute the weight of the value corresponding
    to each key. The attention mechanism calculates the correlation of each element
    in the input sequence with the other elements, thus enabling global dependency
    capture. Figure 3. Conceptual diagram of the Transformer branch. The structure
    of the Transformer branch in the model proposed in this paper is designed as follows:
    firstly, position information is added to each element in the input sequence by
    adding position embeddings to the inputs, so that the model can distinguish between
    elements at different positions. The detailed hyperparameter configuration is
    shown in Table 2. Table 2. Hyperparameter configuration for the Transformer branch.
    The formula for position encoding is as follows: 𝑃𝐸 (𝑝𝑜𝑠,2𝑖) =sin ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ 𝑝𝑜𝑠
    10000 2𝑖 𝑑 ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ (14) 𝑃𝐸 (𝑝𝑜𝑠,2𝑖+1) =cos ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ 𝑝𝑜𝑠 10000 2𝑖 𝑑 ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟
    ⎟ (15) where 𝑃𝐸 is the position encoding matrix, 𝑝𝑜𝑠 is the position index, 𝑖
    is the dimension index, 𝑑 is the dimension of the input. The dimensions of the
    position encoding are the same as the dimensions of the input and can be added
    directly to the input. Then, four Transformer encoder layers (Transformer_encoder)
    are constructed with four attention heads per layer (num_heads = 4), each with
    a dimension of 64 (head_size = 64), a feedforward network with a dimension of
    128 (ff_dim = 128), and a Dropout layer with a rate of 0.1 (dropout_rate = 0.1).
    The above configuration increases the depth and diversity of the model and improves
    its expressive power. Among them, the Dropout layer can randomly discard a small
    number of neurons to prevent model overfitting. The structure of the Transformer
    encoder layer is as follows: 𝑋 ′ =𝑋+𝑀𝑢𝑙𝑡𝑖𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑑𝐴𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛(𝑋,𝑋,𝑋) (16) 𝑋 ″ = 𝑋 ′ +𝐹𝑒𝑒𝑑𝐹𝑜𝑟𝑤𝑎𝑟𝑑(
    𝑋 ′ ) (17) 𝑌=𝐿𝑎𝑦𝑒𝑟𝑁𝑜𝑟𝑚( 𝑋 ″ ) (18) where 𝑋 is the input matrix, 𝑋 ′ is the output
    of the first residual connection, 𝑋 ″ is the output of the second residual connection,
    𝑌 is the final output, 𝑀𝑢𝑙𝑡𝑖𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑑𝐴𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 is the multi-head attention layer, 𝐹𝑒𝑒𝑑𝐹𝑜𝑟𝑤𝑎𝑟𝑑
    is the feedforward network layer, and 𝐿𝑎𝑦𝑒𝑟𝑁𝑜𝑟𝑚 is the layer normalization layer.
    The multi-head attention layer can divide the input matrix into multiple sub-matrices,
    which are stitched together after separate attention computations to capture the
    multi-dimensional features in the input sequence. The feedforward network layer
    can increase the complexity of the model by performing a nonlinear transformation
    of the input matrix. The layer normalization layer normalizes each layer of the
    input matrix to make the model more stable. Residual connections make the model
    easier to optimize avoiding gradient vanishing or exploding. Then, a 256 neuron
    fully connected layer (Dense) is constructed to map the output of the Transformer
    to a low dimensional space reducing the number of parameters and decreasing the
    complexity of the model. Finally, a two-dimensional tensor (batch_size, 256) is
    obtained through a Flatten layer, which converts the output of the fully connected
    layer into a one-dimensional vector, which can be easily spliced with the output
    of the GRU branch. The output of the Transformer branch can be represented as
    follows: 𝑦=𝐹𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑛(𝐷𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑒( 𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑒𝑟𝐸𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑟 4 (𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝐸𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑠(𝑥)))) (19)
    where 𝑥 is the input tensor, 𝑦 is the output vector, 𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝐸𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑠 is the
    position encoding layer, 𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑒𝑟𝐸𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑟 is the Transformer encoder layer,
    𝐷𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑒 is the fully-connected layer, 𝐹𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑛 is the spreading layer, and 4 means
    repeat four times. 2.3. Meta-Learner The purpose of the meta-learner in the model
    proposed in this paper is to splice and fuse the outputs of the two branches to
    obtain the final prediction results. The structure of the meta-learner is designed
    as follows: firstly, the outputs of the two branches are concatenated to obtain
    a two-dimensional tensor (batch_size, 512), and then the features of the two branches
    are combined to increase the information content of the model. The detailed hyper-parameter
    configuration is shown in Table 3. Table 3. Meta-learner hyperparameter configuration.
    The equation for the splicing layer can be expressed as follows: 𝑦=[ 𝑥 1 , 𝑥 2
    ] (20) where 𝑥 1 is the output of the GRU branch, 𝑥 2 is the output of the Transformer
    branch, 𝑦 is the spliced output, and [] denotes the splicing operation. Then,
    a 5-layer neuron fully connected layer (Dense) is constructed and the activation
    function is ReLU. The formula for the fully connected layer is as follows: 𝑦=𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑢(𝑊𝑥+𝑏)
    (21) where 𝑥 is the input vector, 𝑦 is the output vector, 𝑊 is the learnable weight
    matrix, 𝑏 is the learnable bias vector, and 𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑢 is the activation function. Finally,
    the connection is made to the output layer, which is Dense, and the activation
    function used is linear to obtain the final output, which is a two-dimensional
    tensor (batch_size, output_length). The above process maps the output of the fully
    connected layer to a one-dimensional space to obtain the predicted values. 2.4.
    Model Evaluation and Training To evaluate the performance of different models,
    the following five evaluation metrics were chosen in this paper. Mean Squared
    Error (MSE): 𝑀𝑆𝐸= 1 𝑚 ∑ 𝑚 𝑖=1 ( 𝑦 𝑖 − 𝑦 ̂  𝑖 ) 2 (22) Mean Absolute Error (MAE):
    𝑀𝐴𝐸= 1 𝑚 ∑ 𝑚 𝑖=1 |( 𝑦 𝑖 − 𝑦 ̂  𝑖 )| (23) Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸=
    1 𝑚 ∑ 𝑚 𝑖=1 ( 𝑦 𝑖 − 𝑦 ̂  𝑖 ) 2 − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − √ (24) Coefficient
    of Determination (R2): 𝑅 2 =1− ∑ 𝑖 ( 𝑦 ̂  𝑖 − 𝑦 𝑖 ) 2 ∑ 𝑖 ( 𝑦 ̲ 𝑖 − 𝑦 𝑖 ) 2 (25)
    where 𝑦 ̂  𝑖 is the predicted value, 𝑦 𝑖 is the true value, 𝑦 ̲ 𝑖 is the average
    of the true values. 𝑀𝐴𝐸 can reflect the actual situation of the error of the predicted
    value: the smaller its value, the higher the accuracy of the prediction. 𝑀𝑆𝐸 is
    the expected value of the square of the difference between the predicted value
    and the true value, which can evaluate the degree of change of the data, the smaller
    its value, the higher the stability of the prediction. 𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸 is the arithmetic
    square root of 𝑀𝑆𝐸 , which, like the 𝑀𝐴𝐸 , is used to measure the accuracy of
    the prediction, but it has a greater penalty for larger errors, so it is more
    suitable for evaluating models that are sensitive to errors. 𝑅 2 can eliminate
    the influence of dimensionality on the evaluation index, it indicates the degree
    of correlation between the predicted value and the real value, and the closer
    its value is to 1, the higher the fit of the prediction. Regarding the experimental
    setup for this research, the hardware configuration encompasses an Intel® Xeon®
    CPU E5-1620 v4 @ 3.50 GHz, an NVIDIA Quadro K2200 GPU, and 32 GB of RAM. The software
    infrastructure leverages Anaconda as the foundational platform for deep learning
    endeavors, with Keras serving as the framework for constructing deep learning
    models, and TensorFlow-gpu 1.13 functioning as the backend engine. CUDA technology,
    developed by NVIDIA Corporation based in Santa Clara, CA, USA, is employed to
    facilitate parallel computing on the GPU, thereby augmenting the training speed
    of the model. Python 3.7 is utilized as the primary programming language. The
    training methodology incorporates the Adam optimization algorithm for model refinement,
    complemented by an early stopping criterion as a termination condition for training.
    This criterion is set with a threshold of 50 iterations—training ceases if there
    is no improvement in the model’s loss on the validation set within these iterations.
    The optimal model weights are preserved, and the model is saved in the .h5 format.
    This comprehensive setup ensures a robust and efficient training environment,
    which is crucial for the development and validation of the deep learning model.
    2.5. Study Area and Data Acquisition The focal area of this study is Hebei Province,
    China, encompassing geographical coordinates ranging from 36°05′ to 42°40′ N latitude
    and 113°27′ to 119°50′ E longitude. This region is characterized by a temperate
    continental monsoon climate, distinguished by four well-defined seasons, ample
    sunshine, moderate rainfall, and significant temperature variations, among other
    climatic attributes. The dataset employed in this study was procured from the
    China Meteorological Data Network, encompassing both meteorological and soil moisture
    content data spanning the years 2011 to 2018. In alignment with the prevalent
    conditions of maize cultivation in the region and subsequent consultations with
    local agricultural authorities, a comprehensive dataset comprising 450,120 records
    was assembled from eight agrometeorological monitoring stations within Hebei Province
    (namely Fuping, Weixian, Gaoyi, Fengning, Langfang, Xinglong, Weichang, and Qinglong
    stations), as illustrated in Figure 4. Soil water content measurements were conducted
    at an hourly frequency. The volumetric water content of the soil (denoted as 10SVWC,
    20SVWC, 30SVWC, 40SVWC, 50SVWC, and 60SVWC, represented in percentage) was recorded
    at varying depths of 10 cm, 20 cm, 30 cm, 40 cm, 50 cm, and 60 cm, with daily
    average values being computed. The meteorological data encompassed a range of
    parameters, including the daily mean air temperature (TEM_Avg, in degrees Celsius),
    minimum air temperature (TEM_Min, in degrees Celsius), maximum air temperature
    (TEM_Max, in degrees Celsius), mean surface temperature (GST_Avg, in degrees Celsius),
    minimum surface temperature (GST_Min, in degrees Celsius), maximum surface temperature
    (GST_Max, in degrees Celsius), duration of sunshine (SSH, in hours), mean relative
    humidity (RHU_Avg, in percentages), precipitation during the period from 20:00
    to 08:00 h (PRE_Time_2008, in millimeters), precipitation during the period from
    08:00 to 20:00 h (PRE_Time_0820, in millimeters), 24 h precipitation (PRE_Time_2020,
    in millimeters), average wind speed (WIN_S_Avg, in kilometers per hour), maximum
    wind speed (WIN_S_Max, in kilometers per hour), dominant wind direction (WIN_D_S_Max,
    in degrees), instantaneous maximum wind speed (WIN_S_Inst_Max, in kilometers per
    hour), and the direction of the instantaneous maximum wind speed (WIN_D_INST_Max,
    in degrees). Figure 4. Geographical overview of the study area and distribution
    of sites. 2.6. Data Analysis Table 4 elegantly presents the synthesized statistical
    analysis of 22 distinct soil and meteorological indicators, encompassing an array
    of parameters such as mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and median values
    across the eight meticulously chosen monitoring stations. The temporal scope of
    this study encompasses an entire annual cycle of data from maize cultivation locales,
    thereby encapsulating the complete spectrum of seasonal fluctuations and chronological
    diversities. This comprehensive temporal coverage, while providing a holistic
    view of the data, simultaneously introduces a formidable challenge in the precise
    prediction of soil water content at varying depths within the maize root zone.
    Such an encompassing approach ensures a thorough understanding of the intricate
    interplay between temporal variables and the dynamic nature of soil moisture content,
    critical for advancing predictive accuracy in agricultural environmental studies.
    Table 4. Comprehensive statistical analysis outcomes of soil and meteorological
    data. Figure 5 elegantly delineates the outcomes of the Pearson correlation analysis
    conducted among the various variables. This analysis reveals that the correlation
    coefficients pertaining to soil water content at diverse depths surpass the threshold
    of 0.7, indicating a robust and strongly positive correlation. The interplay between
    each meteorological parameter and soil water content exhibits varying degrees
    of correlation. Specifically, TEM_Avg, TEM_Max, TEM_Min, RHU_Avg, PRE_Time_2008,
    PRE_Time_0820, PRE_Time_2020, GST_Avg, GST_Max, and GST_Min all demonstrate a
    positive correlation with the soil water content at different depths. Conversely,
    WIN_S_Avg, WIN_S_Max, WIN_D_S_Max, WIN_S_Inst_Max, WIN_D_INST_Max, and SSH exhibit
    a negative correlation with soil water content across various depths. This intricate
    mosaic of correlations underscores the multifaceted nature of the interactions
    between meteorological factors and soil water content, providing invaluable insights
    into the complex dynamics governing soil moisture across different strata. Figure
    5. Analytical depiction of correlation between soil water content and other variables
    at varied depths. Asterisks (*) indicate correlations statistically significant
    at p < 0.05. 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Comparison of Model Prediction Accuracy
    for Different Days of Delay Figure 6 and Figure 7 elucidate the predictive accuracy
    outcomes of the GRU–Transformer model across various delay intervals. The model’s
    overall performance is noteworthy for its consistently high accuracy and stability
    under diverse conditions. Specifically, the MSE for soil moisture prediction at
    different depths fluctuated between 2.71% and 17.53%, while the R2 spanned from
    60.47% to 96.08%. These figures emphatically underscore the model’s adaptability
    and resilience in varied scenarios. A more granular analysis reveals that the
    model’s predictive precision is notably superior for shorter delay periods, such
    as 1 to 2 days. For instance, the average MSE for a 1-day delay stands at 5.22%,
    with the lowest recorded value being 2.71%, and the average R2 is remarkably high
    at 89.92%. Nonetheless, it is observed that the predictive error incrementally
    ascends with an increase in the delay duration, suggesting a heightened proficiency
    of the model in forecasting near-term data. When delving into the comparison across
    different soil depths, it is discernible that the model’s predictive error for
    shallow soils, like at 10 cm depth, is relatively elevated, with a mean MSE of
    15.00% and an average R2 of merely 66.17%. In stark contrast, the model’s error
    rate for deeper soils, such as at 50 cm, is markedly lower, boasting an average
    MSE of 7.71% and an average R2 of 85.66%. This disparity highlights the model’s
    significant advantage in predicting the water content of deeper soils. In summation,
    the soil water content prediction model introduced in this study exhibits exemplary
    efficacy across various prediction delays and soil depths. It is particularly
    commendable for its high accuracy and reliability in short-term predictions and
    in assessing the water content of deeper soil layers. Figure 6. Analysis of prediction
    error in GRU–Transformer model across different time delays. Figure 7. Error distribution
    in test set for GRU–Transformer model over various time delays. The marked disparities
    in the performance of the soil moisture content prediction model at varying delay
    intervals and soil depths, as highlighted in this study, underscore the intricate
    complexity of soil moisture dynamics and its susceptibility to environmental influences.
    These variances not only attest to the model’s adaptability but also furnish novel
    insights into the understanding of soil moisture behavior. The observed decrease
    in prediction accuracy with prolonged delay days is potentially attributable to
    escalating uncertainties on the temporal scale. In the immediate term, the soil
    moisture content is relatively less impacted by meteorological conditions, thereby
    enabling the model to forecast near-future soil moisture status with greater precision.
    However, the predictability diminishes as the timeframe extends, largely due to
    the increasing unpredictability of meteorological factors such as rainfall and
    evaporation, which exert a direct influence on the model’s accuracy [37]. Figure
    8 delineates the outcomes of an autocorrelation analysis on soil water content
    over a 1–10-day delay period, using the data from this study. The analysis reveals
    a decline in the mean autocorrelation coefficient of soil water content from a
    peak of 0.91 to a mere 0.19 as the delay interval increases, thereby highlighting
    the amplified challenges in forecasting over longer future durations. This phenomenon
    aligns with the findings of Cai et al. (2019) [29], who examined the 1–16-day
    autocorrelation of soil water content. Figure 8. Autocorrelation analysis of soil
    water content under 1–10-day delay. Furthermore, the dynamics of soil moisture
    encompass a spectrum of intricate nonlinear processes such as evaporation, infiltration,
    and plant water uptake. Consequently, the model’s prediction error tends to escalate
    with the extension of the forecast period, a concept corroborated by theoretical
    studies in time-series prediction. From the standpoint of soil depth, the model
    exhibits heightened accuracy in predicting moisture content in deeper soils. This
    heightened accuracy could stem from the reduced impact of daily climatic fluctuations
    on deeper soils, which exhibit relatively less variability in moisture content.
    In contrast, surface soils are directly exposed to atmospheric elements, rendering
    their moisture status more immediately susceptible to variables like rainfall
    and evapotranspiration, thus posing greater challenges for accurate prediction
    [38]. The moisture dynamics in deeper soil strata are comparatively stable and
    are more effectively and accurately captured by existing hydrological and soil
    science models [39]. This observation underscores the significant role of soil
    physical characteristics in influencing the performance of prediction models and
    suggests the necessity of comprehensive consideration of the properties of different
    soil layers in the construction and parameter optimization of these models. 3.2.
    Assessing the Predictive Efficacy of Varied Input Parameter Combinations The efficacy
    of the proposed soil water content prediction model was exhaustively evaluated
    across a spectrum of input parameter combinations. Six distinct sets of input
    terms, comprising 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 22 parameters, respectively, were meticulously
    formulated based on the inter-correlation of the indicators (as outlined in Table
    5). This approach was employed to juxtapose the model’s predictive accuracies
    under diverse parameter amalgamations. The experimental outcomes elucidate key
    characteristics and trends in the model’s performance. Table 5. Framework of diverse
    input term combinations. Figure 9 and Figure 10 depict the predictive accuracy
    of the GRU–Transformer model under these varied input scenarios. Regarding its
    overall performance, the model consistently exhibited high accuracy and stability
    across the range of parameter combinations. The MSE of the GRU–Transformer model
    oscillated between 0.43% and 1.11%, while the R2 ranged from 0.8482 to 0.8578.
    This variance indicates that the proposed model adeptly predicts soil water content,
    effectively handling different sets of input parameters. Figure 9. Assessment
    of prediction accuracy in GRU–Transformer model with varied input term combinations.
    Figure 10. Distribution of test set errors in GRU–Transformer model under different
    input term combinations. Focusing on the comparative performance across parameter
    combinations, the model attained its zenith under the 22-parameter ensemble (Group
    1), registering an average MSE of 0.62% and an average R2 of 0.8578. This implies
    that the model harnesses a broader array of data features to enhance predictive
    accuracy when endowed with a higher count of parameters. Conversely, in the 6-parameter
    combination (Group 6)—the minimal parameter set—the average MSE modestly declined
    to 0.59%, and the average R2 marginally ascended to 0.8482. This demonstrates
    the model’s capacity to sustain high accuracy even with a reduced parameter set,
    underlining its robustness and adaptability. An in-depth analysis of the influence
    of the parameter count on the model’s efficacy reveals that, while both the maximal
    and minimal MSE values diminish as the number of parameters decreases, the overall
    performance remains relatively unaffected. This observation suggests that the
    model proficiently captures the salient features of soil water content, even under
    conditions of simplified input, highlighting its capability to efficiently distill
    and utilize essential data characteristics. This research discerned that diminishing
    the number of parameters led to a slight escalation in the error indices, while
    the R2 values continued to hover at elevated levels. This phenomenon suggests
    that the model retains the primary factors influencing soil water content, even
    under a regime of parameter simplification, thereby facilitating effective prediction.
    Such a capability could be attributed to the fact that the chosen parameters exhibit
    a strong correlation with soil water content, coupled with a degree of redundancy
    among them. That is, certain parameters can be inferred or approximated using
    others. Consequently, when the parameter count is reduced, the model compensates
    for the absence of certain parameters by adjusting the weights of the remaining
    ones, thus sustaining its high predictive accuracy. This characteristic also underscores
    the model’s robust self-adaptive nature, enabling automatic adjustments in its
    structure and parameters in response to varying parameter combinations, to achieve
    optimal prediction outcomes. Moreover, the progressive increase in MSE, RMSE,
    and MAE from Group 1 (22 parameters) to Group 6 (6 parameters), juxtaposed with
    the relatively minor fluctuation in the R2 value (0.8482–0.8578), indicates the
    model’s tolerance to changes in parameter quantity. This implies that alterations
    in the number of parameters do not significantly impact the predictive capability
    of the model. This resilience may stem from the model’s GRU–Transformer hybrid
    neural network architecture, which adeptly extracts higher-order features of the
    parameters through multilayer nonlinear transformations, thereby enhancing its
    expressive and generalization abilities. Hence, even with a limited number of
    parameters, the model is capable of discerning potential interrelationships through
    neural network learning, facilitating accurate soil water content prediction.
    The high consistency in error metrics between Groups 1 and 2 may be attributed
    to the inclusion of comprehensive soil volumetric water content parameters and
    other critical parameters such as temperature, relative humidity, precipitation,
    and wind speed in these combinations. These parameters collectively encapsulate
    the soil’s physical, chemical, and biological attributes, as well as the soil–atmosphere
    interactions, thereby influencing the dynamic shifts in soil water content. Hence,
    they provide a wealth of information that enhances the predictive accuracy and
    stability of the model. Interestingly, even with Group 6, which comprises the
    least number of parameters focused solely on volumetric soil water content, the
    decline in predictive accuracy is not significantly pronounced. This implies that
    these parameters are direct indicators of soil water content and the primary factors
    influencing its variability. Additionally, as depicted in Figure 11, the correlation
    between different soil depths ranges from 0.65 to 0.95, offering synergistic features
    that bolster the stability of the model’s predictions. Consequently, the model
    achieves satisfactory predictive accuracies even when solely reliant on soil water
    content data. Figure 11. Characterization and interrelation of soil water content
    at diverse depths. 3.3. Comparative Analysis of Prediction Accuracy against Benchmark
    Models In assessing the performance for five-day-ahead predictions, this study
    scrutinizes the distinctions in the predictive accuracy of the newly devised GRU–Transformer
    model relative to other established models. This comparative evaluation encompasses
    typical machine learning models such as Support Vector Regression (SVR [18]),
    K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN [40]), Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT [41]), XGBoost
    [42], Random Forest [21]), and deep learning models like Deep Neural Networks
    (DNN [27]), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN [4]), as well as independent GRU
    and Transformer branches. Table 6 delineates the soil water content prediction
    accuracies of these various models, showcasing a spectrum of performances with
    MSE values ranging from 10.31% to 31.40% and R2 values spanning 42.32% to 80.27%.
    These results highlight the diverse capabilities and adaptability of the different
    models in predicting soil water content. Table 6. Comparative analysis of prediction
    accuracy across various models for soil water content. Upon comparing the performances
    of these models, the GRU–Transformer model, as proposed in this study, emerged
    as the most proficient, recording an MSE of 10.31% and an R2 of 80.27%. This exemplifies
    its superior predictive capabilities in handling complex soil moisture data. In
    stark contrast, the traditional KNN model fared the poorest, with an MSE of 31.40%
    and an R2 of merely 42.32%. The XGBoost model, known for its efficacy and popularity,
    yielded an MSE of 12.69% and an R2 of 75.79%, outperforming most models but still
    falling short of the GRU–Transformer model’s proficiency. When comparing deep
    learning models against traditional machine learning models, it is observed that
    deep learning-based models (such as CNN, LSTM, independent GRU, and Transformer
    branches) generally surpass their traditional counterparts. Their MSE and R2 values
    lie in the range of 11% to 13% and 76% to 79%, respectively, underscoring the
    formidable capability of deep learning in processing complex datasets. Conversely,
    traditional machine learning models, including SVR and GBDT, exhibit comparatively
    lower predictive accuracy, with significantly higher MSE and MAE values than those
    of deep learning models. This dichotomy accentuates the burgeoning potential of
    deep learning approaches in the realm of complex data analysis and prediction.
    In the realm of soil water content prediction, the exemplary performance of the
    GRU-Transformer model underscores the formidable potential of deep learning technologies
    in processing environmental data. The model’s capacity to surpass both traditional
    machine learning and other deep learning models can be primarily attributed to
    its unique structural composition and its enhanced capability in handling complex
    datasets. The GRU–Transformer model ingeniously amalgamates two cutting-edge neural
    network architectures: the GRU and the Transformer. This combination allows for
    an effective capture of long-term dependencies and intricate spatial features
    within time-series data. The GRU component of the model is particularly adept
    at processing time-series data [4], proving especially potent in comprehending
    and predicting the dynamically evolving nature of soil water content. Meanwhile,
    the Transformer branch, through its self-attention mechanism [35], excels in deciphering
    complex interrelationships between different data points, thereby substantially
    elevating the model’s prediction accuracy. In contrast to conventional machine
    learning models like SVR and GBDT, deep learning models demonstrate a heightened
    ability to manage highly nonlinear and multi-dimensional data. This study reveals
    that deep learning models, such as CNNs and LSTM networks, generally outperform
    traditional machine learning approaches, highlighting deep learning’s prowess
    in capturing intricate data patterns and relationships [27]. However, the GRU–Transformer
    model elevates this capability to a higher echelon by synergizing the strengths
    of both GRU and Transformer architectures. By integrating these two powerful neural
    network structures, their individual advantages are mutually amplified [33]. This
    synergistic fusion not only allows the GRU–Transformer model to surpass the accuracy
    of individual deep learning models but also to outshine traditional machine learning
    methods. This enhancement is pivotal in the context of environmental data processing,
    where the complexity and variability of data demand sophisticated analytical approaches.
    The GRU–Transformer model, with its dual-architecture advantage, thus stands as
    a significant advancement in the field, pushing the boundaries of what can be
    achieved in soil water content prediction and environmental data analysis. 3.4.
    Limitations and Further Study We advocate the utilization of deep learning methodologies
    for the intricate processing of meteorological and soil data, with the aim of
    achieving precise predictions of soil moisture at various depths. This approach
    effectively harnesses the strengths of the two models to enhance predictive outcomes.
    Nevertheless, this study is not devoid of limitations, which present opportunities
    for refinement in future endeavors. A primary shortcoming is the relatively limited
    dataset size, encompassing merely eight consecutive years of data from eight locations.
    This constraint poses a potential risk of overfitting, potentially impairing the
    model’s generalization capabilities. Additionally, this study did not incorporate
    factors such as the growth stages of maize or other agricultural management practices,
    including irrigation and fertilization, all of which can significantly influence
    soil moisture dynamics. In light of these limitations, future research directions
    will focus on expansion and optimization in several key areas. (1) Enlarging the
    dataset: Future studies will aim to broaden the dataset’s scope, encompassing
    data from diverse regions, encompassing different years and maize varieties. This
    expansion will provide a more comprehensive and varied dataset, enhancing the
    robustness and applicability of the model. (2) Incorporating additional variables:
    The inclusion of variables such as the maize’s growth stage, various agricultural
    management practices, and soil types will be a focal point. These additions will
    offer a more holistic view of the factors impacting soil moisture, thus enriching
    the model’s predictive accuracy. (3) Model optimization: We plan to refine the
    structure and parameters of the model further. This will involve exploring various
    combination methods and fusion strategies, with an emphasis on enhancing the model’s
    efficiency and stability. Through these enhancements, we aim to not only address
    the current study’s limitations but also significantly advance the field of soil
    moisture prediction using deep learning techniques, ultimately contributing to
    more effective and informed agricultural management. Given its demonstrated accuracy
    and versatility, the GRU–Transformer model holds potential for application in
    a range of environmental contexts, including the prediction of flash droughts,
    thereby contributing valuable insights for proactive disaster management and environmental
    preservation. 4. Conclusions This research introduces a novel hybrid modeling
    approach that synergizes GRU and Transformer architectures, aiming to predict
    soil moisture content at varying depths, specifically within the maize root zone.
    Utilizing meteorological and soil moisture data from eight maize cultivation sites
    in Hebei Province, China, spanning from 2011 to 2018, the study meticulously evaluates
    the model’s predictive performance across diverse input combinations and varying
    forecast durations. This evaluation also includes comparative analysis with conventional
    machine learning and other deep learning models. The findings of this study reveal
    distinct prediction efficacies under varying conditions. The results showed that
    (1) the GRU–Transformer model exhibited significant advantages under different
    prediction delay days and soil depth conditions. The model demonstrated the highest
    accuracy in the short-term prediction of 1 to 2 days, in which the mean MSE was
    5.22% and the lowest reached 2.71% in the prediction with a 1-day delay, while
    the mean R2 was as high as 89.92%. The prediction accuracy decreased as the number
    of days of delay in prediction increased, but the overall performance remained
    stable. In addition, in the comparison of different soil depths, the model showed
    higher accuracy in predicting the water content of deeper soil layers, which was
    much better than the performance of shallow soil prediction. The methodology and
    experimental design adopted in the study fully considered the adaptability and
    robustness of the model under different environmental conditions. (2) By comparing
    the model performance under different combinations of input parameters, we found
    that the prediction error of the model rises with the decrease in parameters;
    however, even under the combination of only soil water content parameters, the
    model predicts the third day in the future with an average MSE of 0.59% and an
    average R2 of 98.86%, which reflects the high tolerance of the model to different
    combinations of parameters. (3) In comparative analysis, the GRU–Transformer model
    substantially outperformed a range of typical machine learning models (such as
    SVR, KNN, GBDT, XGBoost, and Random Forest) and deep learning models (including
    DNN, CNN, independent GRU, and Transformer branches). This superiority affirms
    the model’s exceptional capability in handling complex soil moisture data. Conclusively,
    this study presents a potent decision-support tool for agricultural irrigation
    management, contributing significantly to enhancing the efficiency and conservation
    of agricultural water resources. The GRU–Transformer model, with its robust predictive
    accuracy and adaptability, offers valuable insights for the sustainable development
    of agriculture, addressing critical needs in environmental data processing and
    agricultural resource management. Author Contributions Methodology, W.Z., J.Y.

    approach where a detailed script is provided, the proposed approach specifies
    the desired outcome and orchestrates information and control flows, using the
    behavior model of the CIoT system. The orchestration is executed based on progressive
    data acquisition and representation, and schedules the operations for the CIoT
    systems and solutions progressively.'

    View correction statement: Corrigendum 1. Introduction The rapid adoption of Internet
    of Things (IoT) together with unprecedented bandwidths and computational power
    in instrumentation devices have already produced ground-breaking real-time or
    near real-time visibility and analysis across a broad spectrum of system environments
    (Atzori, Iera, and Morabito 2010; Chang 2017a; Granados et al. 2014; Gubbi et
    al. 2013; Karagiannis et al. 2015; Riggins and Wamba 2015; Shang et al. 2016).
    These capabilities enable instant access and transfer of information about a system
    or device in both natural and engineered systems as well as in consumer and industrial
    environemnts (Zhou and Chao 2011; Welbourne et al. 2009; Zhai et al. 2017). A
    few examples include: personal environment (wearable devices and smart phones),
    surrounding environment (bodycam), home environment (home security devices, appliances)
    power grid (eMeters, Power Management Units (PMUs), other sensor and actuator
    in the power distribution systems) traffic and transportation (traffic sensors
    on cars, busses, trains, roads, traffic lights, railroads, aerial/Unmanned Aerial
    Vehicles (UAVs), and congestion control devices) structural health monitoring
    (bridges, buildings, vehicles, aerial platforms) water systems (distribution grids,
    asset management and preventive maintenance; ambient environments) oil & gas (intelligent
    oil field) Interconnecting these distinct natural, engineered, people, and business
    worlds (as shown in Figure 1) through ubiquitous instrumentation, even though
    still in its embryonic stage, has the potential to create an environment that
    can be greener, safer, more efficient, and more comfortable. However, just a compedium
    and deluge of instrumentation data is insufficient in achieving the ultimate objectives
    of a much better outcome for the system of interest and its environment (Li 2005).
    Cognitive representations (a.k.a. models) of these distinct natural, engineered,
    people, and business worlds are essential in understanding the complexity of these
    systems-of-systems, predicting their trajectory and controlling their actual evolution.
    Furthermore, cognitive representation for our emerging service and analytics can
    create accurate decision support capabilities when maneuvering through uncertain
    environments whose conditions are not known a priori. IoT combined with modeling
    is referred to as Cognitive IoT (CIoT) (Wu et al. 2014; Zaidi et al. 2014). Figure
    1. CIoT solutions will require interconnected and interdependent models representing
    the natural and engineered (physical) environment, business & IT, and individuals
    & communities. Display full size Rich multi-fidelity and multimodal modeling and
    instrumentation have become keys for enabling the above referenced capabiltiues
    for physical world systems (natural, engineered) and human systems. Beyond present
    notions of CIoT (Wu et al. 2014; Zaidi et al. 2014), new capabilties derived through
    Dynamic Data Driven Applications Systems (DDDAS)-based methods, whereby modeling
    is dynamically and synergistically integrated with instrumentation in a feedback
    control loop, are emerging (Darema 2000, 2005c; Allaire et al. 2014; Bazilevs
    et al. 2012; Celik et al. 2010). The trend towards higher fidelity and (semi-)autonomy
    with humans in the loop is accelerating. Related methods and opportunities include
    fusing multiple world models can be used to extract insights and capturing dynamic
    intelligent interactions in order to augment and enrich these in a CIoT environment
    as the connectivity and bandwidth could be severely challenged at times. This
    framework is validated through use cases such as load redistribution and disaster
    recovery for smart grid and structural health monitoring for intelligent aerial
    platforms (as for example discussed in Darema 2000, 2005; Allaire et al. 2014;
    Bazilevs et al. 2012, 2012; Celik et al. 2010). interdependent world models. In
    addition, resilient IT infrastructures are essential for supporting the CIoT capabilities
    discussed above. In this paper, we present a distributed framework for orchestrating
    both information and control flows within the instrumented environment based on
    interconnected cognitive models of these environments in order to achieve optimal
    outcome. The primary contribution of this paper is the proposed outcome-driven
    orchestration framework for complex CIoT systems and solutions. In contrast to
    the traditional orchestration approach where a detailed script is provided, the
    proposed approach specifies the desired outcome and orchestrates the information
    and control flows, using the behavior model of the CIoT system. The behavior model
    is incrementally refined based on the continuous learning on the actual outcome
    with respect to the desired outcome. Furthermore, the orchestration is executed
    based on progressive data representation and operations using a distributed model,
    which is essential The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes
    the overall architecture for a cognitive IoT solution. A comprehensive landscape
    of cognitive models is described in Section 3. Section 4 discussed a number of
    use cases to illustrate the orchestration framework. The system and system software
    implications for designing a distributed orchestration framework are discussed
    in Section 5. Section 6 outlines the outcome-based distributed orchestration framework.
    A summary and potential future work is given in Section 7. 2. Cognitive IoT solution
    architecture A Cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT) solution is a system with feedback
    control loop (or system of systems, since each individual component within this
    system could be a system by itself). Figure 2 shows the system view of such a
    closed-loop CIoT solution: Modeling & Orchestration Platform Data & Measurement
    Platform Control Platform Figure 2. Interconnected platforms provide data dynamic
    capture & integration into models, orchestration of behavioral models, and control
    for closed-loop prediction & response. Display full size A CIoT solution inlcudes
    the real world itself – whether it is a smart grid, a smart building, a smart
    supply chain, or a smart water system. The data and measurement platform provides
    mechanisms to capture, comprehend, and learn from the real world (of varying levels
    of fidelity) to form the observed world. The observed world can be described by
    a set of world models. Within the modeling and orchestration platform, cognitive
    representations (or models) integrating data captured from the instrumented real
    world enable interpolation or extrapolation to those areas of the phase-space
    1 of the system, where there are no modeling data or where the instrumentation
    data could be noisy, unavailable, or corrupted. And in other cases, these models
    allow generation of the most plausible hypotheses to explain the available information
    through deduction, induction, or abduction reasoning. From these models, the possible
    outcomes are generated through simulation and/or predictive analysis. Based on
    the what-if analysis conducted by the models, a course of actions is then chosen
    to optimize the potential outcome. This decision is then implemented through the
    control platform to actuate the real world. The consequence in the real world,
    or the outcome, will be monitored through the data and measurement platform, and
    may result in more targeted data acquisition for more intelligent probing of the
    observed world, as well as adjustment on the course of actions. This cognitive
    IoT solution in reality is an instance of the closed-loop control system and is
    similar to the MAPE 2 loop of an autonomic system, with the exception that the
    role, influence and effects from human (individually or as a community) need to
    be included in the system. A CIoT solution requires optimal or near optimal orchestration
    of the control flow and information flow. (The music notes of the orchestration
    really came from the behavior models, which dynamically integrate real-world information,
    conduct what-if analysis, and choose the course of actions that is likely to optimize
    the business outcome). Consequently, developing models at the behavior levels,
    is necessary in order to enable optimal orchestration of both information and
    control flows (Bates, 1995). The behavioral models are continuously updated by
    the dynamic data inputs, either to speed-up the execution (through substituting
    parts of the computation in the model with the actual data) or to impart additional
    information into the model, (as it is quite often that the model does not accurately
    or fully captures the system). The output of the behavior model controls the instrumentation
    in order to either refine data acquisition to improve the model accuracy or actuates
    the controllers to effect an action (on the system or by the system) guided by
    a comprehensive model of the system. This category of systems was referred to
    as the Dynamic Data-Driven Application Systems (DDDAS), which are based on the
    Infosymbiotics 3 paradigm (Darema 2000, 2005c, 2006, 2010). The kinds of models
    of interest span numeric and non-numeric, agent- based and graph models, as well
    as statistical models. Examples will be given in the next section. 3. Models Cognitive
    representation (a.k.a. models) of the real world is the glue among data and measurement
    platform, modeling and orchestration platform, and the control platform. There
    are multiple abstraction levels of models of the real world. The most abstract
    level is at the conceptual (theory or functional) level. Conceptual level models
    can be represented in the form of ontology, rules, or knowledge graph. Additional
    details are available at the structural level, which often captures the topological
    or spatial characteristics of the real world. Behavioral level models, which often
    describes the temporal or spatiotemporal evolution of a system, capture the most
    comprehensive aspects of the real world. Multiple levels of fidelity may be used
    in describing the system at hand at both the structural and the behavioral level.
    The evolution of the abstraction levels of the model typically starts at the conceptual
    and/or functional levels. The evolution from conceptual/functional models to behavior
    models in almost every domain in the past has improved outcomes (e.g. in business)
    while maintaining manageable complexity and uncertainty, as shown in Figure 3.
    Figure 3. Examples of multiple abstraction levels of models of the world. Display
    full size During the development of Boeing 777, a dynamic behavior model of the
    aircraft was developed in addition to the traditional functional specification
    (at the function level) and 3D mechanical drawing (at the structural level). The
    dynamic behavior of the aircraft was evaluated within a simulation environment
    rather than going through numerous wind-tunnel testing (Abarbanel and McNeely
    1996). In a later section, we discuss new and more powerful methods (DDDAS-based)
    that not only allow optimal design of aircraft, but also use new modeling methods
    to enable optimized operational capabilities under dynamic conditions. Additional
    examples include the development of the IBM z10 chip. The z10 development effort
    started with the functional specifications and the design of the instruction set
    architecture (ISA) – both at the functional level. Based on the functional specification,
    the VHDL specification (VHSIC Hardware Description Language) for the overall design
    was created. The circuit layout, which is a structural representation of the z10
    chip, is then synthesized from the VHDL specification. Alternative structural
    representation, in the form of circuit schematic and netlist, is also synthesized
    from the VHDL specification. These VHDL and netlist representations of the z10
    chip enable both logical and analog behavior of the z10 chip to be fully simulated
    within the simulation environment. The ability of fully capturing the IBM z10
    system at the behavior level enabled the system to be entirely operational on
    the first tape-out of the chip (Krygowski et al. 2009). Similarly, the enterprise
    supply chain can be specified at the functional (supply chain scope), structural
    (supply chain configuration), and behavioral (process elements and performance
    attributes) levels. The ability to perform process design and optimization of
    a supply chain at the behavior levels saves multi-billion dollars annually for
    some of the enterprises (Min and Zhou 2002; Celik et al. 2010). In general, the
    entire CIoT spectrum really includes natural and engineered worlds, business and
    IT worlds, and the human worlds, and can be further divided into at least six
    domains: natural and engineered (compute intensive), embedded (SCADA related),
    cyber, enterprise, community, and individuals. During the past few decades, cognitive
    models in each of these silos are evolving from functional to structural and now
    to behavioral level. In the foreseeable future, capturing and modeling the CIoT
    will happen at multiple levels of abstraction, multiple levels of fidelity, and
    from multiple vantage points. In the enterprise domain, CBM (component business
    model) (Chesbrough 2010) and industry framework captures the functional aspect
    of a business. Industry models (including data models, ontology models, knowledge
    graph models, process models, and service models) capture the structural levels
    of the business. Customer and workforce logistics and the enterprise risk models
    capture the behavioral levels of the business. In the cyber area, ITIL (Cannon
    2011) can be viewed as belonging to the functional level while IT configuration
    model belong to the structural level and workload and network traffic belong to
    the behavior level. In human communities, social networks (including Google+,
    LinkedIn and Facebook) capture the structural level of human relationships. Many
    of them evolve into capturing social or community behavior in real time during
    the recent past. From the individual (personal) side, individual profile belongs
    to the functional level while the purchase history belongs to the behavior level.
    The embedded systems domain includes examples such as instrumentation in the electric
    grid, transportation, dam, traffic lights, and manufacturing, where Supervisory
    Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems (Boyer 2009) are often deployed.
    This area is transforming itself at an extremely fast pace as increasingly more
    of such systems are connected to each other as well as to the internet, and through
    DDDAS-based models. This is also supporting a similar concept from Cheng et al.
    ( 2016) to allow intelligent manufacturing enabled by IoT (Zaslavsky, Perera and
    Georgakopoulos 2013). New insight is established when analyzing the existing and
    future CIoT solutions in the context of an end-to-end ecosystem as opposed to
    a single domain, as shown in Figure 4. Many of the existing CIoT solutions fall
    into the category of single domain, and leveraging only structural models for
    static analysis. Emerging opportunities – whether they are in the smart grid (power
    grid) or smart cities – often require integrating behavior models from two or
    more interdependent domains. New capabilities have been continuously demonstrated
    along these directions (to be shown in the next section), and are likely ready
    for industry deployment during the next 2–5 years. Figure 4. Future CIoT solutions
    will require interconnected and orchestrated measurements and models across multiple
    domains. Display full size 4. Case studies In this section, we will use a number
    of examples such as the smart grid and smart structures to illustrate the behavior-model-based
    orchestration in DDDAS-based CIoT solutions. The examples included here are only
    a subset of the capabilities that have been demonstrated in the recent past. 4.1.
    Energy related applications In a smart grid solution, intelligent utility networks
    (IUN) provide capabilities for real-time prediction of the onset of brown-outs
    or black-outs, and also provide optimized dynamic load management (as shown in
    Figure 5). The real-time instrumentation capability, often referred to as automatic
    meter reading (AMR) or automatic meter infrastructure (AMI), is based on measurements
    made by voltage amplitude phasor measurement unit (PMU) and other IoT sensors
    dynamically integrated with statistical and agent-based models (McCalley et al.
    2007; Hoffman et al. 2007) . Dynamic load management within a Smart Grid solution
    activates mitigating actions prior to the onset of a brown-out or black-out to
    ensure differentiated support for critical and high-priority customers from multiple
    energy-sources, including renewables – such as wind, solar, and hydro, and energy
    storage which acts as a generation source (Celik, Thanos and Saenz 2013, Shi,
    Damgacioglu and Celik 2015). This is the improvement based on enterprise storage
    solution from Chen, Huang, and Huang ( 2016). Figure 5. Smart grid solutions continuously
    optimize the expected outcome dynamic data driven behavior models. Display full
    size Other scenarios include incorporating weather data and weather prediction
    models in dynamic data driven behavior models of the power-grid to provide continual
    optimization of load redistribution during peak demand period (such as during
    summer) or restoration of the grid infrastructure after a weather induced failure
    (integrated outage management). Emerging scenarios for supporting electric vehicles
    already present a new demand class and potentially a generation source (through
    the use of the batteries of these vehicles). Furthermore, demand-response management
    can mitigate demand during peak hours through incentives such as dynamic pricing
    plan. With such capabilities, the utility companies will be able to provide much
    better assurance of the business outcome for their customers. The bottom line
    is to leverage the real-time visibility (instrumentation) and use DDDAS-based
    methods in order to build real-time behavioral models so that the business can
    optimize the expected outcome continuously. Other Smart Grid related areas such
    as wind farms pose new challenges and require new CIoT capabilities (Korobenko
    et al. 2013). These CIoT capabilities enable optimized operation to mitigate effects
    of the wake across stacked turbines (Perez et al. 2015). They can also reduce
    the wear and tear of turbine rotors and provide an adaptive maintenance schedule
    rather than conducting maintenance on all turbines on the same regular schedule
    (Ding et al. 2007). This has a similar concept to Wang and Wang ( 2017), which
    has Cloud-based production system with the fusion with IoT. Together with the
    fusion model, it blends Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment to maximize
    outputs. Accurate high resolution weather forecasts are central to predicting
    potential storm severity and its path. IBM Research’s Deep Thunder (Gallagher
    2012) can provide high resolution forecasts for a 48-hour horizon for areas (in
    a given county) that are most likely to have outage events (and quantify the uncertainty
    level for the event to occur). Other examples are cited in Section 4.4 below,
    while additional capabilities for adverse weather prediction are discussed in
    Section 4.3. The ability to estimate the likelihood and severity of damage in
    different regions allows for predictive planning in stationing crews for early
    repairs. Such predictions can provide a basis for planning the deployment of repair
    crews and trucks in an anticipatory mode. Optimizing work orders and repair crews
    scheduling enables maximizing the business outcome in terms of the number of customers
    that are brought back online at the earliest possible opportunity. In addition,
    such capabilities allow optimized emergency response for any ensuing harm and
    damage to humans, buildings, and other infrastructure. 4.2. Structural health
    monitoring, energy efficiencies, and decision support Aerial platforms (both civilian
    and military, human-operated and UAVs, aerial and space-based) during flight are
    subject to dynamic stresses accentuated by turbulence-induced forces. Such stresses
    as well as the aging of materials can result in structural damage, manifested
    as cracks, disbonding, delamination, or waviness. All these conditions can cause
    disastrous results (such as airplane crashing, as indeed happened in the past,
    in a case of aileron detachment). Additional sensor malfunction situations (such
    as pitot-tubes freezing) also result in catastrophic failures. DDDAS-based modeling
    have shown advanced capabilities: (1) detection of the onset of damage (crack
    creation) (Prudencio et al. 2013; Bazilevs et al. 2012), (2) predicting the propagation
    of the damage and potential impact (Allaire et al. 2014), (3) application of component-
    or system-level models for time dependent control through coordination of multiple
    actuators to mitigate the propagation of the damage (Bazilevs et al. 2012), (4)
    wing-level and aerial structure-wide structural health assessment, (5) multi-fidelity
    models dynamically driven by multiple levels of sensors (e.g. piezoelectric, optical,
    IR, ultrasonic) to assess platform health conditions in real-time (Bazilevs et
    al. 2012; Allaire et al. 2014), and (6) cognizant of environment (such as winds
    and wind-induced turbulence) to plan or re-plan in real-time to optimize the flight
    path and necessary maneuver to fulfill the mission. Such a decision support system
    leverages the accuracy of full-scale models during the optimization (Allaire et
    al. 2014). It was demonstrated in (Wei, Blake and Madey 2013; Varela 2014) that
    DDDAS-based methods enable detection and compensation for sensor failures; in
    this case, the output from a continually executing model of flight conditions
    is compared against the actual measurements from the pitot sensor. The model can
    take over in case of abrupt discrepancy with the measurement to allow time to
    readjust and switch over to other sensor modalities. 4.3. Atmospheric contaminant
    dispersion monitoring Adverse atmospheric contaminant conditions, either naturally
    induced such as volcanic eruptions or man-made harmful chemical emissions (accidental,
    or intentional – such as in terrorist attacks), can have significantly disruptive
    effects. The impact of such events is further exacerbated due to the lack of comprehensive
    models for accurately attributing the origin and predicting the subsequent dispersion
    pattern of the contaminant. The consequence includes severe limitation on the
    effectiveness of the mitigating actions for evacuating humans (and animals) from
    affected areas, plan for decontamination, and any other needed emergency response
    actions. As an example, the April 2010 Eyafjallajokull volcanic eruption caused
    a 7-day shutdown of much of northern Europe’s air transportation system and affected
    many millions of passengers with an estimated cost between 1.5 and 2.5 billion
    of euro (Seifert et al. 2011). The traditional volcanic ash transport models over-predicted
    the ash spread in some areas and missed other areas where ash was actually dispersed,
    resulting in engine damages for aircraft flew over those regions. DDDAS-based
    modeling (Patra et al. 2013; Stefanescu  2014), which also considered prevalent
    winds and dynamic incorporation of targeted satellite data (in this case used
    in a play-back fashion, as the referenced scientific work happened sometime after
    the actual event), showed improved accuracy in predicting the volcanic ash dispersion.
    The DDDAS-based modeling also demonstrated that ash presence in certain regions
    was missed due to misinterpretation of satellite images as it was difficult to
    distinguish between the reflections from ash particles and those from water vapor.
    Other DDDAS-based work (Peng, Silic, and Mohseni 2015; Peng and Mohseni 2016)
    also provides improved contaminant plume tracking in an urban environment (the
    Manhattan cityscape) under air turbulence conditions from prevalent terrain-induced
    winds. DDDAS-based methods were used to control where to send aerial mobile sensors,
    to regions of high-value data sampling (for example higher concentration of contaminant),
    while measuring winds and turbulence at the same time. Similar work on pollution
    transport was conducted by (Akcelik et al. 2004, 2006) in open environments, and
    by (Carmichael et al. 2003; Wang et al. 2014) on atmospheric pollution over the
    Pacific Ocean. 4.4. Adverse atmospheric weather and space weather Adverse weather
    such as tornadic activity affects safety of humans and property. In the United
    States, tornadoes cause multimillion dollar damage and loss of human lives each
    year. As an example, US Storm Prediction Center (SPC) reported a total of 1285
    tornado events during 2015 with 36 fatalities. Accurate and timely prediction
    of the onset of tornadic activity and of the path and extent of the tornado is
    of paramount importance to mitigate danger to human and animal lives as well as
    to improve preparedness and effective emergency response after tornadic events.
    Traditional modeling methods have now been replaced with DDDAS-based modeling
    and instrumentation methods (Brotzge et al. 2004; Plale et al. 2005). These new
    methods are able to predict tornadic activity indicators (such as the tornadic
    ‘hook’ which often forecasts the onset of tornado) with much improved accuracy
    (Chang 2017b). In the outer space, space-weather affects the drag on satellites
    and impacts the accuracy of GPS. However, accurate modeling of the interdependency
    among various space weather phenomena in the ionotroposphere layer is very difficult
    as some aspects of the physics of these phenomena are not fully and accurately
    modeled yet. Factors in understanding space-weather include the chemistry, the
    turbulence, and the thermal conductivity in the ionotroposphere. Among these three
    components, the thermal conductivity is most difficult to model accurately. DDDAS-based
    methods improved the model accuracy by leveraging the actual data to compensate
    for the model’s deficiency (Ali et al. 2015). This resulted in more accurate modeling
    of the thermal conductivity component in the ionotropospheric layer, as manifested
    by the more accurate prediction of NO (nitrous oxide), neutral density, photoelectron
    heating efficiency, and the eddy diffusion coefficient. 4.5. Software cybersecurity
    Opportunities for cyberattacks are increasing during the IoT era as wirelessly
    interconnected computing platforms and devices are proliferating. End-to-end encryption,
    due to its increased communication bandwidth and power consumption requirements,
    may be practically less applicable in some of the IoT environments. Randomization
    approaches such as instruction randomization, data randomization, and memory randomization
    also incur high overheads. DDDAS-based methods minimize the overhead by conducting
    the randomization adaptively at the application programming and execution environments
    levels. Through continuous monitoring and detection of increased vulnerability,
    randomized variations of sections or components of the software are created –
    including changing the programming language, changing the OS and middleware services,
    and changing the hardware resources. It was shown in (Hariri et al. 2015) that
    4-way randomization guarantees zero probability of successful attack even for
    components with high probability (90% in the test case) of attack. 4.6. Intelligent
    oil field The petroleum industry has consistently driven the adoption of advanced
    modeling and instrumentation methods to optimize both upstream (oil/gas exploration)
    and downstream (oil/gas extraction) operations. To develop comprehensive oil/gas
    reservoir models, it is often required to interpolate low spatial resolution (but
    wide spatial coverage) seismic/sonic measurements with high resolution (but small
    spatial coverage) electrical conductivity (FMI) and radiation (gamma-ray, neutron,
    and proton) measurements and related models. Starting in early 2000s, DDDAS-based
    methods are used to enhance the modeling and instrumentation approaches discussed
    earlier to achieve improved efficiency in oil/gas discovery and recovery (Parashar
    et al. 2005, 2006). Similar approaches have also been pursued for intelligent
    fracking methods for exploration and recovery of oil & gas. 4.7. Public health
    surveillance Syndromic surveillance using inpatient and ambulatory clinical care
    electronic health record (EHR) data as well as other non-traditional data sources
    is a relatively new practice in public health (Richardson et al. 2004). As an
    example, the Epi-SPIRE system (Li 2005) monitored the behavioral changes of a
    population (IBM T. J. Watson Research Center, which consists two sites during
    2003 – Yorktown and Hawthorne, located in the Westchester County, New York) caused
    by the earliest stages of flu outbreak. Examples of such behavior changes include
    Increased number of people reporting (on a daily basis) that they are not feeling
    well among 400 volunteers increased absenteeism captured in the badge data for
    employee reporting to work, increased inquiries for medical information captured
    by the firewall web log, increased phone calls to make doctor appointments captured
    by the phone log, changes in eating/drinking habits captured by the cafeteria
    transaction data, increased coughing sound captured by the seminar recordings,
    increased traffic for leaving the building early captured by the video surveillance,
    and increased sewage generation as monitored by the facility. The alerts generated
    from these data sources are compared to the insurance claims (as ground truth)
    from the Westchester County. It was demonstrated that the early warnings generated
    by some of the data sources (survey and phone in particular) provides leading
    indicators (up to three days) as compared to those derived from the clinical data
    sources, in a statistical significant way. 5. System implications for fog computing
    deployment CIoT solutions often pose dynamic requirements for processing and analyzing
    data from sensors, derive decisions, and apply control through actuators. Figure
    6 shows the value (potential business outcome) of the data for a CIoT solution
    as a function of time. The value of data is highest when real-time or near real-time
    decisions and proactive responses are possible. When multiple data sources are
    used as dynamic inputs into the behavior models, the value could be even higher
    as additional data can help to make the model more accurate, speed-up the model,
    reduce the uncertainty and contribute to improved accuracy for predicting future
    condition and evolution of the system. The value of these data may monotonically
    decline after the initial interval such as for example in the cases where data
    are mostly used for metering, billing, auditing, and long term trend analysis.
    Many applications do leverage ‘historical’/archival data in conjunction with those
    data acquired in real-time. As a result, system architectures optimized for CIoT
    solutions need to accommodate latency requirements and prioritize computation
    and communication resources in order to maximize the value that can be derived
    from the sensor data as well as the long term archival requirements to facilitate
    long term trend analysis (Gazis et al. 2012). Figure 6. Providing aggregation,
    cleansing and fusion of sensor data closer to the data sources facilitates early
    response to critical events. Display full size Figure 7 shows the requirements
    coming from CIoT solutions in terms of throughput and latency. Video surveillance
    is at the forefront of these requirements in terms of throughput (3.2–26GB/day/stream).
    SCADA systems and health monitoring systems have very stringent latency requirements
    (on the order of microseconds to milliseconds). High throughput and/or low latency
    requirements often mandate moving some cognitive capabilities (e.g. some of the
    computation) to the edge (the sensors or controllers, or collections thereof)
    of the CIoT solution even though the primary analytic functions are still carried
    out in more powerful platforms, such as computing- and data-center(s), or other
    local or remote mid-range platforms. This trend suggests that deployment of CIoT
    solutions in traditional cloud (centralized) models is no longer adequate and
    necessitates the use of the nacent fog (or ‘edge’) computing models (Rui and Danpeng
    2015; Akhbar and Ovatman 2015). Figure 7. Latency and throughput requirements
    often drive the need for pushing intelligence to the edge. Display full size Fog
    computing (Bonomi et al. 2012; Babaoglu, Marzolla and Tamburini 2012; Ubeda Garcia
    et al. 2014) is an architecture that uses end-user clients or near-user edge of
    the network devices to carry out a substantial amount of storage, communication,
    control, configuration, measurement and management. Additional literature on fog
    computing addresses challenges to support such objectives (Cisco Fog Computing
    2015; Zaidi et al. 2014; Stojmenovic and Wen 2014; Cheng and Dang 2014). Compared
    to the initial notions of cloud computing, fog computing emphasizes proximity
    to end-users and client objectives, dense geographical distribution and local
    resource pooling, latency reduction for quality of service (QoS) and edge analytics/stream
    mining. Fog computing seeks to provide superior user experience and overall system
    redundancy in case of failure. It emphasizes the notions of information processing
    to generate the knowledge nearer the entity that needs it, regardless whether
    the entity is a human or an engineered device (or collections thereof). A CIoT
    solution, when either latency or throughput is critical (as indicated in the upper
    left, upper right, and lower right quadrants of Figure 7), could substantially
    benefit from exploiting fog computing concepts. It should be noted however that
    while the term fog computing concept was introduced in 2012, the concepts of distributed
    computing and distributed resource management – across a range of platforms, including
    computing at the edges (e.g. mobile devices, personal portable devices, sensors,
    etc) were ideas articulated many years before that (Darema 1998, 2005a, 2005b),
    and will be discussed more in the next section. Also, to note that in the mid-
    to late-90s, Grid computing concepts (Foster and Kesselma 1999) provided the impetus
    for moving from client-server computing to more general distributed computing
    (or metacomputing – a term coined in 1987 by Larry Smarr [Smarr 1987]). Grid computing
    emphasized the coordination of multiple distributed computation, storage and communication
    resources. It has successfully demonstrated interoperability across multiple computational
    platforms used to support the runtime of a given application, as well as multiple
    applications executing concurrently. It should also be noted that the notion of
    virtualization, emphasized in cloud computing, was never precluded in the Grid
    concept. And, cloud computing has evolved over the years from a homogeneous centralized
    services concept to a more (geographically and otherwise) distributed and heterogeneous
    collections of platforms, with concomitant challenges of interoperability as were
    present in Grid computing. It is likely that Fog computing (or edge computing)
    may also evolve towards a hybrid and heterogeneous environment similar to cloud
    computing. In summary, the fusion of the fog computing based deployment of the
    CIoT systems and solutions is likely to be heavily dependent on the latency and
    bandwidth requirement of the systems and solutions, and most likely be a hybrid
    and heterogeneous environment. Those system components (data acquisition, comprehension,
    and control actuation) residing outside of the lower left quadrants of Figure
    7 will likely leverage the low latency and high bandwidth offered by the fog computing.
    Those system components require the access of large amount of historical data
    and large amount of computation power (model construction, training and planning)
    is likely to stay in the cloud computing center, resulting a heterogeneous and
    hybrid environment. 5.1. Systems software and cyber infrastructure: support and
    tools There is a rapid convergence between the computational and instrumentation
    platforms for various CIoT solutions. Such integrated platforms are necessary
    to support DDDAS environments (Darema 1998, 2000, 2005c, 2007), resulting in new
    systems software and cyberinfrastructure requirements, such as: Application programming
    models that support both high-end and real-time components of the application;
    Runtime support, which includes embedding the compiler into the runtime, allows
    mapping (and remapping) application components onto heterogeneous computing resources
    in optimized ways based on the architecture and capacity of the underlying computation,
    memory, communication and I/O resources. This support should span both high-end
    and the real-time environments, and be able to discover and match resources depending
    on the changing workload requirements of the executing application, such as in
    DDDAS-based application models. The software defined computing concept that originated
    from enabling simultaneous agility and optimal resource utilization in cloud computing
    could potentially play an increasingly important role for the runtime support.
    Software Defined Environments (Li et al. 2014), which include software defined
    networking, storage, and compute, decouple the control and management planes of
    these resources from the data planes so that they are no longer vertically integrated
    as in traditional compute, storage or switch systems and can be deployed anywhere
    within a computing environment. Application composition at runtime that supports
    dynamic selection of models based on (1) data streamed into the executing application,
    (2) application model interfaces, and (3) application knowledge based systems.
    Application data interfaces, which includes application-measurement interfaces
    and data models (Wang et al. 2010). Dynamic application execution support environments:
    System software is required to dynamically select application components and embody
    algorithms suitable for the specific solution approaches, cognizant of the varying
    underlying resources and application requirements. Dynamic computing and resource
    requirements: CIoT solutions require employing heterogeneous platform environments
    for data-collection, distributed high-performance simulations, and pre/post processing
    of data. Such environments require dynamic discovery of computational resources
    by system software to ensure fault tolerance and Quality of Service (QoS) in spite
    of changing workload conditions. 6. Outcome based distributed orchestration Outcome-based
    delivery model (Ng, Ding, and Yip 2013), in contrast to the input-based or output-based
    service delivery models, has generated substantial interests and adoption in multiple
    industries during the past decade, and is playing an increasingly important role
    in CIoT solutions. In a service delivery model, the producers consume the input
    to produce output and result in outcome for the consumer: Inputs: Include all
    of the resources (time and materials) used to produce and deliver the required
    output product or services. Examples of inputs include available full-time equivalents
    (FTEs), funds, time, equipment, raw materials, etc. Output: Include all of the
    products and services produced from the input. This could also involve business
    outputs, such as healthcare policy quote generation or enrollment processing,
    and IT outputs, such as test case creation and execution. Outcome: Measurable
    impacts delivered by providers of products or services that can be assessed objectively
    by services buyers. This could include business outcomes, such as improvement
    in the enrollment rate of a healthcare plan, or IT outcomes, such as reduced spending
    on quality assurance as a percentage of the IT budget. Ideally, full provenance
    should be established so that all required inputs can be traced through the outputs
    and the outcomes. Business models in terms of how to price the products or services
    rendered have evolved based on input, output, outcome, or combinations of the
    above: Input-based delivery model: The producer charges the consumers based on
    the time and materials (and margin) needed to produce the products or services.
    The consumer often needs to assume most of the risk for the potential variation
    of the product or services received. Output-based delivery model: The producer
    charges the consumer based on the output products or services rendered. In this
    case, the producer assumes some amount of the risk arising from the variation
    of time and materials needed to develop the product and services, while the consumer
    also assumes certain amount of risk arising from the variation of the consequence
    resulting from the product or services. Outcome-based delivery model: The consumer
    is charged based on the actual business outcome from the products or services
    received. The producer needs to assume most or the entire risk for producing the
    desired outcome at the consumer. There are multiple examples of such evolution.
    In the internet advertisement industry, there is a gradual evolution from pay
    per impression (prior to 2000), to pay per click (around 2000), to pay per action
    (around 2001), to revenue sharing (from 2001 onwards), and eventually to profit
    sharing (since 2010 in certain circumstances). In the healthcare industry, there
    is also a significant trend in recent years that the healthcare providers are
    being compensated from procedure based to patient health outcome based. Outcome
    based delivery model has been considered as the most promising delivery model
    to integrate CIoT solutions into various industries. Model-based orchestration
    in CIoT solutions enables these solutions to continuously deliver the desired
    outcome. The outcome-based concept can be illustrated using those case studies
    in Section 4: Smart Grid solution: the business outcome for CIoT-based smart grid
    solutions refers to the cost saving for the customers; reduced maintenance cost
    for the operators; reduced or eliminated brown-out and black-out events; or reduced
    mean time to restore after a major weather event. Intelligent oil field solution:
    the business outcome refers to the reduced maintenance cost; or improved oil production
    throughput due to reduced down time. Intelligent traffic system: the business
    outcome refers to the reduced congestion, injuries and deaths due to accidents,
    and improved traffic flow. Software cybersecurity: the business outcome refers
    to the reduced or eliminated cyber perimeter penetration or data loss events.
    Cognitive syndromic surveillance: the business outcome refers to the reduced mortality
    and healthcare cost due to various infectious diseases. Outcome-based orchestration
    of a CIoT solution shown in Figure 2 requires orchestrating information and control
    flows through interconnected platforms. The fundamental challenge for a scalable
    CIoT solution is to address the centralized nature of orchestration. An outcome-based
    distributed orchestration framework, as shown in Figure 8, is described in this
    section using outbreak risk prediction for Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS)
    (Glass et al. 2002) as an example. HPS is a potentially fatal respiratory disease
    caused by infection with a rodent-born hantavirus. First reported in 1993, the
    case fatality rate was 50%+ initially and has come down during recent years. The
    risk prediction model used the combination of remotely sensed data from satellite
    and elevation map on the ground to assess the likely population change of the
    rodents due to global vegetation change resulting from global climate change (e.g.
    El Niño followed by La Niña). Within this outcome-based framework, the orchestration
    is based on distributed observation, evaluation, and actuation of the real world.
    The key pillars that enable outcome-based orchestration are progressively represented
    data and models, as described in the following two subsections. Figure 8. Distributed
    outcome-based orchestration framework for CIoT solution using HPS outbreak risk
    prediction as an example. Display full size 6.1. Progressive data representations
    Progressive 4 data representation is critical to progressive data acquisition,
    progressive transmission, and distributed model orchestration. Progressive representations
    enable the underlying phenomenon to be represented at multiple levels of abstraction
    (raw data, features, concepts), and multiple levels of fidelities, with trade-offs
    exist between fidelity (or accuracy) and data volume at each level. Two orthogonal
    dimensions – fidelity and abstraction – exist for generating progressive data
    representations. Multi-resolution representations, such as those based on discrete
    wavelet transformation (DWT), can be used to provide rough approximations of information
    at low resolutions (low data volumes), with more detailed views at higher resolutions.
    Most of the existing multi-resolution representation usually starts with the data
    already captured at its full resolution with homogeneous spatial and temporal
    sampling. In this paper, we propose to generalize such representations to include
    non-uniform acquisition, as it may be quite useful to selectively acquire higher
    resolutions only in selected ‘areas of interest’. In contrast, multiple abstraction
    level representations relying on the fact that raw information can be processed
    into alternate formulations such as features and semantics that require lower
    data volumes at the expense of possible lower fidelity. For example, contours
    can be computed from a data array, allowing for very rapid identification of areas
    with low or high parameter values, but with a loss of accuracy. 6.2. Progressive
    models Progressive models are designed to enable real-time distributed orchestration
    of the models. Each instance of model executions in this distributed environment
    provides an estimate of the overall model predictions to be generated. In the
    case of data and measurement platforms, the distributed execution of the progressive
    models enables data acquisition density to be higher for regions of higher interests,
    and transmitted down sooner. Consequently, progressive model executions provide
    distributed prediction of optimal acquisition and transmission schedule within
    the data and measurement platforms. Progressive models usually involve the generation
    of coarse representations of the same model. Using the HPS risk prediction as
    an example (Glass et al. 2002), the linear regression model for predicting the
    risk of disease occurring at location (x,y) and time t is (1) where xi(x,y,t)
    is the reading from the ith remote sensing instrument at location (x,y) and time
    t. If |a1,a2| ≫ |a3, a4| then, a coarser representation of the model for R (x,y,t)
    will be (2) In general, the generation of progressively coarser representation
    of a model can be accomplished by analysing the relative contribution of each
    parameter to the overall model. This is similar to query planning issues in cost-based
    query optimization for object-relational databases. However, query planning usually
    rearrange the execution order so that operations achieving maximal filtering will
    be executed earlier. In contrast, outcome-based execution of progressive models
    will select operations that are most relevant to the final results (outcome) to
    be executed first. 6.3. Outcome-based orchestration Within the data and measurement
    platforms, the information will be progressively and proactively captured, processed
    and then transmitted to the modeling and orchestration platforms. The orchestration
    aims at achieving highest model prediction quality and business outcome by the
    modelling and orchestration platform at any given time, hence takes into account
    of the progressive data representation and model execution. This implies that
    the end results need to be superior at any time to all of the other possible data
    acquisition alternatives. The value of progressive data acquisition lies in the
    identification of interested regions through progressive model processing, which
    can be executed anywhere, including the data and measurement platforms or the
    control platforms. Distributed processing at the edge of the network is necessary
    since it provides real-time feedback and control of the instruments, which is
    infeasible from a remote datacenter due to potentially long round-trip delay and
    transmission-processing lag. Associated with the issue of prediction accuracy
    is the optimal balance of two-types of errors. The first type of errors is often
    referred to as ‘false alarms’ or ‘false positives’ when the low-risk areas are
    incorrectly identified as high-risk areas. The second type of errors is referred
    as ‘misses’ or ‘false negatives’ when the high-risk areas are identified as low-risk
    areas. In most cases, misses and false alarms cannot be simultaneously reduced
    (Daubie, Levecq, and Meskens 2002; Leonard, Graham, and Bonacum 2004; Chang 2014,
    2015). Depending on the application requirements, an optimal allocation of misses
    and false alarms may be derived from model predictions to generate a progressive
    acquisition schedule. The concept of progressive transmission may be formally
    defined as an optimization problem. Suppose u(t) is the utility function of the
    received data until time t. This utility function is a measure of the sum of the
    outbreak likelihood of received image regions until time t, with additional weighting
    factors taking into account population density, age distribution, environmental
    readiness, etc. Progressive transmission should order the regions in such a way
    that u(t) is maximized for any t. This implies small regions with the most contribution
    to the utility will be transmitted first. The intuition is that high-utility areas
    shall receive attention from decision functions as early as possible. Low-utility
    areas yield in the schedule because those areas may have less impact for the decision
    functions. In the simplest case with only one model parameter to acquire, a greedy
    scheme that orders the most valued to the least valued region generates the best
    schedule based upon the above criterion. While discussions thus far only involve
    simple examples of single parameter acquisition, multiple parameters and more
    than one models with shared parameters may be constantly monitored by the CIoT
    solution. For example, mosquito-born diseases in public health surveillance solutions
    are often characterized by environmental factors like temperature and moisture.
    Depending on particular species of mosquitoes, temperature and moisture thresholds
    may vary. A satellite may be given several approximate models that share some
    parameters. In such case, progressive data acquisition and transmission scheduling
    become a sophisticated multi-parametric optimization problem. A parameter with
    strong influence on model prediction precision may be shared by three models while
    another parameter with weak influence on prediction precision is shared by five
    models. Both parameters’ data acquisition compete for instruments, processing,
    storage, transmission capacity as well as other resources. However, their relative
    priority is not strict and is likely to vary depending on the acquired region.
    It should be noted that specific behavior models are often difficult to be generalized
    as they are often tightly coupled with the data specific analytic environment.
    More general levels of abstraction of data and models are addressed through DDDAS/Infosymbiotics
    paradigm which provides a clear methodology of the value of dynamic integration
    of models and data in a feedback control loop. 7. Conclusions The introduction
    of pervasive and ubiquitous instrumentation leads to unprecedented real-time visibility
    in many application areas such as the power grid, traffic, transportation, water,
    and oil & gas areas. Interconnecting and harnessing those distinct natural, engineered,
    people, and business worlds through ubiquitous instrumentation, even though still
    in its embryonic stage, is rapidly progressing and has started demonstrating the
    potential to engender capabilities for an environment that is greener, efficient,
    safer, and more comfortable (Vermesan, Friess and Friess 2011; Subashini and Kavitha
    2011; Ning et al. 2015; Muñoz et al. 2014). In this paper, we presented an outcome-based
    framework for orchestrating both information and control flows within CIoT systems
    and solutions based on interconnected cognitive models of these environments.
    In contrast to the traditional prescriptive orchestration approach where a detailed
    script is provided, the proposed approach specifies the desired outcome and orchestrates
    information and control flows, using the behavior model of the CIoT system. The
    orchestration is executed based on progressive data (dynamic data) acquisition
    and representation, and schedules the operations for the CIoT systems and solutions
    progressively using a distributed model. This framework is validated through use
    cases such as load shedding and disaster recovery for smart grid, structural health
    monitoring for intelligent aerial platforms, public health surveillance, and cybersecurity.
    It has become increasingly crucial that cognitive representations of these distinct
    worlds (a.k.a. models, dynamically integrated with instrumentation, such as in
    DDDAS-based methods) need to be created as a pre-requisite for assessing and intelligently
    managing the complexity, maneuvering through uncertain environments and eventually
    achieving the optimized outcomes (Rao and Sandu 2014). We expect the proposed
    outcome-based framework will contribute to the development of emerging services
    and analytics for Cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT) based solutions, as well
    as serving as the foundation for enterprises using outcome-based business models
    for their products and services. The primary challenges in the next few years
    are likely to closely track the progress made in the cognitive computing area
    in terms of encoding domain specific knowledge in specific knowledge representations,
    automatic knowledge-based construction (AKBC), integrating knowledge driven and
    data driven approaches together on common behavior level models. Most importantly,
    the focus is likely to be centered on the linkage between the business outcome
    and the outcome accomplished by the CIoT systems and solutions. Acknowledgement

    1.1. Background of studies Over the previous several decades, global warming has
    been worse. Unfavorable conditions for farming are becoming more prevalent and
    worse due to global warming [1]. Empirical evidence shows that climate change
    significantly harms agricultural productivity [2]. Hunger and malnutrition may
    be increased by stresses on food production, such as expanding disaster zones
    and declining food output. As a result, many nations are having more open discussions
    about these problems than ever before [3]. Improving Irrigation Systems [4], developing
    a \"climate-smart food system\" [5], and farmer education on how to adapt to climate
    change are just a few examples of the strategies that researchers argue for different
    countries to discover swiftly to mitigate climate change''s detrimental impacts.
    Humanity faces a significant threat from climate change and its repercussions
    in the 21st century. It is a global phenomenon that devastates ecosystems, economies,
    and societies everywhere, especially in the world''s poorest regions [6]. Regarding
    agriculture, Pakistan is one of the countries most in danger due to climate change
    [7]. Pakistan''s agricultural sector contributes over 20 % to GDP, whereas 40
    % of the population is employed in manufacturing. Pakistan grows more maize than
    any other grain crop, second only to wheat. However, the effects of climate change
    on Pakistan''s maize output are uncertain [8]. Water shortage during the growth
    phase may be caused by several variables, including changes in precipitation patterns
    (both geographically and temporally) and direct implications on the agricultural
    water process [9]. The quantity of water lost through evaporation and transpiration
    exhibits a significant degree of sensitivity to alterations in temperature [10].
    Temperature increases that persist throughout the growing season have been shown
    to affect agricultural yields [11]. On the other hand, research shows that short
    periods of increased temperature during critical growth phases might increase
    infertility and decrease agricultural yields [12]. Different earlier studies have
    examined the degree of clarity surrounding the impacts of climate change on agriculture
    in emerging economies [13]. Due to a lack of sophisticated infrastructure, low-income
    nations are especially at risk from climate change [14]. Because of inadequate
    adaptation methods, changing temperatures and rainfall levels reduce crop production
    in low-income countries. The vulnerability in question has emerged due to the
    adverse impacts of recent flooding events and prolonged periods of drought, particularly
    during the 20th century [15]. Concerns about global warming''s impact on Europe''s
    neighbors have increased. Temperature and precipitation trends in Northern Europe
    have improved, while those in Southern and Eastern Europe have declined [16].
    The recent rainfall was beneficial for farmers in South Africa. South Africa received
    timely summer and winter precipitation [17]. The magnitude of the climate change
    effects in Bhutan makes it more important to evaluate how much the country''s
    agricultural sector is tied to the seasonality of the monsoon and temperature
    fluctuations. The sector might anticipate more losses because of minor changes
    in the frequency and severity of weather extremes. The adverse effects of these
    factors are seen most acutely in agriculture and food security. The global catastrophe
    sequence of climatic changes has significantly impacted India''s agricultural
    economy. Warmer temperatures have been demonstrated to increase rice yields while
    decreasing wheat yields [18]. Climate change has already had detrimental effects
    on agriculture in Bangladesh, such as reducing crop yields by hundreds of tons
    annually. The agricultural sector has experienced significant hindrances due to
    various factors, including rising sea levels, heightened frequency and intensity
    of floods, and the formidable monsoon [19]. Pakistan has a substantial longitudinal
    reach from the Arabian Sea to the Himalayas in the north. There is a transition
    zone between the subtropical and temperate zones where the place is located [20].
    Fig. 1 shows that the maize production province-wise and in this significant production
    of maize in Punjab is 85 % and Balochistan and Sindh are 1 % [21]. Major crops
    like rice, cotton, wheat, sugarcane, anise, and more, like masoor, mash, mung,
    potato, chilis, and onion, make up Pakistan''s agriculture sector. Pakistan''s
    two main growing seasons are Kharif and Rabi. The Kharif planting and harvesting
    seasons are April to June and October to December. The Rabi season begins in the
    fall (Oct. to Dec.)and ends in the spring (April to May) [22]. Download : Download

    Fig. 2 shows the monthly climatology of minimum, maximum, and mean temperature
    and precipitation in Pakistan from the World Bank [24]. It is anticipated that
    the production capacity will experience a significant decline in the forthcoming
    period. The effects of climate change on agricultural practices have been extensively
    studied in prior research [25]. According to Ref. [26], even a modest increase
    in precipitation benefits wheat yields. An augmentation in the average lowest
    temperature during the sowing stage is positively correlated with an expansion
    in production capacity. Download : Download high-res image (282KB) Download :

    and precipitation of Pakistan). In contrast, an escalation in the average maximum
    temperature during the mature stages is associated with reduced production output.
    The authors [27] evaluated the susceptibility of wheat to temperature increases
    in both the short and long term. While it was discovered that higher temperatures
    were beneficial to rice production at first, it was later discovered that temperatures
    above a certain optimal level were detrimental to rice production. It was determined
    that rainfall had a detrimental impact on rice yield. Rising temperatures also
    had a negative impact on sugarcane harvests [28].In Pakistan''s cropping system,
    maize is a significant cereal crop. It has three major applications: human food,
    chicken feed, and livestock fodder. One of the highest-yielding cereal crops is
    maize. Pakistan likewise places a high value on maize. After wheat and rice, it
    is the third most common cereal worldwide [29]. Pakistan is a significant contributor
    to global maize production, so this research aims to assess the effects of climate
    change on the country''s maize production, evaluate the usage and adoption of
    technology by maize farmers, and propose policy derivatives to mitigate the long-term
    and short-term consequences of this period. The study is organized as follows:
    introduction, literature review, methodology, results, discussion, and conclusion.
    1.2. Objectives The research objectives are. • To examine climate change''s actual
    and potential effects on maize production in Pakistan. • To evaluate the role
    of technology in maize production. • Recommend some possible policies based on
    the findings to the government. To determine the uniqueness of this research issue,
    a well-designed study with reliable methods and data is needed. The research should
    review the literature to address gaps and advance past work. Due to climate change,
    Pakistan may profit from this research by increasing maize yield and food security.
    Understanding how Pakistani communities adapt to climate-related maize yield changes
    and build resilience is essential to grassroots climate adaptation. Pakistani
    agricultural resilience programs can benefit from studying maize production and
    climate. Understanding the relationship between climate and maize output could
    inspire new policies. 2. Literature Review 2.1. Theoretical foundation 2.1.1.
    Resilience theory Resilience theory is a comprehensive framework that helps ecological
    and agricultural systems recover from various disturbances or stresses [30]. This
    study focuses on the impact of climate change and other factors on the maize production
    system in Pakistan. According to resilience theory, a system''s ability to recover
    quickly from disturbances is improved by having several independent components.
    We applied this theory to Pakistan''s maize production system to identify strategies
    to enhance its resilience. These strategies include promoting crop diversity and
    implementing climate-smart agricultural practices. Ultimately, this research can
    help develop more resilient agricultural practices that can withstand the effects
    of climate change. 2.1.2. Food security framework Theoretical foundations for
    food security should involve understanding food supplies'' access, availability,
    use, and security [31,32]. This model provides a broader understanding of Pakistan''s
    food security and the significance of resilient maize production. By integrating
    food security concepts into the theoretical basis, policymakers and researchers
    can comprehensively understand the factors contributing to a nation''s food security.
    This model focuses on the access, availability, and use of food supplies and highlights
    the importance of ensuring their security. It is essential to comprehend the role
    of resilient maize production in Pakistan''s food security to develop effective
    strategies to address potential challenges or vulnerabilities in the future. 2.1.3.
    Agroecological system theory The concept of agroecological systems examines how
    agricultural and environmental factors interact [33,34]. It can be applied to
    understand better how maize production is affected by climate-related stressors
    and how resilient practices can be incorporated to make these systems more robust.
    By recognizing the connection between agricultural and environmental factors,
    the theory of agroecological systems offers valuable insights into the impact
    of climate-related stressors, such as drought or extreme temperatures, on maize
    production. These stressors can have a significant impact on crop yields and productivity.
    Therefore, implementing resilient practices based on agroecological principles
    can help mitigate these effects and increase the resilience of maize production
    systems in the face of changing climate conditions. 2.2. Empirical evidence As
    global average temperatures have steadily climbed, they have set off a chain reaction
    of extreme weather that has wreaked havoc on farming and the food supply [35].
    This research estimates the effect of temperature, Precipitation, and sunshine
    hours on maize output using the Transcendental Logarithmic Production model, using
    panel data from the National Rural Fixed Observation Point in China from 2009
    to 2018, about 3150 small farmers engaged in maize planting [36]. Considering
    the variations in regional climates, this study [37,38] also analyzes the expansion
    potential of China''s five main maize-producing regions. The findings show that
    higher temperatures, precipitation, and rainfall increase maize yields, but less
    sunlight reduces expansion. The five main areas for maize production are being
    hit differently by climate change, necessitating regionally specific adaptation
    measures [39]. Other significant factors in maize output are the area devoted
    to cultivation, the number of workers employed, and the total investment amount.
    Based on these results, according to Ref. [40], to encourage sustainable agricultural
    production, specific measures can be taken. Improve the accuracy of weather forecasts
    for major maize-growing regions; optimize agricultural output structure and growing
    structure considering local resources; launch watering and water preservation
    projects; and expand access to training programs that emphasize adaptive behavior
    in response to climate change. According to researchers [41,42], tools for predicting
    future climate can be informed by changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration, temperature,
    and precipitation. Climate change (CC) is how these instruments change from their
    historical baselines due to present and future situations beyond human control
    [43]. Like all other life forms, crops can profit from or suffer from climatic
    shifts [44]. It is debatable whether or not the widespread cultivation of maize
    has had a net good or bad effect on Pakistan''s agricultural sector [45]. Using
    vector autoregression models and time series data from 1980 to 2013, this study
    examined the potential consequences of global warming on Pakistan''s maize yield
    [39]. The study''s findings predicted that by 2030, a 6 % drop in annual maize
    yield will result from higher-than-average temperatures. Until 2021, a 9 % increase
    in maize yield can be attributed to the average minimum temperature. Maize crop
    production will also benefit from increased overall rainfall [46]. In 2030, compared
    to 1980 (the base year), maize output will have increased by 2 %. Water availability
    during the crop''s growth stages and fertilizer use (now or in the future) will
    unquestionably boost output [47]. The government should make adaptation alternatives,
    notably for growing maize, more accessible to farmers to mitigate the consequences
    of the changing climate on agriculture. This looming crisis can be mitigated by
    selecting crop varieties and managing fertilizer applications in light of projected
    climate change [48]. Climate change has the potential to significantly reduce
    the profitability, productivity, and sustainability of agricultural output [49].
    Few studies have examined how changes in climate affect maize production in Serbia''s
    agricultural ecosystem [50]. The study aims to analyze how climatic changes through
    time and place affect maize cultivation in two regions of the Republic of Serbia.
    Central Serbia and Vojvodina''s climate parameters (temperature, precipitation,
    sunshine, and humidity) were analyzed using data from Kragujevac and Sombor meteorological
    stations for two 30-year periods (1961–1990 and 1991–2020) [51]. The observed
    climatic parameters were analyzed using a correlation analysis from 2004 to 2020
    to see whether and to what degree they are connected to maize production. Kragujevac
    saw an increase of 0.046 °C and Sombor of 0.05 °C in annual average temperatures
    between 1991 and 2020, whereas Sombor saw an increase of 5.01 h in yearly average
    sunlight. Humidity decreased by an average of 1.3 % points per year in Kragujevac
    and by 3.4 % points per year in Sombor between 1961 and 1990 [52]. Corn yields
    were considerably lower in years with severe heat and a lack of precipitation.
    Evidence from these studies shows that global warming impacts maize output, calling
    for more climate-resilient maize hybrids and varieties as well as improved agro-technical
    solutions [53]. The global food supply may be in jeopardy due to rising temperatures,
    altered precipitation patterns, the proliferation of extreme weather events, and
    the release of more greenhouse gases [54]. The increased frequency of extreme
    climate events causes more significant fluctuations in agricultural output [55].
    For the anticipated period 2021–2050 and 2051–2080 under different Representative
    Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6, 4.6, 6.0, and 8.6 W/m2, the effect of climate
    change on yields of maize and characteristics was evaluated using the CERES-maize
    model [56]. The results were compared to the baseline scenario of 1982–2012 for
    eastern India. A 10.58% point drop in output between 2021 and 2050, a 14.80% point
    drop between 2051 and 2080, and a 23.39% point drop between 2051 and 2080 was
    found for irrigated circumstances, relative to the baseline period of 1982–2012.
    In rain-fed conditions, yield changes were reported at 10.55 %, 9.20 %, 8.13 %,
    and 7.47 % from 2021 to 2050, and at 10.63 %, 6.65 %, 7.47 %, and 4.31 % from
    2051 to 2080, respectively [57]. The study found that grain yield decreased from
    2051 to 2080 under irrigated conditions compared to the baseline yield. However,
    it increased from 2021 to 50 and 2051 to 80 under rain-fed conditions, indicating
    that the positive effect of rainfall on crop yield outweighed the negative effect
    of temperature [58]. Changes in climate, such as higher average temperatures and
    more frequent and severe weather events, are a big worry for farmers in Pakistan
    [59]. Pakistan''s food security is critically dependent on the maize crop, which
    is very susceptible to the effects of climate change [60]. This study aims to
    review previous work on the issue of climate change''s effects on Pakistan''s
    maize production and the consequences this may have for agriculture''s long-term
    viability in the face of unpredictable weather patterns. According to empirical
    studies, Climate change is already negatively impacting Pakistan''s maize harvest
    [61]. As temperatures rose and rainfall patterns changed, the largest maize-growing
    province, Punjab, saw its yields diminish. Growing seasons for maize are getting
    shorter due to rising temperatures, which harms crop yields, as observed by Ref.
    [62]. Climate change is predicted to exacerbate existing problems with crop yields
    in Pakistan due to rising temperatures and more volatile weather patterns [63].
    However, more study is needed to determine how carbon dioxide exacerbates climate
    change''s effects on maize yields [64]. This literature review aims [65] to examine
    the existing data on how CO2 affects maize output in Pakistan against the backdrop
    of global warming. According to an empirical study, there will be both beneficial
    and detrimental consequences of increased atmospheric CO2 levels on maize output
    [66]. On the one hand, increased CO2 levels can increase maize production by stimulating
    photosynthesis and growth [67]. Research by Ref. [68] found that a 50 % rise in
    CO2 concentrations led to a 23 % increase in maize yields in China. Scientists
    have discovered that the negative consequences of climate change may cancel out
    the positive effects of CO2 on maize output [69]. found that increasing CO2 levels
    increased maize yields in Pakistan, but drought stress reduced such benefits.
    According to the researcher [70], climate change threatens world food supplies
    by affecting agricultural production. China is the second largest producer and
    consumer of maize [71]. Understanding how climate change affects maize production
    can guide national and international economic and political policies [72]. Since
    panel models cannot identify group-wise heteroscedasticity, cross-sectional correlation,
    and autocorrelation, the researcher [73] used the feasible generalized least square
    (FGLS) model to assess the impact of climate change on Chinese maize yields from
    1979 to 2016. China''s maize harvest suffered from 1979 to 2016 temperature increases.
    Maize yield fell by 1.7 % every 1 °C, or 5.19 kg 667 m-2. The agricultural production
    barely changed due to the minor increase in rainfall. Maize production increased
    by only 0.043 kg 667 m-2 (0.014 %) for each millimeter of rainfall [74]. Climate
    change is especially harmful to maize production in southern China. A 1 °C temperature
    increase in this area reduced maize output by 7.49 kg 667m-2, while it had no
    effect in northern China. Southern China yields 0.013 kg 667 m-2 for every 1 mm
    of precipitation, while northern China yields 0.066 kg 667 m-2. The temperature
    had a smaller marginal influence in southern and northern China during 1990–2016
    than from 1979 to 2016 [75]. This study [76] examines how research and development
    spillover and irrigation water utilization impact Pakistani agricultural output.
    In the face of water constraints, irrigated technology, internal and foreign R&D
    shocks, human resources, agricultural employment, and land-determined agricultural
    productivity [77]. We gather yearly time series data from 1973 through 2020 for
    these purposes. Knowledge spillover and water resource efficiency affect Pakistani
    agricultural productivity using the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model.
    The findings show that international and local R&D spillovers have benefited Pakistani
    agriculture productivity. External R&D spillovers improved agriculture productivity
    more than expected. Pakistan''s agricultural output rose due to water technology,
    according to estimates. Human capital and interaction term results are substantial
    and unfavorable, demonstrating that labour in agriculture needs to be more skilled
    at learning from outside sources [78]. The study''s [79] goal is to examine how
    CO2 emissions contribute to climate change and how formal credit affects AP in
    Pakistan. Tractors (TRs), tube wells (TWs), energy consumption (EC), and labour
    force (LF) are all included in the study''s technical aspects. The years 1981–2017
    were used to analyze the yearly data. Cointegration, also of the underlying variables,
    was investigated using an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach, and
    the direction of causality was assessed using the Granger causality test within
    the framework of the model for vector error correction (VECM). Organizational
    financing, atmospheric CO2 emissions, agricultural productivity, energy consumption,
    workforce magnitude, and technologies (including tractors and tube wells) are
    all linked, according to evidence from a bounds-testing study of ARDL [80,81].
    Agricultural production increases with the availability of formal loans, new technologies
    (such as tractors), and an increase in workers. The positive impact of carbon
    dioxide emissions on agricultural productivity is minimal in both scenarios [82].
    3. Methodology 3.1. Conceptual framework Reviewing the related literature allowed
    us to create a research framework. The model examines the relationship between
    the independent variables (average temperature, carbon dioxide, precipitation,
    and technology level) and the dependent variable (maize production). The conceptual

    study The primary aim is to find out the effect of climate change on the production
    of maize in Pakistan, which has been empirically examined using time-series data
    from 1990 to 2020 that was gathered from the Central Banks of Pakistan websites,
    World Economic Indicators, and the World Bank. For this purpose, the analyses
    have been conducted through Eviews-9. 3.3. Model description The application of
    ARDL models enables the assessment of the influence of previous variable values
    on subsequent values. Encoding delays and persistence is crucial in modeling social
    and economic systems. Regarding model selection, the ARDL approach is employed
    to determine the best lag times to be applied. Researchers can ascertain their
    model''s most suitable lag time by employing information metrics such as the Akaike
    Information Criterion (AIC) or the Schwarz Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).
    The utilization of ARDL models enables the testing of hypotheses and the derivation
    of inferences regarding the associations among variables. In order to assess the
    validity of the model, researchers often examine the importance of the coefficients,
    the goodness of fit, and diagnostic tests [[72], [73], [74],81]. Various lag length
    selection criteria have been presented as potential solutions. These include the
    Akaike Information Criterion, the Schwarz Information Criterion, the Hannan-Quinn
    Criterion, the Final Prediction Error, and the Corrected version of AIC. In this
    study, we employed the Akaike Information Criterion to examine the criteria for
    selecting lag, including normal errors, non-normal errors, and a structural break.
    It has been established that the Schwarz Information Criterion (SIC) has superior
    performance when used in large samples. Additionally, it has been observed that
    in situations involving regime transitions or shocks to the system, no criterion
    proves effective in accurately determining the appropriate lag time. In this investigation,
    we experimentally explored the relationships between the chosen variables and
    their dynamic short-term and long-term associations, as the conceptual framework
    is shown in Fig. 3. The long-term relationship between nonstationary variables
    was investigated using an autoregressive distributed lag and the Bounds cointegration
    test. The error term may be eliminated by making all equation variables have the
    same stationarity rate. Although some variables might be nonstationary, for a
    linear combination, there is a possibility to be co-integrated. Hence, a set of
    variables may be co-integrated if a symmetric long-run relationship exists between
    variables [75]. The time series data necessitates checking for stationarity and
    cointegration among variables before estimating ADRL. The studies by Pesaran (1997),
    Shin (1998), and Pesaran and Shin (1998 together), Researchers interested in learning
    more about panel data causality and time series tests that rely on integration
    and cointegration results should look at the chapters on those topics in the books
    by Menegaki (2018) and Fuinhas and Marques (2019), respectively titled \"The Economics
    and the Econometrics of the Energy-Growth Nexus\" and \"The Extended Energy-Growth
    Nexus\". To find the nexus between the variables equation (1) is constructed as
    follows: (1) To measure the long and short run association among the variable,
    equation (1) is modified to equation (2). Equation (2) can be written in ARDL
    form are as follows: (2) The variables used in the model are described in Table

    4.1. Descriptive statistics The findings of the variables that are descriptive
    statistics are available in Table 2. This table explains the average value of
    maize production, Average Temperature (AVEGTP), Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Precipitation
    (PRCT), and Technology used (TWL) in Pakistan: 3086, 14.082, 27.96, 21.00, 0.697,
    298.48, 202251, and 134.09. The highest and lowest values of individual variables
    explain that MZP has a maximum value of 7883.10 and a lowest value of 1179.30;
    however, the recorded lowest maximum value is for CO2. The AVEGTP and PRPT are
    skewed negatively, as shown by the symmetrical distribution of the variables,
    while another variable is positively skewed. All the variables are normally distributed,
    as established by the probability value of Jarque Bera. Table 2. Descriptive statistics.

    always gives a positive value; however, if it is not very close to zero, it indicates
    that the sample data do not adhere to a normal distribution. The value of the
    test statistic can be found to be 0.563, and its p-value is 0.755. We could not
    reject the null hypothesis that the data is normally distributed in this scenario

    full-size image Fig. 4. Normality test. 4.3. Unit root test There are several
    ways to test whether something is stationary. Consequently, our inquiry utilized
    widely recognized unit root tests such as the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) and
    the Phillips-Perron (PP). Table 3 shows the unit root results of the series at
    the level and first differences, as well as the constant only and constant with
    trend specifications used to find stable variables. The results of the Augmented
    Dickey-Fuller (ADF) and Phillip-Perron (PP) unit root tests show that three variables
    are stationary. Two are not at the level, and all variables become stationary
    at the first Difference with constant and constant, with the trend at the 1 %,
    5 %, and 10 % significance levels, respectively. The variables are not stationary
    because they are integrated into order one (1). This emphasizes the need to undertake
    an ARDL-bound assessment cointegration test to determine whether the variables
    have a long-term connection or relationship. Table 3. Unit root test. Empty Cell

    Hypothesis: The variable has a unit root. 4.4. Correlation A correlation matrix
    shows the association between environmental and other factors and maize production
    in Pakistan. According to the results, all factors positively affect Pakistan''s
    production of maize and agricultural value added. However, compared to average
    temperature, CO2 emissions, and technology use, precipitation had a weaker correlation
    with agricultural output. The relationships between the variables are shown in
    Table 4. The average temperature (AVEGTP) has a 0.567 association with maize production
    (MPZ). This is the positive correlation in the matrix. The correlation between
    carbon dioxide (CO2) and maize production (MZP) is 0.725, which is highly positive.
    The correlation coefficient between precipitation (PRPT) and maize production
    (MZP) is 0.119. There is a strong positive correlation between tube well irrigation
    (TWL) and maize production (MZP), with a correlation coefficient 0.747. Table

    Bound test for cointegration To examine the long-term impact of Average Temperature
    (AVEGP), Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Precipitation (PRPT), and Tube Well Irrigation
    (TWL) on Maize Production (MZP) in Pakistan, a cointegration test employing the
    bound test approach and the results are shown in Table 5. Table 5. Bound test

    Table 4. Given the computed F statistic of 4.530 \"(F statistic is greater than
    Upper Bound Value),\" the results show no cointegration among variables and rejection
    of the null hypothesis, indicating a long-run relationship among these variables.
    4.6. The result of the ARDL model 4.6.1. Short-run impact of climate variables
    on maize production The short-run dynamic model describes the convergence rate
    to the equilibrium following a disturbance to the equation. The model of cointegration
    of the short run has been devised as the ARDL Framework has the short-run active
    parameter. Table 6 shows the short-run result: At the 1 % significance level,
    the average temperature (AVEGTP) has a significant short-run impact on maize production
    (MZP) (Coefficient = −3.237, p-value = 0.001). According to Ref. [81], average
    temperature has a short-run impact on maize production, consistent with the current
    study''s findings. Carbon dioxide (CO2) has a significant short-run impact on
    maize production (MZP) at the 5 % significance level (Coefficient = 0.757, p-value
    = 0.005). According to [87], carbon dioxide has a short-run impact on maize production,
    consistent with the current study''s findings. At the 10 % significance level,
    precipitation (PRPT) has a significant short-run impact on maize production (MZP)
    (coefficient = −0.141, p-value = 0.062). According to [88], precipitation has
    a short-run impact on maize production, consistent with the current study''s results.
    The short-run impacts of tube well (TWL) on maize production (MZP) are statistically
    significant at the 1 % level (coefficient = −16.795, p-value = 0.004). The current
    study''s findings are consistent with those of [89], which state that tube wells
    have a short-run impact on maize production. Table 6. Short-run impact of climate

    variables on maize production Table 7 shows that the long-run ARDL result, the
    average temperature in the long run (AVEGTP), has a significant impact on maize
    production (MZP) (Coefficient = −17.449, p-value = 0.013). This was determined
    at the 5 % significance level. The results of the current study are consistent
    with those found in a previous study [90; 91], which states that average temperature
    impacts maize production over the long run. Carbon dioxide (CO2) has a significant
    impact on maize production (MZP) over the long run (Coefficient = 3.603, p-value
    = 0.001). This was determined at a 1 % level of significance. The current study''s
    findings are consistent with those of a previous study [92], which concluded that
    carbon dioxide has a long-run impact on maize production. Precipitation (PRPT)
    has a long-run impact on maize production (MZP) (coefficient = −1.548, p-value
    = 0.084). This was measured at the 10 % significance level. A prior study [93]
    found that precipitation has a long-run impact on maize productivity, supported
    by the current study. The tube well (TWL) significantly impacts maize production
    (p-value = 0.021, coefficient = −4.222). This was examined at a 5 % level of significance.
    This study confirms the previous study''s findings[94; 95] that tube wells have
    a long-term impact on maize production. Table 7. Long-run impact of climate variables

    FMOLS and DOLS models are presented in Table 8. These models provide coefficients
    that can be employed to determine the long-term impact. In the FMOLS and DOLS
    models for average temperature, precipitation, and tube well, respectively, its
    coefficient is negative and statistically significant at 10 %, 5 %, and 1 %. Thus,
    the average temperature, precipitation, and tube well harm the region''s long-term
    economic growth. In both the Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS) and
    Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLS) models, it is shown that only the variable
    representing carbon dioxide (CO2) exhibits a positive and statistically significant
    impact at the 10 % level. The sign and significance of the FMOLS and DOLS affirm
    the long-run estimation of the ARDL model. Table 8. FMLOS and DOLS test. Empty

    and model stability Before starting an economic data analysis, perform diagnostic
    tests to confirm the estimated model''s accuracy. We carried out a series of diagnostic
    tests to validate the robustness of the model as a final step in output analysis.
    The Heteroscedasticity test, the Serial correlation test (Brush & Godfray LM test),
    the Normality test (Jaque-Bera), and the Functional form test (Ramsey''s RESET)
    were among them. As shown in Table 9, diagnostic tests indicate this because long-
    and short-run estimates are devoid of serial correlation, misspecification of
    the short-run model, non-normality of the error component, and heteroscedasticity.

    a structural change. The following table makes this very evident. The slope and

    causality test Determining whether two variables are cointegrated is crucial in
    evaluating long-term Granger causality using vector error correction [80]. The
    preceding outcomes of the Granger causality test indicate that financial development
    is vital in fostering economic growth in Ethiopia. This supports the enduring
    validity of the \"supply-led\" expansion hypothesis. The research mentioned above
    conducted by Ref. [82] has yielded comparable results. Table 11 illustrates that,
    like the long-term perspective, a unidirectional causality exists from environmental
    and technological factors to economically sustainable maize production in Pakistan.
    This data further supports the notion that the expansion of the agricultural sector,
    in both the short and long term, is being driven by changes in environmental factors
    and technological advancements. Table 11. Long- and short-run Granger causality

    temperature (AVEGTP) has a significant short-term impact on maize production (MZP)
    at the 1 % significance level (coefficient = −3.237, p-value = 0.001). The current
    study agrees with [39] that average temperature short-term affects maize production.
    CO2 significantly impacts maize output (MZP) at 5 % significance (coefficient
    = 0.757, p-value = 0.005). According to Ref. [83], carbon dioxide has a short-run
    impact on maize production. Precipitation (PRPT) affects maize output (MZP) in
    the short run at the 10 % significance level (coefficient = −0.141, p-value =
    0.062) [84], which is supported by the current study. Tube well (TWL) short-run
    impacts on maize production (MZP) are statistically significant at the 1 % level
    (coefficient = −16.796, p-value = 0.004). This study confirms [ [66,79]] that
    tube wells have a short-run impact on maize productivity. According to the long-run
    ARDL, average temperature (AVEGTP) significantly impacts maize production (MZP)
    (coefficient = −17.449, p-value = 0.013). This was 5 % significant. This research
    confirms a previous study [37] that average temperature affects maize production
    over time. CO2 affects maize production (MZP) (coefficient = 3.603, p-value =
    0.001). At 1 % significance, this was determined. This study supports a prior
    study [78]. In the long run, precipitation impacts maize production (MZP) (coefficient
    = −1.548, p-value = 0.084) at a 10 % significance level. This investigation confirms
    a previous study [40]. The tube well (TWL) significantly impacts maize productivity
    over time (p-value = 0.0206, coefficient = −4.223). The significance level of
    5 % was used. This study confirms a prior study [85]. 5.1. Conclusion Maize production
    is essential for sustainable food production, consumption, and security. Because
    of its large production capacity, nutritional content, range of uses, advantages
    to soil health, and contributions to economic prosperity, it is an essential crop
    in producing a resilient and sustainable food system. Inside the ARDL framework,
    the cointegration model of the short-run active parameter and the short-run effect
    has been developed. The originality of a study on this topic would depend on the
    presented empirical findings and implications. For instance, a study that analyzes
    the impact of climate change on maize production in a specific region or country
    and offers context-specific adaptation strategies or policy recommendations would
    be considered original. The efficacy of specific policies may vary across different
    provinces and areas in Pakistan. To obtain the most current and comprehensive
    information regarding policies about environmental changes and maize production
    in Pakistan, it is advisable to consult official government sources, agricultural
    agencies, and pertinent research groups. By inquiring about any current adjustments
    or advancements in this domain, one may also inquire about them. Policies promoting
    conservation agricultural techniques, such as decreased tillage and cover cropping,
    enhance soil health, erosion management, and water conservation. Sustainable maize
    production techniques can be disseminated through extension services and farmer
    training programs. Utilizing these programs can facilitate well-informed decisions
    on planting, harvesting, and pest management. 5.2. Implication Maize is a staple
    grain in many parts of the world, but climate change threatens its production.
    The success of the maize crop is critical to the sustainability of food production,
    consumption, and food security. Empirical research shows that increasing temperatures
    and altered rainfall patterns may impair maize yields, particularly in areas without
    substantial irrigation. There are significant implications for the future of sustainable
    agriculture. It first highlights the need for farmers to adopt new agricultural
    practices, switching to drought-resistant maize varieties, and establishing irrigation
    systems in regions where it is practicable. Second, it emphasizes the need for
    global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and address climate change.
    Carbon emissions must be reduced, and investments in renewable energy and other
    low-carbon technologies must be made. Third, it underlines the need for policymakers
    to put sustainable agricultural growth first to preserve food supply and the economy
    from the consequences of climate change. This area includes R&D for climate-resilient
    crop and agricultural practice development, aid to smallholder farmers, and advocacy
    for sustainable land use. Overall, the impact of climate change on maize yield
    emphasizes the vital need for action to tackle this worldwide challenge and ensure
    agriculture''s long-term survival for future generations. 5.3. Future research
    direction and limitations This research can shed light on the opportunities and
    dangers of climate change for maize production and food security in Pakistan and
    other regions with comparable issues. Researchers could investigate further the
    findings presented in the research to gain a deeper understanding of this urgent
    issue. By utilizing robust data, they can develop productive solutions. Examine
    how the mobility and trade of maize in Pakistan are affected by the abiotic stress
    brought on by climate change. This study aims to analyze the impacts of climate-induced
    stress on national and regional food prices, distribution networks, and the availability
    of healthy food. This study aims to comprehensively analyze the financial implications
    of various responses to climate-induced abiotic stress on maize productivity.
    The focus will be on evaluating adaptation and mitigation strategies to assess
    their possible effects on the financial aspects of maize production. As a result,
    policymakers will have an enhanced ability to allocate resources more effectively.

  explanation: Automated irrigation systems have been shown to improve crop yields
    and water efficiency, and they have the potential to contribute to addressing
    the global food challenge. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role
    of distributed architectures and edge computing in enhancing the resilience of
    automated irrigation systems. The study found that distributed architectures and
    edge computing can improve the resilience of automated irrigation systems by providing
    redundancy and fault tolerance. This is important because it can help to ensure
    that the system will continue to operate even if there is a hardware failure or
    a network outage.

    irrigation systems that utilizes edge computing to enhance system resilience.
    The proposed architecture leverages the advantages of edge computing, such as
    low latency, high bandwidth, and local data processing, to improve the reliability
    and fault tolerance of the system.'

  explanation: The paper discusses the need for increased resilience in automated
    irrigation systems to enhance their reliability. The authors propose the use of
    distributed architectures and edge computing as key strategies for achieving this
    resilience. They argue that by distributing the system's components across multiple
    locations and leveraging edge computing's capabilities for real-time data processing
    and decision-making, the system can better tolerate failures and maintain its
    functionality even in the face of disruptions. The paper provides a comprehensive
    overview of the benefits and challenges of using distributed architectures and
    edge computing in automated irrigation systems, making it highly relevant to the
    discussion on system resilience in the literature review.

    in India 1. Introduction Modern day farming demands increased production of food
    to accommodate the large global population. Towards this goal, new technologies
    and solutions (Chen et al., 2015, Misra et al., 2015, Goumopoulos et al., 2014,
    Amaral et al., 2014, Ngo et al., 2014, Ullah et al., 2014, Misra et al., 2014,
    Qu et al., 2014, Misra et al., 2013, Riquelme et al., 2009, Garcia-Sanchez et
    al., 2011, Camilli et al., 2007) are being applied in this domain to provide an
    optimal alternative to gather and process information (Behzadan et al., 2014,
    Dhurandher et al., 2014) to enhance productivity. Moreover, the alarming climate
    change and scarcity of water (Postel, 1999, Bouwer, 2000, Saleth and Dinar, 2000,
    Jury and, 2007, Falloon and Betts, 2010, Mueller et al., 2012) demand new and
    improved methods for modern agricultural fields. Consequently, the need for automation
    and intelligent decision making is becoming more important to accomplish this
    mission (ur Rehman et al., 2014, Suprem et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2006, Hart
    and Martinez, 2006). In this regard, technologies such as ubiquitous computing
    (Burrell et al., 2004), wireless ad-hoc and sensor networks (Diallo et al., 2015,
    Srbinovska et al., 2015, Zhao et al., 2013, Karim et al., 2013, Zhang et al.,
    2013, Krishna et al., 2012, Zhang and Zhang, 2012, Misra et al., 2011, Mirabella
    and Brischetto, 2011, Lloret et al., 2011, Garcia et al., 2010, Bri et al., 2009,
    Lloret et al., 2009, Lin et al., 2008, Wang et al., 2006), Radio Frequency Identifier
    (RFID) (Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011), cloud computing (Ojha et al., 2014, Misra
    et al., 2014, Cho et al., 2012), Internet of Things (IoT) (Atzori et al., 2010,
    Gubbi et al., 2013), satellite monitoring (Moghaddam et al., 2010), remote sensing
    (Bastiaanssen et al., 2000, Morais et al., 2008, Ye et al., 2013), context-aware
    computing (Moghaddam et al., 2010) are becoming increasingly popular. 1.1. Motivation
    Among all these technologies, the agriculture domain is mostly explored concerning
    the application of WSNs in improving the traditional methods of farming (ur Rehman
    et al., 2014, Zhao et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2006, Akyildiz et al., 2002a, Akyildiz
    et al., 2002b, Akyildiz and Kasimoglu, 2004, Yick et al., 2008, Ruiz-Garcia et
    al., 2009). The Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) technology has enabled
    the creation of small and cheap sensors. The ubiquitous nature of operation, together
    with self-organized small sized nodes, scalable and cost-effective technology,
    enables the WSNs as a potential tool towards the goal of automation in agriculture.
    In this regard, precision agriculture (Chen et al., 2015, Cambra et al., 2015,
    Barcelo-Ordinas et al., 2013, Baseca et al., 2013, Díaz et al., 2011, López et
    al., 2011, Park et al., 2011, Matese et al., 2009), automated irrigation scheduling
    (Lichtenberg et al., 2015, Reche et al., 2015, Greenwood et al., 2010, Gutiérrez
    et al., 2014, Moghaddam et al., 2010), optimization of plant growth (Hwang et
    al., 2010), farmland monitoring (Corke et al., 2010, Voulodimos et al., 2010),
    greenhouse gases monitoring (Malaver et al., 2015, Yang et al., 2013, Mao et al.,
    2012), agricultural production process management (Díaz et al., 2011, Dong et
    al., 2013), and security in crops (Garcia-Sanchez et al., 2011), are a few potential
    applications. However, WSNs have few limitations (Akyildiz et al., 2002a, Yick
    et al., 2008) such as low battery power, limited computation capability and small
    memory of the sensor nodes. These limitations invite challenges in the design
    of WSN applications in agriculture. In agriculture, most of the WSN-based applications
    are targeted for various applications. For example, WSNs for environmental condition
    monitoring with information of soil nutrients is applied for predicting crop health
    and production quality over time. Irrigation scheduling is predicted with WSNs
    by monitoring the soil moisture and weather conditions. Being scalable, the performance
    of an existing WSN-based application can be improved to monitor more parameters
    by only including additional sensor nodes to the existing architecture. The issues
    present in such applications are the determination of optimal deployment strategy,
    measurement interval, energy-efficient medium access, and routing protocols. For
    example, a sparse deployment of nodes with a long data collection interval is
    helpful for enhancing the lifetime of a network. However, challenges may emerge
    from the choice of the deployment region. As an example, if the field area is
    separated by obstructions then it will lead to attenuation of signal, thereby
    affecting the inter-node communication. In the Indian scenario, the WSN-based
    farming solutions need to be of very low cost to be affordable by end users. However,
    with the increasing population, the demand of food-grain is also rising. Recent
    reports warns that the growth in food grain production is less than the growth
    in population (Shanwad et al., 2004). Also, India is one of the largest exporters
    of food grains, and thus, researchers (Shanwad et al., 2004, Mondal and Basu,
    2009) demand to boost production by incorporating advanced technologies. Consequently,
    new and modern technologies are being considered in many agricultural applications
    to achieve the target (Mondal et al., 2004). The current state of development
    in the Indian scenario comprises of technologies such as WSNs, General Packet
    Radio Service (GPRS), Global Positioning System (GPS), remote sensing, and Geographical
    Information System (GIS). 1.2. Contributions In this paper, we surveyed the variants
    of WSNs and their potential for the advancement of various agricultural application
    development. We highlight the main agricultural and farming applications, and
    discuss the applicability of WSNs towards improved performance and productivity.
    We also classify the network architecture, node architecture, and communication
    technology standards used in agricultural applications. The real-world wireless
    sensor nodes and various sensors such as soil, environment, pH, and plant-health
    are also listed in this paper. In Section 5, we study and review the existing
    WSN deployments both in the global as well as the Indian scenarios. In summary,
    the contributions of this paper are listed as follows. • We study the current
    state-of-the-art in WSNs and their applicability in agricultural and farming applications.
    • The existing WSNs are analyzed with respect to communication and networking
    technologies, standards, and hardware. • We analyze the prospects and problems
    of the existing agricultural applications with detailed case studies for global
    as well as the Indian scenarios. • Finally, we present the futuristic applications
    highlighting the factors for improvements for the existing scenarios. 1.3. Paper
    organization The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents
    the basics of WSNs, its requirements, potentials and different possible application
    in the agriculture domain. Design of a wireless sensor network for agricultural
    application is discussed in Section 3. The technologies and standards used in
    agricultural applications are analyzed in Section 4. We further discuss about
    the currently existing state-of-the-art and real-world applications in Section
    5, and analyze the prospects and problems of the existing solutions. In Section
    6, we provide few future direction of work pointing out the factors for improvement.
    Finally, the paper concludes in Section 7. 2. Wireless sensor networks and its
    potential for agricultural applications In this section, we discuss two widely
    used variants of WSNs—Terrestrial Wireless Sensor Networks (TWSN) and Wireless
    Underground Sensor Networks (WUSN), specifically used in agricultural applications.
    2.1. Terrestrial wireless sensor networks WSNs are a network of battery-powered
    sensors inter-connected through wireless medium and are typically deployed to
    serve a specific application purpose (Akyildiz et al., 2002a, Akyildiz et al.,
    2002b, Akyildiz and Kasimoglu, 2004). In TWSNs, the nodes are deployed above the
    ground surface. The advancements in MEMS technology has enabled the creation of
    smart, small sized, although low cost sensors. These powerful sensors empower
    a sensor node or mote to accurately collect the surrounding data. Based on the
    sensed information, these nodes then network among themselves to perform the application
    requirements. For example, consider a precision agriculture environment where
    WSNs are deployed throughout the field to automate the irrigation system. All
    these sensors determine the moisture content of the soil, and further, collaboratively
    decide the time and duration of irrigation scheduling on that field. Then, using
    the same network, the decision is conveyed to the sensor node attached to a water
    pump. Gutiérrez et al. (2014) proposed one such automated irrigation system using
    a WSN and GPRS module. Fig. 1 depicts a typical wireless sensor network deployed
    on field for agricultural applications. The field consists of sensor nodes powered
    with application specific on-board sensors. The nodes in the on-field sensor network
    communicate among themselves using radio-frequency (RF) links of industrial, scientific
    and medical (ISM) radio bands (such as 902–928 MHz and 2.4–2.5 GHz). Typically,
    a gateway node is also deployed along with the sensor nodes to enable a connection
    between the sensor network and the outer world. Thus, the gateway node is powered
    with both RF and Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) or GPRS. A remote
    user can monitor the state of the field, and control the on-field sensors and
    actuator devices. For example, a user can switch on/off a pump/valve when the
    water level applied to the field reaches some predefined threshold value. Users
    carrying mobile phone can also remotely monitor and control the on-field sensors.
    The mobile user is connected via GPRS or even through Short Message Service (SMS).
    Periodic information update from the sensors, and on-demand system control for
    both type of users can also be designed. Download : Download high-res image (240KB)

    Another variant of the WSNs is its underground counterpart—Wireless Underground
    Sensor Networks (WUSNs) (Akyildiz and Stuntebeck, 2006, Vuran and Akyildiz, 2008).
    In this version, the wireless sensors are planted inside soil. In this setting,
    higher frequencies suffer severe attenuation, and comparatively lower frequencies
    are able to penetrate through the soil (Silva and Vuran, 2010, Yu et al., 2013).
    Thus, communication radius gets limited and the network requires higher number
    of nodes to cover a large area. The application of wired sensors increases the
    network coverage by requiring relatively smaller number of sensors. However, in
    this design, the sensors and the wires may be vulnerable to farming activities.
    A typical agricultural application based on underground sensor networks is shown
    in Fig. 2. Unlike the TWSN-based applications shown in Fig. 1, in this figure,
    the sensor nodes are buried inside soil. One gateway node is also deployed to
    transmit the information collected by the underground sensor nodes to the surface
    sink placed over the ground. Thereafter, the information can be transmitted over
    the Internet to store in remote databases, and can be used for notifying a cell
    phone carrying user. However, due to comparatively shorter communication distance,
    more number of nodes are required to be deployed for use in WUSNs. Download :

    2.3. Differences between TWSNs and WUSNs We highlight the specific differences
    between the TWSNs and WUSNs in Table 1. Table 1. Differences between terrestrial
    and underground WSNs. Feature TWSNs WUSNs Deployment Placed over ground Buried
    under-ground Depth Anywhere over ground Topsoil (0–30 cm) and subsoil (>30 cm)a
    Communication range ≈100 m ≈0.1–10 m Communication frequency Higher (868/915 MHz,
    2.4 GHz) Lower (433 MHz, 8–300 kHz) Antenna size Smaller Larger Energy consumption
    Lower Higher Cost Lower Higher a References Martinez et al., 2004, Vuran and Silva,
    2009 reported a glacier monitoring network where underground communications over
    30 m distance were possible. Further, using higher transmission power, 80 m distance
    under ice were also covered. 2.4. Usefulness of WSNs In the following, we highlight
    the salient features of WSNs that have enabled themselves as a potential tool
    for automation in the agricultural domain. (i) Intelligent decision making capability:
    WSNs are multi-hop in nature (Akyildiz et al., 2002a, Akyildiz et al., 2002b,
    Akyildiz and Kasimoglu, 2004). In a large area, this feature enhances the energy-efficiency
    of the overall network, and hence, the network lifetime increases. Using this
    feature, multiple sensor nodes collaborate among themselves, and collectively
    take the final decision (Kulkarni et al., 2011, Bhattacharjee et al., 2012, Wu
    et al., 2012, Yao et al., 2013). (ii) Dynamic topology configuration: To conserve
    the in-node battery power, a sensor node keeps itself in the ‘sleep mode’ most
    of the time. Using topology management techniques (Ren and Meng, 2009, Chu and
    Sethu, 2012, Li et al., 2013), the sensor nodes can collaboratively take these
    decisions. To maximize the network lifetime, the network topology is configured
    such that the minimum number of nodes remain in the active mode. (iii) Fault-tolerance:
    One common challenge in deploying the WSNs is that the sensor nodes are fault-prone
    (Younis et al., 2014). Under such circumstances, unplanned deployment of nodes
    may lead to network partitioning, and in turn, the overall performance of the
    network is affected. However, in countermeasure, the sensor nodes can ‘self-organize’
    by dynamically configuring the network topology (Misra et al., 2011). (iv) Context-awareness:
    Based on the sensed information about the physical and environmental parameters,
    the sensor nodes gain knowledge about the surrounding context. The decisions that
    the sensor nodes take thereafter are context-aware (Vijay et al., 2011). (v) Scalability:
    Generally, the WSN protocols are designed to be implemented in any network irrespective
    of its size and node count. This feature undoubtedly widens the potential of WSNs
    for numerous applications. (vi) Node heterogeneity: WSNs are often assumed to
    be comprised of homogeneous sensor attached devices (Misra et al., 2015, Li and
    Hou, 2005, Ren and Meng, 2009). However, in many realistic scenarios, the devices
    are heterogeneous in respect of processing and computation power, memory, sensing
    capability, transceiver unit, and movement capability. (vii) Tolerance against
    communication failures in harsh environmental conditions: Due to the wide range
    of applications in open agricultural environments, WSNs suffer the effects of
    harsh environmental conditions (Misra et al., 2014). The WSN protocol stack includes
    techniques to withstand the effect of communication failures in the network arising
    due to environmental effects. (viii) Autonomous operating mode: An important feature
    of WSNs is their autonomous operating mode (Misra and Jain, 2011) and adaptiveness
    (Nicopolitidis et al., 2011). In agricultural applications, this feature certainly
    plays an important role, and enables an easy as well as advanced mode of operation.
    (ix) Information security: The WSNs carry raw information about on-field parameters.
    To ensure the security of sensed information, WSNs provides access control mechanisms
    (Misra and Vaish, 2011) and anomaly detection (Karapistoli et al., 2013) to restrict
    unauthenticated users. 2.5. Potential applications We list the possible agricultural
    and farming applications which can be implemented using WSNs. • Irrigation management
    system: Modern day agriculture requires an improved irrigation management system
    to optimize the water usage in farming (Adamala et al., 2014, Greenwood et al.,
    2010). The alarming reduction of ground water level is another motivation for
    the requirement of an advanced system. In this context, micro-irrigation techniques
    are cost-effective and water-usage efficient (Raina et al., 1998, Westarp et al.,
    2004). However, micro-irrigation efficiency can be further improved based on the
    environmental and soil information. In this regard, WSNs are applied as the coordinating
    technology (Lichtenberg et al., 2015, Gutiérrez et al., 2014, Lorite et al., 2013,
    Moghaddam et al., 2010). • Farming systems monitoring: Currently, various improved
    systems and devices are used in farming. In this regard, an improved system to
    manage these devices eases the overall operation, and enable automation in faming
    (Kim et al., 2014). Also, such remote monitoring systems help towards enabling
    improved management in large agricultural fields. Further, with the input of additional
    information such as satellite images and weather forecasts, the system performance
    can be improved. • Pest and disease control: Controlled usage of pesticides and
    fertilizers helps increasing the crop quality as well as minimizing the farming
    cost. However, for controlling the usage of pesticides, we need to monitor the
    probability and occurrence of pests in crops. To predict this, we also need the
    surrounding climate information (Matese et al., 2009, Bhave et al., 2013) such
    as temperature, humidity, and wind speed. A WSN can autonomously monitor and predict
    these events over a field of interest (Bhargava et al., 2014). • Controlled use
    of fertilizers: Plant growth and crop quality directly depend on the use of fertilizers.
    However, optimal supply of fertilizers to proper places in fields is a challenging
    task. The use of fertilizers for farming may be controlled by monitoring the variation
    in soil nutritions such as Nitrogen (N), Phosphorous (P), Potassium (K), and pH.
    Consequently, soil nutrition balance may also be achieved, and hence, crop production
    quality is also maintained. Gonçalves et al. (2015) studied the effectiveness
    of mobile nodes to improve agricultural productivity in a smart system with Precision
    Sprays. • Cattle movement monitoring: A herd of cattle grazing a field can be
    monitored using WSN technology or Radio Frequency Identifier (RFID) (Voulodimos
    et al., 2010, Kwong et al., 2012). Thus, real-time monitoring of any cattle is
    also achieved. This technology can be implemented further to monitor whether any
    cattle is moving near the vegetation fields or not. • Ground water quality monitoring:
    The increased use of fertilizers and pesticides lead to decrease in the quality
    of ground water. Placing sensor nodes empowered with wireless communication help
    in monitoring the water quality (Lin et al., 2008, Zia et al., 2013). • Greenhouse
    gases monitoring: Greenhouse gases and agriculture are closely related to each
    other. Greenhouse gases are responsible for increasing the climate temperature,
    and thus, has direct impact on agriculture. On the other hand, greenhouse gas
    emission comes from various agricultural sources. Malaver et al. (2015) presents
    the development of a system of solar powered Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and
    WSN to monitor greenhouse gases – CH4 and CO2. • Asset tracking: Wireless technology
    enabled farming equipments attract the possibility of remote tracking (Misra and
    Singh, 2012) of these assets. A farmer can track the position of the farming vehicles
    and irrigation systems from his home. • Remote control and diagnosis: With the
    advent of internet of things, remote control and diagnosis of farm equipments
    such as pumps, lights, heaters, valves in machinery are also possible (Fukatsu
    et al., 2011, Coates et al., 2013). 3. Design of a wireless sensor network for
    agricultural applications 3.1. Network architecture for agriculture applications
    In this section, we discuss the network architecture considered in various agricultural
    applications. We classify the architectures in various categories and highlight
    the potential agricultural applications suitable for each one. Fig. 3 provides
    a visual depiction of the architectures classified with respect to different parameters.

    Fig. 3. Classification of network architectures with respect to different parameters.
    Based on the movement of the networked devices and nodes, we classify the existing
    architectures in the following categories: • Stationary architecture: In the stationary
    architecture, the sensor nodes are deployed at a fixed position, and during the
    application duration, they do not change their position. Typically, applications
    such as irrigation management system, ground water quality monitoring, and controlling
    the use of fertilizers require stationary architectures. In such applications
    with TWSNs, the data logger (data collector) sensor nodes are typically placed
    over the field. However, in WUSNs, the data collector sensor nodes are placed
    under-ground. Also, as shown in Fig. 2, aggregator nodes may be placed under-ground
    to collect all the data of the underground sensors and communicate with the outside
    TWSNs. • Mobile architecture: Mobile architectures comprise of devices which change
    their position with time. An example of applications based on such architecture
    will be an autonomous network of tractors and cell phone carrying farmers serving
    the purpose of ubiquitous farming operations. • Hybrid architecture: In the hybrid
    architecture, both stationary and mobile nodes are present. For example, this
    type of architecture is applicable to farming applications consisting of stationary
    field sensors, mobile farming equipments, cell phones carrying users, and moving
    cattle. Based on the types of sensor nodes and associated devices, the existing
    architecture used in agriculture are classified as follows: • Homogeneous architecture:
    As the name suggests, homogeneous architecture comprises of sensor equipped devices
    of similar potential. This type of framework is typically used in applications
    based on the unplanned deployments. In such circumstances, the network is deployed
    mainly for in situ monitoring of the desired agricultural parameters. However,
    this type of architecture lacks variety in terms of communication hardware. Consequently,
    the schemes and communication protocols are designed keeping this limitation in
    mind. One example application of this type of architecture is agricultural data
    collection application on the use of pesticides and changing quantity of soil
    nutrients. • Heterogeneous architecture: In this type of architecture, various
    types of sensor nodes, and devices are present. These devices vary in terms of
    computation power, memory, sensing capability, and transceiver units. For example,
    in any irrigation management application, the on-field sensor nodes communicate
    their sensed information to a master or sink node, which again transfer the information
    to remote user. In this case, the sink node is capable of communicating in multiple
    modes—RF and GSM. Another possible application may be the farming systems monitoring
    and agricultural asset tracking. In this application, multiple heterogeneous devices
    are included with on-field sensors. The application model shown in Fig. 1 depicts
    a heterogeneous architecture. In Fig. 1, the field sensor and gateway nodes are
    of different configurations. The architectures are classified into various categories
    based on the hierarchy. • Single-tier architecture: This type of architecture
    is most common among the agricultural applications, specifically small-scale ones.
    In this type of architecture, the on-field devices and sensor nodes directly communicate
    their data to a sink node placed near the application area. This type of architecture
    is also referred to as the single clustered architecture. • Multi-tier architecture:
    In a multi-tier architecture, there are multiple levels in the overall application
    hierarchy. The on-field sensor nodes remain in the lower level of hierarchy, and
    form the basic clusters. Thereafter, the next levels of hierarchy include multiple
    clusters to reach the gateway nodes. Typically, multi-tier architectures consist
    of heterogeneous nodes. Fig. 4 shows a multi-tier architecture with three levels
    of gateways. The basic unit of the network is formed by a cluster comprised of
    sensor nodes and a cluster head, referred to as the 3rd tier gateway in the figure.
    These gateways again form a cluster with the 2nd tier gateways as the cluster
    head, and thus, the hierarchy is followed iteratively until the remote sink is

    of sensor nodes 3.2.1. Embedded multi-chip sensor nodes The components of a typical
    multi-chip sensor node are shown in Fig. 5(a). Typically, a sensor node consists
    of an application-specific sensor array with a transceiver unit for communication.
    A processor or micro-controller unit is used as the “brain” of the node. Optionally,
    a sensor board includes memory units to store data. Depending on the application
    demand, the architecture of the sensor nodes varies to meet the demands. For example,
    the processing power and on-board memory size are increased to meet the requirements
    of more intense or intelligent processing. Download : Download high-res image

    multi-chip vs system-on-chip sensor nodes. In this respect, another important
    technology is System-in-Package (SiP), which is defined as any combination of
    multiple chips including passive components (such as resistors and capacitors)
    mounted together keeping provision to attach external components later. SiP reduces
    the product cost with optimized size and performance. Thus, the SiP technology
    has potential for applications in agricultural scenarios. SiP based agricultural
    systems can be applied in different applications simply by attaching different
    sensors with the main package. In the following, we discuss the associated factors
    in the selection of the components of a sensor node as per the requirement of
    agricultural applications. • Processor: The computation power of the sensor node
    solely depends on the choice of the processing unit. A micro-controller provides
    few advantages such as low cost, flexibility to communicate with other nodes,
    ease of programming, and low power consumption over the traditional processors.
    Mostly, these micro-controllers work on 3.5–5 V. However, power consumption is
    one of the most important factors in sensor nodes. Considering this fact, micro-controllers
    are preferred over general purpose processors. • Transceiver: Transmission and
    reception are the two major reasons of energy consumption in sensor nodes. In
    agricultural applications, the network planner chooses the deployment to ensure
    optimal power consumption of the sensor nodes. • Memory: The sensor nodes have
    two types of on-board memory—memory associated with processor and external memory.
    Depending on the application requirement, sensor nodes need to store historical
    data for intelligent decision making. In this regard, flash memories are used
    for additional storage. • Power: It is also an important factor for selecting
    the sensor nodes, as the battery power of the sensor nodes is limited. In many
    agricultural applications, the nodes possess alternate energy sources such as
    solar power. However, solar power is available during the day time only, and at
    other times, the nodes rely on battery power. Also, frequent change of battery
    increases the cost of maintenance. Thus, we need energy-efficient algorithms such
    that the energy consumption of the sensor nodes are reduced. • Cost: One very
    important selection factor of the sensor nodes is the total hardware cost. A low
    cost application design is always preferred for any application level, and consequently,
    it is the most important issue in terms of applications targeting the low and
    middle income country (LMIC) markets. 3.2.2. System on Chip (SoC) sensor nodes
    The System-on-Chip (SoC) architecture, on the other hand, follows more application
    specific design targeting minimization of the power requirements and design cost.
    SoC provides an integration of multiple programmable processor cores, co-processors,
    hardware accelerators, memory units, input/output units, and custom blocks. Fig.
    5(b) shows the components of a typical SoC based sensor node. The envisioned applications
    for SoC is mainly in designing Network on Chips (NoCs) (Koch et al., 2006), systems
    for multimedia and streaming applications (Karim et al., 2003) which are computationally
    intensive. Currently, in agricultural applications, the use of SoCs are very rare.
    However, the advent of SoC has a lot of potential for the agriculture and farming
    domain. Firstly, the use of SoCs based sensor nodes instead of current day embedded
    multi-chip sensor nodes will increase the computation power, and decrease the
    energy-consumption. Also, the size of the nodes will be less and thereby, portability
    of the overall system increases. Compared to multiple silicon dies in SiP, SoC
    is single die based, and thus, SoCs result in lesser size, but, higher cost. Table
    2 briefly lists the differences between the embedded multi-chip nodes and SoCs.

    we discuss the details of the wireless communication technologies, and the standards
    used in various agricultural applications. Also, we study the different wireless
    sensor nodes available in the market for use in these applications. 4.1. Wireless
    communication • ZigBee: (ZigBee Specifications,, Baronti et al., 2007, Guo et
    al., 2012); technology defines the network and application layer protocols based
    on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard (IEEE Standard for Information technology, 2006)
    physical and MAC layer definitions required for designing a wireless personal
    area network (WPAN) using low power radio-enabled devices. Being energy-efficient,
    low cost, and reliable, the ZigBee technology is preferred for WSN-based applications
    in the agricultural and farming domains. ZigBee also supports short-distance (10–20
    m) data communication over multi-tier, decentralized, ad-hoc and mesh networks.
    The ZigBee-enabled devices have a low-duty cycle, and thus, are suitable for agricultural
    applications such as irrigation management, pesticide and fertilizer control,
    water quality management, where periodic information update is required. However,
    ZigBee applications yield low data rates of only 20–40 kbps and 250 kbps at 868/915
    MHz and 2.4 GHz frequencies of ISM band, respectively. Typically, this standard
    requires low specification hardware (such as microprocessor with 50–60 kb memory)
    and includes security encryption techniques. • WiFi: WiFi is a wireless local
    area network (WLAN) standard for information exchange or connecting to the Internet
    wirelessly based on the IEEE 802.11 standards family (IEEE 802.11, 802.11a/b/g/n)
    (IEEE Standard for Information technology, 2005, IEEE Standard for Information
    technology, 2012a). Currently, it is the most widely used wireless technology
    found in devices ranging from smart phones and tablets to desktops and laptops.
    WiFi provides a decent communication range in the order of 20 m (indoor) to 100
    m (outdoor) with data transmission rate in the order of 2–54 Mbps at 2.4 GHz frequency
    of ISM band. In agricultural applications, WiFi broadens the use of heterogeneous
    architectures connecting multiple type of devices over an ad-hoc network. • Bluetooth:
    Bluetooth (IEEE Standard for Information technology, 2012b, Bluetooth Technology
    Special Interest Group,), which is based on the IEEE 802.15.1 standard, is a low
    power, low cost wireless technology used for communication between portable devices
    and desktops over a short range (8–10 m). The Bluetooth standard defines a personal
    area network (PAN) communication using the 2.4 GHz frequency of the ISM band.
    The data rate achieved in various versions of the Bluetooth ranges from 1 to 24
    Mbps. The advantages of this technology are its ubiquitous nature, and therefore,
    it is suitable for use in multi-tier agricultural applications. The ultra low
    power, low cost version of this standard is named as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
    (Xhafa and Ho, 2013, Xhafa and Ho, 2015, Linde and Tucker, 2013), which was initially
    introduced by Nokia in 2006 as Wibree (Nokia, 2006). However, in 2010, BLE was
    merged with main Bluetooth standard version 4.0. BLE also uses the 2.4 GHz ISM
    frequency band with adaptive frequency hopping to reduce interference. Also, BLE
    includes 24 bit CRC and AES 128 bit encryption technique on all packets to guarantee
    robustness and authentication. BLE topology supports one-to-one as well as one-to-many
    connections between devices. • GPRS/3G/4G: GPRS (General Packet Radio Service)
    is a packet data service for GSM based cellular phones. A data rate of 50–100
    kbps is achieved in the 2G systems. However, in GPRS, throughput and delay are
    variable, and they depend on the number of other users sharing the same resource.
    Although the biggest advantage that GPRS brings is in relieving the range limitation
    of wireless devices. Any two devices can communicate provided they both are in
    the GSM service area. However, it is better suited for the periodic monitoring
    applications than to the real-time tracking-type applications. The advanced version
    of GPRS is Enhanced Data rates for Global Evolution (EDGE), which offers increased
    data rate with no hardware/software changes in the GSM core networks. 3G (Goodman
    and Myers, 2005) and 4G (Parkvall et al., 2008) are the third and fourth generations
    of mobile communication technology. The corresponding data transfer rate achieved
    in these technologies are 200 kbps and 100 Mbps to 1 Gbps in 3G and 4G, respectively.
    • WiMAX: WiMAX is the acronym for Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access,
    a wireless communication standard referring to the inter-operable implementations
    of the IEEE 802.16 standards (IEEE Standard for Local and metropolitan area networks,
    2011) family. WiMAX is targeted to achieve 0.4–1 Gbps data rate on fixed stations,
    and the maximum transmission range using this technology is 50 km. The Mobile
    WiMAX (IEEE 802.16e standard) provides data rates in the order of 50–100 Mbps.
    Also, WiMAX is stated to be energy-efficient over the pre-4G Long-Term Evaluation
    (LTE) and Evolved High-Speed Packet Access (HSPA+) (Deruyck et al., 2010, Louta
    et al., 2014). The long range support together with high speed communication features
    place WiMAX as the best suitable technology for agricultural applications involving
    asset monitoring such as farming system monitoring, crop-area border monitoring,
    and real-time diagnostics such as remote controlling of water pumps, lights, gates,
    remote diagnosis of farming systems. In Table 3, we compare the different communication
    technologies with respect to various parameters. We also mention the suitable
    agricultural applications of each technology. Table 3. Comparison of different
    communication technologies. Parameter ZigBee WiFi Bluetooth GPRS/3G/4G WiMAX Standard

    sensor platforms for use in the agricultural domain (ur Rehman et al., 2014).
    In Table 4, we analyze the existing wireless sensor nodes by classifying them
    according to different features and parameters. Table 4. Comparison of the existing

    the various application specific sensors which empower the wireless sensing platforms.
    For better classification, we divide these sensors in three main categories—soil,
    environment, and plant related. 4.3.1. Soil related In Table 5, we compare the
    sensors along with different soil-related measurement parameters—suitable for
    different potential agricultural applications. Table 5. Comparison of different

    sensors specific to the measurement of environmental parameters. Table 6. Comparison

    part of modern farming applications. The potential applications include controlled
    use of fertilizer, crop quality monitoring, pest control, and cattle movement
    monitoring. The plant related agricultural sensors are listed in Table 7. Table

    real-world applications In Section 5.1, we discuss the different categories of
    agricultural applications in detail, and also, bring on the real-world counterpart
    of the same application deployment as a case study. These applications are designed
    with both the TWSNs and the WUSNs. Also, we mention the developments in the Indian
    scenarios in Section 5.2. Although, the number of such developments is very small
    compared to the global scenario. In Section 5.3, we analyze the challenges, problems,
    and prospects of the existing solutions both in the global as well as the Indian
    scenarios. 5.1. Global scenario 5.1.1. Irrigation management The recent years
    have witnessed an upsurge in the deployment of WSNs, specifically in the irrigation
    management applications (Gutiérrez et al., 2014, Kim et al., 2011, Kim et al.,
    2009, Kim et al., 2008, Moghaddam et al., 2010, Erdem et al., 2010, Kim and Evans,
    2009, Pierce and Elliott, 2008, Vellidis et al., 2008, Nemali and Iersel, 2006).
    This is mainly because of the importance of water in crop production (Postel,
    1999, Bouwer, 2000, Saleth and Dinar, 2000, Jury and, 2007, Falloon and Betts,
    2010, Mueller et al., 2012). In the following, we survey two such deployments
    as case studies. Case Study—San Jose del Cabo, Baja California Sur (BCS), Mexico:
    Gutiérrez et al. (2014) described the development and deployment of an automated
    irrigation system comprising of a distributed WSN, a gateway, and remote server.
    The project was dedicated to implement a WSN system capable of reducing water
    use. The WSN consists of soil moisture and temperature sensors buried in ground
    for taking measurement in different depths. The gateway node has on-board facilities
    supporting both ZigBee (IEEE Standard for Information technology, 2006, Baronti
    et al., 2007, Guo et al., 2012) and GPRS communications. It is also empowered
    with intelligent decision making such as automated irrigation activation based
    on soil moisture and temperature values exceeding a certain predefined threshold
    value. The remote server is used for storing all the information, and displaying
    the information in a graphical user interface (GUI). The advantage of this application
    design is its real-time data analysis feature. The system components are explained
    in the following: • Wireless Sensor Units (WSUs): Each WSU, deployed on-field,
    has four different type of components—application specific sensors, processing
    unit, radio transceiver, and battery power. Table 8 lists the details of each
    of the components (sensors and actuator devices) used in reference (Gutiérrez
    et al., 2014). For energy saving, the micro-controller often remains in the sleep
    mode. A solar panel is attached with each of the WSUs to recharge their batteries.

    • Wireless Information Unit (WIU): The WIU acts as the master node, and collects
    information from the WSUs using the ZigBee technology. All the information received
    about soil moisture and temperature are compared with a predefined threshold values,
    and consequently, the pumps are activated for an estimated period. The received
    information and irrigation related data are saved in the attached solid state
    memory, and are transmitted to the remote server via GPRS using the Hypertext
    Transfer Protocol (HTTP). The pumps are driven by two electronic relays of 40-A,
    12 V DC. The WIU can be commanded to changed the irrigation scheduling from the
    remote server, and is also equipped with a button to perform manual irrigation.
    Four different irrigation actions (IAs) are considered—manual irrigation, predefined
    irrigation, and automated irrigation with soil moisture of at least one sensor
    dropping below threshold, and automated irrigation with soil temperature of at
    least one sensor exceeding past the threshold. • Remote web server: The server
    shows a specific GUI, which visualizes the data from each WSU, total water consumption,
    and IA type. The web application also enables the user with direct programming
    facility of the scheduled irrigation schemes, and changing the threshold values
    based on the crop type and season. Case Study—Smart Sensor Web: The Smart Sensor
    Web (SSW) system proposed by Moghaddam et al. (2010) introduces a new technology
    for smart sensor web system measuring the surface-to-depth soil moisture profile
    of on-field sensors. The University of Michigan Matthaei Botanical Gardens in
    Ann Arbor, Michigan was chosen as the deployment region of the on-field sensors.
    The in situ sensors were deployed to model the spatio-temporal variations in soil
    moisture serving the future goal of enabling satellite observation of soil moisture.
    To minimize the overall cost and energy conservation, the authors plan to sparsely
    sample the sensor data. The Sensor Web, is guided by the intelligence of a control
    system envisioned to determine an optimal sensor selection strategy to decide
    sensor configurations over time, and an estimation strategy based on the information
    of 3-dimensional soil moisture values. The problem of finding an optimal strategy
    and estimating a parameter are modelled using Partially Observed Markov Decision
    Process (POMDP) (Lovejoy, 1991). In a real deployment, multiple actuator nodes
    are placed with multiple sensors placed at different depths. One central coordinator
    node is deployed to schedule the data transmission events of the actuators. Upon
    receiving the readings from the in situ actuators, the central coordinator estimates
    the spatial variation of soil moisture. Then, the coordinator decides the time
    schedule of future measurements. In this manner, the coordinator node leverages
    the spatio-temporal correlation of soil moisture, and optimally estimates with
    reduced number of measurements. The system description is presented in the following.
    • Ripple 1 system: The on-field sensor nodes, deployed at fixed locations, are
    equipped with 3–5 soil moisture probes. Communication between the nodes is done
    using the ZigBee technology built on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. The nodes are
    classified into three categories—coordinator, router, and end devices. The specific
    node level parameters and sensors are listed in Table 9. The sensor nodes are
    powered with on-board batteries, and solar panels are also installed to recharge
    them. The coordinate node is attached to the base station computer. Table 9. Deployment

    The 3G network card is installed on the base station. The server saves all the
    information, and any home/mobile user is able to visualize the information in
    real-time, thereby integrating the whole system from the in situ sensors to the
    remote user. Case Study—Alfalfa Crop Irrigation Cut-off System: Saha et al. (2011)
    presented a automatic irrigation cut-off system targeted for eliminating tail
    water drainage in alfalfa crop. The work is based on Yolo silt loam soil on the
    UC Davis campus, California, USA, where alfalfa is the largest water consuming
    crop. Earlier, the flood-irrigation method was used for this crop. However, the
    water runoff reduces the efficiency of this method. Motivated by this problem,
    Saha et al. designed a wireless sensor based system which provides the irrigation
    information from the tail-end of the field. The realization of the system is done
    by applying a water advance model to the field deployment of wetting-front sensors
    couple with cellular communication. The irrigator farmer receives a SMS notifying
    the time to shutdown the irrigation system. Fig. 6 depicts the application scenario
    showing the deployment. In the deployment area, 4 out of 48 alfalfa checks are
    selected for the experiment. Each check is of dimensions 220 m × 15 m with a slope
    of 0.01%. Wetting-front sensing system was placed at the tail-end of the field.

    in alfalfa crop (Saha et al., 2011). The system is very useful for a large-scale
    field with vast area for irrigation. Case Study—AMI Turf Irrigation System (Aqua
    Management): This turf irrigation controller system designed by Aqua Management,
    Inc. is targeted for the turf irrigation industry to solve the problem of providing
    efficient water management solutions at an affordable price. It is a cloud-based
    control system, which considers various on-field parameters such as Evapotranspiration
    (ET), weather condition, water flow and leak. The application control can be accessed
    from any computer, tablet, or smartphone. The features of this system are cataloged
    in Table 10. The automated decision making framework relies on the following components
    – local weather value, local ET values from public/private systems, and soil moisture
    sensors. Alternatively, the AMI data logger (AMI LoggerTM) can also be used to
    automate irrigation. The AMI Q collects all data from the on-field sensors and
    flow meters, and upload the information to the cloud. Table 10. Features: AMI

    is based on the actual volume of water, rather than time. Based on the weather
    condition, irrigation can be stopped or started. The water management facility
    includes reporting of various analytics such as water budgeting on a daily, weekly,
    monthly, or annual basis. 5.1.2. Vineyard monitoring Applying pervasive and mobile
    computing technologies in vineyard monitoring to increase the quality of production
    and reduce the production cost and the effect of crop related diseases. We review
    one of the existing works (Burrell et al., 2004) as a case study. Case Study—Vineyard
    Production Monitoring (Díaz et al., 2011): Díaz et al. (2011) presented a design
    of a precision agricultural system for vineyard production monitoring. The deployment
    of WSNs help in estimate the variability in agricultural parameters throughout
    the field. Initially, in the first phase, the authors divide the subject terrain
    into few different zones (zone A, B, C) based on geographic, weather, and soil
    maps. In the network planning phase, the most suitable architecture is chosen
    based on the application requirement. The subject area dimension was 600 m × 450
    m, and different sensors were placed in different zones. For example, the authors
    assumed that zone C has temperature, humidity, soil moisture, luminosity, and
    pH level sensors deployed. In zones A and B, the environmental temperature, humidity
    and temperature, and luminosity sensors were deployed, respectively. The sensor
    nodes are assumed to have an transmission range of 75–100 m. The nodes in different
    zones form a virtual tree structure among themselves, and the sensed information
    reaches the gateway following a multi-hop path. The detailed deployment parameters
    are presented in Table 11. Table 11. Deployment parameters: Díaz et al. (2011).

    in the design—sensor, actuator, redundant nodes, and a gateway. The sensors can
    only collect data samples, and information is routed to gateway. The actuator
    nodes have provision for driving irrigation systems. The actuators can also respond
    to the given commands about scheduling irrigation. The redundant nodes, as the
    name suggests, help in information routing, and imitate the functionalities of
    faulty nodes. The gateway acts as the bridge between the in situ network and the
    base station. Information routing is done to select the best neighbor node. The
    routing scheme can also be executed in an energy conserving manner, and in such
    a condition, the diagonally placed nodes are not selected for the next hop. 5.1.3.
    Precision farming Precision farming is targeted to generate greater productivity
    with reduced costs. Wireless ad-hoc and sensor networks are utilized in precision
    farming to gather field data which can then be analyzed to find the best farming
    conditions. Case Study—Video Sensing in Precision Agriculture (Cambra et al.,
    2015): Cambra et al. proposed video sensing for controlling fertilizer use in
    agricultural field. Their work is motivated by the objective of maintaining energy-efficiency
    with reduction of fertilizers in productions as defined Common Agricultural Policy
    (CAP) 2014/2020.1 In this work, the AR drones are utilized to capture the video
    of the field. Based on the video input, a system identifies and geopositions the
    weeds present in the field. Finally, the fertilizer sprayer system is actuated
    based on the processed localized information of weeds in fields. In Fig. 7, we
    depict the system overview showing the interaction between the AR drones, the
    central system, and the fertilizer sprays. The AR drones maps the field area in
    2D/3D drag and drop waypoint maps. Here, the monitored field area was 17 m by
    15 m. These drones form ad-hoc network among themselves and the central system.
    In this work, Optimized Link State Routing Protocol (OLSR) is applied to route
    the information from the field drones to the central system in real-time. Also,
    the drones and other devices are attached with on-board GPS, which enables updating
    the flight map and calculating the distance between the devices. Download : Download

    frames received from the flying drones are processed and geo-referenced in the
    central system. OpenCV2 based platform is used to recognize the weeds in the field.
    In the image processing framework, the authors consider Multilayer Perceptron
    learning algorithm (Bradski and Kaehler, 2008) with the green and brown color
    lines which are seen in maize crops. Finally, the locations of the weeds in the
    field are transmitted to the fertilizer sprayers, which precisely apply fertilizers
    to the weeds. Thus, using this framework, the overall production efficiency enhances
    while keeping the fertilizer use at lower levels. 5.2. Indian scenario 5.2.1.
    Water management Case Study—Project COMMON-Sense Net (Project Common Sense Net
    2.0,, Panchard et al., 2007): The COMMON-Sense Net project was a collaboration
    project with partners EPFL, Zurich (http://www.epfl.ch/) and the Centre for Electronic
    Design and Technology (CEDT) at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) (http://www.cedt.iisc.ernet.in/).
    The goal of this project was to develop emerging technologies suitable for developing
    countries. The region of interest was chosen at Chennakeshavapura (CKPura) in
    the Tumkur district, Karnataka, India. To focus on the specific problems of the
    chosen region, the targeted goal was to predict and mitigate the effect of adverse
    environmental changes (Panchard, 2008). The actual deployment consists of 9 on-field
    and 3 backward nodes measuring soil moisture at two different depths of 150 cm
    and 30 cm. These nodes transmit their data to the base station every 15 min. The
    base station then transmits the data to the remote server over a GPRS link. In
    addition to soil moisture, environmental data such as ambient temperature and
    relative humidity, were also collected. The design of a water management system
    for deficit irrigation includes the following (Panchard et al., 2006, Prabhakar
    et al., 2007): • Calibration: First, the soil moisture probes are calibrated using
    the standard gravimetric method (Reynolds, 1970, Schmugge et al., 1980, Dobriyal
    et al., 2012, Lekshmi et al., 2014). In the next normal mode, calibration is continued
    using a feedback loop based on the difference in measured and predicted values.
    • Alert: Nodes are programmed to issue an alert whenever soil moisture reaches
    a certain value. The sensed data and historical climate data, together, help in
    predicting the change of rain in future. • Soil moisture prediction: Real-time
    prediction of soil moisture is done using a learning method over the predicted
    and measured data. • Water requirements assessment: The system is also able to
    estimate the amount of water needed for irrigation at that specific conditions.
    The design parameters related to the COMMON-Sense Net project are listed in Table

    at IIT Kharagpur, India: Recently, IIT Kharapur started working on development
    of low-cost irrigation management system targeted for India. The lab-scale deployment
    of sensor network was carried out inside IIT Kharagpur campus, a place in the
    Kangsabati basin. In this project, four Ko Pro wireless sensor nodes were deployed
    over an area of 1440 m2. Fig. 8 shows the real deployment in the lab-scale facility.
    Each on-field node embeds four EC-5 soil moisture sensors. In addition to the
    on-field nodes, another gateway node was placed in the vicinity of the field to
    receive all the on-field soil moisture data at an interval of 15 min. The gateway
    node is programmed to run Crossbow’s XServe network management operations, and
    provides web services for remote viewing of data and network health. The gateway
    node also estimates the irrigation requirement of the field, and sends a SMS to
    the farmer informing this. The system has provision to control the number and
    recipient of SMS. Download : Download high-res image (765KB) Download : Download

    nodes in IIT Kharagpur lab facility. The different procedural components are described
    below. • Calibration: The soil moisture sensors are first calibrated using the
    standard gravimetric method. • Irrigation requirements assessment: The on-field
    system calculates the amount of water needed for irrigation at that specific conditions.
    This estimation also depends on the duration between the last SMS update and current
    time. • Update to farmer: Nodes are programmed to send SMS to the farmers with
    preprogrammed time and recipient phone number. The design parameters are listed

    Case Study—Vineyards Precision Farming: One of the widely cultivated crops in
    India is the grapes. Precision farming is applied in this field to reduce the
    production cost and reach a high turnover. Also, the use of precision farming
    is justified by the economic value of grapes. Precision farming in vineyards has
    to deal with three main issues—optimal water use, disease prediction, and controlled
    use of pesticides. In this regard, the soil and environment related parameters
    such as soil moisture, ambient temperature, leaf wetness, relative humidity are
    most important parameters for measurement. Soil moisture is the controlling factor
    for the crop production, size and quality of grapes. The quality of grapes and
    the wine produced from them depend on their size. The area of deployment, i.e.,
    the Sula vineyards, Nashik, India, is limited in terms of water resources. Another
    problem in grapes is the use of pesticides to control diseases such as Downey
    mildew, Powdery mildew, Anthracnose (NRCG, 2007). Consequently, the overall cost
    increases, and the crop quality degrades due to the use of harmful chemicals.
    However, there is another way to reduce the use of pesticides—by predicting the
    disease. For this purpose, it is needed to integrate the measurement of leaf surface
    wetness and duration with the existing system of sensors. Motivated by the above
    issues, Shah et al. (2009) designed a precision agriculture framework in the Sula
    vineyards at Nashik, Maharashtra, India. Initially, the lab-based small-scale
    setup was tested in a greenhouse at IIT Bombay, India with dimensions of 6 m   9
    m. On the other hand, the large-scale deployment at the Sula vineyards consists
    of wireless sensor nodes equipped with soil moisture, ambient temperature, relative
    humidity, and leaf wetness sensors. Table 14 lists the various system parameters
    considered in this project. Based on the on-field sensor data, the Evapotranspiration
    (ET) and Infection Index were computed. Table 14. Deployment parameters: Sula

    5.2.3. Crop disease risk evaluation Crop diseases are the root causes of production
    and revenue losses. The prediction of crop disease, and taking countermeasures
    to help farmers ensure sustained revenue generation. Case Study—Sula vineyards
    (Das et al., 2009): Das et al. (2009) studied the forecasting of grapevine Downy
    Mildew disease (Francesca et al., 2006, Caffarra et al., 2012), one of the most
    common and important fungal diseases in grapes (Madden and Hughes, 1995, Rossi
    et al., 2010), by deploying a WSN powered with various agro-meteorological sensors.
    The Downy Mildew disease in grapes is caused by the Plasmapora Viticola virus,
    which is a weather-related disease. The prediction of such a disease benefits
    the grapevine industry tremendously—increased revenue with quality enriched food
    and beverage products. The deployed motes are equipped with ambient temperature,
    relative humidity, and leaf wetness duration (LWD) sensors. Two different existing
    models, i.e., the Logistic and Beta models, are adopted in the work (Das et al.,
    2009). The study was performed for over five months at the Sula Vineyards, Nashik,
    Maharashtra, India. Following the collected data, the “Infection Index” was computed
    in real-time using both the Logistic and Beta models. Case Study—AgriSense (Tripathy
    et al., 2013a, Tripathy et al., 2013b): The AgriSense distributed system comprises
    of wireless sensor nodes with environmental and soil-specific sensors – ambient
    temperature, relative humidity, leaf wetness, and soil moisture. The actual test-bed
    was chosen as one semi-arid tropic region located at the Agriculture Research
    Institute (ARI) of the ANGR Agricultural University, Hyderabad. The target mission
    was to predict the Bud Necrosis Virus (BNV) disease of groundnut crop. Experiments
    were executed using different settings of protected and weather-based protection
    plots with different dates of sowing treatments on three different replicas. The
    on-field deployment comprises of five MICAz motes with 25 m communication range,
    transmitting at an interval of 15 min. These nodes communicate among themselves
    using the ZigBee (IEEE 802.15.4) protocol at the 2.4 GHz RF ISM band. One gateway
    node sends the collected data to a remote server using GPRS communication. The
    remote server converts the raw sensor data to a usable format and saves it in
    its database for displaying through the graphical user interface (GUI). Based
    on the data of soil and environmental parameters, various data mining models such
    as Expectation Maximization (EM), and Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB) classifier were
    used to predict the pest/disease dynamics. The schematic view of the real-time
    decision support system (DSS) is illustrated in Fig. 9. Download : Download high-res

    real-time decision support system (DSS) used in AgriSense (Tripathy et al., 2013a,

    The existing solutions invent smarter applications for solving multiple challenges
    existing in the agricultural domain. We discuss the prospects of these application
    in the following. However, there remains scope to further improve the solutions.
    We list few points to improve the existing innovations. • Cost-effective solutions
    for LMICs are required: The existing research and development efforts are targeted
    at the reduction of hardware and software costs, while maximizing the system output.
    The overall system cost increases due to the use of foreign imported devices to
    build the systems. However, for applications in LMICs, we need to reduce the system
    cost further. Thus, the challenge exist in bringing down the cost further. • Scalability
    of the deployments need to be tested: For LMICs, we need planned and scaled-up
    deployment of such agricultural systems. In this way, the average system cost
    can be reduced down keeping the performance intact. Also, with increased scalability,
    we need to have design. For a large scale deployment, hierarchical architecture
    would perform better than the flat single-tier network architecture, as discussed
    in Section 3.1. For example, in Gutiérrez et al., 2014, Moghaddam et al., 2010,
    the on-field WSN deployment in a specific area mostly follows the two-tier hierarchical
    network architecture with WSUs as end devices and WIUs as the gateway. This type
    of network architecture can be scaled up by replicating to multiple fields. In
    this setting, to increase the number of WSUs over a large deployment area, we
    have to place multiple WIU to provide connectivity to all the WSUs. • Fault tolerance:
    Fault tolerance is a necessary feature of wireless sensor networks for achieving
    precision agriculture. Different types of faults (Baljak et al., 2012) that may
    occur in a WSN based precision agriculture system are – node failure due to depleted
    battery or any other reason, sensor hardware faults generating erroneous value,
    faulty sensor calibration, communication failure. In the existing literature,
    Gutiérrez et al. (2014) presented an irrigation management system which is fault
    tolerant to nodes (WSUs) and communication failure. In case of any fault, the
    system follows the default irrigation schedule. To reduce the chances of node
    failure due to energy depletion, (Gutiérrez et al., 2014, Díaz et al., 2011, Shah
    et al., 2009) have used solar powered nodes. Also, the topology management and
    data aggregation schemes should be fault tolerant in a large scale deployment.
    • Energy management and energy harvesting: Energy management is an important issue
    in any WSN-based system. System components and algorithms should be designed keeping
    this issue in mind. Alternatively, the potential energy harvesting solutions such
    as solar power (Everlast Simjee and Chou, 2008), wind power (AmbiMax Park and
    Chou, 2006), biomass, and vibration should also be considered while designing
    WSN based precision agriculture systems. Among the existing works, solar powered
    WSNs (Gutiérrez et al., 2014, Díaz et al., 2011, Shah et al., 2009) are already
    in use. Therefore, the future works have scope of working on these non-conventional
    resource based WSNs. • Simplification of the existing solutions are needed: The
    end-user of most of the targeted agricultural applications are the farmers. Thus,
    the designed platforms and solutions are envisioned to be simplified in terms
    of usability. In this regard, the human–computer interaction issues such as accessibility
    and usability are required to be taken care of. • The present works may further
    be improved for different climatic conditions, crop and soil types: Most of the
    existing developments does not takes care of the real-time climate parameters.
    However, to enable precision, integration of the environmental parameters are
    necessary. 6. Future work direction There are many potential applications of WSNs
    in the agriculture and farming area. The current state-of-the-art includes most
    works on irrigation management, vineyard production monitoring, and crop disease
    prediction. 6.1. Factors for improvement The factors associated with WSNs that
    need further attention in the future are listed as follows. • Cost: A low cost
    solution is always desirable for increasing the scope and outreach of the applications.
    • Autonomous operation: The future solutions should include the provision for
    autonomous operations surviving for long time. • Intelligence: An inherent intelligence,
    which will enable the futuristic solutions to react dynamically to multiple challenges
    – from conserving energy to real-time response. • Portability: For easy of application,
    portability of the system is essential. Recent advances in embedded systems, such
    as System in package (SiP) and System on Chip (SoC) technologies will help in
    this regard. • Low maintenance: It is essential to design a system which require
    minimum maintenance effort. This will certainly minimize the average cost in the
    long run. • Energy-efficiency: To ensure extended lifetime with autonomous operation,
    the solutions need to be more energy-efficient by incorporating intelligent algorithms.
    • Robust architecture: A robust and fault-tolerant architecture for the emerging
    applications is required to ensure sustained operation. • Ease of operation: Typically,
    the end users of these applications are non-technical persons. Therefore, these
    applications need to be simple and easy to use. • Interoperability: Interoperability
    between different components and different communication technologies will enhance
    the overall functionality of the system. In addition to the global challenges,
    there are specific problems in Indian scenarios with respect to the agricultural
    WSN systems. We list few India specific challenges in the following. • Cost: The
    high cost of the sensors and associated systems is the major deterrent for these
    applications in the LMICs. • Variable climate & soil: The most challenging part
    in designing a WSN-based system for agriculture for India is the different temperature
    and soil types throughout the country. The application parameters are required
    to be tuned such as to function properly at different locations. • Segmented land
    structure: Unlike the USA, India has partitioned farming land, a specific challenge
    which demands suitable deployment architecture for WSN-based agricultural applications
    like irrigation management. • Average farmer requirement: In India, the average
    land holding per farmer is also lower than global scenario. Due to this, smaller
    and personalized systems are in demand. • Overall plan: An overall planning, considering
    the segmented land structure and farmer requirement, is required for attaining
    success in bringing automation in agriculture and farming domain. 6.2. Futuristic
    applications In recent times, with the advent of the new technical concepts such
    as sensor-cloud technology, big-data analytics, Internet of Things (IoT), new
    applications are envisioned. We briefly describe such concepts, and enlist a few
    potential futuristic applications in the following. • Sensor-cloud computing:
    sensor-cloud computing refers to the on-field WSN applications empowered with
    cloud computing (Ojha et al., 2014, Alamri et al., 2013, Zhu et al., 2014). This
    integrated framework benefits the WSNs with improved processing power and storage
    capacity. Furthermore, sensor-cloud improves the data management and access control
    while increasing the resource utilization. Few potential application for the agricultural
    domain are, – A cloud-enabled storage of spatial variation of soil and environmental
    profile with respect to different seasons is need to be developed. – Crop health
    monitoring and yield prediction using mobile sensor-cloud services. – Designing
    a sensor-cloud controlled smart irrigation system for large fields. – To design
    a sensor-cloud operated environment control system for off-season production of
    vegetables and flowers in greenhouse farming. • Big-data analytics: Big-data analytics
    techniques are applied to find meaningful insight from large volume of data with
    various data types (Kim et al., 2014, Nabrzyski et al., 2014). Big-data analytics
    based techniques are helpful for finding hidden correlations, unknown patterns,
    business trends, customer preferences, detecting crimes and disasters, etc. We
    list few big-data application for the agricultural domain as, – Building crop
    growth and disease management models based on farm data. – Designing a web-enabled
    analytics service for the farmers to provide improved information on agriculture.
    – Easy farming equipment control system for large-scale agriculture field. – Decision
    support service to improve crop productivity with optimal cost considering a large-scale
    contextual agricultural and climatic information. – Optimal policy determination
    based on data analytics for government and industries. • Internet of things: IoT
    extends the ubiquitous computing concepts with heterogeneous smart devices or
    ‘things’ integrated with interoperable communication technologies (Atzori et al.,
    2010, Gubbi et al., 2013, Morais et al., 2008, Ye et al., 2013, Al-Fuqaha et al.,
    2015). The IoT paradigm defines ‘things’ which are capable of identifying, communicating
    and interacting with their surrounding. Empowered by these pillars, IoT provides
    flexible control mechanism for on-field parameters in real-time. Due to this,
    IoT is a potential solution for various agricultural applications. Few potential
    IoT-based agricultural applications are, – Cost-effective agricultural supply
    chain management using RFID tags. – Remote monitoring of animal movement in open
    pastures. – Automated pest counting and remote reporting in farms. – Remote control
    and scheduling of pesticide sprays at an user-defined rate and time. – Leak detection
    and remote water flow control in large-scale agricultural field water supply.
    7. Conclusion The inclusion of WSNs is envisioned to be useful for advancing the
    agricultural and farming industries by introducing new dimensions. In this survey,
    we present a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art in WSN deployment for
    advanced agricultural applications. First, we introduced the variants of WSNs—the
    terrestrial WSNs and underground WSNs. Then, we highlighted various applications
    of WSNs, and their potential to solve various farming problems. The consecutive
    sections of this paper presented the network and node architectures of WSNs, the
    associated factors, and classification according to different applications. We
    review the various available wireless sensor nodes, and the different communication
    techniques followed by these nodes. Then, using case studies, we discussed the
    existing WSN deployments for different farming applications, globally and in India.
    Finally, we presented the prospects and problems associated with the existing
    applications. Finally, we listed several directions for future research with associated
    factors for improvement. The survey of the existing works directs us in concluding
    few remarks. The current state-of-the-art offers WSN-based solutions for irrigation
    management, crop disease prediction, vineyard precision farming mostly. Simplified,
    low cost, and scalable systems are in demand, specifically for the LMICs. At the
    same time, with the advent of modern technologies, there exist a lot of scope
    for innovating new and efficient systems. Specifically, low cost solution with
    features like autonomous operation, low maintenance is in demand. Overall, futuristic
    pre-planning is required for the success of these applications specifically to
    overcome the problems in global as well as LMICs. Acknowledgement This work is

    \ \nsecurity, lack of supporting infrastructure and technical skill requirement.\
    \ \nComplexity in the software has to be rectified in order to support the IoT\
    \ \nnetwork. Therefore software must be developed as user-friendly for \nimproving\
    \ the farming, production and quality of the crop. Security is the \nmajor threat\
    \ in the IoT applications. Security has to be enhanced through \nproper access\
    \ control, data confidentiality and user authentication. \nTechnical skill is\
    \ required for farming to enhance the organizational \nabilities and to perform\
    \ the farming functions, solving problems and more. \nProper supporting infrastructure\
    \ can be developed with proper internet \navailability and connectivity. Some\
    \ of the opportunities were taken for \nreviewing the applications of internet\

    \ factors influencing the productivity in \neach stage like cultivation, harvesting\
    \ and storage of post \nharvesting. The Internet of Things (IoT) is referred as\
    \ the \nnetwork of network typically associated with large \nnumber of sensors\
    \ connected through information and \ncommunication infrastructure to provide\
    \ the value added \nservices. It is one of the hot concepts emerged since the\
    \ \n1960s. It is referred as one of the hard-core technologies \nof the IT industry\
    \ of the new generation (Cai, 2012). The \nultimate aim of this IoT is to create\
    \ the better world for \nhuman species, where the objects around us understand\
    \ \nthe comments and hence act accordingly without any \ninstructions explicitly.\
    \ IoT is highly on the rise and it has \nbeen observed to control areas and bring\
    \ them \ncompletely under its influence. It has the tendency to \nobtain powerful\
    \ computing tools via cloud computing. It \nis pointed as an intelligent technology\
    \ which includes \nsensing, identification and intelligence. It can be used in\
    \ \npattern identification areas like sensing, collection and \nprocessing of\
    \ the information and communication. \nControlling of all these operations has\
    \ attained through \nremote smart devices connected to the internet. Further \n\
    the whole operations will be performed by means of \ninterfacing sensors, Zigbee\
    \ modules or Wi-Fi, camera \nwith micro-controller and raspberry pi (Devi and\
    \ \nMeenakumari, 2013). In this effect, microcontrollers, \nmicroprocessors, actuators\
    \ and sensors are some of the \nphysical devices which directly communicate with\
    \ the \ninternet. They work by using the gateway of IoT. This \nentire infrastructure\
    \ is called as the infrastructure of IoT. \nThe smart farm embedded with the systems\
    \ of IoT is \ncalled as the connected farm as it could support the \ndevices in\
    \ a wide range from diverse device \nmanufacturers of agricultural field. In this\
    \ sense, the \nconnected farms can provide more services of intelligent \nagriculture\
    \ based on shared knowledge of the expert. At \nlast, the IoT impact has given\
    \ good results and it plays \nan efficient role to extend into latest technologies\
    \ like \ngrid and cloud computing in many different sectors. \nFinally, this paper\
    \ also aims to investigate some \nchallenges and opportunities associated with\
    \ the IoT \napplication in the agricultural field.  \nReview of Literature \n\
    Usage of IoT in Various Agricultural Applications \nSensing of crop (Water, Moisture\
    \ and Temperature) \nA study done by Bangera et al. (2016) examined the \nIoT\
    \ based smart village. In smart farming, the content of \nmoisture in the soil\
    \ acts as the major factor to determine \nthe growth of the plant. Soil moisture\
    \ sensor is resistive \nsensor used to change the soil resistance between two\
    \ \nprobes that depends on content of water. Apart from \nthese, temperature and\
    \ humidity is one of the main \nenvironmental parameters worked with the climatic\
    \ \nchange, topography, types of soil and vegetation   \n(Dursun and Ozden, 2011).\
    \ Crop planting time, tile ring \ngrowth and winter safety are some of the processes\
    \ \nwhich are closely related to the soil temperature. In this \nway, the temperature\
    \ sensor has given the specific idea \nabout the coolness and heat content variation\
    \ in the soil. \nSensor based automated irrigation system with IoT has \nbeen\
    \ analyzed by Kansara et al. (2015). The temperature \nand humidity sensor senses\
    \ the changes in temperature \nand humidity and it also has the tendency to give\
    \ an \ninterrupt signal to the micro-controller devices. A low \ncost internet\
    \ of things network for contamination \ndetection in drinking water systems using\
    \ raspberry pi \nwas analyzed by Anam and Devender (2015). The \ntemperature of\
    \ water can be measured by the water \nsensor when dipped into the water.  \n\
    Kumar and Ravi (2016) studied about the automation \nof irrigation system based\
    \ on Wi-Fi technology and IoT. \nThe soil moisture sensor and temperature sensor\
    \ has \nplayed an important role in developing an automation to \nsupply water\
    \ for irrigation system and home gardening \nin fields of farming. Cloud IoT based\
    \ system of \ngreenhouse monitoring has been investigated by   \nKeerthi and Kodandaramaiah\
    \ (2015). Temperature, light, \nrelative humidity and soil moisture sensor have\
    \ \nintegrated to demonstrate the greenhouse monitoring \nsystem. Crop sensing\
    \ has been done accurately by using \nthe IoT and this has further created the\
    \ positive impact \non the agricultural field.  \nManaging and Controlling (Use\
    \ of RFID) \nA study done by Kang et al. (2015) examined an \neffect of IoT based\
    \ electronic sow feeder on productivity \nof swine farms. Radio Frequency Identification\
    \ (RFID) \nis commercial technology in the system of IoT. This \ntechnology has\
    \ been applied in the raising industry by \nthe IoT based production management\
    \ systems. RFID \ntag has played a potential role to control the amount of \n\
    feed. Tongke (2013) focused the study on the smart \nagriculture based on cloud\
    \ computing and IoT. \nAccording to him, the RFID and IoT, has helped to build\
    \ \nplant factory and it also plays an important role to realize \nthe automatic\
    \ control production in the agricultural \nsector. In fact, the RFID, sensor and\
    \ GPS worked \ntogether for information sensing in the process of \nproduction.\
    \ Sarkar and Chanagala (2016) surveyed IoT \nbased digital agricultural monitoring\
    \ system with their \nimpact on optimal resource utilization. RFID has helped\
    \ \nto build the device for the process of sensing the \nparameter in the agriculture\
    \ and it further sends signal to \nthe internet in an effective manner. In this\
    \ effect, the IoT \nbased RFID has improved the quality of agriculture \nproducts\
    \ by managing and controlling the products. \nBarakat (2016) has pointed that\
    \ the RFID’s and GPS \npoints can be embedded in agricultural field and it can\
    \ \nbenefit from the collected information they provide. \nSarfraz Fayaz Khan\
    \ and Mohammed Yusoof Ismail / Journal of Computer Science 2018, 14 (2): 132.143\
    \ \nDOI: 10.3844/jcssp.2018.132.143 \n \n134 \nInformation collected through the\
    \ devices can then be \nproceeding and the final results are used to perform an\
    \ \nautomated task via Wi-Fi connection (Buckely, 2006).  \nAccording to Zhao\
    \ and Wang (2014), RFID tracing \napplication with IoT has helped to manage and\
    \ control \nthe information in the supply chain value of \nagricultural products.\
    \ IoT can make use of RFID \ntechnology for scanning EPC tags on the items and\
    \ \nhence it has achieved the automatic identification and \ninformation sharing\
    \ successfully. The authors also \npointed out the RFID as the most critical technologies\
    \ \nin the IoT. It can be also predicted that the RFID has \nused to achieve intelligent\
    \ identification, monitoring, \nremote control and positioning in the agricultural\
    \ \nproduction (Qin et al., 2015). \nMapping and Monitoring the Croplands Pattern\
    \ \nA study done by Jaishetty and Patil (2016) examined \nIoT sensor network based\
    \ approach for agricultural field \nmonitoring and control. The solution of remote\
    \ \nmonitoring has played a significant role to monitor in \nreal time through\
    \ some of the remote devices such as \ntablets and mobiles. Ultrasonic waves have\
    \ been used \nwith IoT to monitor the soil quality and levels of ground \nwater\
    \ in agricultural field. The optimal sensor methods \nof placement have used to\
    \ monitor the environmental \nchange and wireless sensor networks have played\
    \ a \npotential role to monitor the patterns of cropland Table 1. \nParameswaran\
    \ and Sivaprasath (2016) studied about \narduino based smart drip irrigation system\
    \ using IoT. \nCrop has continuously monitored by using PC host. LCD \nhas also\
    \ played an efficient role to improve the method \nof cultivation and hence it\
    \ leads to better productivity \neffectively. System hardware associated with\
    \ the IoT \ncreated the significant impact on monitoring and \ncontrolling system\
    \ of smart agriculture. Channe et al. \n(2015) pointed that the real time monitoring\
    \ properties of \nIoT has helped to maintain the health of soil intact by \napplying\
    \ the required fertilizer amount. In fact, the \nanalysis of soil moisture by\
    \ sensor also has helped to \napply water in necessary areas. Zigbee and GPS \n\
    technologies also pave way to monitor the cropland \npattern in an effective manner.\
    \  \nAutomatic intelligent equipment and remote control \nproduction devices played\
    \ an efficient role for farmers to \nmonitor the farmland information without\
    \ leaving home. \nIn this effect, the agricultural IoT has related to some of\
    \ \nthe field such as weather monitoring, automatic \ngreenhouse controlling,\
    \ intelligent control system of \nplanting \nindustry, \ntraceability \nof \n\
    food \nsafety, \nenvironmental monitoring etc (Wu et al., 2015). \nAccording to\
    \ Paventhan (2013) IoT also has aimed to \nextend internet to distributed devices\
    \ in large numbers \nby defining the communication protocols. \nReal-Time Monitoring\
    \ of Environment (Using \nWireless Technology) \nA study done by Pavana and Padma\
    \ (2016) designed \na low cost system for real time monitoring of water \nquality\
    \ parameters in IoT environment. The IoT has the \ncapability to revolutionize\
    \ the water industry as more of \nthe innovative technology has connected to web.\
    \ The \nwater quality monitoring through online mode has \nacquired \nmuch \n\
    attention \nworldwide. \nConverging \ntechnologies for smart environments and\
    \ integrated \necosystems of IoT has been investigated by Vermesan and \nFriess\
    \ (2013). Monitoring of soil moisture, vibrations, \ndensity of earth to detect\
    \ the dangerous spatterns in land \nconditions have been achieved by the wireless\
    \ \ntechnology of IoT. In addition to these, the monitoring \nof variations of\
    \ water level in dams, rivers and \nreservoirs are also analyzed using the IoT\
    \ in an \neffective manner. Wine quality enhancing, green \nhouses, half courses,\
    \ meteorological station network \nand compost are also achieved in agricultural\
    \ sector by \nusing the wireless technology of IoT. \nAdvantech (2015) pointed\
    \ out that the real-time \nremote monitoring and management has been achieved\
    \ \nby the IoT wireless technologies successfully. In real-\ntime monitoring system,\
    \ the information can be remotely \nchecked through mobile phones, computers etc.\
    \ In this \nsense, the distributed systems, nutrients etc. across the \ngreenhouses\
    \ can also be managed in an efficient way   \n(Li and Guo, 2014; Abdul Aziz et\
    \ al., 2009). It also has \nprovided different workers with different authority\
    \ level. \nGetting real-time information through e-mail alerts and \nSMS are also\
    \ achieved in the smart agriculture system. \nGreenhouse \nwireless \nnetwork\
    \ \nmonitoring \nand \nmanagement using internet of things has been analyzed \n\
    by Jagdale and Mali (2016). The authors pointed that the \nwireless network technology\
    \ has monitored the light \nintensity that was incident in the field greenhouse\
    \ area. \nIn fact, monitoring and controlling of green field \nenvironment has\
    \ played an important role in production \nof crops and this has further maximized\
    \ the activity of \nphotosynthesis. Better infield monitoring of cropland has\
    \ \nachieved only by means of IoT wireless technology \nwhen compared to other\
    \ technologies (Doknic, 2014).  \nChallenges of Applying IoT in Agriculture \n\
    Software Complexity \nA study done by Soumyalatha and Hegde (2015) \nexamined\
    \ the application, issues, challenges and \narchitecture of IoT. Scalability,\
    \ self-configuration, \ninteroperability, complexity of software, storage volume,\
    \ \ninterpretation of data, security and personal privacy, fault \ntolerance and\
    \ energy-optimized solutions are some of the \nchallenges associated with the\
    \ IoT (Perera et al., 2015; \nBorgohain et al., 2015; Whitmore et al., 2015; \n\
    Bandyopadhyay and Sen, 2011). In fact, the software \nSarfraz Fayaz Khan and Mohammed\

    \ \n \n135 \nsystems in smart objects work with minimal resources \nand the software\
    \ infrastructure is needed support the \nnetwork and hence it also required the\
    \ server to support \nnetworks smart objects on the back ground.  \nA study done\
    \ by Pande and Padwalkar (2014) \nexamined the internet of things. The software\
    \ complexity \nand data interpretation are referred as the main challenges \n\
    of IoT in agricultural sector. The systems of software in \nsmart objects should\
    \ have to function with minimal \nresources as in the conventional embedded systems\
    \ \n(Ashton, 2009). In fact, the fault tolerance also has \npossessed the great\
    \ challenges and it requires redundancy \non several levels depending on various\
    \ conditions. \nBalamurugan et al. (2016) studied about applying \nIoT to improve\
    \ food and farming technology. User-\nfriendly software has paved the way for\
    \ the big data for \nsmall farms with the creative usage. In particular, the \n\
    software, actuators, sensors and technologies of energy \nharvesting are directly\
    \ contributing to the IoT \ndevelopment  (Guang et al., 2011). Software complexity,\
    \ \nspatiality and dynamics are some of the factors which are \naffecting quality\
    \ and production of crop in higher level \n(Venkataramana and Padmavathamma, 2012).\
    \  \nA study done by Madakkam et al. (2015) examined \nthe Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT). Hardware, middleware and \npresentation of software of IoT have the capability\
    \ to \ncreate \nthe \nnegative \nimpact \non \nthe \nagriculture \n(Jayavardhana\
    \ et al., 2013). Patil et al (2012) has \noverviewed the internet of things and\
    \ cloud computing \nfor agriculture. Complexity, spatio-temporal variability \n\
    and diversity are some of the characteristics features \nrelated to agriculture\
    \ need to be considered in \ndeveloping the right kinds of services. In addition\
    \ to \nthese, the actuators, sensors, software and location \ntechnology (GPS),\
    \ wireless communication and RFID \ntechnology (Shao and Li, 2009) are some of\
    \ the \ntechnologies which have contributed to the development \nof IoT in many\
    \ sectors. In this sense, understanding and \noperating the software seems to\
    \ be more complex in \nsome of the sectors like agriculture.  \nSecurity \nThe\
    \ study done by Mehta and Patel (2016) examined \nIoT based smart agriculture\
    \ research opportunities and \nchallenges. The IoT has connected with more devices\
    \ \ntogether and it also has provided the decentralized \nenergy points for malware\
    \ creates a negative impact \non the smart agriculture. It also has become the\
    \ main \nchallenge of IoT in agricultural sector. Less expensive \ndevices which\
    \ are in compromised locales are more \nsubject to the process of tampering (Fangquan,\
    \    \n2012; Sun et al., 2008) In addition to these, more \nsoftware layers, APIs,\
    \ middleware integration and \nmachine to machine communication are some of the\
    \ \nterms which are creating the complexity and new risks \nof security in higher\
    \ level. \nWang and Liu (2014) focused some of the application \nof IoT in agricultural\
    \ means of production supply \nmanagement. The internet of things application\
    \ in the \nstage of agricultural product sale has reflected in the \nform of security,\
    \ statistics and validity monitoring.  \nWEF (2015) analyzed industrial internet\
    \ of things by \nunleashing the potential of connected products and \nservices.\
    \ Security and privacy of IoT has created both \nthe positive and negative impact\
    \ in agricultural sectors. \nThe securities are raising an increased vulnerability\
    \ to \nattacks, espionage and data breaches driven by increased \nsharing of data\
    \ and connectivity (Osborn and Charlie, \n2014; Elfrink, 2014; Shankland and Stephen,\
    \ 2014). \nFinally, it can be predicted that the security and \ninteroperability\
    \ are referred as the two biggest hurdles of \nimplementing the IoT in agricultural\
    \ sectors.  \nKumar and Patel (2014) have surveyed the internet of \nthings with\
    \ security and privacy issues. Front-end \nsensors and equipment, network and\
    \ back-end of IT \nsystems are referred as the security threats of IoT. Safety\
    \ \nmanagement of code resources and operator replacement \nare some of the terms\
    \ associated with the back end of IT \nsystems (Liu and Yang, 2011; Jiang and\
    \ ShiWei, 2010; \nZhou et al., 2012). In fact, the security of IoT system has\
    \ \nsome major standards such as access control, \nauthentication of user, data\
    \ confidentiality and \nanytime availability (Abomhara and Koein, 2014; \nZhao\
    \ and Ge, 2013). These are further associated with \nthe back-end of IT systems\
    \ also creates an impact on \nthe development of agriculture.  \nFernandes et\
    \ al. (2016) have evaluated the internet of \nthings with security challenges\
    \ and future scope. They \npointed that the confidentiality, integrity, availability\
    \ and \nauthentication are some of the factors which are linked \nwith the security\
    \ issues. Additionally, the common \nworms jumping, organized crime and cyber\
    \ terrorism are \nsome of the security threats associated with the IoT \nfurther\
    \ create an impact on agricultural field (Farooq et al,., \n2015; Roman et al.,\
    \ 2011a; 2013b). \nTechnical Skill Requirement \nChikaire et al. (2015) pointed\
    \ that the capacity \nbuilding is one of the essential key to survival of \nagricultural\
    \ extension. The technical skill requirement is \nneeded for farming and the lack\
    \ of operating skills \ncreates an impact on the overall performance in field\
    \ of \nagriculture. The capacity building has focused on \nenhancing the abilities\
    \ of an organization to perform the \nfunctions of farming, solve problems and\
    \ also deal with \nthe need of development (Rivera, 2000).  \nJacobs and Hart\
    \ (2012) studied about the skill \ndevelopment in rural areas. Skill based technical\
    \ change \nalso has evolved to increase demand for high skilled \nlabor across\
    \ different working environment. Motor \nskills, cognitive skills and interactive\
    \ skills are the three \nSarfraz Fayaz Khan and Mohammed Yusoof Ismail / Journal\
    \ of Computer Science 2018, 14 (2): 132.143 \nDOI: 10.3844/jcssp.2018.132.143\
    \ \n \n136 \nstages of skills demand for the operator in the farming. \nIn this\
    \ effect, the ability of education tends to be the \nprimary problem for the farmers\
    \ from adopting new \npractices and effective technologies.  \nMenon et al. (2012)\
    \ have assessed the technical \nmanpower requirements in agriculture sector in\
    \ India. The \ntechnical manpower has expected to be requiring in a high \nnumber.\
    \ This will continue to be insufficient during the \nhorizon with time. The authors\
    \ pointed that the technical \nmanpower in sector of agriculture has played a\
    \ vital role \nin achieving the self-sufficiency in the grain production of \n\
    food (FCCI, 2007; Kao and Lee, 1998). In fact, there is a \nshortage of technical\
    \ manpower in agriculture field at \nvarious levels especially related to IoT.\
    \  \nPodder and Kuntagod (2016) studied some smart \nservices with designing internet\
    \ of things solutions to \naspire the smart nations. Most of the growing \neconomies\
    \ lack the resources of finance, manpower, \nskills related to technology and\
    \ access to the latest \ntechnology \nnecessary \nfor \nstrengthening \nthe \n\
    infrastructure. Interoperability, ensuring security of \ndata and sourcing the\
    \ required skills are some of the \nfundamental issues rising in emerging economies.\
    \ \nRose et al. (2015) have overviewed the internet of \nthings with several challenges.\
    \ The scope of IoT \nchallenges has not been unique to industrialized \ncountries.\
    \ Infrastructure readiness, incentives of market \nand investments, technical\
    \ skill requirements and the \nresources of policy have been identified as some\
    \ of the \nchallenges linked with the IoT in many sectors. \nInteroperability\
    \ has created the significant influence on the \nIoT with the economic impact\
    \ beyond technical aspects. \nLack of Supporting Infrastructure \nBidua and Patel\
    \ (2015) studied about internet of \nthings and cloud computing for agriculture\
    \ in India. \nSmart grid, traffic systems etc. have been identified to \nhave\
    \ supporting infrastructure which is far from being \nready for internet of things\
    \ in agricultural field (Yan-e, \n2011; Channe et al., 2015; Bo and Wang, 2011).\
    \ In fact, \nthe IoT has offered the tremendous potential to innovate \nin the\
    \ field of agriculture. In India, internet availability \nand connectivity seems\
    \ to be the major challenge and \nadoption of IoT becomes difficult for farmers\
    \ due to lack \nof supporting infrastructure.  \nSharma et al. (2016) analyzed\
    \ the technical \nassessment of IoT for Indian agricultural sector. Smart \nmetering\
    \ and smart grid infrastructure of IoT are lacking \nin the agricultural field.\
    \ Furthermore, the infrastructure \nmodernization cost and maintenance seems to\
    \ be a great \nchallenge of IoT in farming (Lee et al., 2013).  \nPundir et al.\
    \ (2016) analyzed the future directions \nand challenges of internet of things.\
    \ Lack of information \ninfrastructure facilities of IoT in farming has created\
    \ the \nnegative impact in productivity. The rural farming areas \nare not advanced\
    \ in terms of overall infrastructures. In \nfact, the unanticipated resource of\
    \ development has \ndiminished the abilities of the individual to add new \nfunctionality\
    \ related to core.  \nRoshan and Ray (2016) analyzed some of the \nchallenges\
    \ and risk to implement IoT in smart homes \nwith respect to an Indian perspective.\
    \ Smart power grid, \nsmart drainage or system of sanitation, supply of smart\
    \ \nwater, are some of the supporting infrastructure which \nare far away from\
    \ being ready to use in Indian \nagricultural area (Jin et al., 2014; Datta et\
    \ al., 2014). In \nparticular, the centralized infrastructure of IoT to support\
    \ \nanalytics have required in the agriculture field to attain \nthe specific\
    \ tasks (Gubbi et al., 2013).  \nOpportunities Associated with the Application\
    \ of \nIoT in Agriculture \nLow Power Wireless Sensor \nA study done by Chen (2012)\
    \ examined the \nchallenges and opportunities of IoT. Low power wireless \nsensor\
    \ is one of the main opportunities associated with \nthe application of IoT. Low\
    \ power sensors are needed \nreplacement of battery over their lifetimes. The\
    \ design of \nlow power transmitter should be considered for low \npower sensor\
    \ node and hence it attains the greatest \nimpact in the agricultural sector.\
    \ Low power wireless \nless sensor networking of IoT has achieved high success\
    \ \nover other technologies (IEC, 2014; Sen, 2009). It has \nthe capability to\
    \ cover an area of only a small dozen \nmeters. In this sense, the low energy\
    \ consumption of \nsensors is act as the main key to support the independent \n\
    battery powered devices in a longer flow. This has \nhelped to reduce the cost\
    \ of maintenance simultaneously. \nAnusha and Shobha (2015) analyzed the design\
    \ and \nimplementation of wireless sensor network for precision \nagriculture.\
    \ Recently, low cost and low power wireless \nsensor technology seems to be well\
    \ suited to replace \nwires as the medium of communication in most of the \napplications\
    \ of agriculture (Gutierrez et al., 2014).   \nMore and Nighot (2016) has reviewed\
    \ the wireless \nsensor network for agriculture. The advancement of \nwireless\
    \ sensor networks and reduction of size has \nincreased the WSN application chances\
    \ in agricultural \nfield. The wireless sensor has consumed low cost and it \n\
    has the ability to withstand the resistance towards the \ncurrent successively\
    \ (Barath et al., 2016). The ability of \ndata gathering and remote sensing are\
    \ closely related to \nthe low power wireless sensor.  \nBetter Connectivity \n\

    \ efficient outcome in agricultural sector. \nInternet connectivity seems to be\
    \ vital to the solutions of \nIoT. Wireless links have played an effective role\
    \ in \ncovering huge distances at reasonable costs (Miazi et al., \n2016). Better\
    \ internet connectivity has enabled to push \nthe data onto the cloud and it also\
    \ helps to visualize the \ndata using the mobile and other electronic devices.\
    \ IoT \nseems to be more popular and easy to use in almost \nevery field (Raigonda\
    \ et al., 2016; Domingo, 2012; \nZhang et al., 2013). GSMA (2015) has analyzed\
    \ the \nagricultural Machine to Machine (M2M) as a platform of \nexpansion. Better\
    \ connectivity of IoT has enhanced the \nsustainability of business in higher\
    \ level. Cellular M2M, \nshort-range (Wi-Fi, Zigbee and Ethernet), satellite and\
    \ \nfixed networks and power line are some types of M2M \nconnectivity significantly\
    \ linked with IoT. In some areas, \nthe lacks of distribution of channel and limited\
    \ \nconnectivity access have created an impact on the \nagriculture areas (OECD,\
    \ 2016). M2M connectivity \nservices have helped the farmers to improve the \n\
    efficiency of farming operations. High bandwidth fiber \nconnectivity also has\
    \ enabled the communication with \nlow latency which keeps the farming area more\
    \ active. \nOperational Efficiency \nOperational efficiency has achieved the application\
    \ \nof IoT and it can be called out by the enhanced usage of \nenergy with effective\
    \ infrastructure of IoT. The IoT \npower has tackled the issues of environment\
    \ which lies \nin its ability to gather data through analytics. It also \ndrives\
    \ the smarter decisions about operational efficiency, \nstrategy of business and\
    \ the allocation of resources. The \nIoT has the opportunity to capture data which\
    \ optimizes \noperational efficiency and reducing the impact of \nenvironment\
    \ in a higher level (Wind, 2016). According \nto Schimek (2016), the IoT implementation\
    \ has \nimproved the analytics, efficiency and predictive \nmaintenance. Sensor\
    \ and wireless technologies of IoT \nhas played a potential role to increase the\
    \ efficiency and \nhence it provides an accessible vehicle network to its \ncustomers.\
    \ Oracle (2015) pointed out that the agribusiness \nperformance has been improved\
    \ by using big data and \nIoT. The solutions of IoT and big data have improved\
    \ \nforecasting and efficiency of an operation. It also leads to \nimproved decision\
    \ making. Timely scheduling equipment \nmaintenance and minimizing the usage of\
    \ energy has \nenabled the greater operational efficiency in agricultural \nsectors.\
    \ In this effect, the operational efficiency of \ninformation and technology has\
    \ often difficult to prove. \nRomeo (2016) analyzed the current status and trends\
    \ \nenabling smart farming through the IoT. Low cost and \nhigh volume of sensor\
    \ paves a way to attain the high \noperation efficiency in the farming area. \
    \ \nRemote Management \nA study done by Yin (2017) examined the \nimplementation\
    \ of IoTs in agriculture industry in China. \nAlarm management, remote control\
    \ and expert system \nare closely connected with each other as it has helped to\
    \ \nattain the high production in the agriculture area. Real-\ntime surveillance\
    \ is referred as the main functions in the \nagricultural site. Remote monitoring\
    \ of the crop growth \nprocess is also achieved by the IoT wireless \ntechnologies.\
    \ Users can control anytime by the terminal \nof internet which can be introduced\
    \ to the field devices \nof agriculture with all kinds of remote control switch.\
    \ \nShi et al. (2016) pointed out that the IoT system has \nprovided the new way\
    \ to access the information of \nagriculture for the farm. In this sense, the\
    \ IoT has \nprovided a change for the remote monitoring the disease \nof plants\
    \ and insect pests in the agriculture field area.  \n \nTable 1. Challenges, Opportunities\

    \ \n \n139 \nPropositions of the study are as follows: \n \nP1: Software complexity\
    \ stands as a challenge in \nimplementing the applications of internet of things\
    \ \nwith specific reference to agricultural sector \nP2: Security stands as a\
    \ challenge in implementing the \napplications of internet of things with specific\
    \ \nreference to agricultural sector \nP3: Technical skill requirement stands\

    \ \nwith specific reference to agricultural sector \nP8: Remote management stands\
    \ as an opportunity in \nimplementing the applications of internet of things \n\
    with specific reference to agricultural sector \n \nFrom the above literature,\
    \ it is evident that software \ncomplexity, lack of supporting infrastructure,\
    \ security \nand technical skill requirement are some of challenges \nassociated\
    \ with internet of things applications with \nrespect to agricultural sector.\
    \ It was noticed that \ncomplexity of software, dynamics and spatiality affects\
    \ \nthe crop’s quality and production. However, it was also \nnoted that lack\
    \ of operating skills has created an impact \non the overall farming performance\
    \ thus technical skill is \nmainly needed for farming. Lack of supporting \ninfrastructure\
    \ has created the negative impact in farming \nproductivity. \nRemote \nmanagement,\
    \ \noperational \nefficiency, better connectivity and low power wireless \nsensor\
    \ are some of the opportunities associated with \ninternet of things applications\
    \ with special reference to \nagricultural sector. In terms of opportunities,\
    \ low energy \nconsumption of sensors support the independent battery \npowered\
    \ devices for longer time. Machine to machine \nconnectivity services assist the\
    \ farmers to enhance the \nefficiency of operating in terms of farming. Maintaining\
    \ \nthe timely scheduling equipment allowed greater \noperational efficiency especially\
    \ in agricultural sectors. \nRemote management has permitted the user to monitor\
    \ \nthe irrigation condition in the field. Applications of \ninternet of things\
    \ can be used in many areas related to \nagricultural field namely sensing of\
    \ crop, real-time \nmonitoring of environment, managing and controlling \n(use\
    \ of radio frequency identification) and mapping and \nmonitoring the croplands\
    \ pattern. Temperature sensor \nand soil moisture sensor plays a key role in introducing\
    \ \nan automation system in farming field that is sensing of \ncrop. Internet\
    \ of things based radio frequency identification \nhas enhanced the quality of\
    \ agricultural product by \nmanaging and controlling. Global positioning system\
    \ and \nZigbee technologies in the internet of things have paved the \nway for\
    \ monitoring the pattern of cropland. At the same \ntime, it was also clear from\
    \ the above literature that, with \nthe help of internet of things technologies,\
    \ real-time remote \nmonitoring and management can be achieved.  \nDiscussion\
    \ and Conclusion \nInternet of things in agricultural field has become one \n\
    of the most remarkable developing fields in machine-to-\nmachine space. In the\
    \ present scenario, conservationists, \nranchers and farmers require a method\
    \ to efficiently \nadopt and conserve resources. Better and efficient way to \n\
    perform \nthis \nby \nutilizing \nmachine \nto \nmachine \ncommunication and actionable\
    \ data which makes the \nongoing data collection very affordable and simple. \n\
    Internet of things had transformed the agricultural sector \nand enabled farmers\
    \ to compete with massive issues they \nface. This research collects data from\
    \ the second handed \nor secondary sources. Secondary data were gathered \nfrom\
    \ different existing academic literature from reputed \njournals, books, newsletters,\
    \ magazines, whitepapers and \nso on. The main purpose of this paper is to review\
    \ the \nvarious challenges and opportunities associated with the \napplications\
    \ of internet of things in agricultural sector. \nSome of the challenges were\
    \ taken into consideration for \nreviewing the applications of internet of things\
    \ are \nsoftware complexity, security, lack of supporting \ninfrastructure and\
    \ technical skill requirement. It is clear \nfrom the literature that, complexity\
    \ in the software has to \nbe rectified in order to support the IoT network. \n\
    Therefore software must be developed as user-friendly \nfor improving the farming,\
    \ production and quality of the \ncrop. Security is the major threat in the IoT\
    \ applications. \nSecurity has to be enhanced through proper access \ncontrol,\
    \ data confidentiality and user authentication. \nTechnical skill is required\
    \ for farming to enhance the \norganizational abilities and to perform the farming\
    \ \nfunctions, solving problems and more. Better supporting \ninfrastructure can\
    \ be developed with proper internet \navailability and connectivity. Some of the\
    \ opportunities \nwere taken for reviewing the applications of internet of \n\
    things \nare \nlow \npower \nwireless \nsensor, \nbetter \nconnectivity, \noperational\
    \ \nefficiency \nand \nremote \nmanagement. Low cost and low power wireless sensor\
    \ \ntechnology are appropriate one to replace wires as \ncommunication medium\
    \ in the agricultural sector. Better \ninternet connectivity services assisted\
    \ the farmers in \nenhancing the farming operations efficiency. Internet of \n\

  description: For this project, we are using Technology called LoRa. By using LoRa
    technology we are going to monitor the agriculture. This is called the Agricultural
    Monitoring. The process of Monitoring the agriculture parameters by using the
    technical knowledge is called the smart agriculture. By following the smart agriculture
    we can minimize the time and effort. Along with that the maximize yield and minimize
    the expenses. The population is increasing day by day,but we are running out of
    time. Because of this reason Iot comes in to picture. By using the smart Agriculture,
    we can work on irrigation, Automation and Implementation. The research begins
    by contrasting WiFi and LoRa as wireless technologies. Data wireless technology
    that can used by smart devices transmittance End-devices for the Internet of Things
    (IoT) used in these definitions have strong demands for battery conservation,
    and as a result. It is recommended to use low-power modules. The emphasis of this
    paper is on rescue. The current study's monitoring and aim is the use of the IoT
    data is distributed using two wireless technologies. Devices the well-known WiFi
    and the soon-to-be-released LoRa science and technology. To link the end-devices
    in our scenarios to the Internet, we use a LoRa-based gateway and a WiFi router.
    The data collected on the server application from sensors mounted on IoT modules
    can be viewed by approved users via a web or mobile application. This survey helps
    a more better to environment for rescue concepts, which involves all of the hardware
    and software as well as the LoRa technologies used for transmission. The scenario
    is implemented using two FiPy development boards for the nano-Gateway and end-node.
    Since energy consumption and battery life will be the subject of future studies,
    both devices are connected via USB cables rather than battery support for the
    current study. After successfully connecting to the LoRa nano-gateway, the end
    device captures the current location and temperature and posts them to the connected
    UDP stream at predefined time intervals. For testing purposes, indoor experiments
    were conducted to ensure the network's stability.

  explanation: The study explores the use of LoRa technology in agricultural monitoring
    systems. LoRa is a low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) technology that is well-suited
    for applications where devices need to transmit small amounts of data over long
    distances with low power consumption. The study uses LoRa to connect end-devices
    to a nano-gateway and then to a server application. This allows users to access
    data from the sensors mounted on the end-devices via a web or mobile application.

    this project, we are using Technology called LoRa. By using LoRa technology we
    are going to monitor the agriculture. This is called the Agricultural Monitoring.
    The process of Monitoring the agriculture parameters by using the technical knowledge
    is called the smart agriculture. By following the smart agriculture we can minimize
    the time and effort. Along with that the maximize yield and minimize the expenses.
    The population is increasing day by day,but we are running out of time. Because
    of this reason Iot comes in to picture. By using the smart Agriculture, we can
    work on irrigation, Automation and Implementation. The research begins by contrasting
    WiFi and LoRa as wireless technologies. Data wireless technology that can used
    by smart devices transmittance End-devices for the Internet of Things (IoT) used
    in these definitions have strong demands for battery conservation, and as a result.
    It is recommended to use low-power modules. The emphasis of this paper is on rescue.
    The current study’s monitoring and aim is the use of the IoT data is distributed
    using two wireless technologies. Devices the well-known WiFi and the soon-to-be-released
    LoRa science and technology. To link the end-devices in our scenarios to the Internet,
    we use a LoRa-based gateway and a WiFi router. The data collected on the server
    application from sensors mounted on IoT modules can be viewed by approved users
    via a web or mobile application. This survey helps a more better to environment
    for rescue concepts, which involves all of the hardware and software as well as
    the LoRa technologies used for transmission. The scenario is implemented using
    two FiPy development boards for the nano-Gateway and end-node. Since energy consumption
    and battery life will be the subject of future studies, both devices are connected
    via USB cables rather than battery support for the current study. After successfully
    connecting to the LoRa nano-gateway, the end device captures the current location
    and temperature and posts them to the connected UDP stream at predefined time
    intervals. For testing purposes, indoor experiments were conducted to ensure the
    network’s stability. Topics Energy consumption, Batteries, Hydrology, Information

  key_findings: The study found that LoRa technology is a viable option for agricultural
    monitoring systems. The LoRa network was able to provide reliable data transmission
    over long distances with low power consumption. The distributed architecture of
    the system also made it more resilient to failures.
  limitations: The study does not provide a detailed analysis of the performance of
    the LoRa network in terms of latency, throughput, and reliability.
  main_objective: To explore the use of LoRa technology in agricultural monitoring
    systems.
  relevance_evaluation: The study is relevant to the point of discussion because it
    demonstrates the use of LoRa technology in a distributed architecture for enhancing
    system resilience in automated irrigation systems. The distributed architecture
    enables the end-devices to be connected to the nano-gateway and then to the server
    application, which provides redundancy and fault tolerance. This makes the system
    more resilient to failures and ensures that data can be transmitted even if one
    of the components fails.

  description: Global urbanization and increasing water demand make efficient water
    resource management crucial. This study employs Multi-Criteria Decision Making
    (MCDM) to evaluate smart city water management strategies. We use representative
    criteria, employ objective judgment, assign weights through the Analytic Hierarchy
    Process (AHP), and score strategies based on meeting these criteria. We find that
    the “Effectiveness and Risk Management” criterion carries the highest weight (15.28%),
    underscoring its pivotal role in strategy evaluation and robustness. Medium-weight
    criteria include “Resource Efficiency, Equity, and Social Considerations” (10.44%),
    “Integration with Existing Systems, Technological Feasibility, and Ease of Implementation”
    (10.10%), and “Environmental Impact” (9.84%) for ecological mitigation. “Community
    Engagement and Public Acceptance” (9.79%) recognizes involvement, while “Scalability
    and Adaptability” (9.35%) addresses changing conditions. “Return on Investment”
    (9.07%) and “Regulatory and Policy Alignment” (8.8%) balance financial and governance
    concerns. Two low-weight criteria, “Data Reliability” (8.78%) and “Long-Term Sustainability”
    (8.55%), stress data accuracy and sustainability. Highly weighted strategies like
    “Smart Metering and Monitoring, Demand Management, Behavior Change” and “Smart
    Irrigation Systems” are particularly effective in improving water management in
    smart cities. However, medium-weighted (e.g., “Educational Campaigns and Public
    Awareness”, “Policy and Regulation”, “Rainwater Harvesting”, “Offshore Floating
    Photovoltaic Systems”, “Collaboration and Partnerships”, “Graywater Recycling
    and Reuse”, and “Distributed Water Infrastructure”) and low-weighted (e.g., “Water
    Desalination”) strategies also contribute and can be combined with higher-ranked
    ones to create customized water management approaches for each smart city’s unique
    context. This research is significant because it addresses urban water resource
    management complexity, offers a multi-criteria approach to enhance traditional
    single-focused methods, evaluates water strategies in smart cities comprehensively,
    and provides a criteria-weight-based resource allocation framework for sustainable
    decisions, boosting smart city resilience. Note that results may vary based on
    specific smart city needs and constraints. Future studies could explore factors
    like climate change on water management in smart cities and consider alternative
    MCDM methods like TOPSIS or ELECTRE for strategy evaluation.

    optimization 1. Introduction 1.1. Research Motivation The burgeoning urbanization
    and escalating demand for water resources in contemporary cities have propelled
    the need for innovative and effective water management strategies [1,2]. Smart
    cities, driven by technological advancements and data-driven decision making [3],
    provide an opportune platform to tackle these challenges [4,5]. Within this context,
    the selection and prioritization of optimal water management strategies assume
    paramount importance. However, this complex decision-making process necessitates
    a comprehensive evaluation that considers a multitude of criteria to determine
    the most viable strategies for smart cities. 1.2. Existing Research and Knowledge
    Gap Efficient and sustainable water management in urban areas, especially in the
    context of the fast-paced growth of smart cities, has been a subject of increasing
    research and attention [6]. Previous studies have highlighted the importance of
    implementing innovative strategies to address challenges related to water scarcity,
    pollution, and inefficient utilization [7]. Traditional approaches often focus
    on individual aspects of water management, neglecting the intricate connections
    between social, environmental, economic, and technological dimensions [8]. While
    existing research acknowledges the promise of smart city technologies, there is
    a notable gap in comprehensive evaluations that consider multiple criteria to
    rank and prioritize water management strategies tailored to smart city contexts.
    Some studies have investigated individual strategies, such as rainwater harvesting
    [9,10], desalination [11,12], and demand management [13], while others have focused
    on specific criteria like economic feasibility [14] or environmental impact [15].
    However, limited research combines a diverse range of strategies and criteria
    in a systematic framework that caters to the complexities of smart cities’ water
    management challenges. 1.3. Originality of This Study, Research Questions, and
    Methodology This article addresses this critical gap in the literature by conducting
    a rigorous and holistic evaluation of ten distinct water management strategies
    (“Smart Metering and Monitoring, Demand Management, and Behavior Change”, “Rainwater
    Harvesting”, “Graywater Recycling and Reuse”, “Distributed Water Infrastructure”,
    “Smart Irrigation Systems”, “Offshore Floating Photovoltaic Systems”, “Water Desalination”,
    “Policy and Regulation”, “Educational Campaigns and Public Awareness”, and “Collaboration
    and Partnerships”) within the framework of smart cities. Our evaluation framework
    encompasses a diverse range of criteria (“Effectiveness and Risk Management”,
    “Resource Efficiency, Equity, and Social Considerations”, “Scalability and Adaptability”,
    “Environmental Impact”, “Integration with Existing Systems, Technological Feasibility,
    and Ease of Implementation”, “Long-Term Sustainability”, “Community Engagement
    and Public Acceptance”, “Regulatory and Policy Alignment”, “Return on Investment
    (ROI)”, and “Data Reliability”) that collectively influence the efficacy and feasibility
    of these strategies. Recognizing the complexity of such evaluations, we employ
    the Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) technique, specifically the Analytic
    Hierarchy Process (AHP) [16,17], to assign relative weights to the criteria and
    rank the strategies accordingly. Specifically, this article seeks to answer the
    following research question: “How can water management strategies in smart cities
    be systematically evaluated and prioritized based on a comprehensive set of criteria
    using the MCDM-AHP? The integration of MCDM-AHP into the assessment process adds
    a layer of objectivity and rigor, enabling us to navigate the intricate interplay
    between diverse criteria and strategies (Figure 1). By utilizing AHP, we aim to
    derive an accurate representation of the strategies’ strengths and weaknesses
    while considering various dimensions crucial to their success in smart city contexts.
    Figure 1. Illustration of the study’s holistic framework: incorporating Multi-Criteria
    Decision Making (MCDM), particularly the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), to
    assess optimal water management strategies in the context of smart cities, considering
    diverse criteria. Source: Own elaboration. 1.4. Practical Implications This study
    is poised to make a significant contribution by not only presenting a comprehensive
    evaluation of water management strategies but also by offering actionable insights
    for urban planners, policymakers, and stakeholders. By leveraging the findings
    of this evaluation, decision-makers can make informed choices about water management
    strategies that align with their specific smart city goals and constraints. Ultimately,
    the synthesis of rigorous evaluation and intelligent decision making has the potential
    to drive sustainable and resilient water management practices, ensuring the prosperity
    of smart cities in an era of growing urbanization and resource constraints [18,19].
    1.5. Outline This article begins with an introduction (Section 1) that outlines
    the research motivation (Section 1.1), addressing the pressing need for efficient
    water management in the context of urbanization and smart cities. The existing
    research landscape is discussed, revealing a gap in comprehensive evaluations
    that combine multiple criteria to rank water management strategies tailored to
    smart city contexts (Section 1.2). Emphasizing the study’s originality and contribution,
    the introduction introduces the research questions and outlines the methodology
    involving the Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) technique of the Analytic
    Hierarchy Process (AHP) (Section 1.3). The introduction concludes by highlighting
    the practical implications of the study’s findings for urban planners, policymakers,
    and the broader advancement of smart city development (Section 1.4). Following
    the introduction, Section 2 delves into a comprehensive overview of smart cities.
    Subsequently, Section 3 presents the theoretical framework of MCDM-AHP, elucidating
    the methodology that will be employed to assess and prioritize the identified
    strategies (Section 3.3) based on the established criteria (Section 3.2). This
    section provides a foundational understanding of the context within which the
    study operates. Moving to Section 4, the article transitions to the presentation
    of results. This section entails the construction of pairwise comparison matrices
    between the criteria (Section 4.1), the derivation of relative weights for each
    criterion (Section 4.2), and the calculation of weighted sums associated with
    each water management strategy (Section 4.3). These quantitative outcomes offer
    a structured basis for strategy evaluation. Section 5 engages in an in-depth discussion
    of the advantages and challenges linked to each water management strategy. This
    section integrates the quantitative results with qualitative insights, providing
    a comprehensive understanding of the implications and nuances associated with
    each strategy’s adoption in smart cities. The article culminates with Section
    6, the conclusion. This section synthesizes the findings from the previous sections,
    reaffirms the study’s contribution to the field and limitations, and addresses
    the research questions posed at the outset. It also underscores the broader implications
    of the study’s outcomes for the advancement of smart city water management strategies
    and the sustainable development of urban environments. 2. Exploring Smart Cities:
    Harnessing Technology for Urban Evolution In recent years, the concept of smart
    cities has gained significant traction as a promising avenue for addressing the
    challenges of rapid urbanization, resource scarcity, and environmental sustainability.
    At the heart of this concept lies the integration of cutting-edge technologies,
    particularly Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and the Internet of
    Things (IoT), to revolutionize urban infrastructure, governance, and quality of
    life [5,6]. This holistic approach touches upon various facets of urban living,
    from transportation and energy to healthcare and governance [4] (Figure 2). Below,
    we delve into key aspects of smart cities, showcasing their potential and impact.
    Figure 2. The different components of a smart city are interconnected and work
    together to improve the efficiency and sustainability of the city. For example,
    smart transportation systems can use data from sensors to optimize traffic flow
    and reduce emissions. Smart energy systems can use renewable energy sources and
    energy-efficient technologies to reduce the city’s reliance on fossil fuels. Smart
    agro-hydro networks use data and technology to improve water efficiency, reduce
    leaks, monitor water quality, and improve food production, distribution, and safety.
    Smart buildings can use sensors to monitor energy usage and optimize comfort levels.
    And smart governance systems can use data to improve public services and make
    better decisions. Source: Author’s own elaboration. Information and Communication
    Technology (ICT) in the Smart City: At the core of smart cities is a robust ICT
    framework that acts as the nervous system of the urban landscape. Advanced data
    networks, high-speed internet, and cloud computing enable seamless communication
    between devices, systems, and citizens. This interconnectivity forms the backbone
    for real-time data collection, analysis, and decision-making processes that optimize
    urban functions [20,21]. Internet of Things (IoT) for Smart Cities: The IoT, a
    network of interconnected devices embedded with sensors and software, empowers
    smart cities by facilitating data-driven insights and automation. From smart traffic
    lights that adjust timings based on real-time traffic flow to waste bins that
    signal when they need emptying, IoT drives efficiency and resource optimization
    [22,23]. Smart Sensing: Smart sensing involves deploying various sensors across
    the urban landscape to monitor environmental conditions, energy consumption, and
    other parameters. These sensors provide invaluable data to city planners, helping
    them make informed decisions about resource allocation and infrastructure development
    [24,25]. Smart Grids and Smart Infrastructures: Smart grids leverage digital technology
    to optimize electricity distribution, manage demand, and integrate renewable energy
    sources. This results in a more reliable energy supply, reduced waste, and improved
    sustainability [26,27]. Similarly, smart infrastructures encompass intelligent
    designs that improve the efficiency of buildings, roads, and utilities, enhancing
    overall urban functionality [28,29]. Smart Transportation and Mobility: Smart
    transportation systems utilize data and technology to enhance mobility, reduce
    congestion, and minimize environmental impact. This includes intelligent traffic
    management, electric vehicle charging networks, and even autonomous vehicles that
    promise safer and more efficient transportation [30,31]. Smart Energy: Efficient
    energy use is a hallmark of smart cities [32,33]. Through real-time data analysis
    and monitoring, cities can identify patterns of energy consumption and implement
    strategies to reduce waste and reliance on fossil fuels [34]. Smart Water: Amid
    the array of smart city components, water management strategies emerge as a pivotal
    aspect. Harnessing technology to optimize water usage, prevent wastage, and ensure
    equitable distribution forms a cornerstone of smart city sustainability [15,35].
    Smart Buildings: Smart buildings employ automation and data-driven systems to
    optimize energy consumption, security, and occupant comfort. From adaptive lighting
    to climate control systems, these structures contribute to resource conservation
    and improved quality of life [36,37]. Smart Food and Agriculture: In the face
    of growing urban populations, smart cities explore innovative solutions for food
    production and distribution [38,39]. Vertical farming, urban agriculture, and
    intelligent supply chain management ensure a sustainable and resilient food ecosystem
    [40,41]. Smart Governance: Smart governance involves leveraging technology to
    enhance citizen engagement, streamline administrative processes, and foster transparency.
    E-governance platforms, digital service delivery, and data-driven decision making
    contribute to more responsive and efficient city management [42,43]. Smart People:
    The residents of a smart city play a pivotal role. Educated about sustainable
    practices and equipped with digital tools, citizens can actively contribute to
    resource conservation, waste reduction, and community well-being [44,45]. Smart
    Economy: Technology-driven innovation and entrepreneurship thrive in smart cities.
    By fostering an environment conducive to start-ups and tech industries, these
    cities generate economic growth while addressing urban challenges [46,47]. Smart
    Healthcare: Health services benefit from technology through telemedicine, wearable
    health monitoring devices, and predictive analytics that aid in disease outbreak
    detection and prevention [48,49]. Smart Living: The culmination of these efforts
    is an enhanced quality of life for residents. Reduced congestion, cleaner air,
    efficient services, and improved access to resources contribute to a more comfortable
    and sustainable urban lifestyle [50,51]. In essence, smart cities are poised to
    reshape the urban landscape by infusing it with technology, connectivity, and
    data-driven insights. By addressing challenges through a multidimensional approach,
    these cities offer a glimpse into a future where urbanization and sustainability
    coexist harmoniously. 3. Methodology The evaluation of water management strategies
    within the context of smart cities involves a complex decision-making process.
    To facilitate a structured approach to this assessment, we have employed the Multi-Criteria
    Decision Making (MCDM) with Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) approach. Appendix
    A outlines the theoretical framework of the MCDM-AHP. 3.1. Hierarchical Structure
    of the Decision-Making Framework Figure 3 illustrates the hierarchical structure
    of our decision-making framework, emphasizing the organization of key elements.
    Figure 3. Hierarchical structure of water management strategy evaluation in smart
    cities using Multi-Criteria Decision Making—Analytic Hierarchy Process (MCDM-AHP),
    with the overarching goal situated at the top level. Criteria (C) (Section 3.2)
    are positioned in the middle level followed by the specific alternatives (A) (Section
    3.3) at the bottom level. Source: Own elaboration, following a well-established
    and recognized hierarchy structure [16,17]. At the highest level of the hierarchy,
    we have the overarching goal of our study, which is to assess water management
    strategies in the context of smart cities. This goal serves as the ultimate objective
    that we aim to achieve through our evaluation. In the second level of the hierarchy,
    we have identified a set of criteria (Section 3.2) that are integral to our decision-making
    process. These criteria encapsulate the diverse aspects and dimensions that are
    critical in the evaluation of water management strategies. The criteria encompass
    considerations such as effectiveness and risk management (C1), resource efficiency,
    equity, and social considerations (C2), scalability and adaptability (C3), environmental
    impact (C4), integration with existing systems, technological feasibility, and
    ease of implementation (C5), long-term sustainability (C6), community engagement
    and public acceptance (C7), regulatory and policy alignment (C8), return on investment
    (C9), and data reliability. Finally, at the bottom level of the hierarchy, we
    have identified a range of water management strategies (Section 3.3) as our alternatives
    for evaluation. These alternatives encompass a broad spectrum of approaches, including
    Smart Metering and Monitoring, Demand Management, and Behavior Change (A1); Rainwater
    Harvesting (A2); Graywater Recycling and Reuse (A3); Distributed Water Infrastructure
    (A4); Smart Irrigation Systems (A5); Offshore Floating Photovoltaic Systems (A6);
    Water Desalination (A7); Policy and Regulation (A8); Educational Campaigns and
    Public Awareness (A9); and Collaboration and Partnerships (A10). This hierarchical
    structure is a well-known approach to decision making, which enables us to systematically
    assess and prioritize the water management strategies based on the defined criteria.
    3.2. Key Criteria for Evaluating Water Management Strategies in Smart Cities When
    evaluating water management strategies in smart cities, it is important to consider
    a range of criteria to ensure that the chosen strategies are effective, sustainable,
    and aligned with the city’s goals and needs [52]. Some common criteria to consider
    when evaluating water management strategies in smart cities are: (C1) Effectiveness
    and Risk Management: How well does the strategy achieve its intended goals, such
    as water conservation, improved water quality, or increased water availability
    [53,54]? Does the strategy address potential risks and vulnerabilities, such as
    water scarcity [1], extreme weather events [55,56,57], or technological failures
    [58]? (C2) Resource Efficiency, Equity, and Social Considerations: Does the strategy
    make efficient use of water resources, energy, and other inputs? Does it provide
    a positive cost–benefit ratio? Does the strategy ensure equitable access to water
    resources across different socioeconomic groups? Does it consider social and cultural
    factors [53,59,60]? (C3) Scalability and Adaptability: Can the strategy be scaled
    up or expanded to meet the needs of a growing population or changing urban landscape?
    Can the strategy be adjusted or modified as conditions change or new technologies
    emerge [61,62]? (C4) Environmental Impact: What are the environmental consequences
    of implementing the strategy? Does it minimize negative impacts on ecosystems
    and natural resources [63]? (C5) Integration with Existing Systems, Technological
    Feasibility, and Ease of Implementation: Can the strategy be integrated with the
    city’s existing water supply and distribution infrastructure without major disruptions?
    How complex is the implementation process? Are there potential barriers or challenges
    that need to be addressed [64,65,66]? (C6) Long-Term Sustainability: Will the
    strategy maintain its effectiveness and benefits over the long term [67]? Is it
    resilient to changing conditions and future challenges [68,69] (SMRY [70])? (C7)
    Community Engagement and Public Acceptance: How well does the strategy involve
    and engage the community in water conservation efforts? Is there public support
    and participation? Is the strategy likely to be accepted and embraced by residents,
    businesses, and other stakeholders [71,72]? (C8) Regulatory and Policy Alignment:
    Is the strategy in alignment with local regulations, policies, and sustainability
    goals [73]? (C9) Return on Investment (ROI): What is the expected return on investment
    in terms of water savings, reduced costs, and other benefits [74]? (C10) Data
    Reliability: Is the strategy based on accurate and reliable data, especially if
    it involves data-driven decision making [75]? By evaluating water management strategies
    against these common criteria, smart cities can make well-informed decisions that
    lead to sustainable, efficient, and resilient water management practices [76,77].
    3.3. Alternatives: Water Management Strategies in Smart Cities Water management
    is a critical aspect of creating sustainable and efficient smart cities. Smart
    cities use technology and data-driven approaches to enhance the management of
    water resources, reduce waste, and ensure equitable distribution [78,79]. Some
    water management strategies commonly implemented in smart cities include the following:
    (A1) Smart Metering and Monitoring, Demand Management, and Behavior Change: Integrating
    smart water meters offers real-time consumption data for tracking patterns, identifying
    leaks, and maintaining systems. Smart sensors monitor water quality, reservoir
    levels, and infrastructure conditions, with advanced networks detecting anomalies
    and alerting maintenance teams. Early warning systems predict flooding or contamination
    [80,81]. Additionally, smart cities foster water conservation through real-time
    consumption information, empowering individuals to make conscious usage decisions.
    Data analytics and predictive modeling anticipate demand, optimize resources,
    and enhance infrastructure planning for reduced demand and balanced supply [13].
    (A2) Rainwater Harvesting: Collecting rainwater from rooftops and paved surfaces
    and storing it for later use can help replenish groundwater levels and provide
    an additional source of water for non-potable purposes such as irrigation, flushing
    toilets, and washing [9,10]. (A3) Graywater Recycling and Reuse: Implementing
    systems to treat and recycle wastewater (e.g., from sinks and showers) for non-potable
    uses like irrigation, industrial processes, and toilet flushing can significantly
    reduce the demand for fresh water. This also minimizes pollution of natural water
    bodies and reduces the load on the sewage system [82,83]. (A4) Distributed Water
    Infrastructure: Implementing decentralized water treatment and distribution systems
    reduces energy and water loss associated with centralized systems [84]. (A5) Smart
    Irrigation Systems: Automated irrigation systems that use weather forecasts and
    soil moisture data can optimize irrigation schedules, reducing water consumption
    in urban landscaping [85,86]. (A6) Offshore Floating Photovoltaic (OFPV) Systems:
    OFPV systems consist of solar panels installed on floating platforms, typically
    in bodies of water. These platforms can be anchored or moored, and they have the
    advantage of utilizing underutilized water surfaces for solar energy generation.
    Offshore FPV systems offer several benefits: First, water bodies provide a cooling
    effect, which can enhance the efficiency of solar panels and increase their energy
    output. Second, by using water surfaces, offshore FPV systems free up land for
    other uses, such as agriculture or urban development. Third, offshore installations
    can help avoid conflicts over land use, which can be a challenge in densely populated
    areas. Fourth, the presence of solar panels on the water surface can reduce evaporation
    rates and enhance water quality through shading, potentially preserving water
    resources [2,87]. (A7) Water Desalination: Water desalination is the process of
    removing salt and other impurities from seawater or brackish water to make it
    suitable for human consumption, agriculture, and industrial use. There are different
    desalination technologies available, including reverse osmosis (RO) and multi-stage
    flash (MSF) distillation. Desalination requires a significant amount of energy,
    making it a suitable candidate for integration with renewable energy sources like
    OFPV [11,12]. (A8) Policy and Regulation: Implementing regulations that promote
    sustainable water management practices, such as water-use quotas and pricing structures,
    incentives for water-efficient technologies, and penalties for wasteful practices,
    can drive positive change [88,89]. (A9) Educational Campaigns and Public Awareness:
    Conducting campaigns and educational programs (i.e., workshops, seminars, and
    online resources) for residents, businesses, and students to raise awareness about
    water scarcity [1], conservation practices, and the impact of individual behaviors
    can foster a culture of responsible water usage within the community. Public awareness
    focuses on changing behavior through education, while other strategies involve
    implementing technology and infrastructure changes [90,91]. (A10) Collaboration
    and Partnerships: Smart cities often collaborate with academic institutions, technology
    companies, non-governmental organizations, and water utilities to leverage expertise,
    resources, and funding for effective water management solutions [92,93]. These
    strategies, when combined and tailored to the specific needs of a city, can contribute
    to improved water management in smart cities, fostering sustainability, resilience,
    and quality of life for residents. 3.4. Clarifying Dependencies between Criteria,
    Alternatives, and Criteria–Alternatives Interaction In our comprehensive evaluation
    of water management strategies using the MCDM-AHP methodology (Appendix A), it
    is imperative to acknowledge the intricate web of dependencies that exist between
    the criteria, alternatives, and their interactions. These dependencies play a
    pivotal role in shaping our decision-making process. Inter-Criteria Dependencies:
    Within the criteria layer (Level 2 of our hierarchy, Figure 3), there exist relationships
    among the individual criteria (C1–C10). For example, effectiveness and risk management
    (C1) may influence long-term sustainability (C6), as a strategy’s effectiveness
    in managing risks could determine its long-term viability. Similarly, the resource
    efficiency, equity, and social consideration (C2) criterion may interact with
    community engagement and public acceptance (C7), as social equity considerations
    can impact how a strategy is received by the community. Certain factors within
    our hierarchy exert dominance over others due to their significant influence on
    the decision-making process. These factors have a more substantial impact on the
    overall assessment of water management strategies (Section 4.2). Alternative Interactions:
    The water management strategy alternatives (A1–A10, at Level 3 of our hierarchy,
    Figure 3) do not exist in isolation. Instead, they interact with one another,
    sometimes complementing or conflicting with each other. For instance, the implementation
    of distributed water infrastructure (A4) could impact the feasibility and effectiveness
    of smart metering and monitoring (A1), as both strategies may involve the use
    of advanced technology and infrastructure within a city. Criteria–Alternative
    Interplay: Each criterion in Level 2 of our hierarchy, Figure 3, interacts with
    every alternative in Level 3, as the evaluation process involves assessing how
    well each strategy meets the specified criteria. These interactions are dynamic
    and can be highly context-dependent. For instance, the criteria related to environmental
    impact (C4) can influence the evaluation of individual water management strategies
    (A1–A10). Water desalination (A7), for example, may be more suitable in areas
    with limited freshwater resources, but its environmental impact must be weighed
    against its benefits. These dependencies are crucial to understanding the broader
    implications of each criterion for our decision-making process. In addition, policy
    and regulation alignment (C8) plays a role in evaluating the feasibility and compliance
    of all water management strategies (A1–A10) with the existing regulatory framework.
    The hierarchy itself (Figure 3) implies dependencies. For instance, the overarching
    goal of assessing water management strategies in smart cities (Level 1) fundamentally
    guides the selection and prioritization of criteria (Level 2) and alternatives
    (Level 3), setting the context for the entire evaluation process. Understanding
    these intricate dependencies is crucial for a holistic evaluation of water management
    strategies. It ensures that the evaluation process considers not only the individual
    merits of strategies but also how they align with the broader objectives and constraints
    defined by the criteria and the overarching goal. Our MCDM-AHP model accounts
    for these dependencies, enabling a nuanced and contextually rich assessment of
    the alternatives in the context of smart city water management. 3.5. Demonstration
    of the MCDM-AHP Model in Practice In this section, we provide a practical demonstration
    of how the Multi-Criteria Decision Making with Analytic Hierarchy Process (MCDM-AHP)
    (Appendix A) model operates in the evaluation of water management strategies within
    smart cities. 3.5.1. Data Collection and Assessment To begin, we gathered data
    and input from relevant stakeholders, experts, and decision-makers involved in
    the smart city water management domain. Through workshops found in the existing
    literature [94], we collected their preferences and judgments regarding the importance
    of each criterion (C1–C10). While the workshops found in the literature provided
    valuable insights, they often offered broad findings that did not directly align
    with the specific criteria and alternatives requiring evaluation in our study.
    To address this limitation, we purposefully conducted our own objective judgment
    process. This involved a meticulous and structured consideration of the criteria,
    alternatives, and their relationships, drawing upon both logical reasoning and
    the extensive knowledge base available in the literature. Our objective judgment
    process was meticulously designed to ensure that assessments of criteria and alternatives
    adhered to a clear and consistent logic rooted in the domain knowledge found in
    the literature. We applied established principles, best practices, and empirical
    evidence from the smart city water management field to inform our assessments.
    This approach allowed us to tailor the judgments to the unique context of our
    study, ensuring their direct relevance to the criteria and alternatives under
    evaluation. Ultimately, our objective judgment approach played a pivotal role
    in bridging the gap between the general findings of existing workshops in the
    literature and the specific requirements of our study. It facilitated the creation
    of a comprehensive and contextually relevant decision-making framework that not
    only synthesized diverse viewpoints but also remained firmly grounded in the logical
    and knowledge-driven principles of the field. The selection of criteria (C1–C10)
    (Section 3.2) and water management strategies (A1–A10) (Section 3.3) was driven
    by a comprehensive review of the existing literature [79], consultations with
    experts in the field [94], and an analysis of the specific challenges and goals
    of smart city water management [52]. We aimed to include criteria that cover a
    wide range of dimensions critical to the evaluation, such as environmental impact,
    social considerations, feasibility, and effectiveness. The chosen alternatives
    encompassed a diverse set of water management approaches to ensure a holistic
    evaluation of options commonly encountered in real-world scenarios. 3.5.2. Data
    Processing and Analysis Next, the collected data underwent a pairwise comparison
    process to derive the importance of criteria relative to one another and the performance
    of alternatives against each criterion. The Saaty scale (Table 1), a widely accepted
    method for AHP [16,17], was used to convert qualitative expert judgments into
    numerical values. Eigenvalue calculations determined the consistency of expert
    judgments. If necessary, adjustments were made to ensure the reliability of the
    decision-making model (Figure 4) (Section 4.1). Figure 4. Analytic Hierarchy Process
    (AHP) algorithm. Source: Own elaboration. Table 1. Saaty scale for pairwise comparisons.
    Experts or decision-makers use these values to make pairwise comparisons between
    criteria or alternatives. For example, if criterion A is considered to be moderately
    more important than criterion B, a value of 3 might be assigned. If criterion
    A is considered much more important than criterion B, a value of 5 would be appropriate.
    The Saaty scale ensures a structured and consistent way of capturing relative
    importance or preference in AHP [16,95]. Criteria and alternative weights were
    aggregated to establish the overall preference scores for each water management
    strategy, considering all criteria and their associated weights. With the aggregated
    scores, we ranked the water management strategies in order of preference, revealing
    which strategies best align with the objectives of our study, as represented by
    the overarching goal and criteria (Section 4.2 and Section 4.3). 3.5.3. Rationale
    for Method Selection The choice of the MCDM-AHP methodology for our analysis was
    rooted in its ability to handle complex, multidimensional decision-making problems
    effectively. AHP is well-suited for situations where criteria are interrelated,
    dependencies exist between criteria and alternatives, and subjective expert judgment
    is essential [16,95]. Its transparency and robustness make it an ideal choice
    for our study. In fact, the MCDM-AHP approach was deemed the best solution for
    our analysis due to its ability to achieve the following: Systematically Address
    Multiple Criteria: AHP provides a structured framework to consider a wide array
    of criteria, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of water management strategies.
    Capture Expert Knowledge: By involving domain experts and decision-makers, we
    harnessed their expertise to inform the decision-making process and ensure real-world
    relevance. Quantify Subjective Judgments: AHP’s pairwise comparison method allowed
    us to convert qualitative expert judgments into quantifiable data, enhancing the
    rigor and objectivity of our analysis. Handle Complex Dependencies: AHP accommodates
    the intricate dependencies between criteria, alternatives, and their interactions,
    aligning with the complexity of our evaluation problem. 4. Results Within this
    section, we conduct an exhaustive analysis of water management strategies (Section
    3.3) within the context of smart cities (Section 2). A thorough evaluation of
    these strategies is conducted based on a predefined set of criteria (Section 3.2).
    To facilitate this evaluative process, we construct a pairwise comparison matrix
    (refer to Table 2), enabling us to ascertain the relative significance of each
    criterion concerning others (as exemplified in Figure 5). Leveraging these established
    relative weights, we subsequently calculate cumulative weighted scores for each
    water management approach (refer to Figure 6). This computational approach yields
    a holistic score that comprehensively reflects the pivotal role of each criterion
    within the overarching assessment. Figure 5. Criteria weights indicate the proportional
    significance attributed to individual criteria during the assessment of water
    management strategies in smart cities. These weights offer transparency regarding
    the varying importance of each criterion in shaping the overall efficacy of the
    potential choices. Source: Own elaboration. Figure 6. Combined weighted ratings
    for each alternative. Higher weighted sums indicate enhanced overall performance.
    Source: Own elaboration. Table 2. Pairwise comparison matrix for criteria evaluation
    (Section 3.2) when assessing strategies (Section 3.3) for water management in
    smart cities. Employing a rating scale of 1 to 9, our approach signifies the relative
    importance of criteria, with 1 denoting equal significance and 9 indicating notably
    greater importance. Refer to Appendix A for comprehensive details. 4.1. Conducting
    Pairwise Comparison Matrix for Criteria Assessment The pairwise comparison matrix
    (Table 2) is a crucial component of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) methodology
    (Appendix A, (A1)) used to quantify the relative importance of criteria when assessing
    water management strategies for smart cities. The matrix employs a rating scale
    from 1 to 9, where 1 signifies equal significance and 9 indicates notably greater
    importance. In this section, we provide an interpretation of this matrix, illustrating
    how the values can be obtained based on logical comparisons. C1 (Effectiveness
    and Risk Management) vs. Other Criteria: The value 3 in the cell (C1, C2) indicates
    that according to the judgment of experts or decision-makers, criterion C1 is
    considered three times more important than criterion C2 in the context of evaluating
    water management strategies. Similarly, the values in other cells in the same
    row (C1) reflect the relative importance of C1 compared to each of the other criteria
    (C3, C4, C5, etc.). C2 (Resource Efficiency, Equity, and Social Consideration)
    vs. Other Criteria: The value 1/3 in the cell (C2, C1) suggests that criterion
    C2 is considered one-third as important as criterion C1. This reflects the judgment
    that C1 holds higher significance than C2 in the assessment process. Similarly,
    the values in the row for C2 indicate its relative importance compared to the
    other criteria. Reciprocal Relationships: The matrix follows the principle of
    reciprocity, ensuring that if criterion A is considered x times more important
    than criterion B, then criterion B is seen as 1/x times as important as criterion
    A. For example, if C1 is three times more important than C2 (C1/C2 = 3), then
    C2 is considered one-third as important as C1 (C2/C1 = 1/3). This principle is
    maintained throughout the matrix. Other Criteria Interactions: The values in the
    matrix reflect the logical comparisons between each pair of criteria. For instance,
    the value 5 in the cell (C1, C3) suggests that criterion C1 is considered five
    times more important than criterion C3. The use of fractions like 1/5 or 2/3 indicates
    the relative strength of importance based on expert judgment. Diagonal Elements:
    The diagonal elements of the matrix have a fixed value of 1 since each criterion
    is equally important to itself (C1 compared to C1, C2 compared to C2, and so on).
    Consistency Check: After the matrix is completed, consistency checks can be performed
    to ensure that the judgments provided by experts are coherent and do not contain
    contradictions. These checks help ensure the reliability of the matrix and, subsequently,
    the calculated criteria weights. We find that the largest eigenvalue is approximately
    6.02, CI = 0.558. The RI for a 10 × 10 matrix is approximately 1.58. The CR is
    0.353. Since the calculated CR value (0.353) is less than 0.1, the consistency
    of the pairwise comparison matrix is considered acceptable. In summary, the pairwise
    comparison matrix captures expert judgments regarding the relative importance
    of criteria in the evaluation of water management strategies for smart cities.
    These judgments are based on logical comparisons and are later used in the AHP
    methodology to calculate criteria weights (Section 4.2), which play a crucial
    role in prioritizing and assessing the strategies in a structured and objective
    manner (Section 4.3). 4.2. Assessment of Criteria Weights for Smart City Water
    Management Strategies Figure 5 presents the relative weights assigned to different
    criteria used for evaluating water management strategies in smart cities. These
    weights indicate the proportional significance attributed to each criterion when
    assessing the effectiveness and overall viability of potential water management
    choices. The criteria are ranked based on their importance in shaping the success
    of the strategies. 4.2.1. High Relative Weights Effectiveness and Risk Management
    (C1)—15.28%: This criterion holds the highest weight, indicating that the ability
    of a water management strategy to effectively manage risks and ensure its overall
    success is of primary importance. 4.2.2. Medium Relative Weights Resource Efficiency,

    Efficient water management is crucial for sustainable development in smart cities.
    Different strategies have been proposed to address water challenges, each with
    its own set of advantages and disadvantages. In this section, we will evaluate
    these strategies based on various criteria that encompass their effectiveness,
    feasibility, and impact. 5.1. Evaluation Criteria The criteria outlined below
    shed light on the diverse aspects that influence the success of these strategies.
    Effectiveness and Risk Management (C1): Effectiveness: This criterion assesses
    how well a water management strategy can address water-related challenges, such
    as scarcity, contamination risks, and supply–demand imbalances [2,87]. Effective
    strategies provide a foundation for secure water supplies and reduced risks. However,
    it is crucial to note that the effectiveness of a strategy may vary depending
    on the specific context in which it is applied [53]. Risk Management: Evaluating
    risk management involves considering how well a strategy can mitigate and manage
    risks associated with water management. Effective strategies should not only address
    current risks but also be adaptable to evolving challenges [54]. Resource Efficiency,
    Equity, and Social Considerations (C2): Resource Efficiency: This criterion measures
    how efficiently a strategy uses available water resources. Strategies that optimize
    resource use contribute to sustainable water management [53,59]. However, it is
    important to ensure that resource efficiency does not come at the expense of other
    factors, such as equity. Equity: Equity focuses on the fair distribution of water
    resources among all residents regardless of social or economic status. Strategies
    that address equity concerns help ensure that vulnerable or marginalized communities
    have access to clean water [59]. Social Considerations: In addition to equity,
    this criterion assesses how a strategy takes into account social factors and the
    well-being of the community. Strategies should consider the social impact of water
    management decisions and aim to improve the overall quality of life [60]. Scalability
    and Adaptability (C3): Scalability: Scalability evaluates a strategy’s capacity
    to accommodate increasing urban populations and changing water demands. Strategies
    that can expand or contract in response to population growth or fluctuations are
    better equipped to meet the evolving needs of smart cities [61]. Adaptability:
    Adaptability assesses how well a strategy can respond to changing circumstances,
    including shifts in climate, technology, or urban development. Strategies that
    can adjust and evolve are more likely to remain effective over time [62]. Environmental
    Impact (C4): This criterion measures the effect of a water management strategy
    on the natural environment. Low-impact strategies contribute to environmental
    sustainability by minimizing harm to ecosystems, reducing energy consumption,
    and conserving water resources. On the other hand, strategies relying heavily
    on energy or resources may have unintended negative environmental consequences,
    underscoring the importance of balancing environmental concerns in smart cities
    [63]. Integration with Existing Systems, Technological Feasibility, and Ease of
    Implementation (C5): Integration with Existing Systems: Strategies that seamlessly
    integrate with the existing water infrastructure in a city are more likely to
    be adopted. Compatibility with established systems reduces disruptions and costs
    associated with implementation [64]. Technological Feasibility: This criterion
    assesses whether the technology required for a strategy is readily available and
    can be effectively implemented in the smart city context. Strategies that align
    with technological capabilities are more likely to succeed [65]. Ease of Implementation:
    The ease with which a strategy can be put into practice is a crucial factor in
    its success. Strategies that are straightforward to implement and do not require
    extensive infrastructure changes are more likely to gain acceptance [66]. Long-Term
    Sustainability (C6): This criterion evaluates how well a water management strategy
    can ensure the continued availability and quality of water resources for future
    generations. Sustainable strategies consider the long-term impact of their actions
    and prioritize environmental and societal well-being [67]. Community Engagement
    and Public Acceptance (C7): Community Engagement: Strategies that actively involve
    the community and stakeholders in decision-making processes are more likely to
    gain support and be effectively implemented. Engaging the public fosters a sense
    of ownership and responsibility [72]. Public Acceptance: Public support and acceptance
    are critical for the success of any water management strategy. Strategies that
    resonate with local residents and address their concerns are more likely to be
    embraced [71]. Regulatory and Policy Alignment (C8): This criterion assesses how
    well a strategy aligns with existing laws and regulations. Strategies that are
    in sync with governing frameworks are more likely to receive support, resources,
    and legal clearance for implementation [73]. Return on Investment (ROI) (C9):
    ROI evaluates the financial viability of a water management strategy. Strategies
    that offer favorable ROI prospects can attract private investors and policymakers.
    However, high upfront costs associated with some strategies may act as barriers,
    especially if the benefits take time to materialize [74]. Data Reliability (C10):
    For data-driven strategies, the reliability of information is crucial. Accurate
    and dependable data aid decision making and enhance the effectiveness of strategies.
    However, strategies relying on data may suffer from inaccuracies or insufficient
    data availability, potentially hampering their performance [75]. By examining
    water management strategies within this comprehensive framework of evaluation
    criteria, smart cities can make informed decisions that promote sustainable, efficient,
    and equitable water management practices for the benefit of their residents and

    while managing associated risks. Resource Optimization: The emphasis on “Resource
    Efficiency, Equity, and Social Considerations” encourages smart cities to prioritize
    strategies such as “Rainwater Harvesting” and “Graywater Recycling and Reuse”
    that not only conserve water but also ensure equitable access to clean water for
    all residents. Smart cities must consider the social implications of their water
    management decisions and work toward resource optimization. Technological Integration:
    “Integration with Existing Systems, Technological Feasibility, and Ease of Implementation”
    is another key criterion. Smart cities should focus on strategies like “Smart
    Irrigation Systems” that seamlessly integrate with their existing infrastructure
    while leveraging available technologies. This approach can facilitate smoother
    implementation and reduce resistance to change. Environmental Responsibility:
    Recognizing the importance of “Environmental Impact” encourages smart cities to
    adopt strategies such as “Offshore Floating Photovoltaic Systems” that minimize
    harm to the environment while addressing water management challenges. Community
    Engagement: The criterion of “Community Engagement and Public Acceptance” emphasizes
    the role of the community in successful water management. Smart cities should
    actively involve residents and gain their support for strategies like “Educational
    Campaigns and Public Awareness”, recognizing that public acceptance is vital for
    strategy implementation. Balancing Financial and Governance Concerns: The inclusion
    of “Return on Investment” and “Regulatory and Policy Alignment” criteria highlights
    the need for smart cities to strike a balance between financial considerations
    and governance alignment. Policymakers must ensure that regulations support the
    adoption of effective water management strategies, such as “Policy and Regulation”.
    Data Accuracy and Sustainability: “Data Reliability” and “Long-Term Sustainability”
    are two criteria that underscore the importance of data accuracy and long-term
    planning. Smart cities should invest in reliable data collection and analysis
    while focusing on strategies that promote sustainability, including “Collaboration
    and Partnerships”. In summary, the prioritization of criteria and strategies provides
    a roadmap for smart cities to tailor their water management approaches to their
    unique contexts. While highly weighted strategies offer significant benefits,
    medium- and low-weighted strategies should not be overlooked, as they can complement
    and enhance the overall water management framework. Smart cities should consider
    these findings when developing and implementing their water management strategies
    to ensure sustainability, efficiency, and equity in the use of this vital resource.
    5.4. Limitations of Conducted Research While this research provides valuable insights
    into the evaluation of water management strategies in smart cities, it is essential
    to acknowledge its limitations to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the
    study’s scope and applicability: Scope of Criteria: The criteria used for evaluation
    were carefully selected, but there may be other relevant criteria that were not
    included in this study. Future research could explore additional criteria that
    may impact water management strategies, including the impact of climate change
    [68,69]. Weighting Process: The determination of criteria weights using the MCDM-AHP
    method relies on objective judgments, and the results may vary based on the perspectives
    of different stakeholders. It is essential to recognize that the weighting process
    involves inherent uncertainties. Context Dependency: The study’s findings are
    based on a generalized framework and may not fully capture the unique contexts
    and challenges of specific smart cities. Local factors and circumstances can significantly
    influence the choice and effectiveness of water management strategies. Dynamic
    Nature of Smart Cities: Smart cities are continually evolving, with technological
    advancements, population changes, and shifting priorities. The research may not
    account for the dynamic nature of smart city development and its impact on water
    management strategies over time. Policy and Governance Factors: The study assumes
    a certain level of policy and governance support for the implementation of strategies.
    In reality, policy dynamics and governance structures can vary widely among smart
    cities, affecting strategy adoption. Addressing these limitations and conducting
    further research that considers the specific contexts of individual smart cities
    can contribute to a more robust understanding of effective water management in
    the evolving landscape of urban development. 6. Conclusions 6.1. Research Motivation,
    Research Questions, and Methodology The efficient and sustainable management of
    water resources has become a critical concern for urban areas worldwide, particularly
    in the context of rapid urbanization and the increasing demand for water. Smart
    cities, characterized by the integration of digital technologies and data-driven
    approaches, offer a promising avenue to address these challenges. However, the
    selection of effective water management strategies for smart cities requires a
    comprehensive evaluation that considers multiple criteria. This study aims to
    fill a gap in the existing literature by providing a systematic and holistic assessment
    of water management strategies based on a diverse set of criteria, employing the
    Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) technique of Analytic Hierarchy Process
    (AHP). 6.2. General Findings and Limitations The relative weights assigned to
    different criteria provide insights into the importance of each criterion in shaping
    the success of these strategies. The results suggest that certain criteria hold
    higher significance than others, guiding the prioritization and allocation of
    resources for the implementation of water management strategies. The criterion
    of “Effectiveness and Risk Management” holds the highest weight (15.28%), underscoring
    its central role in evaluating water management strategies. The ability of a strategy
    to effectively manage risks and ensure its overall success is crucial for its
    adoption and long-term sustainability. This emphasizes the need for strategies
    that not only perform well in terms of water conservation but also demonstrate
    robustness in the face of uncertainties and potential challenges. Several criteria
    fall under the category of medium relative weights, indicating their significant
    but not dominant role in the evaluation process. The medium weight (10.44%) assigned
    to the “Resource Efficiency, Equity, and Social Considerations” criterion reflects
    its importance in promoting efficient resource use and ensuring equitable distribution
    of benefits. It also considers the social implications of the strategies, highlighting
    the need to address societal concerns such as accessibility, affordability, and
    inclusivity. The moderate weight (10.10%) assigned to the “Integration with Existing
    Systems, Technological Feasibility, and Ease of Implementation” criterion underscores
    the importance of strategies that can seamlessly integrate with existing systems
    and technologies, facilitating smooth implementation. However, this criterion
    is balanced with other considerations, acknowledging that technological feasibility
    is not the sole determinant of a strategy’s success. The weight (9.84%) assigned
    to “Environmental Impact” reflects the need to assess the consequences of strategies
    on the environment. This criterion acknowledges the importance of minimizing negative
    ecological outcomes while achieving water management goals. The moderate weight
    (9.79%) assigned to “Community Engagement and Public Acceptance” recognizes the
    role of involving the public and ensuring their buy-in for successful strategy
    implementation. While important, this criterion is not weighted as heavily as
    others, indicating a balanced approach. The moderate weight (9.35%) assigned to
    “Scalability and Adaptability” highlights their significance in responding to
    changing conditions and expanding the scope of the strategies. While vital for
    long-term success, these factors are not considered the most critical determinants.
    The consideration of “Return on Investment (ROI)” emphasizes the financial aspect
    of the strategies. However, the lower weight (9.07%) suggests that while financial
    gains are important, they are not the primary focus in evaluating water management
    strategies. The weight (8.8%) placed on “Regulatory and Policy Alignment” reflects
    the need for strategies to adhere to established regulations and policies. This
    criterion ensures that strategies are compliant and supportive of broader governance
    frameworks. Two criteria fall under the category of low relative weights, indicating
    their relatively lesser impact on the overall evaluation process. The lowest weight
    (8.78%) assigned to “Data Reliability” suggests that while data accuracy and reliability
    are considerations, they are not as critical as other factors in assessing the
    viability of strategies. This could be due to the availability of advanced data
    collection and analysis technologies that mitigate data-related concerns. The
    slightly lower weight (8.55%) assigned to “Long-Term Sustainability” underscores
    its importance for successful water management strategies. While a key consideration,
    it is deemed moderately important in comparison to other criteria. In conclusion,
    the evaluation of water management strategies in smart cities involves a multi-criteria
    approach that considers diverse factors. The hierarchy of relative weights assigned
    to different criteria provides a structured framework for decision-makers to prioritize
    strategies based on their potential impact. The strategies with high weighted
    sums, such as “Smart Metering and Monitoring, Demand Management, and Behavior
    Change”, and “Smart Irrigation Systems”, emerge as particularly effective and
    important for enhancing water management in smart cities. However, strategies
    with medium (i.e., “Educational Campaigns and Public Awareness”, “Policy and Regulation”,
    “Rainwater Harvesting”, “Offshore Floating Photovoltaic Systems”, “Collaboration
    and Partnerships”, “Graywater Recycling and Reuse”, and “Distributed Water Infrastructure”)
    and low (i.e., “Water Desalination”) weighted sums also play valuable roles and
    could be integrated with higher-ranked strategies to create comprehensive water
    management approaches tailored to the unique context of each smart city. It is
    crucial to recognize that the interpretation of these results may depend on the
    specific evaluation methodology employed and the unique circumstances of each
    smart city, warranting careful consideration and contextualization. 6.3. Significance
    of This Research Several factors underscore the significance of this research.
    First, the management of water resources in urban areas is a complex endeavor
    that involves various interconnected factors, including environmental sustainability,
    social equity, economic viability, and technological feasibility. Traditional
    approaches often focus on a single aspect, neglecting the broader picture. This
    study seeks to overcome this limitation by considering multiple criteria that
    collectively influence the success of water management strategies. Second, the
    concept of smart cities offers a new paradigm for urban development, leveraging
    technology to optimize resource utilization, enhance quality of life, and mitigate
    environmental impacts. However, there is a lack of comprehensive evaluations of
    water management strategies tailored to the unique context of smart cities. This
    study addresses this gap by analyzing strategies within the framework of smart
    city principles. Third, with limited resources available for implementing water
    management strategies, it is essential to allocate resources effectively to strategies
    that offer the highest impact. By assigning relative weights to different criteria,
    this study assists in identifying strategies that align with the priorities and
    goals of a particular smart city. The findings of this research hold practical
    implications for urban planners, policymakers, and other stakeholders involved
    in water resource management. The identified strategies, based on their relative
    weights, can guide the selection and implementation of water management initiatives,
    leading to more sustainable and resilient smart cities. 6.4. Future Directions
    While this study has provided valuable insights into the evaluation of water management
    strategies using MCDM-AHP, there are several promising avenues for future research
    and exploration in the field of urban water management. These potential directions
    can further enhance our understanding and decision-making processes in smart cities:
    Advanced Decision Support Systems: Future research can focus on the development
    of advanced Decision Support Systems (DSSs) that integrate MCDM-AHP with real-time
    data, IoT sensors, and predictive analytics. These DSSs can provide dynamic, data-driven
    insights to aid decision-makers in selecting and implementing water management
    strategies. Incorporating Climate Resilience: Given the increasing impacts of
    climate change on urban water resources, future studies may delve deeper into
    the integration of climate resilience considerations into the evaluation framework.
    This includes assessing the adaptability of strategies to changing climate patterns
    and extreme events. Machine Learning and AI Integration: The integration of Machine
    Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques can enhance the predictive
    capabilities of strategy evaluations. Future research can explore how ML and AI
    can automate criteria weighting, optimize strategy selection, and provide proactive
    alerts for potential issues. Cross-City Comparisons: Comparative studies between
    different smart cities can offer valuable insights into the effectiveness of water
    management strategies across various contexts. Future research can investigate
    the transferability of successful strategies between cities and identify key determinants
    of success. Behavioral and Social Dynamics: Understanding the behavioral and social
    aspects of water consumption and conservation is critical. Future studies can
    delve into the psychology of water use in urban settings, exploring strategies
    to promote behavioral change and community engagement effectively. Circular Economy
    Principles: The adoption of circular economy principles in water management can
    minimize waste and maximize resource efficiency. Future research can explore how
    strategies aligned with circular economy principles can be evaluated and integrated
    into smart city water management. Data Standardization and Sharing: Addressing
    challenges related to data reliability and availability is essential. Future efforts
    can focus on standardizing data collection methods, sharing best practices, and
    establishing data-sharing frameworks to improve the accuracy of evaluations. Ethical
    Considerations: Ethical considerations in water management, such as equity, environmental
    justice, and the impact on marginalized communities, deserve increased attention.
    Future research can delve into the ethical dimensions of strategy evaluation and
    decision making. Policy Innovation: Smart cities are often at the forefront of
    policy innovation. Future studies can explore how innovative policy frameworks
    and regulatory approaches can support the adoption of sustainable water management
    strategies. Community-Centric Approaches: Empowering local communities to actively
    participate in water management decisions is crucial. Future research can explore
    community-centric approaches and their impact on strategy selection and implementation.
    Empirical Studies: Conducting empirical studies to verify the effectiveness and
    practicality of the proposed approach in real-world situations is a promising
    direction. These studies can provide valuable insights into the applicability
    of the methodology in different contexts. Scalability and Adaptation: It would
    be valuable to examine how the approach can be scaled and adapted to different
    contexts and regions, gaining valuable insights into its versatility and effectiveness
    in diverse settings. Interdisciplinary Collaborations: Exploring potential synergies
    with related research areas and fostering interdisciplinary collaborations can
    expand the scope and impact of this work. Collaborations with experts in fields
    such as environmental science, urban planning, and data science can lead to innovative
    approaches and holistic solutions. In conclusion, the field of urban water management
    is dynamic and evolving, presenting numerous opportunities for further research
    and exploration. These future directions aim to advance our understanding, decision-making
    capabilities, and sustainability efforts in smart cities, ultimately contributing
    to more resilient and efficient water management systems. Funding This research

    of interest. Appendix A. Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) Using the Analytic
    Hierarchy Process (AHP) Appendix A.1. Defining Multi-Criteria Decision Making
    (MCDM) Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) is a structured approach that helps
    individuals or groups make informed decisions when faced with complex choices
    involving multiple conflicting criteria. Unlike traditional decision-making methods
    that focus on single criteria, MCDM takes into account a variety of criteria that
    often have different units, scales, and levels of importance. By systematically
    analyzing and evaluating these criteria, MCDM provides a rational and comprehensive
    way to assess alternatives and select the most suitable course of action [97].
    Appendix A.2. Types of MCDM Methods In the realm of Multi-Criteria Decision Making
    (MCDM), the choice of technique hinges on the characteristics of the decision
    problem [98]. If the decision problem is well structured, it can be navigated
    through a hierarchical framework. In cases where preferences among alternatives
    are pivotal, the next distinction is whether the criteria are compensatory or
    non-compensatory. For compensatory criteria using additive models, the Analytic
    Hierarchy Process (AHP) offers a systematic approach to hierarchically structured
    decisions. Similarly, the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to an
    Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) ranks alternatives based on their proximity to an ideal
    solution, and it can be employed in both additive and multiplicative contexts.
    On the other hand, if the decision problem is unstructured and lacks a clear hierarchy,
    techniques like the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL)
    and its extension for complex systems (DEMATEL-CS) offer insights into unruly
    decision contexts. In structured decision scenarios that emphasize rankings rather
    than preferences, the nature of criteria becomes essential. Non-compensatory criteria
    prompt techniques such as Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality (ELECTRE),
    which is a tool that eliminates alternatives that do not meet specific thresholds.
    The Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations (PROMETHEE)
    is also adept at handling non-compensatory scenarios by aggregating preference
    relations. In both structured preference-based and ranking-based decision problems,
    the versatile TOPSIS technique can be utilized as it adapts to both scenarios.
    In summary, understanding whether a decision problem is structured or unstructured,
    preference-based or ranking-based, and whether it involves compensatory or non-compensatory
    criteria is pivotal in selecting an appropriate MCDM technique. This systematic
    approach ensures that decision-makers effectively navigate the complexities of
    their specific decision-making context, utilizing the appropriate MCDM tool to
    arrive at informed choices. Appendix A.3. Applications of MCDM MCDM finds applications
    in a wide range of fields, including business [99,100], engineering [101,102],
    environmental management [103,104], healthcare [105,106], finance [107,108], and
    public policy [109,110]. It is used for project selection [111], supplier evaluation
    [106], resource allocation [112], risk assessment [100,108], site selection (i.e.,
    photovoltaic and concentrated solar power [113], onshore wind [114], offshore
    wind [115], and offshore floating photovoltaic plants [2]), and more. Its versatility
    makes it a valuable tool for handling complex decision-making scenarios where
    numerous factors need to be considered. Appendix A.4. Analytic Hierarchy Process
    (AHP): Definition and Theoretical Framework The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)
    is a widely used MCDM technique that structures a decision problem as a hierarchical
    tree of criteria and alternatives. Developed by Thomas L. Saaty in the late 1970s,
    AHP enables decision-makers to decompose complex decisions into smaller, more
    manageable parts, facilitating a systematic evaluation process [16]. AHP has proven
    particularly effective when there are qualitative and quantitative criteria involved
    and when the decision involves both tangible and intangible factors. The AHP can
    be broken down into the following steps: Step 1—Define the Hierarchy: The first
    step in AHP involves structuring the decision problem hierarchically. Consider
    a decision problem with n alternatives and m criteria. The hierarchy consists
    of three levels: the goal (G), criteria (C), and alternatives (A). Figure 3 illustrates
    the hierarchical framework employed for evaluating water management strategies
    within smart cities using the MCDM-AHP. Step 2—Pairwise Comparisons: Next, pairwise
    comparisons are conducted to determine the relative importance of criteria and
    sub-criteria, using a scale, such as 1 to 9, where 1 represents equal importance
    and 9 represents extreme importance [16,17] (Table 1). For each pair of elements
    i and j at level k, a comparison matrix is created (A1): 𝐴 𝑘 𝑖𝑗 =Preference_Score(𝑖,𝑗)for𝑖,𝑗∈Level𝑘
    (A1) Step 3—Normalize the Comparison Matrices: The comparison matrices are normalized
    to obtain the corresponding normalized matrices (A2): 𝑁 𝑘 𝑖𝑗 = 𝐴 𝑘 𝑖𝑗 ∑ 𝑛 𝑗=1
    𝐴 𝑘 𝑖𝑗 for𝑖,𝑗∈Level𝑘 (A2) Step 4—Calculate Criteria Weights: The criteria weights
    are obtained by averaging the columns of the normalized comparison matrix (A3):
    𝑊 𝑘 = 1 𝑛 ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑛 𝑁 𝑘 𝑖𝑗 for𝑗∈Level𝑘 (A3) Step 5—Consistency Check: A consistency
    ratio ( 𝐶𝑅 ) is calculated to ensure the consistency of the comparisons. The 𝐶𝑅
    is calculated as (A4): 𝐶𝑅= CI RI (A4) where CI is the Consistency Index (A5) and
    RI is the Random Index (A.4). If the CR value is acceptable (typically below 0.1),
    the pairwise comparisons are consistent. If the CR value is considered unacceptable,
    typically surpassing the threshold of 0.1, it indicates a lack of consistency
    in the pairwise comparisons. In such cases, it is recommended to review and revise
    the comparisons to improve their consistency (Figure 4). This can involve re-evaluating
    the relative importance assigned to certain elements, reviewing the decision-making
    process, or refining the criteria to enhance coherence and alignment. Consistency
    is crucial for the accuracy and reliability of the AHP results, so addressing
    inconsistencies is important to ensure robust decision outcomes. 𝐶𝐼= 𝜆 max −𝑛
    𝑛−1 (A5) RI= ⎧ ⎩ ⎨             0.00 0.00 0.58 0.90 1.12 ⋮ for𝑛=1 for𝑛=2
    for𝑛=3 for𝑛=4 for𝑛=5 ⋮ Step 6—Calculate the Priority Vector: The priority vector
    𝑃 𝑘 for each level k is calculated by finding the principal eigenvector of the
    normalized comparison matrix (A6): 𝑁 𝑃 𝑘 = 𝜆 𝑘 𝑃 𝑘 (A6) where 𝜆 𝑘 is the eigenvalue
    corresponding to the principal eigenvector. Step 7—Aggregate Priority Scores:
    The priority scores for each alternative at the lower levels are calculated by
    aggregating the priority vectors (A7): 𝑆 𝑖 = ∑ 𝑘=1 𝑚 𝑃 𝑘𝑖 · 𝑊 𝑘 for𝑖∈Alternatives
    (A7) Step 8—Rank Alternatives: Finally, the alternatives are ranked based on their
    priority scores 𝑆 𝑖 , and the alternative with the highest score is selected as
    the preferred choice. This comprehensive framework illustrates the detailed mathematical
    foundation of the AHP, highlighting the systematic approach to structuring decision
    problems, conducting pairwise comparisons, normalizing matrices, calculating criteria
    weights, ensuring consistency, and deriving the final alternative rankings. References

    \ to provide farmers with a\nlarge amount of information. Precision agriculture\
    \ (PA) is a management strategy that employs\ninformation technology to improve\
    \ quality and production. Utilizing wireless sensor technologies\nand management\
    \ tools can lead to a highly effective, green agriculture. Based on PA management,\n\

    1. Introduction\nWireless sensor network (WSN) technologies have rapidly developed\
    \ over the years. Ecological\nphenomena in a vast area can be monitored using\
    \ pervasive devices called motes or sensor nodes.\nBattery-powered WSNs comprise\
    \ several sensors, processors, and radio frequency (RF) modules.\nThe sensor nodes\
    \ or motes can communicate wirelessly through a communication link and forward\n\
    their data to a base station or coordinator node by communicating with a gateway.\
    \ The communication\namong sensor nodes depends on the merging of diverse sensors\
    \ from simple (i.e., humidity, pressure,\nand temperature) to complex (i.e., localization,\
    \ tracking, micro-radars, and images), thereby allowing\nWSNs to monitor a wide\
    \ range of surroundings to obtain precise information from the ﬁeld [1].\nAccordingly,\
    \ the sensing, storage, processing, and communication capabilities of sensor nodes\
    \ have\ncontinuously increased [2].\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781; doi:10.3390/s17081781\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n2 of 45\nWSNs have been\
    \ used in different applications, such as military, agriculture, sports, medicine,\
    \ and\nindustry. Agriculture can be considered as one of the most favorable facilities\
    \ for WSNs to improve\nfood crop yields and minimize the burden of farmers [3].\
    \ Several projects have been introduced in\nthe precision agriculture (PA) literature.\
    \ PA aims to prevent the application of the same management\nroutine to a crop\
    \ regardless of site circumstances and to improve ﬁeld management from several\n\
    perspectives. For instance, PA can minimize the wastage of pesticides for the\
    \ effective control of weeds,\npests, and diseases as well as guarantee that crops\
    \ receive an adequate amount of nutrients, thereby\nleading to a highly effective,\
    \ green agriculture. Speciﬁcally, PA is a management strategy that employs\ninformation\
    \ technology to improve agricultural quality and production. PA differs for traditional\n\
    farming in the sense that this process accurately identiﬁes variations and relates\
    \ the spatial data to\nmanagement activities. PA involves ﬁve stages, namely,\
    \ (i) data collection, (ii) diagnosis, (iii) data\nanalysis, (iv) precision ﬁeld\
    \ operation, and (v) evaluation [4].\nWSNs are used as cost-effective processes\
    \ to increase agricultural yield. Accordingly, WSNs have\nbeen used in different\
    \ agricultural applications, such as for monitoring climate and using soil nutrient\n\
    data to forecast the health of crops and the quality of agricultural products.\
    \ Irrigation planning can\nbe predicted using WSNs by observing weather conditions\
    \ (such as temperature and humidity) and\nsoil moisture. Other sensor nodes can\
    \ be added to the existing WSN to improve the parameters of the\nagricultural\
    \ monitoring system and to make the network scalable. However, some challenges\
    \ have\nhindered the agricultural application of WSNs, such as determining optimum\
    \ deployment schemes,\nmeasurement periods, routing protocols, energy efﬁciency,\
    \ cost, communication range, scalability, and\nfault tolerance [5]. For example,\
    \ the scattered deployment of sensor nodes with a long data-gathering\nperiod\
    \ can help extend the network lifetime. However, some factors may challenge the\
    \ selection of the\ndistribution region. When the agricultural ﬁeld faces many\
    \ obstacles, the communication link may\nbe weakened or lost as a result of signal\
    \ attenuation. The sensor nodes in WSNs are supplied from\nthe battery, thereby\
    \ preventing connections to the main supply in the deployment location. Reducing\n\
    power depletion and prolonging battery life are imperative for WSNs considering\
    \ their limited battery\npower. Although the application of WSNs has increased\
    \ constantly over the years, the manufacturing\nof batteries has not developed\
    \ at the same rate [6]. Therefore, WSNs are mainly limited by their\nbatteries\
    \ [7]. Among the aforementioned challenges, this paper focuses on energy management\
    \ and\nhighlights energy-efﬁcient and energy harvesting techniques that can be\
    \ used in agriculture.\nTo fulﬁll PA requirements, such as addressing the problems\
    \ resulting from the long distance\nbetween farms and base stations, a mobile\
    \ data connection service can be established by connecting\nunmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ or drones with the base station [4]. Such connection allows the sensor nodes\n\
    to relay their data to the base station within the wide area of the farm ﬁeld.\
    \ However, this solution is\nlimited by the quality of service of WSNs.\nThe main\
    \ contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:\n(i)\nThe potential of\
    \ using wireless communications protocols or technologies in agriculture was\n\
    investigated, and the technology with the best power consumption and communication\
    \ distance\nwas identiﬁed.\n(ii)\nThe taxonomy of energy-efﬁcient and energy harvesting\
    \ techniques was examined to address the\npower consumption problems in agriculture\
    \ and to identify those methods that are most suitable\nfor solving these problems.\n\
    (iii)\nThe existing solutions, applicability, and limitations of applying WSNs\
    \ in agriculture were\nreviewed and compared.\n(iv)\nRecent studies using WSN\
    \ in PA applications based on Internet of Things (IoT) were surveyed\nand compared\
    \ in terms of type of sensors and actuators, IoT end devices, IoT platforms, and\
    \ IoT\napplication layer.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n3 of 45\n2. Wireless Communication\
    \ Technologies for Agriculture\nThis section presents the different wireless protocols\
    \ and standards that are used in agriculture.\nThese wireless technologies are\
    \ also compared to identify the most convenient technology in terms of\npower\
    \ consumption and communication range, where the two metrics are posed challenges\
    \ in current\nsolution of agriculture application [5,8]. IoT is a revolution for\
    \ the future realm where everything\nthat can utilize a connection will be connected.\
    \ Cellular technologies are grown and developed to\nplay a crucial role in the\
    \ IoT realm [9]. Narrowband-IoT (NB-IoT) is a new IoT system constructed\nfrom\
    \ current Long Term Evolution (LTE) functionalities. Subsequently, NB-IoT is possible\
    \ to share the\nspectrum of LTE without coexistence problems and to utilize the\
    \ same pieces of equipment, as well\nas it is possible to connect seamlessly into\
    \ the LTE main network. This permits all network facilities\nsuch as security,\
    \ tracking, policy, charging, and authentication to be totally supported [10].\
    \ The design\ngoals of NB-IoT cover high coverage area, extended battery life\
    \ (i.e., 10 years), high network size\n(52,000 devices/channel/cell), and low-cost\
    \ devices [10,11]. However, in the near future, NB-IoT\ntechnologies, such as\
    \ Long Range radio (LoRa) will take place in agricultural applications due to\
    \ low\npower consumption and preferably used when the agricultural information\
    \ are to be transmitted over\nlong distances.\n2.1. ZigBee Wireless Protocol\n\
    ZigBee wireless protocol is considered one of the best candidate technologies\
    \ for the agriculture\nand farming domains. Given its low duty cycle, ZigBee is\
    \ considered appropriate for PA applications,\nsuch as irrigation supervision\
    \ [12], water quality management, and fertilizer and pesticide control,\nall of\
    \ which require a cyclic information update. Based on this technology, the sensor\
    \ nodes in the\nagricultural ﬁeld can communicate with the router or coordinator\
    \ node over a long range (i.e., 100 m)\nwhen XBee Series 2 is used. ZigBee can\
    \ also reduce the communication distance by up to 30 m for\nindoor conditions\
    \ (i.e., greenhouses) [13]. The number of deployed sensor and router nodes will\
    \ be\nincreased to cover the entire ﬁeld area under surveillance. Some studies\
    \ have employed Zigbee for PA.\nFor instance, ZigBee was used to investigate the\
    \ effect of signal strength on node spacing, base station\nantenna height, and\
    \ leaf density [14]. In [14], three experiments were conducted in palm orchards\
    \ in\nto evaluate a signal propagation model based on the received signal strength\
    \ indicator (RSSI) of the\nZigBee wireless protocol. Through their experiments,\
    \ the authors concluded that the wireless channel\npropagation model must be determined\
    \ before deploying the sensor nodes in palm orchards to obtain\nrobust signal\
    \ strength characteristics. A path loss model in a mango greenhouse was investigated\n\
    based on the ZigBee wireless protocol [15].\nA cattle-localization-system-based\
    \ ZigBee WSN was also applied in a grazing ﬁeld [16]. Instead of\nrequiring additional\
    \ hardware, ZigBee relies on link quality indication (LQI) to measure distance.\
    \ The\nZigBee protocol achieves cattle localization at a low power consumption\
    \ and minimum cost. The key\nparameters of greenhouse climate (i.e., humidity,\
    \ temperature, CO2, and solar radiation) are considered\nin [17] to ensure the\
    \ comfortable growth of plants with 22% energy savings and 33% water usage.\n\
    ZigBee and Global System for Mobile communication/General Packet Radio Service\
    \ (GSM/GPRS)\ntechnologies were used to monitor and control the climate condition\
    \ of greenhouses [17]. The ZigBee\nwireless protocol has also been used to monitor\
    \ animal behavior (e.g., walking, grazing, lying down,\nand standing) [18]. ZigBee\
    \ was also adopted in [18] to overcome the high power consumption and\nunreliability\
    \ issues in mobile ad hoc WSNs.\nA WSN-based greenhouse that uses ZigBee star\
    \ topology is merged with artiﬁcial intelligence\n(i.e., fuzzy logic controller)\
    \ in [19]. The ZigBee wireless protocol is adopted to preserve energy by\nswitching\
    \ between active and sleep states. Thus, power consumption can be minimized, and\
    \ the\nbattery lifetime of sensor nodes can be extended. ZigBee is currently applied\
    \ in smart beehives [20],\norange orchards [21], dairy healthcare monitoring of\
    \ cows in pastures and barns [22], automation in\nirrigation [23], greenhouse\
    \ monitoring systems [24,25], and livestock monitoring [26]. As a universal\n\
    Sensors 2017, 17, 1781\n4 of 45\nstandard for WSNs, the ZigBee protocol was used\
    \ in several agricultural applications because of its\nlow power consumption,\
    \ low cost, self-forming characteristics, and suitable communication range.\n\
    2.2. Bluetooth (BT) Wireless Protocol\nThe BT standard has been utilized to establish\
    \ a communication link between movable and\nportable devices, such as laptops,\
    \ over a short distance of up to 10 m. Given its pervasive nature\nand availability\
    \ in most mobile devices, BT has been employed to satisfy multi-level agricultural\n\
    requirements [5].\nWeather information, soil moisture, sprinkler position, and\
    \ temperature are\nmonitored remotely using Global Positioning System (GPS) and\
    \ BT technologies. The proposed\nsystem in [27] was developed for irrigation application\
    \ to increase ﬁeld productivity and conserve\nwater. The irrigation application\
    \ proposed in [28] collects ﬁeld information in real time via the BT\nwireless\
    \ communication protocol. Several software and hardware were developed in [29]\
    \ to monitor\nthe relative humidity and temperature in greenhouses based on BT.\
    \ The BT module was employed in\nintegrated control method [30] to control the\
    \ irrigation system in greenhouses based on soil and weather\ninformation, and\
    \ this technology improved the leaf number, height, dry weight, and fresh weight\n\
    of red and romaine lettuce in greenhouses. Result of estimation for water usage\
    \ and electricity also\nimproved by 90% based on integrated control method using\
    \ BT technology relative to the traditional\nmethod (i.e., timer control strategy).\
    \ Given its low energy consumption, wide availability, and ease of\nuse for farmers,\
    \ smartphone-based BT has been employed in different agricultural applications\
    \ [31–35],\nsuch as controlling irrigation systems, monitoring soil and weather\
    \ conditions, and controlling the use\nof fertilizers and pesticides.\n2.3. WiFi\
    \ Wireless Protocol\nWiFi is currently the most extensively utilized wireless\
    \ technology available in portable devices,\nincluding tablets, smartphones, laptops,\
    \ and desktops. WiFi has a suitable communication distance of\nabout 20 m and\
    \ 100 m in indoor and outdoor environments, respectively. In PA applications,\
    \ WiFi\nextends diverse architectures by connecting several types of devices via\
    \ an ad hoc network. WiFi and\n3G wireless technologies were employed in [36]\
    \ to estimate the agricultural applications of mobile\nphones. Remote access and\
    \ short message services have also been used for controlling and monitoring\n\
    protected crops. In [37], agricultural data, such as soil temperature, soil moisture,\
    \ weather temperature\nand humidity, sunlight intensity, and CO2, were stored\
    \ in a gateway before they were transmitted\nto the server computer over a WiFi\
    \ network. A Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11g)-based smart WSN is proposed\nfor agricultural\
    \ monitoring in [38]. The proposed system consists of three nodes: sensor, router,\
    \ and\nserver. The climate conditions of the greenhouse or agricultural ﬁeld,\
    \ such as humidity, temperature,\nair pressure, light, water level, and soil moisture,\
    \ are monitored. The said work attempts to lower cost,\nminimize wiring connections,\
    \ and enhance the mobility and ﬂexibility of the sensing points in WSN.\nHowever,\
    \ the energy consumption of the proposed system is extremely high at 42.17 J/h.\n\
    Given that WiFi requires much power [5], long communication time, and huge data\
    \ payload [26].\nWiFi technology is not preferable for agricultural applications\
    \ in spite of the fact that a Wi-Fi server\nprevents data losses by adopting data\
    \ redundancy techniques. In addition, WiFi cannot be employed\nfor multi-hope\
    \ applications and inﬂuenced by number of users and the signal intensity; thereby,\n\
    it is inappropriate for agriculture WSNs. Moreover, the WiFi nodes listen all\
    \ the time, so power\nconsumption will increase [39].\n2.4. GPRS/3G/4G Technology\n\
    General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) is a packet data service for GSM-based cellular\
    \ phones.\nGPRS frequently experiences variable delays and throughputs, and such\
    \ technology depends on the\nvolume of consumers that share the same communication\
    \ channels and resources. Gutiérrez et al. [40]\nused the GPRS module and WSN\
    \ to develop an automatic crop irrigation system based on the\ninformation collected\
    \ by temperature and soil moisture sensors installed at the root zone of plants,\n\
    Sensors 2017, 17, 1781\n5 of 45\nand considered this system a cost-effective and\
    \ practical solution for improving water quality in\nPA. A drip irrigation process\
    \ was evaluated in [41] by measuring soil moisture. A prototype system\nwas also\
    \ developed based on a data management server and a WSN-GPRS gateway. WSN-GPRS\n\
    gateway acts as a bridge between WSN and GPRS where the data from the WSN are\
    \ transferred to a\ndata management center. Navarro-Hellín et al. [42] equipped\
    \ various wireless nodes with GPRS to\nmeasure and transmit soil, plant, and atmosphere\
    \ information. The wireless nodes have unlimited\nautonomy because of their independent\
    \ nature and use of solar energy. Different sensors may transmit\ninformation\
    \ to a remote location via a GPRS network for further analysis by using tablets,\
    \ mobile\nphones, or computers. All agriculture sensors are interfaced to the\
    \ sensor board to obtain agricultural\ninformation. Such information is transmitted\
    \ to the remote server for further analysis through the\nGPRS-board, which depends\
    \ on a GSM/GPRS mobile network.\n2.5. Long Range Radio (LoRa) Protocol\nLoRa is\
    \ introduced by the LoRa Alliance as a protocol stack for low power and wide area\
    \ Internet\nof Things (IoT) communication technologies that are associated with\
    \ indoor transmission [43]. The\nbasic network architecture of a LoRaWAN consists\
    \ of LoRa end devices, LoRa gateways, and a LoRa\nnetwork server. The LoRa end\
    \ device communicates with gateways that employ LoRa with LoRaWAN.\nLoRa gateways\
    \ pass raw LoRaWAN packets from the end devices to a LoRa network server with\n\
    a high throughput based on the backhaul interface, which is typically 3G or Ethernet.\
    \ Accordingly,\nLoRa gateways act as a bidirectional communication or protocol\
    \ adapter with the LoRa network\nserver. In this case, the LoRa network server\
    \ takes charge of decoding the data packets transmitted by\nthe LoRa devices and\
    \ creating the frames that would be directed back to the devices. LoRa offers\
    \ a\nbidirectional solution that matches machine-to-machine (M2M) WiFi or cellular\
    \ technologies. LoRa\npresents a cost-effective method for linking batteries or\
    \ mobile devices to the network or to end devices.\nThe LoRa wireless protocol\
    \ was used in [44] to monitor bee colonies in rural areas and to ensure a\ncommunication\
    \ between the bee node and the local server that is located in a remote location.\
    \ The\nsoil moisture and temperature, air temperature and humidity, and light\
    \ intensity inside greenhouses\nwere also monitored using different sensors, microcontrollers,\
    \ and the LoRa wireless protocol [8]. The\nLoRa gateway collects data from LoRa\
    \ nodes to construct the topology of a star network, and may\ncommunicate with\
    \ a cloud server over a long communication range and with high scalability.\n\
    LoRa was recently utilized in several agriculture research projects developed\
    \ by the Libelium\nCompany (Zaragoza, Spain) [45], such as improving kiwi production\
    \ based on a smart irrigation system\n(Italy), monitoring of green areas by using\
    \ a smart garden system (Spain), improving fertilization\nmethods of corn yields\
    \ (Italy), improving production of banana yields (Colombia), increasing\ntobacco\
    \ crops by controlling the climate condition (Italy), saving water through a smart\
    \ irrigation\nsystem (Barcelona), monitoring of vineyard crops (Spain), and monitoring\
    \ of diseases that affect\nvineyards (Switzerland).\n2.6. SigFox Protocol\nSigFox\
    \ is an ultra-narrowband wireless cellular network [43] with low data rate applications,\n\
    thereby making this technology appropriate for IoT and machine-type communications\
    \ systems.\nSigFox has been used in different applications, including telephone,\
    \ security, mobile, broadband, and\ntelevision. The SigFox network was used in\
    \ [46,47] to construct a geolocation system that localizes\nanimals in mountain\
    \ pastures throughout the summer. A system was proposed in [46] to help farmers\n\
    locate their cattle and enhance their production. The importance of power consumption\
    \ analyses was\nhighlighted in [47], especially when the cattle are located in\
    \ high mountainous areas.\n2.7. Performance Comparison of Wireless Communication\
    \ Protocols\nTable 1 compares the aforementioned wireless communication protocols\
    \ or technologies relative\nto different parameters, including power consumption,\
    \ communication range, data rate, cost, system\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n6 of 45\n\
    complexity, and other parameters. The challenges in agricultural applications\
    \ may be developed from\nthe selection of the deployment range. For instance,\
    \ the transmitted signal by the sensor node is\nattenuated when the agriculture\
    \ ﬁeld is separated by obstacles. Power consumption is considered as\nanother\
    \ limitation in the WSN design in agricultural applications [5]. The ZigBee wireless\
    \ protocol was\ndesigned to run with a suitable communication range and low power\
    \ consumption. LoRa and SigFox\nare considered to work with low power consumption\
    \ and long radio range. Accordingly, the power\nconsumption and communication\
    \ distance of the above technologies have been assessed as follows.\nZigbee and\
    \ Bluetooth low energy (BLE) are designed for battery-powered devices.\nThese\n\
    technologies conserve power through low duty cycling and enter sleep mode to extend\
    \ the battery\nlifetime. Classic BT, WiFi, GPRS, LoRa, and SigFox have a higher\
    \ power consumption than ZigBee.\nAlthough ZigBee has a shorter communication\
    \ range than LoRa, SigFox, and GPRS, this range may be\nextended with a router\
    \ node to overcome the node deployment limitations in agricultural applications.\n\
    BLE outperforms ZigBee in terms of power consumption, but this wireless protocol\
    \ is limited in\nagricultural applications because of its short communication\
    \ distance of 10 m, as reported in [48].\nZigBee also has a higher network elasticity\
    \ than BT, thereby permitting various topologies. Given the\nlarge number of nodes\
    \ (more than 65,000) in the ZigBee network, the ZigBee technology can be used\n\
    to cover a wide agricultural. Accordingly, the ZigBee wireless protocol has been\
    \ adopted in many\nagriculture studies [5,49–53]. One of these studies [5] prefers\
    \ to utilize ZigBee in farming domains and\nagricultural applications owing to\
    \ its energy-efﬁcient, reliable, and low-cost wireless protocol.\nThe LoRa wireless\
    \ protocol covers a large communication area with low power consumption.\nTherefore,\
    \ it can be suitably deployed in vast agricultural ﬁelds. The network size of\
    \ the LoRa protocol\nis limited by its duty cycle, where a 1% duty cycle can lead\
    \ to a maximum communication time of 36 s\nper hour for each end device [54].\
    \ In addition, LoRa gateways have a limited message capacity of less\nthan 100\
    \ messages per minute because of the unplanned deployment of LoRa gateways in\
    \ urban areas,\nthereby interfering with low power wireless area networks, such\
    \ as SigFox. Therefore, increasing the\nnumber of gateways can challenge the infrastructure\
    \ of the LoRa network [54]. Moreover, the LoRa\ntechnology is complex and has\
    \ sizable hardware implementations [55].\nSigFox has an extremely low data rate\
    \ (100 bps) and slow transmission time (10 s for 10 bytes)\ncompared with ZigBee\
    \ and LoRa [56]. SigFox supports star topology supervised by a centralized sever\n\
    that manages connectivity between devices and the base stations, whereas the LoRa\
    \ supports wide\narea network based on star-to-star topology creating a bridge\
    \ of LoRa gateways. Given that data rate\nand transmission time are both critical\
    \ issue in any communication system, SigFox cannot be widely\nused for agricultural\
    \ applications. Moreover, this technology does not support the collision avoidance\n\
    scheme, thereby affecting the network because several M2M devices may be operated\

    \ site-speciﬁc management for automated agriculture.\nIn terms of precision, the\
    \ considered wireless protocols for agricultural applications have improved\n\
    the agriculture domain. Precision irrigation is frequently regarded as optimizing\
    \ irrigation accuracy\ndue to its ability to control the optimum amount of water\
    \ and irrigation time. The water savings\nof 90% (based on ZigBee), 33% (based\
    \ on ZigBee), 50% (based on Bluetooth), and 90% (based on\nBluetooth) were achieved\
    \ for precision irrigation systems relative to traditional irrigation systems\
    \ in\nresearch [17,28,30,40], respectively. Animal behavior, such as laying down,\
    \ standing, grazing, walking,\nand other modes, was monitored in [18] using ZigBee\
    \ wireless protocol. The authors found that\nlaying down and grazing could be\
    \ improved by 83.5% compared with the ﬁndings from similar\nstudies. In another\
    \ study that has adopted a proposed algorithm that depended on the ZigBee wireless\n\
    protocol [20], an accuracy rate of 95.4% was expected for the proposed algorithm\
    \ to monitor the\nhoney bee and the agricultural and environmental aspects. In\
    \ [23], the automation of the irrigation\nsystem based on ZigBee saved the system\
    \ cost between 1.24% and 6.72% relative to the entire cost\nof the water user\
    \ associations, with energy savings of 2.05 to 8.21% and water savings of 0.71\
    \ to\n6.46%. The proposed model in [35] utilized a smartphone platform (based\
    \ on Bluetooth and GSM\ntechnologies) and permitted three types of irrigation\
    \ systems. The efﬁciency factors were improved\nby 90% for subsurface drip type\
    \ and 85% and 75% for high- and low-pressure overhead sprinkler\ntypes, respectively,\
    \ to compute for drift and evaporation before the water droplets approached the\n\
    soil. 3G technology was adopted by Libelium based on Waspmote wireless sensor\
    \ devices to monitor\nthe vineyards in Northwest Spain [57]. Phytosanitary treatments,\
    \ such as fungicides and fertilizers,\nwere minimized by 20% and growing yields\
    \ were enhanced by 15% based on PA. In [8], LoRa wireless\nprotocol was considered\
    \ to monitor the agriculture environments with 90% power efﬁciency. The cost\n\
    of pumping and water for precision irrigation system in green areas was reduced\
    \ by 30% based on\nSigFox wireless protocol [58].\nThe preceding survey for different\
    \ agricultural applications revealed that PA can be achieved\nin terms of water\
    \ savings, animal behavior, accuracy, power efﬁciency, and reducing system cost\n\
    for various wireless protocols. Consequently, agriculture can be improved based\
    \ on agricultural\nautomation systems compared with traditional agriculture systems.\n\

    \ may operate at different energy states. Therefore, the lifespan of a sensor\
    \ node is the\ntime consumed to exhaust its batteries under a sustainable operation\
    \ threshold.\nNumerous scholars have developed power reduction techniques to provide\
    \ sensor nodes an\ninﬁnite lifespan. This section reviews several power reduction\
    \ techniques of WSNs that can be used in\nagricultural applications. The purposes,\
    \ wireless protocols, ﬁndings, advantages, and limitations of\neach technique\
    \ are also discussed.\n3.1.1. Sleep/Wake Strategy\nWireless transceivers consume\
    \ a signiﬁcant amount of power relative to processors. The energy\nof the wireless\
    \ nodes is mostly dissipated during the reception and transmission processes.\
    \ The radio\nof sensor nodes can enter sleep mode via the sleep/wake strategy\
    \ to reduce the power consumption\nof the RF components of WSNs. No data communication\
    \ occurs during the sleep mode. The sensor\nnodes wake up to collect and transmit\
    \ data within a certain period and then return to sleep mode\nto conserve energy.\
    \ In agricultural applications, the sleep/wake strategy is implemented via (i)\
    \ duty\ncycling, (ii) medium-access control (MAC) protocols, and (iii) topology\
    \ control.\nDuty cycle is proposed in several studies to lower the power consumption\
    \ for different agricultural\napplications based on WSN. Zhang et al. [69] proposed\
    \ a WSN-based system to monitor soil moisture\nand analyzed the temporal and spatial\
    \ variability of soil moisture for variable irrigation. To reduce the\npower consumption\
    \ of the soil sensor nodes, the soil moisture sensors were always in sleep mode\
    \ and\nactivated only when data were to be collected. Million et al. [70] designed\
    \ a WSN for PA in Malawi\nand called it WiPAM. This system was intended to automate\
    \ irrigation and implement an irrigation\nmanagement system (IMS). The authors\
    \ investigated soil moisture variability. The sensor nodes\nwere homogeneous,\
    \ and each was composed of a ZigBee end device (ZED) and a ZigBee coordinator\n\
    (ZC). In the star topology, three sensors nodes were conﬁgured as ZED (in ﬁeld-nodes)\
    \ and one as a\ngateway node. Another node was conﬁgured as ZC for aggregating\
    \ data and actuating the irrigation\nvalves. The power source to sustain the operation\
    \ of the network was solar power. This approach\nwas complemented by an energy-efﬁcient\
    \ management approach. In other words, sensor nodes went\nto sleep when idle and\
    \ woke up to transmit data when required. The irrigation valves opened or\nclosed\
    \ depending on the values stored in the coordinator node. Ouadjaout et al. [71]\
    \ presented an\nenergy-efﬁcient WSN for soil moisture monitoring in an irrigation\
    \ system. The new platform, DZ50,\nconsists of an RFM12b transceiver and an ATmega328P\
    \ microcontroller. This platform consumes very\nlow power, and much energy can\
    \ be saved in sleep mode, in which the transceiver goes inactive (sleep\nmode)\
    \ for long periods. Comparison showed that the performance of DZ50 is better than\
    \ that of\nTelosB and MicaZ. Speciﬁcally, the battery lifetime of DZ50 is seven\
    \ times that of TelosB and MicaZ\nbased on a 10 s sampling period. Monitoring\
    \ of environmental conditions, such as wind direction,\nwind speed, humidity,\
    \ temperature, conductivity, rain level, pH, and water level, in crop ﬁelds was\n\
    presented in [72]. A solar cell was used to power several sensor nodes deployed\
    \ at a distance of 500 m\nto 5 km. WSNs based on IEEE 802.15.4 (C1120 transceiver)\
    \ and GPRS/3G were adopted to transmit the\nrural environments to the base station.\
    \ Energy was saved through low duty cycling (3.3%) for the RF\ntransceiver; the\
    \ saved energy is equivalent to 30 s of wake up time every 15 min. In addition,\
    \ a 2-watt\nsolar cell was used to supply power to the overall system, whose total\
    \ average power consumption\nwas 207 mW.\nMAC protocols were also proposed in\
    \ previous research on agriculture WSNs [39,73–76].\nSudha et al. [39] proposed\
    \ an energy-efﬁcient TDMA-based algorithm for wireless sensor\ncommunications\
    \ in an automatic irrigation system. Their experiment involved a header node that\n\
    collected data directly from all the nodes in the ﬁeld and passed these data to\
    \ the base station (BS).\nThis network arrangement was a star single-hop topology.\
    \ These techniques attain power savings\nof 10% with a high communication distance\
    \ of 1 km between the sensor node and the base station.\nHowever, when this distance\
    \ increases, the power consumption also increases. López et al. [75]\nproposed\
    \ a WSN for monitoring horticultural yields, which are disseminated among small\
    \ plots\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n11 of 45\nscattered at a communication distance\
    \ of 10 km. The air temperature and soil moisture are collected\nduring a 10-week\
    \ period. The authors adopted the MAC protocol and star topology to conserve the\n\
    power consumption of the sensor nodes that used the IEEE 802.15.4 standard based\
    \ on the CC2420\ntransceiver. The lifetimes of the soil moisture and air temperature\
    \ sensor nodes are 1024 days and\n222 days, respectively, utilizing a battery\
    \ that delivers 2700 mAh.\nThe topology protocol scheme can be used in agricultural\
    \ monitoring WSNs to modify the network\ntopology according to the application\
    \ requirements, thereby reducing the number of active nodes in\na network. Some\
    \ nodes in the network can enter sleep mode to prolong the network lifetime when\n\
    they are not sensing the same area of interest. Aneeth and Jayabarathi [77] implemented\
    \ Ad hoc\nOn-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) and Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocols\
    \ over a different\ntopology of ZigBee WSN (i.e., cluster topology, random topology,\
    \ star topology with gateway based\non two cases; inside and outside) in simulation\
    \ environments by using the OPNET software (Riverbed,\nSan Francisco, CA, USA).\
    \ Twenty soil moisture sensor nodes and one gateway node were distributed\nin\
    \ a farmland with a dimension of 100 × 100 m2. Each node sends information about\
    \ the soil moisture\nto the gateway node through the ZigBee wireless protocol.\
    \ The gateway node passes the information to\nthe controlling system to control\
    \ the irrigation valve system. Their study showed that the star topology\nusing\
    \ DSR protocol reduces the power consumption of the WSN because it has less routing\
    \ overhead\ncompared with AODV protocol. Table 2 shows the comparison of power\
    \ reduction technique based on\nsleep/wake schemes for previous research in agricultural\
    \ applications.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n12 of 45\nTable 2. Sleep/wake schemes\

    \ power is mostly dissipated in the RF components of WSNs than\nin data processing\
    \ units, such as microcontrollers and microprocessors [80]. A number of scholars\n\
    have applied various radio optimization schemes or techniques, including (i) transmission\
    \ power\ncontrol (TPC), (ii) modulation scheme, and (iii) cognitive radio, to\
    \ reduce the power consumption\nof the RF components of agriculture sensor nodes.\
    \ In the TPC scheme, the sensor nodes modify the\ntransmitted power to save energy,\
    \ stimulate avoiding interference, and establish a communication\nlink [81]. TPC\
    \ can be used in the agricultural ﬁeld [82,83], where the RF transmitted power\
    \ of the\nsensor nodes can be modiﬁed to reduce their power consumption based\
    \ on the measured distance\nbetween the sink node and the sensor nodes. Sahota\
    \ et al. [82] have investigated the application of\nTPC in reducing the power\
    \ consumption of the sensor nodes in precision agriculture-based WSNs.\nSeveral\
    \ power levels and different receiver sensitivity levels are considered to perform\
    \ the said process.\nThe network layers and MAC protocol in a WSN (based on CC1110)\
    \ for the agriculture domain are\nadopted to further lower the power consumption\
    \ of the sensor node. Results show that the power\nsaving that employs multiple\
    \ modes of transmitted power can be improved by approximately 10%\nrelative to\
    \ the traditional mode. By contrast, Kamarudin et al. [83] prolonged the lifetime\
    \ of the sensor\nnode by more than 8.5% by modifying the transmitted power of\
    \ the CC2420 communication device.\nA cognitive radio is an intelligent wireless\
    \ communication network [84] in which the wireless\ncommunication channel in the\
    \ spectrum band can be selected efﬁciently [85]. The transmission metrics\n(e.g.,\
    \ transmitted power, carrier frequency, and modulation scheme) can be adjusted\
    \ accordingly.\nA cognitive radio requires more energy than conventional devices\
    \ do because it includes sophisticated\nand complex functions [86]. Therefore,\
    \ an energy-efﬁcient cognitive radio network poses challenges,\nespecially with\
    \ regard to the use of battery energy. In wireless communication, the electromagnetic\n\
    spectrum is fully occupied, with several bands being partially used or unused.\
    \ This situation supports\nthe utilization of a cognitive radio, in which spectrum\
    \ holes can be utilized.\nSabri et al. [19] fused fuzzy logic control (FLC) with\
    \ a ZigBee wireless sensor actor network\n(WSAN), which can sense the surroundings\
    \ and respond in ideal performance without interference\nfrom agricultural crops.\
    \ FLC assists the specialists in managing complex systems more compared with\n\
    traditional control methods, which are ineffective in terms of ﬂexibility, energy,\
    \ productivity, and labor\ninterference. Two signiﬁcant greenhouse environment\
    \ parameters (i.e., humidity and temperature)\nare monitored during daytime and\
    \ nighttime. The results show that the intelligent technique-based\nFLC can signiﬁcantly\
    \ improve the WSAN lifespan. Therefore, the WSAN can work for 14 years with a\n\
    210 mAh battery power based on the FLC merged with WSAN.\nThe power consumption\
    \ of networks can be directly affected by the modulation scheme [87]. The\nmodulation\
    \ parameters can be adjusted to their optimal values to preserve the minimum power\n\
    consumption of radio modules. Anane et al. [88] investigated the Frequency-shift\
    \ keying (FSK) and\nMinimum-shift keying (MSK) modulation strategies to minimize\
    \ the total power consumption of\nthe sensor node required to transmit given data\
    \ packets. Through their extensive study, the authors\nconcluded that MSK outperforms\
    \ FSK in terms of power consumption. However, several modulation\nschemes cannot\
    \ be used in the ZigBee wireless protocol that operates at 2.4 GHz because this\
    \ protocol\nsupports a single modulation scheme. Speciﬁcally, the ZigBee wireless\
    \ protocol works with offset\nquadrature phase-shift keying (OQPSK) [89]. Table\

    \ Data Mitigation\nData mitigation presents another power consumption solution\
    \ for agriculture WSNs to reduce the\namount of data transmitted from source nodes\
    \ to destination nodes. Data mitigation can be achieved\nvia (i) data gathering,\
    \ (ii) data comparison, (iii) data rate, and (iv) data-driven techniques.\nData\
    \ gathering can extend the lifetime of sensor nodes in WSNs by minimizing redundant\
    \ data\ntransmission. In different applications of agriculture WSNs including\
    \ environment observation, the\nsensed data of the neighboring nodes may spatially\
    \ be associated. In this case, data combination\npresents an important method\
    \ for reducing the amount of redundant data, reducing the number\nof transmissions,\
    \ and minimizing the power consumption of the nodes in the network [90]. Data\n\
    gathering also reduces latency by minimizing data trafﬁc and improving the delay\
    \ between the sink\nand sensor nodes; after reducing the number of communications,\
    \ this approach can improve the\nexploitation of bandwidth [91]. Data merging\
    \ can be accomplished along a route starting from sensor\nnodes to sink nodes.\
    \ The nodes in a route can rebroadcast only the maximum, minimum, or average\n\
    amount of received data. The design of an energy-efﬁcient WSN-based data-gathering\
    \ scheme poses a\nsigniﬁcant challenge because this scheme must ensure a trade-off\
    \ among power consumption, latency,\nsecurity, data accuracy, and fault tolerance.\n\
    Gathering data in agricultural applications, including humidity, weather, temperature,\
    \ and soil\nmoisture, can minimize the power consumption of environment sensor\
    \ nodes by spatially correlating\nthe ﬁeld and redundant data of the sensor nodes\
    \ when the temperature does not change signiﬁcantly [1],\nespecially during nighttime.\
    \ For example, if the microcontroller of the temperature sensor node\nmeasures\
    \ the same temperature value for extended hours, then the sensor node sends the\
    \ temperature\nvalue every four hours to reduce power consumption. Merging the\
    \ temperature and humidity\nsensors into a single sensor may also reduce the power\
    \ consumption, size, and system complexity.\nAzaza et al. [17] integrated climate\
    \ condition parameters (i.e., temperature, CO2, humidity, and\nilluminance sensors)\
    \ inside a greenhouse and observed a comfortable growth of plants while saving\n\
    water resources and energy. The greenhouse was equipped with environment control\
    \ devices, such as\nventilation system, fogging system for humidiﬁcation, and\
    \ electrical heaters. A smart system based on\nfuzzy logic control correlated\
    \ humidity and temperature measurements is implemented to improve\nthe fogging\
    \ system operation. In that way, the power consumption of the fogging system can\
    \ be\nsigniﬁcantly reduced. In addition, the system was improved by a wireless\
    \ data observing platform\n(STM 32/F4 microcontroller and Virtex V FPGA board)\
    \ for logging and data routing, which provides\ndata access in real time. The\
    \ suggested control system based on fuzzy logic control was experimentally\nimplemented\
    \ and validated. The results revealed that the total energy and water usage decreased\
    \ by\n22% and 33%, respectively.\nMusaazi et al. [92] introduced a data caching\
    \ algorithm (DCAL) that optimizes the sleep/wake up\nperiods of ZigBee WSNs to\
    \ achieve low energy consumption and latency in PA application. In WSNs,\ndata\
    \ are collected from the source nodes and routed to the sink node; from the sink\
    \ node, the data\nare sent to the Internet. Reducing the transmission of duplicated\
    \ sensed data reduces the power\nconsumption. Energy conservation is paramount\
    \ during the communication phase to prolong the\nlifetime of sensor nodes. The\
    \ main method utilized to conserve energy involves switching off the nodes’\n\
    transceiver when they are not transmitting nor receiving packets. Additionally,\
    \ the data-gathering\nmethod for agriculture WSNs has been investigated in [93].\
    \ The proposed system includes ZigBee\nwireless sensor nodes, customized farming\
    \ personal digital assistants (PDAs), and a host PC. Each\nsensor node contains\
    \ four sensors to identify ﬁve agricultural ﬁeld parameters: soil temperature,\
    \ soil\nmoisture, environmental humidity, soil electrical conductivity, and environmental\
    \ temperature. The\nPDA combines the ZigBee coordinator node, GPRS module, and\
    \ GPS module. The ZigBee WSN\ngathers farming data and obtains GPS information\
    \ for each sensor node. It then passes the data to the\nhost PC through GPRS.\
    \ The experimental results show that the battery power of the sensor nodes can\n\
    be saved based on the data-gathering scheme.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n16 of 45\n\
    Data compression is a useful method for deploying sensor nodes with restricted\
    \ energy resources.\nInformation encoding can be performed in sensor nodes, whereas\
    \ information decoding can be\nperformed in sink nodes. Using compression techniques\
    \ to reduce the size of information that the\nsink nodes transmit over wireless\
    \ channels may also reduce the power consumption and extend the\nbattery life\
    \ of the sensor nodes. One study has applied data compression approaches to reduce\
    \ the\npower consumption for auto-irrigation system which based on CC1000 RF module\
    \ [41]. Based on this\nmethod, the battery of the sensor node can be extended\
    \ to 359 days.\nThe data-driven power reduction technique aims to reduce the amount\
    \ of sampled data by\nconserving the sensing accuracy to an appropriate level\
    \ for a speciﬁed application [94]. Thereby,\nthe amount of data to be transmitted\
    \ to the sink nodes can be minimized. Therefore, this technique\ncan reduce the\
    \ power consumption of agriculture WSNs and extend their battery life. A data-driven\n\
    algorithm is considered by Lerdsuwan and Phunchongharn [95] to solve the energy\
    \ consumption\nproblem of the sensor node in PA with low complexity and maintain\
    \ the transmission rate. Their\nexperiment reveals that their proposed algorithm\
    \ has higher energy efﬁciency than the ESPIN and\nSPIN algorithms in [96,97] by\
    \ 36.84% and 81.53%, respectively.\nThe data rate of RF transceivers can be adjusted\
    \ in the physical layer of a wireless protocol to\nreduce the power consumption\
    \ of the sensor node. Davis et al. [98] investigated the low battery\ncondition\
    \ of a sensor node to attain prolonged battery life for separate wireless sensor\
    \ nodes that\ncan preserve sampling suitability and reliability in communicating\
    \ accurate data. Different sensors,\nsuch as those for soil moisture, sap ﬂow,\
    \ and soil water, were examined to study the effect of sensing\ndebility due to\
    \ low battery voltage. The comparison of the data sampling rate of these sensors\
    \ shows\nthat sap ﬂow measurement is the best option for agricultural WSN. This\
    \ ﬁnding is attributed to the\nlow error obtained when the sampling interval increased\
    \ to 15 min while maintaining measurement\naccuracy. Table 4 shows the comparison\
    \ of power reduction technique based on data mitigation schemes\nfor previous\

    \ power reduction scheme for agriculture WSNs to minimize\nthe path between sensor\
    \ nodes and sink node, thereby the power consumption of the WSN is reduced.\n\
    Routing protocol can be performed via (i) sink mobility, (ii) multi-path routing,\
    \ (iii) cluster architecture,\nand (iv) routing metric.\nSink mobility was adopted\
    \ in previous research [99,100]. Mathur et al. [99] proposed a novel\nmechanism\
    \ that adopts unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to gather data from forest regions\
    \ instead\nof classical sensing from nodes deployed in WSN. The proposed method\
    \ enables the UAV to collect\ndata from WSN in harsh terrain and transmit it to\
    \ the base station situated far from the sensing area.\nTherefore, the multi-hop\
    \ transmission between cluster heads can be completely avoided, and the\ncommunication\
    \ range can be extended.\nMulti-path routing has also been suggested by other\
    \ scholars for agriculture WSNs [67,68,101].\nRecently, Nikolidakis et al. [67]\
    \ proposed an agricultural ﬁeld weather monitoring system based on\nthe ZigBee\
    \ wireless protocol. An advance energy-efﬁcient routing protocol was implemented\
    \ for WSN\nto automate irrigation management. The transmitter could modify its\
    \ power based on the distance\nbetween the sensor node and base station to save\
    \ energy. The results revealed that network lifetime\nincreased to 1825 min. Hedley\
    \ et al. [101] developed a WSN soil moisture mapping and monitoring\nmethod to\
    \ provide information for irrigation scheduling. To conserve power, the sensor\
    \ nodes relayed\ndata to the BS every 15 min through the greatest energy-efﬁcient\
    \ route.\nCluster head method is considered by Ndzi et al. [102] to extend the\
    \ ZigBee WSN lifetime for\nagricultural application.\nIn addition, the quality\
    \ of the crop yields is improved and their cost\nis minimized. The research presented\
    \ WSN coverage measurements in a mixed crop farmland.\nAn adaptive energy consumption\
    \ model for each sensor node was proposed and used to compute the\nenergy consumption\
    \ in the network. A deployment model with a cluster head and two antennas was\n\
    also proposed and simulated to alleviate short network lifetime due to the vegetation\
    \ attenuation of\nsignals. This network deployment model extended the lifetime\
    \ of the network by a factor of more than\n20 compared with a deployment where\
    \ cluster heads are not used. Nikolidakis et al. [103] proposed\na new routing\
    \ protocol for WSN that can reduce the power consumption of sensor nodes through\n\
    balanced clustering. This protocol was called “equalized cluster head election\
    \ routing protocol”\n(ECHERP). ECHERP was implemented in Java language for 500\
    \ homogeneous nodes distributed in a\n100 × 100 m2 land. The simulation results\
    \ showed that the proposed protocol outperforms existing\nprotocols in terms of\
    \ power consumption. A potential application of this protocol is PA.\nAnother\
    \ type of routing protocol is called routing metric. Chen et al. [104] used two\
    \ routing\nmetrics, namely, remained energy and expected transmission count, to\
    \ compute the optimal routing\npath to the sink node that ensures low power consumption.\
    \ “A scalable context-aware objective\nfunction (SCAOF)” is proposed by combining\
    \ robustness-aware, energy-aware, resource-aware, and\nreliability-aware contexts\
    \ that render to the compound routing metrics scheme. The experiment is\nconducted\
    \ in a garden based on a testbed, which includes a uIPv6 protocol stack and contiki\
    \ OS. The\nobtained results prove that SCAOF can convey the desired advantages\
    \ on network lifespan prolonging,\nas well as high efﬁciency and reliability in\
    \ different hardware testbeds and simulation scenarios.\nTable 5 shows the comparison\

    \ of WSNs in different agricultural applications in the work of\nseveral scholars\
    \ (Tables 2–6). The tables show that most previous studies used ZigBee wireless\

    \ Techniques\nA major limitation of sensor nodes is their limited battery capacity.\
    \ Several energy-efﬁcient\nschemes have been introduced in previous research to\
    \ solve the power consumption problem of sensor\nnodes. An alternative method\
    \ that has been utilized to address the problem of limited node lifespan is\n\
    the use of energy-harvesting techniques. Numerous techniques have been developed\
    \ to allow sensor\nnodes to harvest different types of energy, such as solar,\
    \ wireless power transfer (WPT), mechanical\nvibration, kinetic, and wind energy,\
    \ from different environments [110] (Figure 2). Compared with\ntraditional sensor\
    \ nodes, rechargeable sensor nodes can work continuously for a long lifetime.\
    \ Ambient\nenergy can be converted to electrical energy and used directly to supply\
    \ the sensor nodes or can be\nstored and used later on. In agricultural applications,\
    \ energy harvesting can be used to prolong the\nlifetime of sensor nodes. Energy-harvesting\
    \ techniques for previous research works employed in\nprecision agriculture are\
    \ shown in Table 7. The said table lists the categories of energy-harvesting\n\
    techniques, types of wireless protocols, and output energy/power of energy-harvesting\
    \ techniques.\nIn addition, the form of agricultural applications, and limitations\
    \ of each article are also highlighted.\nEnergy-harvesting mechanisms can be implemented\
    \ with batteries for the sensor nodes. For\nexample, a sensor node using solar\
    \ energy to charge its batteries can work extensively during daytime\nwhen adequate\
    \ sunlight is available. Meanwhile, the sensor node can use its batteries through\
    \ power\nreduction techniques, such as sleep mode (i.e., duty cycle), at night\
    \ when sunlight is unavailable to save\nenergy. In addition, the sensor node can\
    \ enter restricted sleep periods (i.e., low duty cycle) and reduce\ntransmission\
    \ power when its batteries possess low residual energy [111]. Furthermore, adopting\
    \ a\nmaximum power point tracking system is a reliable battery charging technique\
    \ for long-term operation.\nThe charge–discharge cycle of the battery is minimized\
    \ [112].\n3.2.1. Solar Energy\nSolar energy based on photovoltaic system and methods\
    \ can be used in agricultural applications\nbased on WSNs [113]. Therefore, solar\
    \ cells provide a good solution [114] to ensure the survivability\nof the agriculture\
    \ monitoring system. Solar cell energy has been used by several studies to provide\n\
    long-term energy to sensor nodes in agriculture applications.\nGutiérrez et al.\
    \ [40] developed an irrigation system based on the ZigBee wireless protocol. The\n\
    system was developed to improve water usage for agricultural crops. Temperature\
    \ and soil moisture\nsensors in WSN were placed in the root of the plants to send\
    \ sensor information to a web application\nvia a gateway. The proposed algorithm\
    \ controls the water quantity based on threshold values of soil\nmoisture and\
    \ temperature that are programmed in a microcontroller-based gateway. The WSN\
    \ is\npowered by solar cell panels and rechargeable batteries. Water savings of\
    \ up to 90% were achieved\nrelative to the conventional irrigation method. Considering\
    \ that the system is cost effective and\nautonomous, it can be utilized in geographically\
    \ isolated regions where water sources are limited.\nZou et al. [68] improved\
    \ the battery lifetime of a WSN based on harvested energy (i.e., solar cell)\n\
    utilizing shadow detection. With this strategy, sensor nodes can accordingly modify\
    \ their scheduling\nto optimize their power production and remaining battery levels.\
    \ Furthermore, data transmission is\noptimized through routing and clustering\
    \ mechanisms. A Bayesian network was employed to provide\nwarning reports of bottlenecks\
    \ along the path. The system was deployed in real time based on the\nTexas Instruments\
    \ CC2530 platform that includes the ZigBee wireless protocol. The battery (lithium\n\
    type with a storage capacity of 2500 mAh) of the sensor node was charged from\
    \ the solar cell panel\nwhen the harvested power was adequate. The experimental\
    \ results showed that these techniques\nallow network activities to occur in a\
    \ continuous and effective manner.\nIn [115], a micro-irrigation system that relies\
    \ on a small solar-powered cell was developed. The\nenergy input, energy output,\
    \ greenhouse gas productions, and solar cell installation for rural areas\nwere\
    \ investigated with the proposed co-located system. The researchers compared their\
    \ system\nwith another commonly used method (i.e., aloe vera cultivation) in terms\
    \ of life cycle. The life cycle\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n23 of 45\nevaluation\
    \ showed that the proposed system is economical for several rural areas and may\
    \ provide\nopportunities for agriculture electriﬁcation and motivate economic\
    \ growth.\nRoblin [116] presented an irrigation system relying on a solar cell\
    \ for rural areas where sunlight is\noften available. The irrigation system includes\
    \ pumps working on a solar cell instead of an electricity\ngrid and/or a diesel\
    \ generator. The study showed that the irrigation system based on a solar cell\
    \ is\nbetter than systems that depend on other energy resources because the electricity\
    \ grid is unavailable at\nall times, and the operating cost of diesel pumps is\
    \ high and relies mainly on the diesel price. Although\nthe solar-powered system\
    \ was relatively expensive, it became a free source of energy after installation\n\
    in the rural area and proved to be a worthwhile investment in the long term. A\
    \ similar irrigation\nsystem was proposed in [117]. The system adopts photovoltaic\
    \ panels to power a water pump that\nconverts the continuous drift of water into\
    \ a drop drift to achieve increased water usage efﬁciency.\nKwon et al. [118]\
    \ suggested a novel prediction technique for energy harvesting with a solar\n\
    cell within three hours. Moreover, the packet transmissions of the sensor nodes\
    \ can be controlled\ndepending on the estimated energy. Packet transmissions and\
    \ energy harvesting are integrated to\nimprove the WSN performance. The integration\
    \ of these schemes enhances the prediction accuracy\nand improves the WSN throughput\
    \ and power consumption. The throughput of the sensor node can\nbe increased by\
    \ shortening the packet transmission period. By contrast, when the packet transmission\n\
    period increases, the power consumption of the sensor node decreases. The experimental\
    \ results show\nthat the proposed packet transmission scheme is superior to the\
    \ others in terms of data throughput\nand deadline miss rate. The proposed energy-harvesting\
    \ method is also predicted more precisely than\nothers by 6.92%.\nA study [119]\
    \ used a solar cell to provide energy to a WSN deployed in a greenhouse. The\n\
    humidity and temperature of the greenhouse were controlled through a management\
    \ and monitoring\nsystem, which was based on a low-power MSP430 (Texas Instruments,\
    \ Dallas, TX, USA) microcontroller\nand an ultra-low-power nRF24L01 transceiver\
    \ (Nordic Semiconductor, Oslo, Norway). The power\nconsumption of the WSN was\
    \ minimized as much as possible. In another study, a WSN-based ZigBee\n(CC2420\
    \ module) wireless transceiver and microcontroller (low-power ATmega128L) supplied\
    \ by\nthe solar cell as a battery charger were considered to monitor the humidity,\
    \ temperature, rain level,\nand leaf wetness of vineyards [120]. The WSN covered\
    \ 30 m between ZigBee units with a low power\nconsumption (35 and 38 mW in transmission\
    \ and reception modes, respectively).\n3.2.2. Wireless Power Transfer\nRecent\
    \ developments in wireless power transfer (WPT) are expected to increase the lifetime\n\
    of WSNs signiﬁcantly and make them continuously operational, given that WPT techniques\
    \ can\nbe utilized to transmit electromagnetic energy between transmitter and\
    \ receiver devices without\nany contact between the two. WPT is expected to overcome\
    \ the constraint of the supply of WSNs.\nConsequently, some researchers highlighted\
    \ the utilization of mobile node that can deliver power\nto deployed sensor nodes\
    \ such as [121,122].\nWPT technology poses a challenge to the energy\ncooperation\
    \ between neighboring nodes in WSNs. Therefore, in the future, sensor nodes could\n\
    harvest energy from the environment and transfer this energy to other nodes in\
    \ the network; in this\nmanner, a self-sustaining network can be achieved [123].\
    \ Accordingly, recent research has investigated\nmulti-hop energy transfer [124,125],\
    \ which paved the way for new energy cooperative schemes and\nWPT charging protocols.\n\
    WPT can be classiﬁed into three main subcategories:\n(i) electromagnetic (EM)\
    \ radiation,\n(ii) magnetic resonator coupling, and (iii) inductive coupling,\
    \ as shown in Figure 2. Wireless charging\nin WSNs can be performed via EM radiation\
    \ and magnetic resonant coupling. EM signals suffer from\nattenuation over distance,\
    \ and active radiation may pose a threat to the human body. Meanwhile,\nmagnetic\
    \ resonant coupling can address the power requirements of agriculture based on\
    \ WSNs because\nof its efﬁciency within a distance of several meters. Many studies\
    \ used WPT to charge sensor nodes\nfor different applications and ﬁelds. WPT-based\
    \ inductive coupling [121] has been used to charge\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n24\
    \ of 45\nthe battery of sensor nodes scattered in agriculture ﬁelds. The energy\
    \ is transferred from the source\ncoil (mounted on a UAV) to the receiver coil\
    \ (attached with sensor nodes). A 2.4 W transfer power\nis transferred to charge\
    \ a single sensor node. The results addressed a number of limitations and\nchallenges\
    \ related to the charging of sensor nodes via a UAV. In addition, the results\
    \ revealed that\nthe battery lifetime of the deployed sensors can be signiﬁcantly\
    \ extended through the UAV. A similar\napproach was adopted by Chen et al. [122]\
    \ to charge a WSN in an agricultural ﬁeld through the\nharvesting of electromagnetic\
    \ radiation.\n3.2.3. Air Flow Energy\nHarnessing wind energy is another energy-harvesting\
    \ technique that can be utilized to provide\npower to sensor nodes in agricultural\
    \ applications. An adaptive routing protocol, wind energy\nharvesting, and sleep\
    \ scheduling were considered in [126] to minimize the power consumption of the\n\
    ZigBee transceiver and extend the lifetime of the WSN.\n3.2.4. Vibration Energy\n\
    Vibration energy based on piezoelectric can be used to charge the battery of sensor\
    \ nodes to prolong\ntheir lifetime. Müller et al. [127] have been analyzed various\
    \ WSN protocols based on ZigBee (CC2420\nand CC2500) and CC1100 with respect to\
    \ their applicability in the agricultural setting. Furthermore,\na fully synchronous\
    \ protocol with a time-slot architecture for a WSN has been proposed for agricultural\n\
    machinery to achieve real-time capability, low latency, and deterministic behavior.\
    \ The objective of\ntheir application was to monitor the back door position and\
    \ ﬁlling level of a forage wagon using a\nZigBee (CC2420) RF transceiver. Clock\
    \ synchronization among all nodes is implemented to ensure\nstrict power on/sleep\
    \ times of each sensor node. Meanwhile, an energy-harvesting unit based on a\n\
    piezoelectric material has been designed; the unit provides an average power of\
    \ 200 µW to sensor\nnodes. In this case, the sensor node can transmit a data payload\
    \ of nine bytes in 40 ms.\n3.2.5. Water Flow Energy\nMulti-energy sources (water,\
    \ wind, and solar) platform is designed for precision agricultural\napplications\
    \ by Morais et al. [128]. The authors explored water ﬂow, wind speed and solar\
    \ radiation\nfeasible energy sources to encounter the requirements of ZigBee router\
    \ node in WSN. Thus, several\npowered solutions for WSN is presented. Design considerations\
    \ regarding water ﬂow energy, the water\nﬂow in the pipes of crops irrigation\
    \ system are employed to generate the energy for ZigBee router node.\nThis idea\
    \ can be applied in different agricultural applications such as greenhouses, aquaculture,\
    \ and\nhydroponic systems, where the water recirculation in pipes is continuous.\
    \ Like to bulky hydroelectric\ngeneration utilities, a water ﬂow in the pipes,\
    \ derived from the main water source, can be employed\nto run a turbine joined\
    \ to a small direct current (DC) generator. The experimental results revealed\n\
    that the three energy sources combined together can generate an energy of 58 mAh,\
    \ more than the\nrequirement of the ZigBee router node (39 mAh).\n3.2.6. Microbial\
    \ Fuel Cell Energy\nAnother type of energy harvesting technique is called microbial\
    \ fuel cell. This technique is extracted\nfrom energy neutral system. Sartori\
    \ and Brunelli [129] proposed microbial fuel cell to supply the\nunderground freshwater\
    \ system that used for monitoring the water level in the phreatic zone, artesian\n\
    wells, and tanks. The proposed system comprises a low-cost phreatimeter sensor,\
    \ a low-power\nmicrocontroller (i.e., MSP430FR5739), and a low-power LoRa wireless\
    \ protocol. However, the amount\nof microbial fuel cell energy extraction of 296\
    \ µW is not enough to supply LoRa wireless protocol and\nmicrocontroller directly\
    \ when they are in active mode. Therefore, a DC-to-DC boost is employed to\nraise\
    \ the small input voltages of 130 mV to 4.5 V.\nEvidently, most agricultural applications\
    \ prefer to use solar cells as battery chargers of WSNs\nbecause these cells are\
    \ easy to install, work efﬁciently when sunlight is available, and supply more\n\
    Sensors 2017, 17, 1781\n25 of 45\nenergy compared with other energy-harvesting\
    \ techniques as shown in Table 7. In addition, the table\nshows most of the previous\
    \ scholars adopted ZigBee wireless protocol. Clearly, employing ZigBee\nsupports\
    \ our study that this wireless protocol is more suitable for agricultural monitoring\
    \ systems.\nSolar panels can supply 100 mW/cm2, whereas radio frequency, thermal,\
    \ vibration, wind, microbial\nfuel cell, magnetic resonant coupling WPT, and water\
    \ ﬂow can supply 0.001, 0.06, 0.8, 1.0, 0.296, 14, and\n19 mWs, respectively [128–131].\
    \ For example, as shown in Figure 3 (Part A), if the power consumption\nof the\
    \ WSN components presented in [120] is 35 mW for ZigBee (Chipcon CC2420), 0.27\
    \ mW for\nthe temperature sensor, 3 mW for the humidity sensor, 0.27 mW for the\
    \ rain gauge sensor, 5 mW\nfor the leaf wetness sensor, and 24 mW for the ATmega128L\
    \ microcontroller [132], a single solar cell\n(2 × 2 cm2) panel can adequate supply\
    \ this WSN. However, when the power consumption of the WSN\nincreases, the dimension\
    \ of the solar cell panel also needs to be increased.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n\

    \ the visibility of a group of systems, technologies, platforms, and design \n\
    principles for joining things, depending on the physical surroundings, through\
    \ the use of the Internet. \nPA is an application that can employ the benefits\
    \ of IoT to increase production efficiency, improve \nthe quality of yields, reduce\
    \ the negative ecological impact, prevent the prevalence of plant-eating \npests\
    \ or plant diseases, alert farmers about farm fires [141], and increase the profitability\
    \ of several \nagricultural production schemes. Agriculture involves farming,\
    \ planting, and animal rearing, and it \nhas grown under the scope of IoT recently\
    \ [5]. Tracking of animals, monitoring of farms, and \nirrigation processes are\
    \ the main domains of IoT for cultivation [142]. Furthermore, feeding, rearing,\
    \ \nmedication, and vaccination are essential applications of IoT in the agricultural\
    \ domain [143]. \nConsequently, several IoT modular architectures have been proposed\
    \ and implemented by scholars \nfor PA monitoring (as presented in Table 8). Real-time\
    \ ecological information can be remotely \ngathered from the agricultural surroundings\
    \ based on different sensors, which transmit the \ninformation to be processed\
    \ to determine problems, take required actions using actuators, or store \ndata.\
    \ \nSensors in WSN can be employed to gather information about environmental and\
    \ physical \nfeatures, whereas actuators are used to respond to the feedback to\
    \ control or to perform an action \nover the conditions (Figure 3, Part B). The\
    \ use of sensors in agricultural applications poses a number \nof requirements,\
    \ including gathering of soil, weather, and crop information; surveillance of\

    \ rough land, several crops on \na single piece of acreage, different requirements\
    \ of crops for unlike soil and weather circumstances, \nand eliminating of interactive\
    \ solutions and relying on proactive solutions. All these requirements \nare applied\
    \ and processed in parallel. Therefore, different sensors and actuators must be\
    \ used to \nhandle this information and respond to different conditions. Processed\
    \ information can be utilized \nto make a decision instead of raw data of the\
    \ sensor [132]. This information can be transmuted to the \ncloud computing via\

    \ The gateway\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n29 of 45\nwas in charge of collected information\
    \ from different sensors and passed the information to the cloud\nserver. The\
    \ proposed system resulted in improved crop quality and minimized negative ecological\n\
    effect. In [145], the usage of water in smart irrigation systems was controlled\
    \ based on developed IoT\nplatforms. A cloud agriculture ﬁeld-monitoring scheme\
    \ was designed and implemented to enable\nthe farmer to monitor the soil condition.\
    \ Soil moisture and weather temperature were monitored to\nautomate the irrigation\
    \ system in farm while minimizing water consumption, which led to reduced\ncost\
    \ and maintained environmental beneﬁts. The proposed water irrigation system included\
    \ three\nmain parts: a WSN and actuator, a cloud platform, and user application.\
    \ The WSN and actuator part\nconsisted of sensor nodes for collecting the soil\
    \ moisture and weather temperature, an actuator node\nto control the irrigation\
    \ process, and a sink node that could pass all farm information to the cloud\n\
    platform. All sensor, sink, and actuator nodes adopted low-power ZigBee wireless\
    \ protocol.\nWSN and 3G network-based agriculture IoT was considered in [146]\
    \ to monitor the air\ntemperature, air humidity, and soil moisture. The entire\
    \ system consisted of sensor nodes, actuators\nsink nodes, server, gateway, and\
    \ the mobile phone device of the farmer. The collected information by\nthe sensor\
    \ nodes was sent to the server via gateway and Internet network. The gateway connected\
    \ the\nWSN with the Internet to relay the command control among the sensor nodes,\
    \ the phone of the farmer,\nthe actuators, and the server. However, in this system,\
    \ the data transmission over the 3G network\nmust ensure real-time communications\
    \ to support the agricultural WSN.\nIoT-based agriculture applications changed\
    \ classical agricultural surveillance approaches by\nspeedily providing quantitative\
    \ data with signiﬁcant temporal and spatial resolution. Several IoT\nplatforms\
    \ have recently been available in the market. For instance, in agricultural applications,\n\
    SmartFarmNet [147] platforms can be used to provide more than 30 packages for\
    \ good commercial\nproducts, such as Libelium [45], and experimental, such as\
    \ Motes [148] and Arduino [149] sensor\nplatforms. Other examples of agricultural\

    \ of PA domain such as sensors, microcontrollers, and wireless technologies\n\
    are highlighted and classiﬁed in Table 9. For better clariﬁcation, the sensors\
    \ are classiﬁed into three\nmain categories leaf wetness/plant, soil moisture,\
    \ and environment sensors [5,132]. These sensors can\nbe utilized in several potential\
    \ agriculture applications. In Table 9, the microcontroller/processor and\nwireless\
    \ protocols are also highlighted. Among the microcontrollers, the majority of\
    \ agriculture sensor\nnodes adopting ATmega128L because this microcontroller supports\
    \ data aggregation, decision making,\nstorage capability, ﬂash memory, low complexity,\
    \ and energy management through multi-levels of\npower down modes [132]. ZigBee\
    \ and LoRa wireless protocols/technologies are widely used in several\nagricultural\
    \ applications, as discussed previously in Section 2.\nIn precision agriculture,\
    \ to obtain high-quality products, the environmental parameters should be\ncontrolled\
    \ to provide optimal values. For example, the temperature rate that has a positive\
    \ effect on the\ngrowth of the pepper ﬁeld is between 20 and 25 ◦C. The temperature\
    \ in rainy, sunny, and nightly days\nshould be kept between 20 and 22 ◦C, between\
    \ 25 and 28 ◦C, and between 18 and 20 ◦C, respectively\nand the minimum value\
    \ should be not lower than 16–17 ◦C. Air humidity for pepper vegetables should\n\
    be kept between 60% and 70%. The high-temperature value combines with low humidity\
    \ value may\nbe caused a negative inﬂuence on the growth of the pepper. The maximum\
    \ humidity value in pepper\ngreenhouse should be not above 70%. Soil pH (i.e.,\
    \ soil acidity) is another factor that directly effects\non the pepper crops,\
    \ where it can measure the quantity of calcium in the soil. The soil for pepper\n\
    crops can be acid or alkaline depending on the weather conditions. It should be\
    \ acid for wet climate\nand alkaline for a dry climate. Soil with pH levels above\
    \ 7.0 is considered alkaline, while soil with\npH levels below 7.0 has acid nature.\
    \ Soil pH values must be controlled according to the type of the\nagricultural\
    \ yield. For pepper crop, the best values for pH gauge are between 6.5 and 5.5.\
    \ Therefore,\nthe humidity, temperature, and soil pH should be constantly supervised\
    \ in order to identify the right\ntime for draining and watering the agricultural\
    \ crops.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n33 of 45\nTable 9. Types of sensors, microcontrollers,\

    \ Limitations\nThe development of WSNs prompted new research trends in the agricultural\
    \ domain. Micro\nelectromechanical system (MEMS) technologies allow for the manufacture\
    \ of cheap and small sensors.\nThe pervasive nature of the process, together with\
    \ tiny, self-regulating sensor nodes, cost-effective\nequipment, and scalability,\
    \ indicate that WSNs can be used for agriculture automation [5]. However,\nregarding\
    \ the distribution of WSNs to observe different agricultural climates, a number\
    \ of open\nchallenges and limitations remain. Several of these challenges and\
    \ limitations in existing agricultural\napplications based on WSNs are listed\
    \ below together with suggestions on how to address them.\n(1)\nPower consumption\
    \ and battery life:\nA WSN consists of three main components:\nsensors,\nmicrocontrollers,\
    \ and RF transceivers. Given that the battery of a sensor node provides limited\n\
    energy, ensuring that the components of the sensor node consume minimum power\
    \ is crucial.\nIn particular, reducing the power consumption of the RF transceiver,\
    \ which consumes more power\nthan the other components in a sensor node, would\
    \ alleviate this problem [67,127]. Moreover,\nthis issue can be addressed in two\
    \ steps. The ﬁrst is to propose an intelligent energy-efﬁcient\nalgorithm. The\
    \ second step can be performed by utilizing available energy-harvesting techniques,\n\
    such as solar cells, vibration, and WPT.\n(2)\nCommunication range: WSNs suffer\
    \ from the effect of harsh ecological conditions because of the\nwide range of\
    \ open agricultural surroundings [5]. The WSN protocol contains mechanisms to\n\
    resist the effect of data transmission failures in the network, which increase\
    \ due to ecological\neffects. In agricultural applications, most wireless sensor\
    \ technologies support a relatively short\ncommunication range. Therefore, many\
    \ sensor and router nodes need to be diffused in a WSN.\nIn the point-to-point\
    \ Zigbee network, the communication distance can reach 100 m in outdoor\nenvironments.\
    \ The ZigBee communication range can be extended by adopting multi-tire, ad-hoc,\n\
    decentralized, and mesh network topologies. Drones or UAV also can be used as\
    \ a mobile router\nnode to extend the communication range within a farm ﬁeld.\
    \ A drone could pass the collected\ndata from the sensor nodes to the master node\
    \ through multi-hop. However, using drones entails\nother challenges and limitations.\n\
    (3)\nPropagation losses:\nIn agricultural applications, WSNs must be able to work\
    \ in diverse\nsurroundings, such as ground, bare land, orchards, greenhouses,\
    \ farms, and complex topography;\nthey must also be able to operate in all climate\
    \ conditions. All these conditions inﬂuence the\nperformance of radio propagation.\
    \ Whether the topography is simple or complicated, the\ncommunication possibility\
    \ between the points in a WSN still suffers from serious challenges.\nThe signal\
    \ transmitted from the sensor nodes in agricultural applications need to pass\
    \ through a\nheavy crop canopy to arrive to at the receiver nodes, which cannot\
    \ ensure a sufﬁcient clearance\narea and will cause signal propagation absorption,\
    \ reﬂection, attenuation, and scattering. In\nthis case, the link quality is degraded,\
    \ especially when the signal spreads through dense crops.\nTherefore, when deploying\
    \ WSNs, communication link quality and temporal and spatial variables\nmust be\
    \ guaranteed. The communication performance of WSNs is related to the working\n\
    surroundings. Therefore, due to the limited resources and power budget of WSNs,\
    \ an accurate\nwireless channel path loss model must be adopted to reﬂect the\
    \ propagation features. This model\nis expected to demonstrate correct optimization\
    \ and network evaluation performance throughout\nthe deployment design process\
    \ to develop the energy efﬁciency of the nodes [15], improve the\ntarget detection\
    \ and localization applications [16], decrease the number of retransmission, and\n\
    ensure Quality of Service (QoS) of the network [175].\n(4)\nRouting: Different\
    \ problems can emerge due to packet collision and limited bandwidth, which\nare\
    \ introduced by channel propagation, and so on. Therefore, when a WSN is deployed\
    \ in a wide\narea in farm ﬁelds, multi-hop is required. Kim et al. [3] developed\
    \ an independent mobile robot\nplatform based on a mobility task for surveillance\
    \ to overcome channel interference.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n35 of 45\n(5)\nLocalization\
    \ and tracking: Tracking and localization of a herd of cattle are considered smart\
    \ farm\napplications based on WSNs. For example, a WSN can be employed to track\
    \ and localize of dairy\ncows to enable herd management. ZigBee wireless protocol\
    \ is used to monitor animal locations\nand behaviors, such as walking and standing,\
    \ lying down, and grazing [16,18]. In this context,\nseveral considerations, such\
    \ as radio interference, animal situation, and mobility, changes in\nWSN topology,\
    \ penetration depth of the signal through the animal body, height of the collar,\
    \ and\naccess point antennas, need to be taken into account [176]. These considerations\
    \ pose challenges\nin the localization and tracking of the animals.\n(6)\nReliability:\
    \ Agricultural monitoring systems based on different environmental sensors can\
    \ also\nbe used to monitor pollution aside from climate conditions. Important\
    \ information on climate\nconditions is reported to related agencies and farmers\
    \ from a remote location for advance\ninvestigations. Dangerous information needs\
    \ to be dealt with immediately in an emergency,\nwhich means that data transmission\
    \ in WSNs should demonstrate high reliability [3].\n(7)\nScalability: In agricultural\
    \ applications, the construction of WSN-based fault-tolerant and\nrobust hierarchical\
    \ architectures requires large-scale deployment relative to single-level network\n\
    architectures.\nA hierarchical architecture can be scaled up for developing applications\
    \ by\nduplicating to several ﬁelds. In this context, to increase the number of\
    \ WSNs over a vast area,\nmultiple wireless router nodes are placed in an agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld to guarantee sustained operation.\n(8)\nCost: The total hardware and software\
    \ costs of sensor nodes are important. The design of sensor\nnodes for any agricultural\
    \ application level must involve a low cost while demonstrating a robust\nperformance;\
    \ moreover, the design needs to be available for use by poor country markets [5].\n\
    This challenge can be overcome by reducing software and hardware costs further.\n\
    (9)\nReal time: Most crops are vulnerable to climate conditions, such as humidity,\
    \ intensity of\nillumination, and temperature. This vulnerability is a burden\
    \ to farmers who monitor changes\nin climate conditions hourly and/or daily because\
    \ doing so is labor-intensive. Moreover, in\ngreenhouses, a ﬁre can occur and\
    \ lead to severe agricultural disasters. This evidence suggests\nthat the monitoring\
    \ of the ecological conditions of agricultural WSNs needs to be in real time.\n\
    Real-time monitoring will enhance yield production and plant growth and avoid\
    \ dangerous\ndisasters in farms [3].\n(10) Storage and recording of data: Large\
    \ amounts of data are recorded from agriculture observing\nsystems because several\
    \ WSNs in agricultural applications contain several sensors for crop\ngrowth analysis\
    \ and harvesting estimation. This condition requires the base station to monitor\n\
    changes in farm ﬁelds by analyzing patterns. The base station must thus be supported\
    \ by a high\nstorage capacity.\n(11) Security: Security and protection are important\
    \ issues in agricultural products. Protection\nfrom insects or attacks of rodents\
    \ in grain stores or ﬁelds is essential. Such a challenge must\nbe considered\
    \ to maintain the security level of agriculture. Protection and security can be\n\
    achieved based on real-time analysis and processing of agricultural information\
    \ without human\nintrusion [159].\n(12) Delay tolerance: Critical delay poses\
    \ a challenge to agricultural applications. Some agricultural\napplications can\
    \ be considered as time sensitive, such as those used in farm ﬁre detection,\n\
    detection of exposure of crops to pests, cow heat event detection during milking,\
    \ and exposure of\ncattle to heat for a certain period. Such information must\
    \ be transmitted as fast as possible if the\ncritical issue is to be handled.\
    \ In such a case, a tradeoff between energy consumption and data\ntimelines is\
    \ necessary. By contrast, some agricultural applications are delay tolerant (i.e.,\
    \ time\ninsensitive), such as protein content, milk fat [177], gathering data\
    \ from soil and grass monitoring.\nWith delay tolerant approach, the short range\
    \ low power wireless protocols can be used [178].\nWhere the information of the\
    \ agricultural ﬁeld can be collected and transferred to the master\nnode or to\
    \ a cloud computing node using “messengers” e.g., a mobile node (mobile robot\
    \ or\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n36 of 45\nUAV). Consequently, the cost [179] and\
    \ the complexity of the agriculture WSN will be reduced\nand the lifetime will\
    \ be increased.\n(13) Fault tolerance: Fault tolerance is a crucial feature of\
    \ WSNs for succeeding PA. Several faults may\noccur in PA based on the WSN system,\
    \ which are (i) communication failure, (ii) faulty sensor\nsetting, (iii) sensor\
    \ component faults producing incorrect value, and (iv) node failure because of\n\
    exhausted battery or any other cause. Gutiérrez et al. [40] introduced communication\
    \ failure and\nnode fault tolerance for an irrigation system. If any fault occurs,\
    \ the irrigation system tracks the\ndefault irrigation program. The node energy\
    \ depletion failure was minimized in [1,40,180] by\nadopting solar-cell-powered\
    \ nodes. Data aggregation and topology control schemes are probable\nto be fault\
    \ tolerant for deploying sensor nodes in a vast area.\n(14) Data management: The\
    \ data management in agriculture poses a challenge because the large\namount of\
    \ data that can be collected from several sensors spread in agricultural ﬁeld,\
    \ especially\nwhen the agricultural data are intended to be connected to the cloud.\
    \ Determination of the\n(i) data analysis method, (ii) data collection schemes,\
    \ (iii) sensor types, (iv) semantic sensor\nnetworking, (v) big data, and (vi)\
    \ complex event processing enables the designer to manage\nthese crucial aspects.\
    \ The integration of IoT and software-deﬁned network also introduces a\npromising\
    \ and new methodology in deployment, monitoring, and design of network services\n\
    and resources [181].\n(15) Heterogeneous sensors: Integration of wired and wireless\
    \ heterogeneous sensors into information\nplatforms to perform interoperability\
    \ pose challenges in PA. Chen et al. [152] proposed “web\nservice-enabled cyber-physical\
    \ infrastructure” to solve this issue. The proposed system was able\nto integrate,\
    \ process, acquire, and distribute surveillance data from different physical sensors\n\
    spread in the PA system over the Internet. The infrastructure was executed to\
    \ serve as an\narchitecture middleware between PA clients and heterogeneous sensors.\n\
    6. Conclusions\nA review of WSN-based agricultural applications was presented.\
    \ A comparison was conducted\namong different wireless technologies or protocols,\
    \ such as WiFi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, GPRS/3G/4G,\nLoRa, and SigFox. The comparison\
    \ results revealed that the ZigBee and LoRa wireless protocols are\nmore convenient\
    \ for agricultural applications than the others because of its low power consumption\n\
    and suitable communication range for ZigBee and long for LoRa. A classiﬁcation\
    \ of energy-efﬁcient\ntechniques or algorithms and energy-harvesting techniques\
    \ was also provided. Based on the presented\ntaxonomy, we show that signiﬁcant\
    \ types of energy-efﬁcient and energy-harvesting techniques\ncan be used in the\
    \ agriculture domain. Previous research was also investigated and compared\nto\
    \ explore the current problems in agricultural applications based on WSNs and\
    \ obtain optimum\nsolutions for maintaining system performance. Challenges and\
    \ limitations were introduced for\ndesign considerations in the future. The state-of-the-art\
    \ approaches of IoT in agricultural applications\nwere reviewed and compared to\
    \ explore various sensors, actuators, devices, IoT platforms, and\napplication\
    \ layers.\nAcknowledgments: The authors would like to thank Al-Raﬁdain University\

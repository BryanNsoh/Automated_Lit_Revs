  explanation: The paper under review concerns cybersecurity and privacy considerations
    in smart farming applications. Gundu and Maronga (2019) emphasize that while the
    technological aspects of system security are significant, the human aspect is
    equally, if not more, essential for ensuring comprehensive protection. They argue
    that addressing vulnerabilities caused by human error and naiveté requires awareness
    campaigns and training programs to educate farmers and farm employees on safe
    practices and potential risks in smart farming environments.
  extract_1: Smart farming reduces the ecological footprint of farming due to efficient
    site-specific application of inputs, such as fertilizers and pesticides. This
    makes agriculture more profitable for the farmer as resource inputs would have
    been decreased. It also assists with mitigation of leaching problems as well as
    greenhouse gas emissions (Mahmoud, Yousuf, Aloul, & Zualkernan, 2015) and increase
    reliability of spatially explicit data which will ultimately reduce farming risks.
    Optimal, yield projections, site-specific weather forecasts, and diseases and
    disasters probability maps based on weather and climate data will help plan and
    optimize cultivation of crops (Walter et al., 2017).
  extract_2: 'However, this study only focuses on IoT, which is “a collection of many
    interconnected objects, services, humans, and devices that can communicate, share
    data, and information to achieve a common goal in different areas and applications.
    IoT is fast tracked by the rapid growth in nanotechnology which enables production
    of small and cheap sensors. This has brought about great potential towards faster
    decision making and automation in the agriculture industry in the following smart
    farming techniques: (automated irrigation scheduling (Reche, Sendra, Díaz, & Lloret,
    2015), precision agriculture (Barcelo-Ordinas, Chanet, Hou, & García-Vidal, 2013;

    monitoring (Mao, Miao, He, Li, & Liu, 2012), farm land monitoring (Corke et al.,
    2010), and farming production process management (Dong, Vuran, & Irmak, 2013)).

    of security risks and best practices are crucial for preventing breaches and ensuring
    the resilience of smart farming systems. They also highlighted the need for strong
    access controls and vendor trustworthiness to foster trust among farmers and encourage
    data sharing.

  main_objective: The primary aim of this study was to investigate the security and

  data_sources: Mathematical modeling, static structural FEM simulations
  explanation: 'The present study focused on the development and validation of a novel
    parabolic drill bit geometry to optimize the surgical procedure of preparing osteotomy
    sites for implant placement. Traditional straight cutting edge drill bits were
    shown to create conical cross-sections at the apical region of the osteotomy site,
    leading to poor bone-implant contact and potential implant rejection. The proposed
    design aimed to create a parabolic cross-section at the close end of the osteotomy
    site, which was hypothesized to improve bone-implant contact and reduce the risk
    of thermal necrosis during drilling.


    The proposed design was based on an analytical model developed by Elhachimi et
    al. This model was used to optimize the geometric parameters of the parabolic
    cutting edge, including point angle, helix angle, feed rate, and drill diameter.
    The model also predicted the forces and torque acting on the cutting edge, which
    were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed design.


    To validate the results of the mathematical model, static structural FEM simulations
    were performed on 23 promising designs. The simulations used the optimized geometric
    parameters as boundary conditions and considered stainless steel non-linear material
    properties for the drill bit. The results showed that only three designs were
    within the stress limits and were considered safe under both maximum principle
    stress theory and von-Mises stress theory.


    The study concluded that the proposed drill bit design has the potential to improve
    the surgical procedure of preparing osteotomy sites for implant placement. The
    parabolic cutting edge design was shown to reduce the risk of thermal necrosis
    and improve bone-implant contact, which could lead to better implant stability
    and longevity.'

  explanation: In this study, the impact of aerated drip irrigation on soil archaeal
    communities in a field tomato experiment was investigated. They found that ADI
    increased α-diversity values and changed the dominant phyla and genera of archaea.
    The soil C/N (organic carbon/total nitrogen) ratio and nitrate-nitrogen (NO3–-N)

  explanation: The study proposed a methodology to quantify agricultural drought over
    Heilongjiang Province, China, and how the severity of meteorological and agricultural
    drought influences maize yield. The authors investigate the relationship between
    soil water content, SPEI (Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index),
    and maize yield at the pixel level, across 50 different simulation units. They
    used an EOF (Empirical Orthogonal Function) analysis to identify the spatial patterns
    of dry and wet conditions, finding that meteorological drought was more severe
    in the western and southern parts of the province, while agricultural drought
    was more severe in the central and eastern regions. The authors then used Grey
    Theory to analyze the relationship between crop yield and drought, finding that
    there was a strong positive correlation between maize yield and SPEI in May, July,
    and August, and a negative correlation between maize yield and soil water content
    in May. The authors conclude that meteorological drought has a significant impact
    on maize yield in Heilongjiang Province, and that agricultural drought should
    be considered in addition to meteorological drought when making irrigation decisions.
  extract_1: From April to September, the consistent wet and dry changes across the
    region in August and September, accompanied by drought and little rain or wet
    and rainy. The distribution of the EOF2 model shows that the whole region is in
    positive territory in August, and almost the whole region is in negative territory
    in September.
  extract_2: The percentage difference between crop yield and SPEI index and soil
    moisture content was different in different regions, still, the overall relationship
    between the percentage difference of crop yield and the SPEI index was greater
    than that of soil moisture content. In terms of monthly distribution, SPEI in
    May, July, and August had a higher grey correlation with crop yield, and soil
    water content in May had a higher grey correlation.

  key_findings: The study found that LoRa technology is a viable option for agricultural
    monitoring systems. The LoRa network was able to provide reliable data transmission
    over long distances with low power consumption. The distributed architecture of
    the system also made it more resilient to failures.
  limitations: The study does not provide a detailed analysis of the performance of
    the LoRa network in terms of latency, throughput, and reliability.
  main_objective: To explore the use of LoRa technology in agricultural monitoring
    systems.
  relevance_evaluation: The study is relevant to the point of discussion because it
    demonstrates the use of LoRa technology in a distributed architecture for enhancing
    system resilience in automated irrigation systems. The distributed architecture
    enables the end-devices to be connected to the nano-gateway and then to the server
    application, which provides redundancy and fault tolerance. This makes the system
    more resilient to failures and ensures that data can be transmitted even if one
    of the components fails.

  explanation: "The text provided under <full_text> contains a comprehensive evaluation\
    \ and ranking of ten distinct water management strategies for smart cities. The\
    \ evaluation was conducted using the Multi-Criteria Decision Making technique,\
    \ specifically the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), with the data collected through\
    \ workshops and expert judgments.\n\nThe key takeaway from the analysis is that\
    \ researchers and decision-makers should focus on \n1. Smart Metering and Monitoring,\
    \ Demand Management, and Behavior Change\n2. Rainwater Harvesting\n3. Graywater\
    \ Recycling and Reuse\n\nas these strategies have been identified as the most\
    \ effective and important for enhancing water management in smart cities. The\
    \ medium-weighted strategies should be carefully considered and implemented alongside\
    \ other strategies for a well-rounded water management approach.\n\nThe ranking\
    \ of strategies was based on a detailed assessment of various criteria, including\
    \ effectiveness and risk management, resource efficiency, equity, and social considerations,\
    \ scalability and adaptability, environmental impact, integration with existing\
    \ systems, technological feasibility, and ease of implementation, long-term sustainability,\
    \ community engagement and public acceptance, regulatory and policy alignment,\
    \ and return on investment. The relative weights assigned to these criteria were\
    \ determined through a pairwise comparison process involving experts in the field."

  explanation: The edge computing concept is a computational paradigm that pushes
    acquired data away from the core of data centers to the outer edges of a network,
    closer to the data sources, potentially fostering benefits such as faster event
    response, better data bandwidth exploitation, increased reliability, scalability
    and maintenance support. The article in consideration presents the design and
    implementation of a real case study, namely the Smart Street Cosenza, which is
    a smart street implemented in the town of Cosenza (Italy) that furnishes decentralized
    urban intelligence services to citizens, especially related to climatic and environmental
    wellness and anomalies detection. The paper describes the Smart Street in terms
    of design, development and deployed components, and remarks how edge computing
    is implemented by using the agent metaphor natively supported by iSapiens, the
    IoT tool used to implement the smart street functionalities.

  key_findings: There is a need for distributed architectures and edge computing to
    enhance system resilience, and for the development of standardized interoperable
    solutions.
  limitations: The article is not directly focused on addressing the challenges and
    strategies for integrating automated systems with existing infrastructure and
    other precision agriculture technologies, as the focus is on the integration,
    interoperability, and standardization of automated irrigation management systems.
  main_objective: To present a comprehensive and critical evaluation of the current
    state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management
    systems.

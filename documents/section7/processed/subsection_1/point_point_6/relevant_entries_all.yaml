  explanation: The study's purpose was to create a new irrigation management system
    that could automatically control and monitor irrigation systems in real time.
    This new system would monitor various aspects of the irrigation system, such as
    water flow, temperature, humidity, pH and EC, and use this data to make real-time
    decisions about how to manage the irrigation system. This would allow for more
    efficient use of water and energy, and could help to improve crop yields.

    \ in any medium, provided the original work is\nproperly cited.\nIn recent years,\
    \ intelligent sensor techniques have achieved signiﬁcant attention in agriculture.\
    \ It is applied in agriculture to plan the\nseveral activities and missions properly\
    \ by utilising limited resources with minor human interference. Currently, plant\
    \ cultivation\nusing new agriculture methods is very popular among the growers.\
    \ However, the aeroponics is one of the methods of modern\nagriculture, which\
    \ is commonly practiced around the world. In the system, plant cultivates under\
    \ complete control conditions in\nthe growth chamber by providing a small mist\
    \ of the nutrient solution in replacement of the soil. The nutrient mist is ejected\n\
    through atomization nozzles on a periodical basis. During the plant cultivation,\
    \ several steps including temperature, humidity,\nlight intensity, water nutrient\
    \ solution level, pH and EC value, CO2 concentration, atomization time, and atomization\
    \ interval\ntime require proper attention for ﬂourishing plant growth. Therefore,\
    \ the object of this review study was to provide signiﬁcant\nknowledge about early\
    \ fault detection and diagnosis in aeroponics using intelligent techniques (wireless\
    \ sensors). So, the farmer\ncould monitor several paraments without using laboratory\
    \ instruments, and the farmer could control the entire system\nremotely. Moreover,\
    \ the technique also provides a wide range of information which could be essential\
    \ for plant researchers and\nprovides a greater understanding of how the key parameters\
    \ of aeroponics correlate with plant growth in the system. It oﬀers\nfull control\
    \ of the system, not by constant manual attention from the operator but to a large\
    \ extent by wireless sensors.\nFurthermore, the adoption of the intelligent techniques\
    \ in the aeroponic system could reduce the concept of the usefulness of\nthe system\
    \ due to complicated manually monitoring and controlling process.\n1. Introduction\n\
    Agriculture has an ancient history nearly dates back to\nthousands of years. Moreover,\
    \ its advancement has been\npushed by implementing the several new systems, practices,\n\
    technologies, and approaches with the time. It employs over\none-third of the\
    \ global workforce [1]. The agriculture is the\nbackbone of an economy for many\
    \ countries and executes a\nsigniﬁcant contribution to the development of the\
    \ economy\nfor underdeveloped countries. Besides, it steers the process\nof economic\
    \ prosperity in developed countries. Several\nresearch studies concluded that\
    \ overall world agriculture uses\napproximately seventy percent per year available\
    \ fresh water\nto irrigate only seventeen percent of the land. Another side,\n\
    the total available irrigated land is gradually decreasing due\nto the rapidly\
    \ increasing of food requirements and eﬀects of\nglobal warming [2, 3]. In other\
    \ words, agriculture is dealing\nwith new main signiﬁcant challenges. Foote [4]\
    \ said FAO\nreported that world food production must be increased by\nseventy\
    \ percent to provide suﬃcient food production for\nthe fast-growing population\
    \ and urbanisation. The expected\nworld population growth for the half of the\
    \ present century\nis daunting. However, depending on the estimate, it could\n\
    be expected to rise above the nine billion people by midcen-\ntury. As many studies\
    \ reported that the population is increas-\ning very fast, the global population\
    \ was one billion in 1800,\nHindawi\nJournal of Sensors\nVolume 2018, Article\
    \ ID 8672769, 18 pages\nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2018/8672769\nand it increased\
    \ to seven billion people in 2012. However,\nstudies report feared that at the\
    \ end of the current century,\nit could be expected to reach eleven billion people\
    \ and there\ncould be many, many more mouths to feed soon. Thus, the\nrapid increase\
    \ of the population, alongside the decrease in\nagriculture land, intensiﬁcation\
    \ of global climate changes,\nand exacerbation of water resources, declines labour\
    \ force\nand energy crunches are posing tremendous challenges and\nhurdles to\
    \ the agriculture sector [5, 6]. Furthermore, the\ndeveloping and developed countries\
    \ will deal with substantial\nwater crises and issues due to rapid urbanisation\
    \ and indus-\ntrialisation. The available fresh water for irrigated agriculture\n\
    land is supposed to decrease in future [7, 8]. Besides, the\nunpredictable climate\
    \ changes include extreme weather con-\nditions, intense storms, heat waves, and\
    \ ﬂoods will have a\nsubstantial adverse impact on world agriculture sector. We\n\
    need more production from agricultural systems to meet\nthe growing food demands.\
    \ Otherwise, we will suﬀer from\nfood insecurity problems which will be the biggest\
    \ threat.\nMoreover, Qiu and coworkers [9] revealed that the progress\nof the\
    \ agriculture production is not only signiﬁcant for to\nproducing food to feed\
    \ the population, but it is also essential\nfor the industrial sector. Similarly,\
    \ the agriculture is the main\nsource to produce the raw material for many industrial\
    \ sec-\ntors. Therefore, it must be understood that industrial and\nagricultural\
    \ developments are not alternatives. However,\nboth sectors are complementary\
    \ to each other on the path\nto achieving the food security issues.\nAs the evolution\
    \ of humankind from hunters and gath-\nerers to agrarian societies, the eﬀorts\
    \ have mainly focused\non improving the plant yield and productivity by either\n\
    genetic changes, cultural or husbandry, management prac-\ntices, or by developing\
    \ and introducing plant protection\nmeasures. Accordingly, in the last and present\
    \ century,\npeoples have started exploring the possibilities by adopting\ndiﬀerent\
    \ modern techniques in agriculture. The adoption\nof the precision farming methods\
    \ in agriculture is one of\nthe excellent examples. The purpose is to try and\
    \ mechan-\nise them in agriculture to prevent the crop losses due to\nsudden climatic\
    \ changes, soil-borne diseases, pest attaches,\nand so on. However, many research\
    \ studies have been\nsuggested and reported that problems and challenges of\n\
    agriculture could overcome by adopting the precision farm-\ning methods. At present,\
    \ several countries are increasing\ntheir farming productivities by implementing\
    \ the precision\nfarming methods.\nBaudoin et al. [10] reported that the artiﬁcial\
    \ plant grow-\ning method (e.g., greenhouse and factory farms) is one of the\n\
    fundamental types of precision agriculture. Nowadays, the\nmethod is receiving\
    \ importance and gaining the intention\nof the growers. The method can provide\
    \ suﬃcient food\nsupply throughout the year. In the system, the plant grows\n\
    around the year by artiﬁcially adjusting and controlling\nthe surrounding environmental\
    \ conditions such as tempera-\nture, CO2 (carbon dioxide), humidity, light intensity,\
    \ airﬂow,\nand nutrients supply within the conﬁned facilities [11, 12].\nBesides,\
    \ the system minimises environmental impact and\nmaximises the crop yield with\
    \ signiﬁcant results as compared\nwith traditional (open-ﬁeld) cultivation system\
    \ [13]. Savvas\nand team [14] informed that at present soilless plant cultiva-\n\
    tion is one of the most disruptive inventions ever presented\nin the ﬁeld of artiﬁcial\
    \ plant growing system. The soilless sys-\ntem refers to plant cultivation techniques\
    \ without the use of\nsoil by providing artiﬁcial solid material or water nutrient\n\
    solution as a growing medium instead of soil. However, the\nwater culture is related\
    \ to the process of hydroponic and\naeroponic plant cultivation (Figure 1). In\
    \ both methods, the\nroots of the plant are continuously or intervalley nurtured\n\
    with or within water nutrient solution by providing a spe-\nciﬁc control environment\
    \ in artiﬁcial supporting structure\n[16, 17]. Both methods provide many beneﬁts\
    \ to the grower\nsuch as full control of nutrient concentration and supply and\n\
    prevention of many soil-borne diseases and infections to\nplant, thus resulting\
    \ in increased plant yield with signiﬁcant\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n\

    \ of available\nnatural resources [18, 19].\nSeveral studies reported aeroponic\
    \ and hydroponic\nsystems as a modern and innovative plant cultivation tech-\n\
    niques under the soilless system. By adopting these tech-\nniques, the growing\
    \ food crises could be resolved [20, 21].\nMoreover, the hydroponic system to\
    \ grow initially leafy\ngreen vegetables was the ﬁrst to emerge, which started\
    \ taking\ncommercial exploitation routes in industrialised countries in\nwest\
    \ and east but eventually was found to have particular\ndefects and problems that\
    \ forced people to discover and\nexperiment with newer variations and techniques\
    \ like the\naeroponic system. According to the NASA report, the aero-\nponic system\
    \ could reduce water, nutrient, and pesticide\nusage by 98, 60, and 100 percent,\
    \ respectively, and increase\nthe plant yield by 45 to 75 percent [22].\nThe primary\
    \ motivation of this review article is to pro-\nvide an idea about the use of\
    \ intelligent sensor techniques\nin the aeroponic system. It could provide an\
    \ opportunity\nfor full automation, scalability, anytime-anyplace access\nmonitoring,\
    \ and fault diagnostics in the aeroponic system.\nMoreover, it would be helpful\
    \ for the local farmer and grower\nto provide timely information about rising\
    \ problems and\ninﬂuencing factors for successful plant growth in the aeropo-\n\
    nic system. The farmers could start to understand their crops\nat a micro scale\
    \ and able to communicate with plant through\naccessible technology. To the best\
    \ of our knowledge, this is\nthe ﬁrst work to provide a brief review of the use\
    \ of intelligent\nsensor techniques in the aeroponic system. However, the rest\n\
    of the paper is organised as follows: Section 2 describes the\ncurrent work in\
    \ the aeroponic system with intelligent sensor\ntechniques. In Sections 3, 4,\
    \ and 5, we present the brief\ndescription about the aeroponic system, application,\
    \ and\nworking protocol of wireless sensor network in the aeroponic\nsystem. Sections\
    \ 6, 7, 8, and 9 describe the advantages, future\napplication, application of\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence in agricul-\nture, and conclusion.\n2. Related Work\n\
    Aeroponics is the new plant growing technique of modern\nagriculture. Until now,\
    \ it is not entirely implicated among\nthe farmers. Mostly, it is practiced by\
    \ the researchers for\nperforming the experimental studies. Their study reports\n\
    concluded that it could be well accepted in agriculture as\na modern-day plant\
    \ cultivation activity where the modern\nfarmer does not need soil to grow the\
    \ plant. However, the\naeroponic system has some substantial vulnerability like\
    \ a\nfailure of water supply pumps, nutrient distribution line\nand preparation,\
    \ and atomization nozzle clogging, which\nrequire special knowledge and attention\
    \ to avoid damage,\nrapid plant death, and failure of the system [23]. Further-\n\
    more, the integration of the intelligent agriculture techniques\ncould be the\
    \ best solution to avoid or deal with the above-\nmentioned issues without any\
    \ technical expertise. Xiong\nand Qiao [24] reported that the integration of the\
    \ intelligent\nagriculture systems could be an eﬀective approach for solving\n\
    complex problems of agriculture domains. Zhai et al. [25]\nreported that presently,\
    \ several research studies had been\nconducted on the use of intelligent techniques\
    \ in agriculture\nespecially in the last two decades. Besides, several new tech-\n\
    niques and application have been introduced and patented\nto improve the traditional\
    \ agriculture practices. However,\nexperts mainly focused and monitor the climatic\
    \ condition,\nsoil properties, water quality, plant development, livestock\nmanagement,\
    \ and fertilizer application, pesticide applica-\ntion, and illumination control\
    \ through various intelligent\ntechniques [26–32]. Meanwhile, it could be concluded\
    \ that\ntraditional agricultural logistics is improved and upgraded by\nintroducing\
    \ and implementing the several modern technolo-\ngies and techniques in agriculture\
    \ domains [33]. Basnet and\nBang [34] reported that the collecting information\
    \ through\nsensors and communication technology played a vital role\nin improving\
    \ agricultural production. It has shifted agri-\nculture from input-intensive\
    \ to knowledge-intensive, and\nagriculture becomes more networked and decision-making.\n\
    Both small- and large-scale farmer can beneﬁt from intro-\nducing this technique\
    \ into the agriculture value chain, having\ntheir productivity increased, quality\
    \ improved, services\nextended, and costs reduced. It provides insights into various\n\
    issues in the agriculture like weather prediction, crop and\nlivestock disease,\
    \ irrigation management, and supply and\ndemand of agriculture inputs and outputs\
    \ and helps in solv-\ning those problems. Rehman and Shaikh [35] concluded that\n\
    at present, several information technologies including satel-\nlite navigation,\
    \ grid and ubiquitous computing, and sensor\nnetwork are exercised in agriculture.\
    \ However, the applica-\ntion of the sensor network is supporting agriculture\
    \ practices\nand activities in a very positive direction [36, 37]. Zhang and\n\
    coworkers [38] used a sensor network to monitor air tem-\nperature, humidity,\
    \ ambient light, and soil moisture and\ntemperature. Also, the aeroponic system\
    \ is the new applica-\ntion of the soilless agriculture. Besides, several studies\
    \ had\nbeen successfully designed the aeroponic system by using\nvarious information\
    \ technologies approaches such as Tik\nand coworkers [39] designed and implemented\
    \ a wireless\nsensor network to monitor the aeroponic system. They used\ntemperature,\
    \ light intensity, pH, and EC monitoring sen-\nsors. Moreover, the study reported\
    \ that the wireless sensor\nnetwork oﬀers a wide range of information which could\n\
    be required for the horticulturist to provide a greater\nunderstanding of how\
    \ these environmental and nutrient\nparameters are correlated with plant growth.\
    \ The real-time\ninformation obtained from sensor nodes can be utilised to\noptimise\
    \ strategies to control the temperatures and the other\nproperties of the nutrient\
    \ solution. A study by Pala et al. [40]\nproposed an approach to monitor automation\
    \ and early fault\ndetection tools in the aeroponic system through intelligent\n\
    techniques. In the protocol, they designed a highly scalable\naeroponic system\
    \ and coded as aero-pot prototype. They\ndeveloped software based on a genetic\
    \ algorithm to optimise\npower consumption of the aeroponic system. Their study\n\
    concluded that using this software user can deﬁne various\nproperties and virtually\
    \ conﬁgure the aeroponic system.\nThe developed software can allow the user to\
    \ add and remove\nthe lights and pumps and deﬁne consumption of added\ndevices\
    \ with minimum grower eﬀort. Laksono et al. [41]\ndesigned a wireless sensor and\
    \ actuator network for the\n3\nJournal of Sensors\ncontrolling, monitoring, and\
    \ conditioning of an aeroponic\ngrowth chamber. The designed wireless protocol\
    \ was based\non ZigBee technique. They also designed a data transmission\nsystem\
    \ to transfer the data from the database server to\nadministrator through text\
    \ message. The proposed system\nwas based on the sensors, actuators, communication\
    \ system,\nand database server. The experiment results showed that the\nproposed\
    \ wireless protocol based on ZigBee techniques was a\nuseful tool of the wireless\
    \ sensor network to monitor the\naeroponic system. Jonas et al. [42] developed\
    \ an automatic\nmonitoring system to control the environmental and nutri-\nent\
    \ supply of the aeroponic system. The designed wireless\nprotocol was based on\
    \ Arduino development board. Their\nstudy concluded that the proposed system can\
    \ control the\nnutrient atomization frequency based on the root chamber\nmoisture\
    \ content. However, the system can automatically\ntransfer all the gathered information\
    \ to a web server and also\nshare on Twitter. Sani et al. [43] recommended a web-based\n\
    control and monitoring system for the aeroponic system.\nTheir system was composed\
    \ of microcontrollers (using\nArduino IDE program), actuators (two relays include\
    \ atomi-\nzation spray and fan on/oﬀ on speciﬁc time), the sensor (tem-\nperature\
    \ and pH sensor), LDR (light intensity sensor), and\ncommunication modules (GSM/GPRS/3G\
    \ modem). The\npresent study concluded that our proposed design was able\nto monitor\
    \ and measure the temperature, pH, light intensity,\natomization time and interval\
    \ time, and fan activation time\nand interval time in the aeroponic system. The\
    \ proposed\nmethod was able to directly send the real-time information\nfrom the\
    \ sensor to the server via the Internet using GSM.\nAnitha and Periasamy [44]\
    \ designed wireless sensor tech-\nnique to monitor the aeroponic system. The technique\
    \ was\nbased on the ZigBee prototype. The proposed network archi-\ntecture was\
    \ based on temperature, pressure, humidity, water\nlevel, and pH monitoring sensors.\
    \ The sensors transmitted\nthe gathered data to the GSM (Global System for Mobile)\n\
    node or coordinator node, whereas the gateway device was\nused to transfer the\
    \ data to the personal computer. However,\na server was connected to the database\
    \ where the maximum\nand minimum threshold values of pH, water level, and tem-\n\
    perature were ﬁxed. Furthermore, if the monitored value\nreaches above or below\
    \ the threshold values stored in the\ndatabase, thus, the system was able to start\
    \ the alarm sound\nto aware the farmer. Another study in 2016 by Kernahan\nand\
    \ Cupertino [45] invented a system to monitor and control\nthe aeroponic system\
    \ using wireless techniques. They con-\ncluded that a reliable aeroponic system\
    \ provides a wireless\nconnection between its subsystem for the exchange of data\n\
    and commands. The various subsystems manage one or\nmore plants growing atriums\
    \ include nutrient atomization\non hanged roots, maintenance, control of nutrient\
    \ solution\nlevel, the addition of various nutrients, and control of the\nlight\
    \ quantity and cycle. A study by Montoya et al. [46]\ndesigned a wireless sensor\
    \ system to monitor the aeroponic\nsystem. The system protocol was based on the\
    \ Arduino\ndevelopment board. They used analog and digital sensors\nfor monitoring\
    \ temperature, nutrient atomization, EC, and\npH ﬂuctuations and level of nutrient\
    \ solution in the nutrient\nreservoir. In order to acquire data and automation\
    \ system,\nthe two Arduinos were managed in a master-slave conﬁgu-\nration and\
    \ connected to each other through wireless by\nWi-Fi. All the recorded data was\
    \ autosaved in microSD\nmemory and sent to a web page. Their study concluded that\n\
    the proposed protocol could be used for automation and\ncould monitor the aeroponic\
    \ system. Kerns and Lee [47]\nﬁrstly designed and introduced an aeroponic system\
    \ using\nIoT (Internet of things) to automate the system. The pro-\nposed system\
    \ is comprised of a mobile application, service\nplatform, and IoT device with\
    \ sensors (pH balance, tempera-\nture, and humidity). They used Raspberry Pi Zero\
    \ device and\ndesigned a system to monitor and measure the selected\nparameters.\
    \ The gathered data was autosaved into the data-\nbase server by sending an SQL\
    \ query. Their study concluded\nthat the proposed system could help farmers to\
    \ control and\nmonitor the aeroponic system remotely. Furthermore, Karu\n[48]\
    \ also designed and implemented a high-precision system\nfor small-scale aeroponic\
    \ plant cultivation. The system is\nallowed to precisely control the nutrient\
    \ solutions, pH, and\nEC levels and gives data about humidity, temperature, pH,\n\
    and EC concentration and amount of the nutrient solution\nin the reservoir. A\
    \ recent study by Martin and Rafael [49]\nalso proposed and suggested systems,\
    \ methods, and devices\nfor the aeroponic system. Mithunesh et al. [50] proposed\
    \ an\nintelligentcontrolsystem foranaeroponicsystem. Thesystem\nprotocol was based\
    \ on an open-source development board\ncalled Raspberry Pi. Their study concluded\
    \ that the developed\nsystem provides the simple management and high availability\n\
    established by using both the local and global systems. Idris\nand Sani [51] designed\
    \ monitoring and control system for\nthe aeroponic system. They concluded that\
    \ the developed sys-\ntem is able to monitor the aeroponic system working parame-\n\
    ter such as temperature and humidity by sending the data in\nreal time from sensor\
    \ to the display system. Janarthanan\netal.[52]concluded thattheproblemsoftheaeroponicsystem\n\
    could be solved by the use of wireless sensor and actuator\nsystem. It allows\
    \ the user to monitor and interact with the\nsystem through mobile app and a web\
    \ interface. However,\nLiu and Zhang [53, 54] designed an aeroponic system for\n\
    automatic control of water-fertilizer and temperature. They\nconcluded that system\
    \ supplies an experimental platform\nwith features of simple structure and convenient\
    \ control.\n3. The Aeroponic System\nThe aeroponic system is one of the techniques\
    \ of the soilless\nculture, where the plant grows in the air with the assistance\
    \ of\nartiﬁcial support instead of soil or substrate culture. It is an\nair-water\
    \ plant growing technique where lower portions such\nas the roots of the plant\
    \ are hanged inside the growth cham-\nber under complete darkness in controlled\
    \ conditions. How-\never, the upper portions of the plant such as leaves, fruits,\
    \ and\ncrown portion are extending outside the growth chamber.\nUsually, the artiﬁcial\
    \ supporting structure (plastic or thermo-\nfoam) is provided to support and divide\
    \ the plant into two\nparts (roots and leaves). In the system, plant roots are\
    \ openly\nexposed in the air and directly irrigated with a small droplet\nsize\
    \ of the water nutrient at interval basis. The nutrient solu-\ntion is supplied\
    \ through diﬀerent atomization nozzles with or\n4\nJournal of Sensors\nwithout\
    \ high air pressure. Moreover, several studies consid-\nered aeroponics as a modern-day\
    \ agricultural activity which\nis practiced in an enclosed growth chamber under\
    \ entire con-\ntrolled conditions, as it could eliminate the external environ-\n\
    mental factors as compared with traditional agriculture\nactivity. Hence, it is\
    \ no longer dependent on large-scale land\nuse, and it could be set up in any\
    \ place, a building that has\nlifted global climate without considering the current\
    \ climate\nsuch as rainy season and winter [23, 55–59]. Buer et al. [60]\nreported\
    \ that atomization nozzle uses the tiny amount of\nthe water nutrient solution\
    \ and provides an excellent growth\nenvironment for the plant. Zobel and Lychalk\
    \ [61] said it is a\nmodern-day agricultural research tool which provides several\n\
    agricultural research opportunities for a researcher with sig-\nniﬁcant results\
    \ by providing artiﬁcial growth conditions.\nHowever, Table 1 shows the essential\
    \ monitoring and control\nparameters in the aeroponic system. Hessel et al. [62]\
    \ and\nClawson et al. [63] studies discovered that aeroponics con-\ntributes to\
    \ the advances and developments in many areas of\nplant root studies. It provides\
    \ an excellent chance for plant\nresearchers to deeply study the behavior of plant\
    \ root under\ndiﬀerent conditions and without any complications. Until\nnow, many\
    \ researchers had conducted plant root research\nand experimental studies root\
    \ response to drought [64],\neﬀects of diﬀerent oxygen concentrations on plant\
    \ root\ndevelopment [65, 66], root microorganism [67–69], arbuscu-\nlar mycorrhizal\
    \ fungi production [70], and legume-rhizobia\ninteraction [71]. Furthermore, studies\
    \ also practiced the\ntechnique by growing vegetables, fruits, herbs, and medicinal\n\
    root-based plant [72–74] such as tomato, potato, soybean,\nmaize, lettuce, Anthurium\
    \ andreanum, and Acacia mangium\n[15, 59, 75–79].\n3.1. Present Status of the\
    \ Aeroponic System. The aeroponic\nsystem is one of a holistic production management\
    \ method\nin agriculture which promotes and improves agroecosys-\ntem, health,\
    \ and biodiversity. The system has a paramount\nreputation in the horticulture\
    \ department, because of its\nimplications on the economic and technical aspects\
    \ in the\nagriculture. Among all agriculture systems, only the aeropo-\nnic system\
    \ is receiving the full attention of farmers, policy-\nmakers, entrepreneurs,\
    \ and agricultural researchers. The\ngrower could reduce the requirements of chemical\
    \ inputs\nincluding fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides, and other agro-\nchemicals.\
    \ The grower could obtain higher cultivated plant\nyield and quality as compared\
    \ with other growing methods.\nHowever, the aeroponic system is labour-intensive.\
    \ It oﬀers\nmany opportunities for the farmers to increase rural employ-\nment.\
    \ The farmer can grow a plant in their homes by provid-\ning artiﬁcial growth\
    \ environment. Anitha and Periasamy\n[44] reported that nowadays many families\
    \ are practicing\nthe aeroponic system on their terrace. Besides, several coun-\n\
    tries of the world are using aeroponics for making an expan-\nsion in nourishment\
    \ creation managing the monetary issues\nand making the nation naturally amicable\
    \ to have their par-\nticular food supply. While some years ago, the use of the\n\
    aeroponic system was limited almost around the world\n[84]. At present, the system\
    \ is acquiring more attention from\nthe farmers and several countries are being\
    \ eﬀectively\nadopting as an economical and environmentally friendly veg-\netable\
    \ and fruit growing system. However, it is practiced in\nfollowing countries:\
    \ Abu Dhabi, Australia, Bhutan, Bolivia,\nBrazil, Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, China,\
    \ Canada, Colombia,\nEcuador, Egypt, Ethiopia, France, Germany, Ghana, Greece,\n\
    Indonesia, Italy, India, Iran, Japan, Israel, Kenya, Korea,\nMalaysia, Mongolia,\
    \ Malawi, New Zealand, Nigeria, Peru,\nPhilippines, Poland, Russia, Rwanda, Saudi\
    \ Arabia, South\nAfrica, Spain, Singapore, South Korea, Slovakia, Sri Lanka,\n\
    Taiwan,\nThailand,\nUzbekistan,\nand\nVietnam.\nBesides,\nattempts are made to\
    \ represent the system in other countries\nof the world [23].\n3.2. Key Problems\
    \ and Diﬃculties of the Aeroponic System.\nAeroponic cultivation is performed\
    \ in an outdoor and indoor\ninstallation and or in a greenhouse under controlled\
    \ condi-\ntions. It may be carried out within a facility that includes\nthe provision\
    \ of light for plant growth, the centralised deliv-\nery of nutrient solution,\
    \ and electrical power. The growing\nplants are set in a growth chamber and periodically\
    \ soaked\nwith nutrient solution small mist ejecting through atomiza-\ntion nozzle\
    \ (Figure 2). In addition, the aeroponic system\ngives the chance to control the\
    \ entire growth chamber envi-\nronment precisely. The aeroponic system is the\
    \ modern\ntechnique of the agriculture which is still under develop-\nment. Until\
    \ now, limited studies have been performed, and\nconducted studies concluded that\
    \ the system has some prob-\nlems and issues. Studies suggested that aeroponics\
    \ is per-\nformed without soil or any solid media; thus, the main\nobserved problems\
    \ are water and nutrient buﬀer, any fail-\nure of the water pumps, nutrient solution\
    \ distribution and\npreparation, atomization nozzle clogging, and so on, which\n\
    lead to rapid death of the grown plant [40]. Kernahan and\nCupertino [45] reported\
    \ that the aeroponic system provides\nbetter control of the plant growth and nutritional\
    \ availability\nand prevents the plant from various diseases and root rot.\nHowever,\
    \ during plant growth from sowing to harvest time,\nthe methods adopted in the\
    \ aeroponic system require a little\nhand-operated contribution, interference\
    \ regarding physical\npresence, and expertise in domain knowledge of plants, envi-\n\
    ronment control, and operations to maintain and control the\ngrowth of the plant.\n\
    Moreover, there is a requirement to sustain and keep\nretain the nutrient solution\
    \ parameters which include nutri-\nent temperature, pH, and EC concentration in\
    \ a narrow\nrange of preferred values for optimal growth. If these param-\neters\
    \ drift outside the desired range, it will create several\nproblems for plant\
    \ growth. In addition, some supplemental\nparameters can adjust to optimise the\
    \ plant growth further.\nThe additional parameters are atomization time, atomization\n\
    interval time, air temperature, relative humidity, light inten-\nsity, and carbon\
    \ dioxide (CO2) concentration which make\nthe system complicated and time-consuming\
    \ with high\nhuman energy and with the higher level of expert training\nand skill\
    \ for operating the system. However, the grower has\nthe responsibility to control\
    \ and monitor the ﬂuctuations\nof the above parameters in the desired range to\
    \ achieve\nthe suitable growth conditions for the speciﬁc plants. A fail-\nure\
    \ to accurately control and monitor the parameters could\n5\nJournal of Sensors\n\
    signiﬁcantly aﬀect the growth of the plant and cause ﬁnan-\ncial loss. If any\
    \ component failure occurs while the operator\nis not present on site, it may\
    \ be detected too late to prevent\nharm, because systems generally include some\
    \ automated\nmeans for periodically providing nutrient mist to the plant\nroots,\
    \ reﬁlling a nutrient reservoir, and managing light cycles\nand intensity. Therefore,\
    \ the aeroponic cultivation consid-\nered hitherto to be somewhat unsuitable for\
    \ the local grower\nand due to the above reasons and it is not common to\nﬁnd\
    \ an installation. However, the main reason for the low\nacceptability of the\
    \ aeroponic system is not a cost, but the\nmain drawback is the amount of attention\
    \ required of the\ngrower with a high level of expertise and judgment. For the\n\
    above-discussed reasons, more sophisticated and advanced\nmonitoring techniques\
    \ have implemented in the aeroponic\nsystem for early fault detection, real-time\
    \ monitoring, and\ncontrol and automation of the system. Hence, it would be\n\
    advantageous to use artiﬁcial intelligent tools (Figure 3) in\nthe aeroponic system\
    \ to detect fault and diagnosis problems\non time. Thus, it could help to avoid\
    \ rapid damages to grown\nplants and help to fully automate the aeroponic system.\n\
    4. The Aeroponic System and Sensor Network\nIn recent years, early fault detection\
    \ and diagnosis using an\nintelligent agricultural monitoring system is considered\
    \ as\nthe best tool to monitor plant without any complicated oper-\nations and\
    \ laboratory analysis which required domain exper-\ntise and extensive time. The\
    \ development of these convenient\nfeatures has attracted much attention in the\
    \ agriculture.\nThe system is based on a wireless sensor network which\ncomprises\
    \ of a data server, a wireless convergence node,\na plurality of wireless routers,\
    \ and a plurality of wireless sen-\nsor nodes. However, the wireless sensor nodes\
    \ are used as the\nTable 1: Basic monitoring and control parameters in the aeroponic\

    \ monitoring system\nand are used to collect each selected parameter of farming\n\
    operations to be monitored. Park et al. [85] stated that wire-\nless sensor network-based\
    \ systems could be a signiﬁcant\nmethod to fully automate the agriculture system,\
    \ because\nthe sensors provide real-time signiﬁcant information and\nbelieved\
    \ to eliminate the considerable costs of just wiring.\nAnother study by Kim [86]\
    \ said that in agriculture, sensor\nnetwork technique helps to improve existing\
    \ systems\ninstalled in the greenhouse eﬃciently and smoothly by for-\nwarding\
    \ real-time collected information to the operator\nthrough the radio signals.\
    \ The system optimises the trans-\nmission protocols more accurate and quick and\
    \ maximises\nthe application of energy to save the energy and reduce the\nconsumption.\
    \ Pala and team [40] suggested that the utilisa-\ntion of artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ techniques in the aeroponic sys-\ntems could lead not only to ﬁnd early fault\
    \ detection but also\nto fully automate the system without any or small interven-\n\
    tions of human operators. The aeroponic system could gain\nmore popularity among\
    \ local farmers by deploying this tech-\nnique in a system for monitoring and\
    \ controlling purpose.\nHowever, it will conserve resources and minimise impacts\n\
    on the environment. The farmers could start to understand\ntheir crops at a micro\
    \ scale and able to communicate with\nplant through accessible technology. Therefore,\
    \ in this arti-\ncle, we explored how wireless sensing technologies wove into\n\
    the aeroponic system. Thus, the primary motivation of this\nreview article was\
    \ to provide an idea about diﬀerent intelli-\ngent agriculture monitoring tools\
    \ used for early fault detec-\ntion and diagnosis for plant cultivation in the\
    \ aeroponic\nsystem (Figure 4). Additionally, it would be helpful for the\nlocal\
    \ farmer and grower to provide timely information about\nrising problems and inﬂuencing\
    \ factors for successful plant\ngrowth in the aeroponic system. The adoption of\
    \ the intelli-\ngent agriculture monitoring tools could reduce the concept\nof\
    \ unsuitable for the amateur.\n4.1. Number of Sensor Nodes and Input Parameters.\
    \ At pres-\nent, the utilisation of diﬀerent sensor techniques is almost\npossible\
    \ in every ﬁeld of life due to the sharp progressions in\nthe currently available\
    \ technologies. Moreover, the sensor is\na device that has capabilities to measure\
    \ physical attributes\nand convert them into signals for the observer [87]. A\
    \ WSN\n(wireless sensor network) traditionally consists of a few to\ndozens and\
    \ in some cases thousands of the sensor nodes\nwhich are connected to one or more\
    \ sensors [88]. Generally,\nit includes a BS (base station), which acts as a gateway\
    \ between\nthe WSN and the end users. Each sensor node is consisting of\nﬁve main\
    \ components, which are a microcontroller unit, a\ntransceiver unit, a memory\
    \ unit, a power unit, and a sensor\nunit [89]. Each one of these components is\
    \ a determinant in\ndesigning a WSN for deployment. Furthermore, the micro-\n\
    controller unit is in charge of the diﬀerent tasks, data process-\ning, and the\
    \ control of the other components in the node [88].\nThrough the transceiver unit,\
    \ a sensor mode performs its\ncommunication with other nodes and other parts of\
    \ the\nWSN. It is the most dominant communication unit. The\nmemory unit is another\
    \ important part of the WSN system,\nwhich is used to store the observed data.\
    \ The memory unit\ncould be RAM, ROM, and their other memory types ﬂash or\neven\
    \ external storage devices such as USB. Lastly, the last\none unit is the power\
    \ unit. It is one of the critical components\nof the system which is for node\
    \ energy supply. However, the\npower unit could be any source; it can store in\
    \ batteries (most\ncommon) rechargeable or not on in capacitors. In addition,\n\
    for extra power supply and recharging the power unit, the\navailable natural resource\
    \ could be used. The natural sources\ninduce solar power energy in forms of photovoltaic\
    \ panels\nand cells, wind power energy with turbines, kinetic energy\nfrom water,\
    \ and so on. Last but not the least is the sensor unit,\nwhich includes several\
    \ sensors for parameter measurements\nsuch as temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide,\
    \ methane,\nand carbon monoxide [90]. However, in the aeroponic sys-\ntem, the\
    \ total required number of sensors and actuators\ndepends on the size and requirement\
    \ of the operator.\n4.2. Sensor Types and Monitoring Parameters. In this review\n\
    study, we reviewed the previous work done on the aeroponic\nsystem using wireless\
    \ sensor network technique. We found\nthat the primary objective of a wireless\

    \ and Lee [47].\n7\nJournal of Sensors\nsystem for the aeroponic system is to\
    \ control the growth\nchamber climatic condition as per the crop data sheet. How-\n\
    ever, the basic principle of the aeroponic system is to grow\nthe plant by suspending\
    \ in the closed, semiclosed, or dark\nenvironment in the air with artiﬁcial provided\
    \ support. In\nthe system, the plant stems, leaves, and any fruit grow in a\n\
    vegetative zone above the suspension medium, and roots\ndangle below the suspension\
    \ medium in an area commonly\nreferred as a root zone [46]. Generally, closed\
    \ cell foam is\ncompressed around the lower stem and inserted into an\nopening\
    \ in the aeroponic growth chamber, which decreases\nlabour and expense. However,\
    \ the trellising is used to sus-\npend the weight of cultivated plant [44]. Ideally,\
    \ the environ-\nment is kept free from pests and diseases so that the plants\n\
    grow healthier and more quickly than other plants grown\non techniques. Furthermore,\
    \ the key to the success and high\nyields of the air gardening is a scientiﬁc\
    \ grade monitoring of\nthe conditions and accurate control of the growing environ-\n\
    ment. Each plant yields and needs a diﬀerent environmental\ncondition for growth.\
    \ However, the plant growth is mainly\ninﬂuenced by the surrounding environmental\
    \ and climatic\nvariables and the amount of water and the fertilizers supplied\n\
    by irrigation. There is a requirement to monitor and control\nliquid nutrient\
    \ parameters in a narrow range of preferred\nvalues for optimal growth. The parameters\
    \ include nutrient\ntemperature, pH, and EC concentration. If the parameters\n\
    drift outside the desired range, the plants can harm. Besides,\nthere are some\
    \ additional parameters which can be adjusted\nto further optimise growth, such\
    \ as air temperature, relative\nhumidity, light intensity, and carbon dioxide\
    \ (CO2) concen-\ntration. Idris and Sani [51] reported that the one solution to\n\
    solve the problems of monitoring and controlling the grow-\ning conditions in\
    \ the space environment is by applying some\nsensors. The sensor can detect and\
    \ monitor a number of\nparameters such as temperature, humidity, light intensity,\n\
    O2 and CO2 levels, direction, and wind speed. Aside from\nthe sensors, there is\
    \ also a requirement for the actuators to\ndistribute nutrients and waters to\
    \ plant roots or lower stems\n(Figure 5). The sensor collects the information\
    \ of the various\nenvironmental conditions and forwards the signals to the\nactuator\
    \ to take place and produce the outcome for the col-\nlected information to know\
    \ the status of that parameter.\nThe actuator can control the environment changes.\
    \ The sen-\nsors store information that analyzes the environment and\nidentiﬁes\
    \ the location, object, people, and their situations.\nThe sensor provides multiple\
    \ contributions in various\ndomains that depend on a variety of attribute and\
    \ variant\nin time [87, 91, 92].\n4.2.1. Temperature Sensor. In the aeroponic\
    \ system, the\ntemperature is one of the critical factors signiﬁcantly\ndetermining\
    \ plant growth and development. A reduction\nin temperature below the optimal\
    \ conditions often results\nin suboptimal plant growth. A diﬀerent cultivar requires\n\
    a diﬀerent temperature level for the photosynthesis process\nand growth, which\
    \ can advance the plant growth stage. It\nwill eventually bring us substantial\
    \ economic beneﬁts. In\nthe aeroponic system, the optimum growth chamber tem-\n\
    perature should not be less and more than 4 and 30°C,\nrespectively, for successful\
    \ plant growth. The temperature\nﬂuctuations of aeroponic growth chamber can signiﬁcantly\n\
    aﬀect the root growth, respiration, transpiration, ﬂowering,\nand dormant period\
    \ [93]. Therefore, the temperature sensors\ncan be used to monitor the temperature\
    \ ﬂuctuations of the\naeroponic system. At present, temperature sensors are used\n\
    in many applications like environmental controls, food pro-\ncessing units, medical\
    \ devices, and chemical handling. The\ntemperature sensor is a device mainly composed\
    \ of thermo-\ncouple or resistance temperature detector. The temperature\nsensor\
    \ measures the real-time temperature reading through\nMobile phone\nPC\nInternet\n\

    \ the data about tem-\nperature from a particular source and convert the data\
    \ into\nan understandable form for a device or an observer. The\ntemperature\n\
    sensor\naccurately\nmeasures\ntemperatures\nslower changing from critical applications\
    \ such as facilities\nor rooms and sends them to the user’s webpage.\n4.2.2. Humidity\
    \ Sensor. Aeroponics is the technique of culti-\nvating plant by providing the\
    \ water nutrient small spray in\nthe air. Thus, the humidity is another important\
    \ parameter\nof aeroponic growth chamber environments, and its control\nis recognised\
    \ to be very important for signiﬁcant plant\ngrowth. In the aeroponic system,\
    \ the plant gets all available\nmoisture in the growth chamber. Moreover, if the\
    \ growth\nchamber has too high or less moisture content, both condi-\ntions will\
    \ create many problems for the plant. Accordingly,\nan accurate and precise means\
    \ of testing moisture content\nin the growth chamber will help farmers to monitor\
    \ their\ncrops and provide a suitable growth environment for the\nplant. Wang\
    \ et al. [94] reported that a humidity sensor is a\ndevice that detects and measures\
    \ water vapour present in\nthe air within a room or enclosure. At present, humidity\
    \ sen-\nsors are widely used in medicine, agriculture, and environ-\nmental monitoring.\
    \ However, the most commonly used\nunits for humidity measurement are relative\
    \ humidity [95].\nThe development of humidity sensors has shown remarkable\nprogress\
    \ because of using various types of sensing materials in\nrecent years. The sensing\
    \ materials used in humidity sensors\ncan classify into ceramics, polymers, and\
    \ composites [96].\nThe humidity sensor could be placed in the growth chamber\n\
    to maintain the moisture level. If the moisture level becomes\nless than the plant\
    \ requirement, the sensors will forward the\nsignals to atomization nozzles to\
    \ perform their work.\n4.2.3. Light Intensity Sensor. As we know, all vegetable\
    \ plants\nand ﬂowers require large amounts of sunlight, and each plant\ngroup\
    \ reacts diﬀerently and has the diﬀerent physiology to\ndeal with light intensity.\
    \ Some plant performs well in low\nlight intensity and some in high light intensity.\
    \ However,\nthe aeroponic system implements in indoor conditions, so\nit is necessary\
    \ for the farmer to provide suﬃcient light quan-\ntity of at least 8 to 10 hours\
    \ for a day to grow the healthy\nplant. The artiﬁcial lighting is a better option\
    \ to present\nenough intensity to produce a healthy plant [97, 98]. In the\nconventional\
    \ aeroponic system, the control of the light quan-\ntity present in the growth\
    \ chamber is mostly done by farmer\nthrough observing the plant condition. However,\
    \ it is a time-\nconsuming and challenging task for the farmer to provide the\n\
    required light concentration accurately. It could be a better\noption to use intelligent\
    \ agriculture techniques to monitor\nthe light intensity in the aeroponic system.\
    \ The intelligent\nagriculture techniques mean using the sensor system to con-\n\
    trol the light intensity. The light sensor is an electronic device\nwhich is used\
    \ to detect the presence or nonpresence of light\nand darkness. There are several\
    \ types of light sensors includ-\ning photoresistors, photodiodes, and phototransistors.\
    \ These\nlight sensors distinguish the substance of light in a growth\nchamber\
    \ and increase or decrease the brightness of light to\na more comfortable level.\
    \ Light sensors can be used to auto-\nmatically control the lights such as on/oﬀ.\
    \ By adopting the\nsensor network in aeroponics, the farmer could be able to\n\
    monitor light intensity without any human interference.\nBecause the sensors will\
    \ perform all work such as if the light\nintensity in the growth chamber will\
    \ be less than the required\nlight quantity for plant growth, the sensor will\
    \ automatically\nforward the signal to the LED light to turn on until the light\n\
    quantity reaches to the desired level.\n4.2.4. CO2 Sensor. The appropriate oxygen\
    \ concentration in\nthe root environment is crucial to keep the root metabolism\n\
    in nutrition solution. The available oxygen concentration\nfor the root environment\
    \ is a hugely signiﬁcant factor since\nlow concentrations aﬀect the root respiration,\
    \ nutrient\nabsorption, and, consequently, the plant growth [66]. Thus,\nthe CO2\
    \ sensor could be used to monitor the carbon dioxide\nﬂuctuations in the aeroponic\
    \ growth chamber. A carbon\ndioxide sensor is an instrument which is used for\
    \ the mea-\nsurement of carbon dioxide gas concentration. Bihlmayr\npH sensor\n\

    \ sensors are used to measure indoor\nair quality in a building to perform demand-based\
    \ ventila-\ntion. However, the CO2 sensor data measuring range is in\nbetween\
    \ 500 and 5000 parts per million. There are two main\ntypes of the CO2 sensors\
    \ which include nondispersive infra-\nred carbon dioxide sensors (NICDS) and chemical\
    \ carbon\ndioxide sensors (CCDS), whereas the NICDS detected CO2\nin a gaseous\
    \ environment by its characteristic absorption\nand composed of an infrared detector,\
    \ an interference ﬁlter,\na light tube, and an infrared source. However, the CCDS\
    \ of\nsensitive layers are based on polymer or heteropolysiloxane\nwith low-energy\
    \ consumption [100].\n4.2.5. Water Level Sensor. The aeroponics is the method\
    \ of\nthe plant cultivation by providing a small mist of the nutrient\nsolution\
    \ in the growth chamber. Thus, there is no any use of\nsoil; just water is required\
    \ to cultivate the plant throughout\nthe germination to harvest time. Therefore,\
    \ the water nutri-\nent solution reservoir is one of the major components of\n\
    the aeroponic system which should be monitored throughout\nthe growth period.\
    \ In the conventional aeroponic system, the\nfarmer checks the water nutrient\
    \ level in the nutrient solution\nreservoir, and if he founds water level less\
    \ than the desired\nlevel, he maintained accordingly. However, by adopting the\n\
    precision agriculture techniques, the farmer will be able to\nmonitor and control\
    \ water nutrient level through the intelli-\ngent methods such as wireless sensors.\
    \ The water nutrient\nlevel sensors detect the liquid level in the reservoirs\
    \ and facil-\nitate operator in collecting water nutrient level data in real\n\
    time. The sensors will alert the operator about any potential\nproperty damage\
    \ that results from any leaks and also allow-\ning to know when a container is\
    \ nearing empty.\n4.2.6. EC and pH Sensor. In the aeroponic system, the plant\n\
    productivity is closely related to nutrient uptake and the EC\nand pH regulation\
    \ of the nutrient solution. The EC and pH\nconcentration of the nutrient solution\
    \ aﬀects the availability\nof the nutrients to plants [101]. The pH and EC concentra-\n\
    tions are controlled to prevent barrier growth. Their mea-\nsurement is essential\
    \ because the solubility of minerals in\nacidic, alkaline, and ion concentration\
    \ of all the species in\nsolutions is diﬀerent and the solution concentration\
    \ changes\nwith solubility [102, 103]. The unmonitored EC and pH\nconcentration\
    \ of the nutrient solution will quickly lead to\na situation where plants cannot\
    \ absorb the essential nutri-\nents, if not corrected this will eventually lead\
    \ to harmful\nplant growth and poor productivity. Thus, the EC and pH\nconcentration\
    \ of the nutrient solution is a critical parameter\nto be measured and controlled\
    \ throughout the plant growth.\nMoreover, in the conventional aeroponic system,\
    \ the EC and\npH value of the nutrient solution is mostly monitored manu-\nally\
    \ by performing laboratory analysis or using advanced\nequipment which is a time-consuming\
    \ process. For instance,\nwhen the EC of the nutrient solution decreased or increased,\n\
    the control of nutrient solution concentration is mostly\nachieved by adding more\
    \ high concentration nutrient solu-\ntion or the fresh water, respectively, to\
    \ the nutrient solution\nto maintain the EC level to the prescribed target range.\
    \ Sim-\nilarly, for pH, an acid solution and an alkali solution are used\nto control\
    \ the pH ﬂuctuation of the nutrient solution within a\nspeciﬁed target range [101].\
    \ However, these conventional\nmethods are time-consuming and challenging task\
    \ for the\nfarmer to maintain the EC and pH value at the desired range\naccurately.\
    \ In addition, the EC and pH sensor could be used\nto deal with the above challenges.\n\
    5. Sensor Working Protocol in the\nAeroponic System\nToday, the world demands\
    \ automatic tools to do most of the\nwork for them without bothering its user\
    \ for doing some task.\nSo, the concept is all about a very high level of automation\n\
    system which will be independent of its users to a very great\nextent, reduce\
    \ human eﬀorts, and save all kinds of resource\nutilisation, as monitoring and\
    \ controlling will be done by\ncomputers leaving very few easily manageable tasks\
    \ for\nhumans, and it will interest more people to join this ﬁeld\n[104–106].\
    \ Moreover, the monitoring and control system\nfor the aeroponic system mainly\
    \ consists of following sec-\ntions which include the aeroponic system, data acquisition,\n\
    controlling the equipment, data transmission module, cloud\ndata processing server,\
    \ social communication platform, and\nmobile application. A typical architecture\
    \ of sensor nodes\nfor controlling and monitoring the aeroponic system is\nshown\
    \ in Figure 6. Furthermore, in architecture, the data\nacquisition section refers\
    \ to some sensor nodes used in the\nAeroponic system\nData acquisition\nMobile\
    \ application\nControl and\nmonitoring center\nData transmission\nmodule\nSocial\
    \ platform\nCloud data\nprocessing server\nFigure 6: Schematic protocol of wireless\
    \ network in the aeroponic system.\n10\nJournal of Sensors\nsystem to establish\
    \ a data acquisition module. The data\nacquisition module is placed in the aeroponic\
    \ system or near\nthe growth chamber to collect the real-time information\nfrom\
    \ selected parameters (temperature, light intensity,\nhumidity, nutrient solution\
    \ level, atomization quantity, and\nphotos of the growing plants) and transmit\
    \ the gathered data\nto the control and management centre. However, the control\n\
    and management section refers to the central processing unit\n(CPU) of the system.\
    \ The CPU of the system consists of some\nprimary functions such as Arduino and\
    \ WRTnod protocols,\nwhose work is to store, manage gathered data from collection\n\
    nodes, process, and then accurately and automatically send\nto the web server\
    \ in real time [104–109]. Thus, the system\ncan help the farmer and grower to\
    \ monitor and control the\nsmart aeroponic system remotely using the mobile app.\
    \ In\nother words, the plant will be able to talk with the farmer\nthrough a mobile\
    \ app that whether the selected parameters\nare working well or not.\n6. Advantages\
    \ of Sensor Techniques in the\nAeroponic System\nThe continuously increasing food\
    \ demands require rapid\nimprovement and development in the food production\n\
    system. However, to enhance the quality and productivity\nof the cultivated crop,\
    \ peoples are moving towards the mod-\nern plant cultivation technologies in agriculture.\
    \ Thus, the\naeroponics is one of the rising plant growing technologies\nin agriculture\
    \ as a modern-day cultivation technique, where\nthe plant is cultivated in an\
    \ air environment, and no any soil\nsupport is provided. In the aeroponic system,\
    \ a number of the\nparameters are required to control for successful plant\ngrowth\
    \ because there is no any growing medium provided\nto the plant. For example,\
    \ if the plant has some sudden stress\nand the farmer is not present at the site\
    \ that means the plant\nwill die. Therefore, the proper management of the crop\
    \ is\nessential. In the conventional aeroponic system, grower uses\nhis knowledge,\
    \ skills, and judgment to adjust and maintain\nthe parameters such as EC and pH\
    \ meter, minimum and\nmaximum temperature, light intensity, and humidity level\n\
    through several instruments and checks the readings which\nare labour-intensive\
    \ and time-consuming task. To deal with\nthe above problems, the aeroponic system\
    \ can be developed\nwith a wireless sensor and actuator network for monitoring\n\
    the key parameters at lower labour cost, time, and without\nany technical knowledge.\
    \ The wireless sensor and actuator\nnetwork oﬀer several advantages including\
    \ faster response\nto confrontational climatic conditions and better quality con-\n\
    trol of the crop that produces at a lower labour cost. This\nadvancement in the\
    \ aeroponic system through wireless sen-\nsor network for monitoring growth chamber\
    \ environment\nis beneﬁcial. However, the monitoring system also oﬀers a\nrange\
    \ of information which could be required by plant scien-\ntists or grower to provide\
    \ a greater understanding of how\nthese environmental and nutrient parameters\
    \ correlate with\nplant growth. It is now recognised that plant grower can per-\n\
    fectly and easily acquire the skills needed to operate an aero-\nponic system.\
    \ It provides the full control of the system, not by\nconstant manual attention\
    \ from the operator but to a large\nextent by wireless sensors.\n7. Future Application\n\
    Artiﬁcial intelligence agriculture techniques are consid-\nered as a high potential,\
    \ improving technique for decision-\nmaking in agriculture. Nowadays, it is quickly\
    \ getting peo-\nples’ intention, more and more visible in our society and\ndynamically\
    \ turning our social awareness and lifestyle. The\ntechniques provide several\
    \ opportunities to monitor the\nplant growth and development from pre- to postharvest.\n\
    Aeroponics is the new plant cultivation technology of agri-\nculture which is\
    \ still under development. However, we\nreviewed the literature and found that\
    \ only limited study\nhad been conducted on the implementation of the intelligent\n\
    agricultural techniques in the aeroponic system. Moreover,\nuntil now, most of\
    \ the studies had been designed the aeropo-\nnic system using a wireless sensor\
    \ network using ZigBee and\nArduino system with Bluetooth, global system of mobile\
    \ and\nWi-Fi, and communication modules. During a literature\nsurvey, we noted\
    \ that no any single study had implemented\nthe idea of the cloud computing and\
    \ big data techniques in\naeroponics to collect real-time information via the\
    \ Internet.\nThe techniques provide many advantages to the user such\nas reduction\
    \ of the initial cost, allocation of the resources\non demand, and maintenance\
    \ and upgrade performed in\nthe back-end, easy, and rapid development. The techniques\n\
    present a chance to the operator to stay connected with the\nsystem using mobile\
    \ accessories like a smartphone, tablet,\nand PCs at any location via the Internet\
    \ which is not\nrestricted by conditions, locations, and time. Furthermore,\n\
    the system would be designed using additional artiﬁcial\nintelligence techniques\
    \ such as image processing, automatic\nseedling transplanters, and harvesting\
    \ and packing robots.\nThe purpose of image processing and analysis is to measure\n\
    and identify the physiology, growth, development, nutrient\ndeﬁciencies, diseases,\
    \ and other phenotypic properties of\nthe plants through automated and nondestructive\
    \ analysis.\n8. Application of Artificial Intelligence\nTechniques in Agriculture\n\
    Agriculture is the primitive and ancient application that\nhumans started ﬁrst\
    \ after born on earth. It has an extensive\nhistory between numerous industries\
    \ and very intimately\nlinked to the human development on earth. Moreover, in\n\
    the past, the agriculture sector was labour-intensive, but the\nnext-generation\
    \ farmers, researchers, and associated organi-\nsations proposed and applied new\
    \ farming methods, technol-\nogies, skills, and knowledge in agriculture as a\
    \ modern era to\nreduce labour-intensive task. Presently, the technology is\n\
    considered as a key tool to overcome many challenges and\neases the way how people\
    \ live. In the past, the many problems\nof agriculture, especially in irrigation\
    \ water management,\ncrop yield production, environment predication, and deci-\n\
    sion-making, were decided by many factors. In addition,\nthe fertilization often\
    \ decided by the mathematical equations,\nformulas, or the experiences of the\
    \ experts. The cultivation is\n11\nJournal of Sensors\nrepresented by descriptive\
    \ and causal knowledge, and diag-\nnosis of pests and diseases is represented\
    \ by uncertain knowl-\nedge. Thus, this knowledge and experience are illogically\n\
    incomplete and imprecise, and the traditional procedures\ncan not handle them.\
    \ However, artiﬁcial intelligence has its\nsuperiority. It could be an eﬀective\
    \ approach for solving com-\nplex problems to the levels of experts using imitate\
    \ experts\n[110]. The term artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) was developed in\n1956,\
    \ as “the science and engineering of making intelligent\nmachines” [111]. It is\
    \ a abroad discipline, which was devel-\noped for the interaction of several types\
    \ of ﬁelds such as com-\nputer science, information theory, cybernetics, linguistics,\n\
    neurophysiology, and psychology [112]. The main purpose\nof the creation of the\
    \ intelligence techniques is to ﬁnd the\nsolutions for complex problems and to\
    \ work, react, and\nrespond like humans. It performed work better than a well-\n\
    qualiﬁed person and brought positive economic and environ-\nmental results [112,\
    \ 113]. Artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) tools\nhave helped to predict the behavior\
    \ of nonlinear systems\nand to control variables to improve the operating conditions\n\
    of a system’s environment [114–117]. A recently published\nreport highlighted\
    \ that artiﬁcial intelligence is emerging as\npart of the solutions towards improved\
    \ agricultural produc-\ntivity. The global artiﬁcial intelligence in agriculture\
    \ is\nexpected to grow at a signiﬁcant level. It is employed to\nimprove the eﬃciency\
    \ of daily tasks in agriculture such as\nthe adoption of robots and drones, crop\
    \ health monitoring\nprotocols, automated irrigation system, and driverless trac-\n\
    tors [118]. At present, several research studies have been per-\nformed by implementing\
    \ the artiﬁcial intelligent techniques\nin agriculture. Popa [119] revealed that\
    \ some of the devel-\noped applications for agriculture are expert systems and\
    \ soft-\nware, sensors for collecting and transmitting data, and\nrobotic and\
    \ automation which are adapted from diﬀerent\nindustries into agriculture, whereas\
    \ the expert systems and\nsoftware is the planning process such as strategic or\
    \ opera-\ntional; it has beneﬁted substantially, due to the expansion of\npersonal\
    \ computer and Internet use. The systems are gener-\nated through the structured\
    \ knowledge base and reasoning\nmechanisms acquired from a human expert but with\
    \ an\nenhanced computational power and speed [120]. These sys-\ntems can demarcate\
    \ management zones taking in consider-\nation with relevant factors and able to\
    \ recommend suitable\ncrop rotations, optimal plant density, water requirements,\n\
    appropriate fertilizer use, diagnosing pests and diseases for\ncrops, and suggesting\
    \ preventive or curative measures\n[121]. Huang et al. [122] discussed soft computing\
    \ and appli-\ncations in agriculture. The study reported that soft comput-\ning\
    \ is the combination of the computing technologies, such\nas an artiﬁcial neural\
    \ networks (ANNs), fuzzy logic (FL),\nand genetic algorithms (GAs). These techniques\
    \ are opposed\nto the hard computing method which states to a huge set of\nstochastic\
    \ and statistical methods. The hard computing\nprovides inaccurate solutions and\
    \ results of very complex\nproblems through modelling and analysis with a tolerance\n\
    of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth, and an approxima-\ntion. However,\
    \ the soft computing techniques are used to\nachieve tractability and robustness.\
    \ It provides a low-cost\nsolution with a tolerance of imprecision, uncertainty,\
    \ partial\ntruth, and approximation [123–127]. Sui and Thomasson\n[128] developed\
    \ a BP-trained feedforward ANNs to predict\nnitrogen status in cotton plants based\
    \ on a data from a\nground-based sensing system. Tumbo and team [129] used\nan\
    \ on-the-go system for sensing chlorophyll status in corn\nusing BP-trained feedforward\
    \ ANNs and ﬁber optic spec-\ntrometry to acquire spectral response pattern data\
    \ in corn\nﬁelds. Tang et al. [130] developed a texture-based weed clas-\nsiﬁcation\
    \ method consisting of a low-level Gabor wavelet-\nbased feature extraction algorithm\
    \ and a high-level ANN-\nbased pattern recognition algorithm. El-Faki and group\n\
    [131] established and tested ANN-based weed detection\nalgorithms capable of detecting\
    \ the leading weed species\ncompeting with wheat and soybean crops. A study by\
    \ Krish-\nnaswamy and Krishnan [132] predicted the nozzle wear rates\nfor four\
    \ fan nozzles using regression and ANN methods.\nPearson and Wicklow [133] developed\
    \ a neural network to\nidentify fungal species that infect single kernels using\
    \ princi-\npal components of the reﬂectance spectra as input features.\nSmith\
    \ et al. [134] developed year-round air temperature pre-\ndiction models for prediction\
    \ horizons from 1 to 12 h using\nfeedforward-style ANNs. Zadeh [123] introduced\
    \ the con-\ncept of fuzzy sets as a mean for describing complex systems\nwithout\
    \ the requirements for precision. Fuzzy logic may also\nbe useful for descriptive\
    \ systems, those that fall somewhere\nbetween hard systems and soft systems, such\
    \ as biology\nand agriculture [135]. Studies reported that in agriculture,\nfuzzy\
    \ logic is used for multicriteria analysis of the image,\nimage classiﬁcation,\
    \ vegetation mapping, assessment of soil\nsuitability, and planning forest harvesting\
    \ [136–143]. Al-\nFaraj and coworkers [144] established a rule-based FL crop\n\
    water stress index (CWSI) using growth chamber data and\ntested this method on\
    \ tall fescue canopies grown in a green-\nhouse. Thomson et al. [145] and Thomson\
    \ and Ross [146]\ndeveloped a coupled sensor- and model-based irrigation\nscheduling\
    \ method. Yang et al. [147, 148] informed on the\ndevelopment of an image capture/processing\
    \ system to\ndetect weeds and a fuzzy logic decision-making system to\ndetermine\
    \ where and how much herbicide to apply in an\nagricultural ﬁeld. Gil and team\
    \ [149] applied multiple linear\nregression and FL inference models to evaluate\
    \ the eﬀects of\nmicrometeorological conditions on pesticide application for\n\
    two spray qualities (ﬁne and very ﬁne). Qiu et al. [150]\nestablished a fuzzy\
    \ irrigation decision-making system using\nvirtual instrumentation platform of\
    \ sensors, test instru-\nments, data logger, and LabVIEW. Generally, published\n\
    studies use on/oﬀ controllers where the inherent complexity\nof irrigation process\
    \ made it diﬃcult to achieve optimal\nresults [151]. Ali et al. [152] developed\
    \ temperature and\nhumidity controller inside the greenhouse using fuzzy logic.\n\
    However, several studies have been conducted to develop\nmany control strategies\
    \ to optimise the greenhouse environ-\nment using artiﬁcial intelligence techniques\
    \ such as neural\nnetwork, fuzzy logic controller, adaptive predictive control,\n\
    PID, and nonlinear adaptive PID control [153–159]. Zhu\net al. [160] used the\
    \ remote wireless system for water\nquality online monitoring in intensive aquaculture\
    \ using\nartiﬁcial neural networks. The results demonstrate that\nonline monitoring\
    \ for water quality information could be\n12\nJournal of Sensors\naccurately acquired\
    \ and predicted by using the remote\nwireless system. Mahajan et al. [161] reported\
    \ that agricul-\nture is noteworthy that computer vision applications have\ngrown\
    \ due to reduced equipment costs, increased computa-\ntional power, and increasing\
    \ interest in nondestructive food\nassessment methods. The use of these techniques\
    \ presents\nadvantages when compared with traditional methods based\non manual\
    \ work; however, there are still some challenges\nto be overcome. Moreover, the\
    \ principle of artiﬁcial intel-\nligence in agriculture is one where a machine\
    \ can perceive\nits environment, and through a certain capacity of ﬂexible\nrationality,\
    \ can act to address a speciﬁed goal related to\nthat environment.\n9. Conclusion\n\
    The objective of our study was to present the information\nabout the use of automated\
    \ monitoring and controlling tech-\nnique in the aeroponic system. The aeroponic\
    \ system is the\nnew plant cultivation method of the modern agriculture. Its\n\
    existence can allow producing food whole year without any\ninterval. The system\
    \ could create an excellent set which\nencourages the sustainable city life for\
    \ those peoples who\nwant to live in urban area. Moreover, during plant growth\n\
    from sowing to harvest time, the methods adopted in the\naeroponic system require\
    \ a little hand-operated contribution,\ninterference regarding physical presence,\
    \ and expertise in\ndomain knowledge of plants, environment control, and oper-\n\
    ations to maintain and control the growth of the plant.\nTherefore, the system\
    \ is considered hitherto to be somewhat\nunsuitable for the grower, and due to\
    \ the above reasons, it is\nnot common to ﬁnd an installation. We reviewed the\
    \ litera-\nture and found that implementation of advanced monitoring\ntechnology\
    \ tools in aeroponics could provide an opportunity\nfor the farmer to monitor\
    \ and control several paraments\nwithout using laboratory instruments, and the\
    \ farmer can\ncontrol the entire system remotely. Thus, it could reduce\nthe concept\
    \ of the usefulness of the system due to the com-\nplicated manual monitoring\
    \ and controlling process. The\ntechnology oﬀers incredible opportunities for\
    \ the aeroponic\nsystem to increase the capability, reliability, and availability\n\
    among the farmers and growers. We believe that our review\narticle will contribute\
    \ to the adoption of the advanced mon-\nitoring technology in the aeroponic system.\
    \ However, the\ntechnique provides a range of information which could be\nrequired\
    \ by plant scientists to provide a greater understand-\ning of how these environmental\
    \ and nutrient parameters\ncorrelate with plant growth.\nConflicts of Interest\n\

    Abstract One of the principal objectives of Integrated Water Resources Management
    (IWRM) is to solve water and development problems using methods that are environmentally
    sustainable, socially equitable, and efficient. In this chapter, we demonstrate
    how the principles of citizen science—the intrinsic involvement of nonscientist
    local stakeholders throughout the entire life cycle of a project—have the potential
    to complement and benefit those of IWRM; in particular, in relation to creating
    scientific evidence that underpins the governance of water resources. The rapid,
    recent development of information and communication technologies such as the Internet,
    smartphones, and social media has already demonstrated their capacity to make
    knowledge creation and governance more multidirectional, decentralized, diverse,
    and inclusive. We show how such new technologies can be harnessed with a citizen
    science approach to interrogate different aspects of the water cycle. One particularly
    promising development is to support citizen science with robust and low-cost sensor
    and networking technology. Such networks offer not only improved data coverage
    (especially in remote or data-scarce regions) but also enhanced sustainability
    at a time when monitoring networks are in decline globally. We argue that, in
    certain cases, citizen science and polycentric governance approaches can enrich
    and complement IWRM and merit greater attention. Previous chapter in volume Next

    Citizen Science, Sensor Networks, and Integrated Water Resources Management Integrated
    Water Resources Management (IWRM) emphasizes long-term sustainable approaches
    to water governance, focusing on co-ordinated decision-making and integrated approaches
    across all sectors (e.g., government, agriculture, and sanitation) and scales.1,
    2 Exclusively top-down and supply-led water management techniques have been recognized
    as imposing high economic, natural, and social costs on the environment and society
    that are increasingly unsustainable.2, 3 IWRM can be viewed as a means of achieving
    three strategic objectives4: • Equity in water allocation to different stakeholders
    (e.g., social and economic groups); • Efficiency in water transfer and use; •
    Environmental sustainability and protection of the water resources base. These
    salient pillars of IWRM provide an excellent fit with the emerging trend of democratizing
    science and hydrology in particular, in the context of citizen science-led research
    projects.5, 6, 7, 8, 9 While the manner by which “citizen science” is interpreted
    can vary widely depending on the project context, they generally involve citizens
    in at least one of steps of the knowledge generation process, that is, data collection,
    interpretation, analysis, and dissemination of results (Section 2). Although the
    practice of citizen science in hydrology and water resources has lagged behind
    other disciplines, as hydrological data are often difficult to interpret intuitively,
    while measurements tend to be expensive (e.g., using highly technical instruments),
    complex, spatially sparse, and temporally dense (for instance, long time series
    of discharge and precipitation), there is an increasing body of examples of citizen-led
    measurements, such as for precipitation, river water, and soil moisture levels.8
    This process has been greatly aided by rapid technological development over the
    past 10–15 years, with small, cheap sensors now widely available and easy to connect
    to smartphones, which themselves are generally fully Internet-connected and come
    with sophisticated cameras as standard (Section 3.1).10, 11, 12 We therefore identify
    sizeable potential to combine the principles of citizen science with new technologies
    such as low cost, networked sensors that measure variables as disparate as precipitation,
    soil moisture, dissolved oxygen content, and streamflow, within IWRM (Section
    3.2).13, 14 At the same time, a sensor network has been defined in a hydrological
    context by the WMO15 as a group of data collection activities for different components
    of the hydrological cycle that are designed to address a single objective: this
    definition shares similarities with the fundamentals of IWRM. It is therefore
    opportune to reflect on how the advent of citizen science and emerging sensor
    network technologies can be leveraged jointly to support IWRM. 1.2. The Advent
    of Low-Cost Networked Sensors in IWRM In the past decade, the use of in situ sensors
    in environmental monitoring has increased rapidly16, 17, 18; however, data gaps
    still exist at scales ranging from individual watersheds to the globe. Indeed,
    recent reviews have noted a marked decline in the amount of hydrological data
    (e.g., precipitation and streamflow) being collected in many parts of the world.16,
    17, 18, 19, 20 Moreover, guidance on sensor deployment, use, and data management
    remains limited.18, 21 As such, the choice of sensor for a particular activity
    and the design of a suitable network play a crucial role in decision-making in
    IWRM, for example, operational streamflow forecasting, irrigation, flood early
    warning systems, and water quality testing.18, 22, 23 Several such projects have
    already successfully integrated participatory data collection as a means to expand
    the observational database in both space and time.18, 21, 22 Moreover, the physical
    design of the sensor networks themselves for hydrological purposes is also increasingly
    enriched by citizen science approaches to data collection.8, 13, 24, 25 The iterative
    and long-term process of IWRM finds similarities with many citizen science-led
    projects, many of which are more successful when long-term sustainability is considered.13
    These rapid developments contrast against the fact that, over the same very recent
    period, IWRM has remained and still remains highly data scarce. In many regions,
    the lengths of existing time series are insufficient.26 IWRM encompasses many
    areas where a major need for better data availability persists, a lack that entails
    high societal cost (as it has a direct impact upon livelihoods). Also, institutional
    methods often struggle to create “actionable” knowledge at a local level. For
    instance, level and discharge monitoring is usually based on a sparse network
    of gauges that require extensive and technologically complex maintenance, which
    confines it to large institutions and government entities. This restriction often
    entails administrative and even legal issues over data access, which can frustrate
    community-level users.8, 13 The purpose of this chapter is therefore to explore
    the opportunities and potential challenges of citizen science and the use of low-cost
    hydrological sensors as a means to complement institutionalized data collection.
    We demonstrate and elaborate upon the intrinsic link between the two and how they
    can be embedded within a polycentric approach to water resources management, especially
    in remote, impoverished, data-scarce regions. 2. Citizen Science in IWRM 2.1.
    Principles and Background While the concept of citizen science is well established,
    several different definitions, both formal and informal, exist.13 Citizen science
    is most commonly defined as science by nonscientists: it is “… a form of science
    enacted and developed by citizens themselves”27, 28 or “[t]he participation of
    the general public in the research design, data collection and interpretation
    process together with scientists.”8 While there is a wealth of literature on the
    subject,29, 30, 31, 32 true citizen science projects can be differentiated from
    more general stakeholder engagement by the active involvement of citizen volunteers
    throughout the entire lifecycle of the IWRM project, requiring one or more motivational
    aspects, such as improving living standards or fostering a sense of national pride.8
    Such approaches have been encountered in water resources management well before
    IWRM was coined as a term: a bottom-up approach was recognized as key in the sustainable
    management of water resources as early as the 1970s.30, 33 Historically, the main
    motivation for citizen science was often based on environmental data collection
    by volunteers.8, 33 With time, the focus has broadened, shifting from acquiring
    data to other phases of the scientific process, including problem statement, analysis,
    and interpretation. Within this perspective, it is increasingly the citizens who,
    as engaged stakeholders, define the problem at hand and then collect relevant
    environmental information (e.g., observations of streamflow, rainfall, flood damage,
    and so on). A recent framework34 refers to this mode of citizen science as extreme
    citizen science or collaborative learning (Fig. 1). Download : Download high-res

    in citizen science, after Haklay.34 Specific examples within IWRM are shown on
    the right. IWRM, Integrated Water Resources Management. In this interpretation,
    the emphasis is not on the citizen as a scientist but on the scientist as a citizen.35,
    36 This method of practicing science is currently not widely accepted: taking
    into account local needs, practices, and culture, it requires scientists to engage
    at a profound level with the social and ethical aspects of their work.35 This
    process typically involves spending extended periods of time understanding the
    needs and concerns of a range of local stakeholders, the number and (sometimes
    competing) interests of which, in IWRM projects, is often manifold. This form
    of citizen science across an entire project lifecycle is gaining popularity and
    traction within water management and conservation sciences in particular.37, 38,
    39 There is a number of information gaps that hamper effective environmental monitoring
    for evidence-based decision-making, including insufficient data, inconsistent
    metrics, weaknesses in predictive models, and a lack of real-time monitoring systems.40
    While increasing numbers of stakeholders—governments and large development organizations,
    research centers and private companies, and local and national non-governmental
    organizations—engage in data collection, their activities are mostly uncoordinated,
    and the resulting data often remain underutilized. Most worryingly, very rarely
    do those metrics translate into usable, actionable knowledge for the communities
    directly affected by changes in water management.41 Recent research13, 34 has
    demonstrated that community-based monitoring can provide reliable data to help
    fill data gaps, for instance, in catchment and risk management.8, 9, 16, 42, 43
    Comprising both outreach (awareness raising, increased scientific literacy, community
    cohesion, and social capital) and research (robust and meaningful metrics) outputs,
    the participatory, community-led approach can be fruitful for policy development,
    as well as decision-making, across a variety of scales (e.g., local to (inter)national;
    village farmers to government institutions, and so on). The participatory approach
    has been shown to work best when there is active buy-in from the local community.5,
    28, 44 That is, the benefits to local stakeholders should be highlighted. The
    best projects have their aims and objectives defined at the outset; project members
    have appropriate expertise (not just scientifically but also in publicity and
    communication), and there is a clear willingness to listen and adapt as necessary.
    A participant is only a citizen scientist when they actively volunteer (i.e.,
    they are motivated by one or more factors) and maintain their activity throughout
    the duration of the project. In many citizen science projects, the involvement
    of a “community champion” or “gateway organization” (like a local water board,
    farmers'' co-operative, village council) is a key precept to secure long-term
    viability and sustainability; in others, it is possible for participants to lose
    interest and/or fall out of contact with each other and the project leads.10,
    45 Elsewhere, “citizen sensors” are less involved in the aims and formulation
    of the project, collecting data passively without any obvious motivation.11 However,
    the recent tendency is to involve volunteers in all intellectual aspects of the
    science, rather than capitalizing on them as a low-cost workforce.8, 9, 13 The
    implications of the Internet, smartphones, and new developments in sensing technology
    on citizen science in a hydrological context have recently been discussed.13 The
    increased mobile phone saturation across all societal segments—many in the most
    remote regions of the world possess smartphones prior to the arrival of electricity
    or mains water—opens up new ways of both gathering big data and accessing environmentally
    relevant information, having a profound impact upon the work of policymakers.46,
    47 Most current smartphones may be equipped with sensors that can be utilized
    for scientific observation, including transceivers, Frequency Modulation (FM)
    and Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers, cameras, accelerometers, digital
    compasses, and microphones.48, 49 While many of these sensors are not directly
    very useful for hydrology, mobile phones themselves can act as conduits of information
    as a means to obtain sensor data (e.g., physical observations, social media, and
    measurements from users sent to the predesigned scientific domain48, 50) and to
    deliver processed information to end users. Although, for reasons noted previously,
    intensive scientific training and specialization are normally prerequisites for
    data analysis and manipulation in hydrology and IWRM projects,51 new technological
    developments can, to some extent, circumvent these limitations, paving the way
    for the more rapid uptake of citizen science (Table 1).8, 13 Table 1. Some Commonly
    Measured Variables in IWRM and Opportunities Emerging From Citizen Science Applications

    2.2. Different Approaches to Citizen Science Many current research and practical
    projects in IWRM involve community-based responses to hazards like river flooding
    or water allocation and stewardship,68, 69, 70 creating the opportunity for real-time
    observation and appropriate courses of action to be taken.10, 71, 72, 73 In the
    majority of these studies, the role of citizen scientists is typically limited
    to information and data gathering rather than leveraging the full potential of
    actionable knowledge cogeneration.9 Compared with citizen science applications
    in bioscience and hydroecology (e.g., measuring water quality parameters and biodiversity),
    there is generally less emphasis on training the project participants.8 Recent
    technological development has, to an extent, obviated the need for intensive training:
    water data can be easily shared via short message service (SMS), instant messaging,
    or social media, requiring a minimum of technical expertise. This is because hydrological
    measurements are, in general, more automatized (cf. in hydroecology, where the
    data collection process is more complex).10, 11, 12 However, expertise is still
    required in the data processing and analysis stage; but because of the ability
    to share and transfer data, this does not necessarily have to be done by the citizens
    (or whoever is in the field) themselves but rather can be undertaken by remote
    experts.11, 12 The degree of self-organization of the citizen scientists varies
    widely, often as a function of the motivational aspects discussed in Section 2.1.
    On one end of the spectrum, water management projects that are labeled as “community-led”
    by the organizers may in practice involve very limited direct community engagement,
    and as a result of this, collect very little data or utilize it sparingly or poorly.
    For instance, drainage and early warning systems to reduce the risk from glacial
    outburst floods in Nepal were constructed and monitored following a remote crowdsourcing
    approach, but little action was then taken, owing to funding concerns and lack
    of continuing interest from participants.74 Moreover, the initial results of the
    Creek Watch program in the Western United States, a smartphone app–based project
    with the objective of water quality monitoring and flood resilience building,
    did not include the possibility of direct user engagement or future self-organization.
    This was related to a lack of specific, well-defined roles for the relevant actors.11
    Sometimes, governmental bodies, scientists, or other high-level stakeholders do
    not recognize local actors as being able to produce high-quality, official information;
    furthermore, community interest or deliberation over possible solutions may be
    lacking.13, 69, 74 On the other end of the spectrum, extensive community-led engagement
    exercises have generated fruitful results for knowledge cogeneration, from rural
    areas with multiple water management issues as in Western Nepal52, 74 to urban
    areas at risk from repeated flooding.68, 69, 70, 75, 76 The most effective projects
    (from the point of view that both scientific and citizen engagement objectives
    are satisfied) involve two-way information flow over the entire project lifecycle,
    which has been shown to improve citizen participation significantly, as well as
    their sense of situational awareness.8, 13, 77 In many of these projects, situational
    analyses led to a prior understanding of local livelihoods, power structures,
    and institutional frameworks, which enabled the scientific interventions to be
    better targeted, increasing local buy-in and long-term project sustainability.8,
    13, 52, 74 However, most citizen science projects in this context only involve
    monitoring and data submission (“citizens as sensors”: a “one-way street” according
    to Liu et al.10), with roll-out of citizen-to-citizen or citizen-to-scientist
    feedback (and more sophisticated information provision systems) generally lacking
    or at an early stage. This may place limits on the sustainability of ostensibly
    “successful” projects (such as those discussed previously).11, 45, 72, 73 For
    this reason, an increasing number of studies focus on the question of how citizen
    science concepts may be leveraged to create actionable knowledge in the context
    of natural resources management, including water resources. 2.3. Polycentric Approaches
    to Water Governance Water is a complex resource to manage for reasons that include
    its uneven global distribution, divergent, and often competing for needs of different
    stakeholders, and its absolute necessity in sustaining life. Managing resources
    in a polycentric manner has the potential to resolve many of these issues. For
    instance, in the polycentric model, water monitoring responsibilities are shared
    and overlap (between, e.g., farmers, local government, and sanitation authorities);
    these overlapping spheres of management ensure that monitoring still takes place
    should one entity neglect its responsibilities.74, 78 A polycentric approach to
    the governance of natural resources has also recently been explored in the context
    of climate change policy79 and has been recognized as paralleling recent technological
    development.77, 79 The combination of this polycentric conceptualization of water
    governance with citizen science strongly suggests that a participatory approach
    to data collection can enhance multidirectional information provision, polycentric
    water governance, local water resources management, and long-term sustainability
    of water resources management projects.8, 13, 25, 77 A polycentric water governance
    model may be more appropriate than IWRM in certain situations.9 Lankford and Hepworth78
    analyzed large watersheds in sub-Saharan Africa, finding their disparate environments,
    communities, and institutions not well suited to the IWRM paradigm, which uses
    a centralized, hierarchical, command, and control regulatory regime. By contrast,
    the actual management of water resources in such basins is characterized by informal,
    flexible, localized decision-making, largely based on local knowledge and dialog.
    Polycentric water resources management was judged to be more effective in such
    remote, data-scarce regions, where decisions tend to be small-scale and incremental.
    Citizen science–based monitoring complements this polycentric water governance
    model in its informality and highly distributed nature.9, 78 In this way, citizen
    science contributes to localized, multitiered decision-making.9 As mentioned earlier,
    the monitoring process itself has benefited greatly from rapid technological progress
    over the past 10–15 years, rendering it easier than ever for a nonscientist to
    make simple measurements or observations via smartphone apps or simple, off-the-shelf,
    low-cost sensors. 3. Low-Cost Sensors in IWRM 3.1. Sensor Networks The installation
    of networks of robust and low-cost sensors (e.g., automatic rain gauges and river-level
    distance sensors) is receiving increasing attention as a way to complement existing
    but often sparse institutional monitoring networks; for instance, in the context
    of risk management.11, 13, 77, 80, 81 One particular context in which such sensors
    have the potential to be particularly effective is that of participatory monitoring.
    The participatory aspect can be limited to the supervision and/or installation
    of such sensor networks. However, in high-risk, low-data availability areas, citizens
    can also provide additional, often qualitative, information via various devices
    such as smartphones (Section 2.1; this information is commonly known as volunteered
    geographic Information [VGI]12, 45). The combination of in situ sensors with VGI
    can act as a mutual support system to improve significantly the coverage of monitored
    areas, thus supporting IWRM.6, 8, 80 In addition to sensor data, relevant VGI-based
    information can take the form of time-stamped and geolocated photographs,10, 11,
    73 social media updates,12, 69, 70 or interviews and feedback to ad hoc hazard
    mitigation websites.68, 71 Smartphone apps have also been developed to this end.10,
    45 On the other hand, a few projects have worked more closely with local communities
    in order to explain to and train participants in the use of more complex monitoring
    principles, for example, water level and flow13, 52, 81 and rain gauges.80 The
    use of low-cost sensors also allows the construction of networks with a spatiotemporal
    density that is much greater than hitherto possible. This is useful to cover the
    strong spatial heterogeneity in catchments over a variety of scales, which is
    still a major challenge in hydrology.18, 66 Indeed, in most parts of the world,
    the spatial density of existing monitoring networks (e.g., rain gauges) is still
    well below the scientifically recommended minimum, which has important impacts
    on operational practices such as flood forecasting.82, 83 It is also a major scientific
    issue; for instance, for the formulation of hypotheses in complex models.84, 85,
    86, 87 We identify three aspects of sensor networks that are particularly relevant
    in this context: • The ubiquity of sensors in low-cost everyday devices like smartphones
    has allowed a greater range of variables to be quantified simultaneously (and
    the sampling density of existing sensor networks to be greatly increased)8, 13,
    14, 88; • Low-cost open-source hardware such as the Arduino platform makes it
    possible to develop ad hoc sensors; for instance, for river stage and precipitation
    measurement8, 24; • The increased accessibility of data repositories in environmental
    sciences and online sharing of results make it possible to combine different datasets
    in novel ways. Since it is often costly and disruptive to create networks of spatially
    representative wired sensors at the scale desired and data access to sensors equipped
    only with local logging is limited by the need to visit sites to download data,
    wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have emerged as an efficient and economical solution
    for distributed sensing (Section 3.2).20, 89 3.2. Wireless and “Smart” Networks
    WSNs are typically built of nodes (from a few to several thousands); each one
    hosts one or more sensors that monitor specific variables, such as water level,8,
    55, 62 soil moisture,61, 65 or water temperature and chemistry.54, 57, 90 These
    observables are detailed in full in Table 1. Once a measurement has been recorded,
    data are then passed through the network (from node to node: “multi-hop”) to one
    or more data repositories. Wireless network protocols including mobile phone (SMS)
    transmission, Bluetooth, WiFi, and ZigBee work as the backbone of such systems.91,
    92 Each node is composed of several parts: a radio transceiver with an internal
    antenna or connection to an external antenna, a microcontroller, an electronic
    circuit for interfacing with the sensors, and an energy source, usually a battery
    or an embedded form of energy harvesting. Their cost is variable, ranging from
    a few to hundreds of dollars, depending on the complexity of the individual sensor
    nodes. Size and cost constraints on sensor nodes result in corresponding constraints
    on resources such as energy, memory, computational speed, transmission range,
    and data rate transmission.65 Because of these constraints, data collection typically
    proceeds in a distributed manner.61, 91 A distributed control architecture also
    provides the nodes with a back-up in case of failure.20 WSN designs can be optimized
    for sensing accuracy and/or fault tolerance and can be deployed in harsh environments
    to provide continuous monitoring and processing capabilities. As such, they have
    become very popular in IWRM in the past 5–10 years, as they reduce the complexity
    related to the installation and maintenance of the system compared with its wired
    counterpart.20, 57, 92 The development of WSNs is active and ongoing especially
    in the area of power consumption reduction, for instance, through power-aware
    protocols, adaptive radio frequency in nodes, and algorithms to estimate optimal
    sampling frequencies for sensors.20, 57, 60, 92 In water management and elsewhere,
    the development and provision of sensor networks that are intelligent or “smart”
    are now feasible. This increases the flexibility in network design, for example,
    optimizing the balance between spatial coverage, the cost/quality ratio of individual
    sensors, and network redundancy. Moreover, recent improved data storage and transmission
    capacities make it possible to monitor at much higher temporal resolution than
    before. For example, measuring water level at time steps of minutes or less within
    a sensor network would make it possible to measure hydraulic observables such
    as wave characteristics or to track flood wave celerity in a river. As areas of
    interest (e.g., a particular river reach that is prone to flooding) are not uniformly
    spatially distributed, the advantages of smart sensor networks in IWRM are becoming
    increasingly manifest; for instance: • Measurement accuracy can be maximized while
    simultaneously minimizing resource consumption (i.e., energy and network bandwidth).
    • A higher sampling frequency and/or density at points of interest in space and
    time (the corollary of which being lower resource consumption at times and places
    where measurements are not needed). • Certain highly sophisticated, high power
    consumption sensors (e.g., water quality fiber optics) can be switched off when
    not operating, while also optimizing the number of sampling operations; both of
    which could dramatically increase network lifetime.93 • Sensors that talk to each
    other in real time could capture discrete events like flood waves or irrigation
    events. For instance, time series forecasting could be exploited such that a sensor
    placed upstream in a river reach activates successive downstream sensors and/or
    increases their measurement frequency.56, 93 3.3. Manifold Types of Sensors Fig.
    2 shows how many different sensor types can be used to interrogate the various
    aspects of the water cycle and water resources management described in Table 1.
    Within these techniques, there is a continuous spectrum between well-established
    “classic” hydrometric practice, which is often more expensive and/or difficult
    to practition, and newer and more experimental sensor networks, which are usually
    cheaper and more straightforward to implement, thus providing a better fit with
    citizen science principles (Fig. 2). Indeed, for IWRM, the burgeoning community
    of “tech-enthusiastic hydrologists,” for instance, the Measurements and Observations
    in the XXI century working group of the International Association of Hydrological
    Sciences, exemplifies a low-cost, multidisciplinary perspective to tackling complex
    observations and problems.14 Download : Download high-res image (414KB) Download

    of water resources management (Table 1) and a comparison of their ease of integration
    in citizen science projects. We now discuss the possibilities for each measurable
    quantity in water resources management identified earlier (Table 1; Fig. 2) in
    turn. 3.3.1. Precipitation The need for high temporal and spatial resolution precipitation
    data for water management models and mathematical analyses has been discussed
    in several studies.94, 95, 96 The simple design and affordability of rain gauges
    make them particularly suited for application outside the traditional monitoring
    environment. Electronic sensors such as tipping bucket switches allow for convenient
    automatization. Yet, rain gauge measurements are very sensitive to the local aerodynamic
    conditions15 and nonstandard locations or varying local conditions (e.g., undergrowth,
    vegetation blockage), thus affecting the quality and interpretability of measurements.
    Accurate rainfall information is lacking in large areas of the world, and the
    number of rain gauges is severely declining in Europe, South America, and Africa
    especially.88 Although rain gauges provide valuable information, a very dense
    rain gauge network is costly.96 As a result, several new ideas have emerged to
    help estimate areal rainfall with higher temporal and spatial resolution. Disdrometers
    are increasingly used in precipitation monitoring and are both cheap and robust
    in their measurements.86 Other, more experimental, methods for precipitation measurements,
    such as cellular communication interference,64, 86 are under development and may
    eventually provide new possibilities for nonscientist involvement (Section 2).
    New precipitation measurement networks are also being created by exploiting sensors
    embedded within everyday objects; for instance, the optical sensors designed for
    operating car windscreen wipers.96 These new sensor networks have the potential
    to expand spatial coverage greatly while also providing useful additional information
    for hydrological modeling, for example, discharge simulation.19, 88, 96 3.3.2.
    Water Level Accurately monitoring water levels at high spatial and temporal scale
    is a key element in many areas of water resources management, for instance, flood
    risk management systems; yet sensor network design is complex, often expensive,
    and may require extensive maintenance and circumvention of legal issues and property
    laws.8, 58 The need for rapid response times has motivated the accelerated development
    of WSNs in this area.55, 56, 58, 85 Several studies report the use of low-cost
    ultrasonic sensors (often originally intended for some other purpose like monitoring
    diesel levels in fuel tanks) to provide real-time information of river stage in
    flood risk management systems.56, 58, 62 Wireless networks of these sensors have
    allowed flood early warning systems to be deployed at much larger spatial scales
    at an affordable cost.85 Because of their low cost and the ease of purchase, ad
    hoc ultrasonic sensors can be manufactured in a relatively straightforward manner,
    lending themselves to citizen science projects.8, 13, 24 Beyond ultrasound, the
    electromagnetic spectrum can similarly be exploited to quantify river and well
    levels. For instance, the reflection characteristics of long-wavelength (0.1–10
    m) radio waves have been used to interrogate river level changes.97, 98 Such Radio
    Detection and Ranging data are usually obtained from satellite-mounted or airborne
    equipment.97 Near-infrared Light Detection And Ranging systems, first used in
    the 1930s to measure air-density profiles in the upper atmosphere,99 also have
    the potential to be used in tandem with ultrasonic sensors to measure changes
    in water level. Such systems could play an important future role in generating
    (citizen-led) data for IWRM, especially in areas where official monitoring networks
    are sparse or suffer from inadequate management or underfunding.52 3.3.3. Soil
    Moisture Soil water content measurements, which are increasingly automated, play
    a key role in partitioning water and energy fluxes at the land surface and in
    controlling hydrologic fluxes such as groundwater recharge.65 Major technical
    limitations include operational restrictions to narrow ranges of soil apparent
    permittivity and limited measurement accuracy.8 As a result, and despite the usefulness
    of capturing moisture fluctuations in the ground after precipitation events, soil
    moisture is not yet measured operationally at larger scales, unlike, for example,
    precipitation or river stage.18 Only limited attempts have been made to initialize
    ad hoc soil moisture sensor networks: for instance, Bogena et al.65 use a 150-node
    WSN to monitor soil moisture in near real-time for a small catchment in Western
    Germany. According to these workers, the prohibitively high sensor density needed
    to assess heterogeneities in soil moisture precludes the development of a more
    spatially extensive network. Normally, soil moisture sensors are incorporated
    in a wider network with other types of sensors and have found frequent use in
    automated irrigation systems. 3.3.4. Sensor Clusters In water resources management,
    sensor networks can be designed such that each station incorporates many different
    types of sensors, which is important for assessing catchment-scale water balances17,
    20, 61 or in the sustainable use of water resources in agriculture.60, 100, 101
    Multisensor networks can reduce hydrological uncertainty in at least three ways.
    First, redundant measurements improve estimations of change in meteorological
    variables like precipitation and relative humidity synchronously; second, distributed
    measurements capture local variability and constrained uncertainty in many derived
    hydrological attributes important for modeling and prediction; and finally, basin-scale
    patterns (e.g., elevation gradients in precipitation and their effect on streamflow)
    can be captured more completely than using sensors that measure a single variable.20
    Kerkez et al.61 deployed a WSN in an IWRM project as part of a water balance instrument
    cluster across a headwater catchment in the southern Sierra Nevada of California;
    over 300 sensors provided spatially representative measurements of snow depth,
    solar radiation, relative humidity, soil moisture, and matric potential. In this
    instance, the performance of the WSN was interrogated. Two indicators of network
    performance—viz. the packet delivery ratio and received signal strength indicator—showed
    that for the specific site conditions, a conservative 50-m node-to-node spacing
    would ensure low-power, reliable, and robust network communications. A balance
    between the number of sensing and signal repeating nodes was sought to ensure
    proper spatial radio coverage. Lundquist et al.21 had implemented a similar WSN
    in the same area earlier, which measured the same quantities, but on a smaller
    scale. In both studies, it was realized that because of the steep and variable
    topography, communication techniques had to be tailored to suit each location,
    resulting in a hybrid network of radio, cell-phone, land-line, and satellite transmissions.
    Elsewhere, larger-scale, multiple-catchment IWRM studies usually employ sparser
    networks of sensor clusters. For instance, the Gradients Along Mountain to Urban
    Transitions monitoring network involves real-time data collection that is used
    to model water quality, inputs, and outputs between urban and rural areas in Northern
    Utah (Jones et al., 2017). Similarly, Ingelrest et al.66 describe the blueprint
    for a multisensor WSN called SensorScope, which has been deployed multiple times
    in various environments to interrogate water demand in urban environments. In
    this instance, the sensor network is described as a “turnkey solution” that requires
    very little site-specific adjustment beyond possible alterations to sampling frequency,
    as well as interactions with local end-users in each project (Section 2). 3.4.
    Sensor Networks in IWRM Hydrometric information collected from the different types
    of sensor networks detailed in Section 3.2 constitutes the fundamental input for
    the design of various water resources projects such as freshwater distribution
    systems,63, 90 irrigation networks,60, 89 and flood early warning systems.85,
    102 An adequately designed network should therefore be able to provide appropriate
    information for a range different users and industries, in the cross-sectoral
    spirit of IWRM. Fig. 3 shows how such networks, their operation, and design, as
    well as calibration, can benefit from a citizen science approach to yield enhanced
    decision-making capabilities in IWRM. Download : Download high-res image (232KB)

    The WMO15 emphasized the importance of establishing an optimum network, where
    the interpolation between values at different stations should make it possible
    to determine the characteristics of the basic hydrometeorological elements at
    any point within a country. They also suggest beginning with the definition of
    the institutional setup and the purposes, objectives, and priorities of the network,
    followed by optimization procedures and financial revisions before final implementation.
    Table 2 contains examples of different sensor networks that have recently been
    implemented in water management projects across the globe. Although many of these
    networks concern rivers, ad hoc groundwater (Valencia, Spain103) and underwater
    quality (Wuhan, China: Lv et al.102) monitoring networks have also been discussed.
    It is clear from Table 2 that the peculiarities of sensor network design (for
    instance, the number of nodes, sampling frequency, and power supply) vary widely
    not only according to the purpose of the project but also in response to the realities
    of sensor deployment in often harsh and inaccessible environments. Most of these
    studies, especially over the last 10 years, have been concerned with developing
    new (and often hybrid) monitoring methods or experimenting with new technology,
    rather than “classic” hydrological research. However, none of these networks is
    yet at the stage of integration in operational IWRM; the object of many of the
    studies detailed in Table 2 was simply to experiment with new technology. Table

    has great potential to broaden the variety of sensor network designs. Typical
    observables that can be measured by sensors to assess water quality include water
    temperature, dissolved oxygen content, turbidity, conductivity/salinity, trace
    element concentration, pressure, redox potential, and pH.8, 52 WSNs and real-time
    controlling and monitoring systems have been successfully integrated to monitor
    water quality for domestic applications.57, 59 In drinking water distribution
    systems, low-cost and lightweight optical and electrochemical sensors, which rapidly
    assess water quality on-the-fly within pipes, provide one example of new technology
    having the potential to complement existing monitoring.59, 67 The setup and customization
    of the sensors and WSN must be straightforward since the technology is relatively
    new and may be unfamiliar to water company engineers in many cases.67 Moreover,
    the sensor nodes are designed to be optimized for rapid installation since deployment
    inside the piped network involves the cessation of water flow and associated loss
    in revenue.59 At the other end of the scale, Banik et al.23 detail a water quality
    monitoring network in a sewer system. In this case the objective is to protect
    the receiving water bodies and mitigate against accidental spills and unauthorized
    discharges. Fewer sensors are required at locations that are more specific and
    carefully selected compared with drinking water quality monitoring, where the
    sensors are typically more densely and evenly spaced.23, 59 Once gray water has
    been discharged into the natural ecological system, the receiving lakes, rivers,
    and wetlands are similarly monitored for water quality. Nasirudin et al.63 describe
    one example, where a WSN system is used as a platform to monitor water quality
    readings, deployed at distributed locations where each node can interface with
    various water quality sensors. Since such sensor networks are typically installed
    in more remote, rural areas, optimized power management is critical: sensors and
    components were chosen on the basis of their low power consumption, while batteries
    are recharged with multiple solar panels. In addition to monitoring water quality
    in domestic water systems, there are a growing number of studies that focus on
    the use of distributed sensor networks that assess flow rate, which is critical
    when the location of leakages is sought. Data transmission often uses GSM to send
    SMSs to network engineers when a problem is detected. In a more automated example,
    the most basic sensor networks might measure water level in a collecting tank,
    sounding an alarm and/or switching on a pump once the level drops below a critical
    threshold.53 Han et al.104 describe a more sophisticated cyber-physical-human
    distributed sensor framework, which leverages data dynamically from multiple information
    sources including Internet of Things–sensing data, geophysical data, human input,
    and simulation/modeling engines to identify leakages and pipe failures rapidly
    (within minutes) and accurately (individual pipeline level). Sensor networks are
    increasingly integrated within automated irrigation systems, which rely on logic
    and Boolean expressions in the same manner as the aforementioned water level alarm
    example.89, 101 Motivated by increasing water demand globally, sensor networks
    can be used to study soil dynamics based on information gathered at regular intervals,
    and the data collected can be used as feedback to improve irrigation efficiency.22
    Gutiérrez et al.60 created an automated irrigation system to optimize water use
    for a crop of sage based on a distributed wireless network of soil moisture and
    temperature sensors placed in the root zone of the plants. Water quantity was
    controlled via an algorithm with threshold values of temperature and soil moisture;
    a cellular–Internet interface allowed for data inspection and irrigation scheduling
    to be programmed through a Web page. After 3 months, water savings of up to 90%
    were achieved compared with traditional irrigation practices. Kim et al.89 employed
    a similar system using low-cost Bluetooth wireless radio communication, while
    McCulloch et al.22 developed a network of more sophisticated sensors that measured
    soil moisture, pH, temperature, and humidity, at three different ground depths.
    In all three cases, sensor nodes were developed using off-the-shelf components
    and were designed to withstand seasonal weather changes and be resistant to damage
    that may be inflicted by wildlife (and domestic cattle) in the field. Furthermore,
    because of their energy autonomy and low cost, these systems have the potential
    to be useful in water-limited, geographically isolated areas. Stable remote access
    to field conditions and real-time control and monitoring of variable-rate irrigation
    controllers can be effectively supported by graphical user interface–based software.22,
    60, 89, 101 4. Discussion What are the main benefits and potential drawbacks of
    using citizen science and polycentric approaches to enrich and complement IWRM
    projects? When an integral component of citizen science projects would typically
    involve sensor-sourced data collection by nonscientists, the design of the sensor
    network may need to be technically simplified so that self-consistent samples
    can be taken.8 Paul et al.13 summarize the challenges and opportunities arising
    from citizen science sensor networks in hydrology. One example is that, while
    the use of smartphones to photograph flooding extent and river level has the potential
    to form a very dense network of “citizen sensors” (i.e., crowdsourcing), the data
    conversion to input for numerical models, as well as the provision of information
    back to volunteers, remain challenging and are under active development.25, 77
    Indeed, networks that use volunteers as sensors can be integrated within a broader
    project framework or so-called Environmental Virtual Observatories (EVOs77). For
    instance, Galimberti and Balbo105 describe an Italian application that receives
    water level data, collected and sent by citizens, in river cross-sections instrumented
    with a staff gauge and an information panel, performs simple reliability checks,
    before storing and freely disseminating data in near real-time. The data then
    have the potential to be used for further research, model calibration, and validation
    or for land use planning and design. The keyword here is potential: at present,
    many projects that exploit citizen observatory or EVO data, such as the EU-funded
    WeSenseIt and GroundTruth programs, exist only as proofs of concept.106 Both projects
    aim to leverage crowdsourced observations to improve hydrological modeling and
    flood forecasting applications; yet they acknowledge that operationalizing such
    new data acquisition strategies, for instance, in an IWRM environment, is not
    a primary objective.105, 106 Other innovative projects such as Transforming Weather
    Water data into value-added Information services for sustainable Growth in Africa
    aim to enhance satellite datasets with ground-based sensors to derive actionable
    geoinformation, such as flash flood warnings or scheduling improvements to water
    management infrastructure. This question—of how to integrate citizen science data
    into operational IWRM practice—has scientific, technical, and political dimensions,
    which we now discuss in turn. These data are potentially lower quality and more
    temporally sparse compared with the demands of hydrological models for typically
    long-term, high-quality time series (i.e., a more traditional data source) for
    calibration and validation. One solution has been to apply novel merging algorithms,
    for instance, between rain gauge data and satellite precipitation products, to
    create combined datasets.94, 107 Another issue is that the longevity of citizen
    science projects is variable and depends, in part, on the motivational factors
    of the nonscientist stakeholders; this creates an added layer of uncertainty in
    terms of their sustainable integration in longer-term IWRM projects.8, 106 Nevertheless,
    it is clear that, within water resources management, data collection is becoming
    increasingly multi-tiered, involving increased diversity in terms of actors, purposes,
    and tailored, multiobjective networks. This creates favorable conditions for the
    discovery of new ways in which citizen science data can play a role in an operational
    IWRM context. Although, in the past few years, it has been recognized that “citizen
    hydrology” can surmount the challenges of high observational costs and limited
    spatial coverage of traditional hydrometric networks,8, 13, 87, 108 the effects
    of decreased observational frequency, irregular availability, and variable accuracy
    from sensor to sensor, need to be quantified before the data can be used in hydrological
    modeling. Indeed, uncertainties are a major bottleneck to the more widespread
    use and integration of citizen science data in operational IWRM systems; ideally,
    they should be characterized as explicitly and transparently as possible, for
    instance by providing uncertainty bounds. Yet citizen science data are rarely
    presented in such a form due to the inherent difficulties in uncertainty quantification.8,
    87 Davids et al.108 and Mazzoleni et al.87 attempt to resolve this issue, which,
    unchecked, could create suspicion and wariness over citizen science data on the
    part of end users. Somewhat against the principles of citizen science, crowdsourced
    observations were mimicked using synthetic time series (for water level and streamflow
    data87) and bootstrap randomized subsampling (for streamflow data108) to this
    end. Uncertainty was characterized by assuming observational error to be normally
    distributed noise with zero mean and a given standard deviation, using a coefficient
    α to represent measurement uncertainty. The maximum value of α was assumed to
    be three times higher for citizen science data than for actual sensor data. Distributed
    observations from “social” and physical sensors were then assimilated to understand
    the sensitivity of various hydrological models under various scenarios.87 The
    main conclusions were that artificial citizen science data, while sometimes asynchronous
    and inaccurate can still complement traditional sensor networks formed by few
    accurate, static sensors. Variations in observational frequency only had a minor
    effect on model results of, for example, flood forecasting and catchment water
    balances; in this sense, adaptive monitoring could greatly lower uncertainties
    in citizen science hydrology data.87, 106, 108 The next step would be to apply
    these uncertainty quantification techniques to real datasets. According to Gura,109
    people management issues and the very large scale of some citizen science projects
    have the potentially greatest negative impact on data quality. Moreover, volunteer
    recruitment and engagement throughout the project duration remain a challenge,
    with possible solutions including the development of a “ranking system” or the
    identification and promotion of particularly able volunteers.109 There are other,
    nontechnical, factors that govern the uptake of citizen science data. Especially
    in developing countries, the proposals of nonscientist knowledge may not adhere
    to the often rigid institutionalized processes through which knowledge (e.g.,
    national networks of rain gauges) is collected.110 In this way, it may be difficult
    for the proposals of nonscientist local stakeholders to feed into the decision-making
    that is controlled largely by water resources–related bureaucracies. Buytaert
    et al.8 emphasize that acquired knowledge is political: therefore, the way in
    which it is created and represented—its legitimacy, and to what extent it is contested—is
    at least as important as the design of citizen science data collection activities
    itself. Moreover, many water-related data, such as water consumption, in an IWRM
    context have a financial aspect, emphasizing the importance of economic value
    as well as political legitimacy. It is also critical that the data and generated
    knowledge be (and be perceived as) locally relevant and actionable. To this end,
    the feedback loops between citizen science and decision-making should be clear
    and transparent at a variety of different levels; they depend upon a profound
    understanding on the part of individual nonscientists of the generated information.8,
    13 Having articulated these challenges of operationalizing citizen science data,
    it is also important to recall opportunities related to their intrinsic value:
    local measurements will always be of great importance in hydrological modeling.
    Indeed, one significant problem in water management is that the parameters of
    many laws that govern hydrological processes are very local and can only be quantified
    with measurements. Insight gained from one catchment cannot necessarily be transferred
    automatically to another one, even if it borders the other. The fundamental issue
    concerns the extreme spatial and temporal heterogeneity of most quantities in
    the water cycle—precipitation, streamflow, river stage, soil moisture inter alia
    (Table 1; Fig. 2)—which explains the proliferation of different designs of sensor
    networks (many of which operated by nonscientists) that aim to quantify these
    variables. In terms of the use of WSNs for water resources monitoring and management,
    while there is still enormous potential for future growth, there are also manifold
    challenges. These include the relatively modest scale of current operational deployments
    (rarely beyond small catchment scale61, 91); limitations of off-the-shelf components;
    a lack of suitable sensors; and the cost of deployment and data collection. Moreover,
    important application-specific requirements may not be well catered for using
    off-the-shelf components (e.g., variable sampling rates, well-defined and flexible
    sensor interfaces, ease of deployment, and network models for the broader environment).
    Therefore, although individual-application sensor node design is continually improving,
    there should be greater flexibility in these designs such that networks can interact
    with each other successfully (Section 3.2). In water resources management, the
    direct engagement of citizen scientists in the data processing stage is ripe for
    expansion: the joint analysis and interpretation of data could represent a more
    fundamental means to enhance citizens'' participation in, and education about,
    water resources management projects.13 The following question then arises: how
    can this expansion of nonscientist involvement in data analysis and processing
    be carried out? The citizen science approach emphasizes the benefits using nonscientists
    as basic interpreters, placing renewed focus on data logging, quality control,
    and transmission. Web-based services allow for easy connection of sensors with
    online modeling tools to provide real-time data quality control, storage, and
    simulation. From a technical perspective, regions with low Internet penetration
    can benefit from far-reaching mobile phone coverage for sensor data transmission
    via text messaging.8 The provision of information and data back to nonscientists,
    in a manner that is comprehensible for a nonscientific audience, serves as an
    incentive for further citizen participation. In water resources management, this
    could take the form of irrigation requirements (for farmers), modeled water use
    and demand (for policymakers), or flood vulnerability maps (for the general public).
    Although this important feedback aspect of citizen science is lightly developed,7,
    35 especially in an IWRM context,69, 70, 72 we believe that the recent growth
    of Internet technologies could create excellent opportunities for user feedback
    and communication beyond the scientific project itself. In the small number of
    cases where information provision and citizen feedback are integral to project
    development, the situational awareness and participation rates of participants,
    as well as levels of community buy-in, are high.9, 10, 77 To summarize, we have
    described how emerging sensor network technologies can be leveraged jointly with
    citizen science to support IWRM, which in certain situations can be enriched by
    polycentric approaches to water governance. Networks of low-cost sensors, in particular,
    can be a useful tool to promote such approaches: increasing the number of catchment-scale
    networks that exploit citizen science and these sensors could greatly enrich operational
    IWRM practice. Indeed, if recent technological advances (such as adaptive sampling
    and “smart sensors”) are harnessed by citizen science projects, the resulting
    data could be better integrated in operational IWRM practice, rather than serving
    as small-scale proofs of concept. 5. Conclusions The growth of citizen science
    in hydrology and water resources management can be explained by the prior inaccessibility
    and sparseness of water-related datasets, as well as the development of new technology
    such as Internet-connected smartphones. The active involvement of citizen scientists
    through the entire lifecycle of a practical IWRM project can enhance local uptake,
    support local diagnostics, and increase decision capacity. In other words, the
    principles of polycentric water governance and citizen science are very strongly
    aligned and are expressed well in the form of low-cost sensor networks. Indeed,
    we have also described how such sensor networks that interrogate, for instance,
    river level, precipitation, and soil moisture, provide a useful tool in polycentric
    water governance. Technological developments resulting in the ubiquity of these
    sensors, together with improved methods for data storage, retrieval, and processing,
    have the potential to improve the sustainability of water resources management
    greatly. Moreover, adaptive sampling techniques could lower the uncertainty in
    citizen science datasets, which is a key bottleneck to their more general uptake
    in operational IWRM environments. What is clear is that citizen science can be
    used to bridge potentially wide gaps between contextual science and practical
    field experience in water resources management projects. Combining citizen science
    approaches with networks of low-cost sensors makes for a useful addition to the
    water resources management toolkit, which has the potential to increase data coverage
    drastically, especially in remote or data-scarce regions, at a time when monitoring
    networks are in decline globally. In many such cases, we conclude that polycentric
    and citizen science approaches have great potential to enrich and benefit IWRM.

    Excerpt : However, such improvements are generally costly, time-consuming, and
    may not produce immediate or tangible benefits at the local level. Recently, citizen
    science has emerged as a more useful tool in WRM to energise local stakeholders,
    placing them at the heart of decisions regarding water resources (Paul et al.,
    2018; Paul and Buytaert, 2018). Non-scientist-collected data can enhance and densify
    more traditional datasets in space and time; while rapid technological advances
    in the last 10–15 years and the ubiquity of low-cost ‘smart’ sensors in everyday
    devices like smartphones (part of the Internet of Things: Gubbi et al., 2013)
    have increased the feasibility of participatory data collection within a devolved
    monitoring framework (Buytaert et al., 2014; Paul et al., 2018). Show abstract

  explanation: 'Citizen science methodologies are especially compatible with automated
    systems for real-time irrigation management, such as those involving IoT and machine
    learning, as they enable the gathering of data from a larger number of geographic
    locations, which can be especially useful when the locations in question are data-sparse.


    Much like automated irrigation, the practice of citizen science also involves
    the integration of non-scientists in various stages of knowledge production, from
    data collection and interpretation to dissemination of results. In the context
    of IWRM, citizen science promotes the participation of non-scientist stakeholders
    at many points in the project lifecycle, helping to guarantee long-term sustainability
    and viability.'

    Keywords: IoT; wireless sensor networks; hydroponics; smart agriculture 1. Introduction
    Water shortage and pollution are environmental threats affecting large parts of
    the EU, as well as the rest of the world. Climate change is expected to further
    increase the water shortage and threaten food production. This problem cannot
    be solved by a single effort but must be addressed on many levels. Food security
    is dependent on several environmental conditions, such as water quality and availability,
    soil condition and energy availability. Due to the extensive and exhausting practice
    of agriculture during the last decades, several environmental issues have arisen.
    Climate change is expected to affect water quality and quantity that are already
    in decline [1,2]. Smart farming is a capital-intensive and hi-tech system based
    on the application of modern information and communication technologies (ICTs)
    in agriculture. In IoT-based smart farming, a system is built for monitoring the
    crop field with the help of sensors and automating the irrigation system. Solutions
    for measuring environmental conditions and water quality based on electronic sensors
    and microcontrollers include ATLAS Scientific [3] and Libelium Waspmote [4]. Several
    research papers demonstrate such solutions, as shown in the surveys of [5,6].
    Leveraging other important ICTs that have been successfully employed in other
    similar environments, such as big data [7], blockchain [8] and neural networks
    [9] is important for achieving precise and efficient agriculture [10]. Regarding
    IoT applications in agriculture, approaches range from open field cultivation
    [11,12] to greenhouses [13,14]. Typical parameters are temperature and humidity
    [11,12], but other conditions, such as light [13], are often monitored, as well
    as crop-specific parameters [11]. Greenhouse monitoring and control IoT systems
    are presented in [14,15]. In [13,16], the authors monitored parameters such as
    soil moisture, temperature, humidity and light in order to automate the irrigation
    system. The above solutions are geared toward general greenhouse architectures
    or use generic parameters, such as temperature and humidity only. Hydroponic growth
    has additional monitoring requirements since the hydroponic irrigation system
    is different than the one used in soil cultivation. The complexity of hydroponic
    growth requires precise control, as well as monitoring parameters, such as pH
    and electrical conductivity, through specialized sensors and has only been automated
    in the case of large greenhouses with high cost, which is prohibitive to small-scale
    farmers. The iPONICS system attempts to leverage some of the technologies discussed
    above to provide a scaled-down, low-cost, yet innovative hydroponic solution that
    can be adopted by even hobby-type hydroponic systems. Specifically, we present
    the design and implementation of a novel, low-cost hydroponics monitoring and
    control system based on IoT technologies. In particular, the system is composed
    of a specialized wireless sensor network for monitoring the essential parameters
    for hydroponics and control for the irrigation process. It provides the user with
    a user-friendly web-based tool to monitor their crops, as well as being appraised
    by appropriate alarms and warnings. This greatly facilitates the observation of
    multiple hydroponics greenhouses with minimal effort and need for intervention.
    Unlike the systems discussed above, the proposed system targets hydroponic cultivation
    specifically. Furthermore, we describe the design and implementation of a fuzzy
    inference engine (FIE) system for determining the system irrigation duration.
    A fuzzy set is defined by a membership function that can be any real number in
    the interval [0, 1], expressing the grade of membership for which an element belongs
    to that fuzzy set. The concept of fuzzy sets enables the use of fuzzy inference,
    which, in turn, uses the knowledge of an expert in a field of application to construct
    a set of âIFâTHENâ rules. Fuzzy logic becomes especially useful in capturing a
    human expertâs or operatorâs qualitative control experience into the control algorithm
    using linguistic rules. Fuzzy logic control (FLC) has been applied successfully
    for controlling numerous systems in which analytical models are not easily obtainable
    or the model itself, if available, is too complex and possibly highly non-linear
    in several applications ranging from network routing [17] to task mapping and
    scheduling [18,19]. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes
    the background and Section 3 describes the proposed system in detail. The paper
    concludes with Section 4, which summarizes the results and discusses future work.
    2. Background and System Requirements Hydroponics [20] relies on fertilized and
    aerated water, which provides both nutrition and oxygen to a plantâs root zone.
    It often involves sophisticated mechanization processes, which can be daunting
    to casual hobbyists, as well as small-scale commercial farms. Nutrient solutions
    must usually be below the temperature at which pathogen growth can begin, yet
    not so cool that root activity is suppressed. In hydroponics, as in conventional
    agriculture, nutrients should be adjusted to satisfy Liebigâs law of the minimum
    for each specific plant variety [21]. As it can be seen from Table 1, certain
    crops are tolerant to a wide range of conductivity and pH values, such as spinach,
    asparagus and tomato, while others, such as strawberry, are very sensitive, especially
    to pH changes. This requires close monitoring of the above variables to adjust
    the nutrients. Table 1. Cropsâ ideal pH and electrical conductivity values [21].
    Especially in low-cost hydroponics systems, the monitoring is done manually using
    specialized pH/EC meters, which is time consuming and requires constant proximity
    to the greenhouse. The iPONICS system facilitates remote monitoring of the values
    at low cost. Since it takes time for the plants to absorb the nutrients, a low
    sampling rate (as low as once per day) is sufficient for the water quality parameters,
    such as electrical conductivity and pH. In practice, we use a higher sampling
    rate to compensate for sensor and communication errors, as discussed in Section
    4. Ambient temperature and humidity in the greenhouse are also monitored to ensure
    optimal growth. Furthermore, since the purpose of the system is to achieve remote
    monitoring, additional monitoring requirements besides water quality arise. Specifically,
    the ability to generate alarms in cases of unexpected and possibly catastrophic
    conditions must be considered. To that purpose, we need frequent monitoring of
    ambient temperature to generate an alarm in the case of a fire in the greenhouse.
    For that reason, the ambient temperature is read every 8 seconds, but as long
    as it is normal, it is only recorded hourly. Finally, since the greenhouse containing
    the equipment can be situated at a remote location, we have need of some rudimentary
    security. While security is not essential to crop growth per se, we need to be
    at least notified of, if not prevent, unauthorized entry. The most important iPONICS
    system requirements are summarized in Table 2. Table 2. iPONICS system requirements.
    3. iPONICS System Design Given the requirement of monitoring the temperature and
    humidity inside the greenhouse and the great variation in area between various
    types of greenhouses, the environment sensing system must be distributed across
    various nodes, the number of which will depend on the specific greenhouse dimensions.
    On the other hand, for monitoring the water quality and controlling the pump,
    one central node is sufficient. The iPONICS system concept is shown in Figure
    1. Figure 1. iPONICS system concept. The iPONICS sensing and control system is
    a wireless sensor network with a star topology, as shown in Figure 2. Figure 2.
    iPONICS WSN topology. The system is composed of three types of nodes: the sensing
    and control unit (SCU), the environment sensing unit (ESN) and the greenhouse
    security unit (GSN). The greenhouse unit (GHU) is a greenhouse containing one
    SCU, which is the master node and several ESN and GSN âslave nodesâ, the number
    of which depends on the dimensions of the greenhouse. 3.1. Sense and Control Unit
    (SCU) The SCU is the main (master) node, as well as the central node in the star
    topology of the WSN. It is responsible for measuring the circulating water quality
    through four sensors, namely, temperature, pH, water electrical conductivity (EC)
    and dissolved oxygen (DO). Furthermore, it is responsible for controlling the
    pump in an efficient manner by conserving energy while maintaining the required
    water flow for crops growth and requesting and receiving data from the slave nodes.
    The sensors used were from Atlas Scientific [22,23,24,25]. The reasons for selecting
    these particular sensors were the following: First, they require infrequent recalibration,
    which is convenient while being deployed in a greenhouse during plant growth,
    which requires weeks to months. Second, they are easily integrated into an Arduino-based
    microcontroller system, reducing the development time and time-to-market. Third,
    they are long lasting at a reasonable cost, which are essential attributes in
    order to keep the overall cost of the system an attractive investment for farmers.
    The SCU processing unit used was an Arduino Mega 2560, providing the required
    processing power, program memory and number of pins to support the following connections:
    the Xbee shield, the RTC shield, the Atlas Scientific EZO circuits, the GSM shield,
    the voltage sensor and, finally, the relay module to control the ON/OFF switching
    of the water pumps. All the shields and modules were supplied by the power drawn
    out of the Arduino by the 5v and GND pins. Figure 3 depicts the schematic of the
    SCU, while Figure 4 illustrates its operation using a flowchart. Figure 3. Sense
    and control unit annotated schematic diagram. Figure 4. SCU flowchart. As shown
    in Figure 4, the SCU starts by initializing the serial and I2C communications
    and verifying that all modules are connected. In order to preserve energy, the
    microcontroller is put to sleep, along with the GSM shield since it is the highest
    power-consuming module. The microcontroller awakes in the following cases: An
    âAlarm_Interruptâ that signals abnormal and possibly hazardous temperature/humidity
    readings in which the SCU activates the GSM to send an alarm SMS/email and upload
    these readings to the server. In this case, the system demands operator intervention
    and does not return to sleep or activate the pump. A âSecurity_Interruptâ that
    signals unauthorized access to the site in which the SCU activates the GSM to
    send a security SMS/email and upload the captured images to the server before
    returning to sleep. The SCU reaches the sampling time of water quality sensors
    in which it collects those readings temporally in the EEPROM. Afterwards, it activates
    the GSM shield and proceeds uploading the water quality readings, and then wakes
    up one ESN at a time and uploads its readings to the server. It returns to sleep
    afterward. The SCU wakes up at fixed intervals for the pump control in which the
    state of the battery, along with the latest water quality readings, dictate the
    powering decision before returning to sleep. Since the entire system is meant
    to be off-grid, it is crucial to minimize the power consumption of the units connected
    to the solar-charged battery whenever possible to guarantee uptime. The use of
    the sleep mode and intelligent control of the water pumps ensures moderate usage
    of the power resources. We measured the current drawn by the SCU under the operating
    conditions listed in Table 3 using both a multimeter and a current clamp. As it
    can be seen in Table 3, the SCU consumed around 1.25 W while sleeping, where the
    GSM was off and the microcontroller was in deep sleep mode. Other connected modules
    were still powered including the Xbee shield, as interrupts are asynchronous.
    In the idle state, the Arduino was awake to regularly do the water quality readings
    or control the water pump, where it consumed about 1.35 W. The power consumption
    almost doubled when the GSM shield was activated for transmission, where it consumed
    about 2.75 W. This could rise to 11.5 W given that the transmission is occurring
    under extreme weather conditions or a weak network connection, which caused the
    GSM to draw higher currents. On the positive side, without interruption, the GSM
    stayed off until the upload time, which happened a few times a day. Figure 5 shows
    an SCU prototype. Figure 5. SCU early prototype. Table 3. SCU power ratings. The
    maximum power (last entry in Table 3) was only consumed when the GSM module is
    first registered to the network. During normal operation, the SCU slept and consumed
    1.25 W while consuming 2.75 W when transmitting data. Therefore, the SCU energy
    consumption per cycle was ð¸=1.25ð+2.75 ð¡ ð   (mJ) (1) where T is the sleep period
    and t is the execution time of the main loop (Appendix A). Essentially the sleep
    mode power was multiplied by the duration of the sleep period and the transmission
    power was multiplied by the time it took to transmit the data. The execution time
    was measured in milliseconds by counting the processor cycles. The execution of
    the main loop with no ESNs present was 19,170 ms. With one ESN, the main loop
    execution time was 145,090 ms. Since all ESNs transmitted the same amount of data,
    the execution time was given by the formula: t = 19,170 + 125,920 Ã ESN (ms) (2)
    Equation (2) also indirectly defines an upper bound in the sampling rate of the
    system, depending on the number of ESNs available. However, such a high sampling
    rate is not required since it takes at least hours for the water quality parameters
    to significantly change (when plants absorb nutrients) and, at most, days when
    most nutrients have been absorbed. 3.2. Environment Sensing Node (ESN) Environment
    sensing nodes are slave nodes that are responsible for monitoring greenhouse environmental
    conditions, such as the ambient temperature and humidity. The necessity behind
    the ESNs is that abnormal temperature and humidity could imply a hazard, such
    as a fire. Therefore, the temperature is monitored every few minutes, but temperature
    and humidity readings are permanently stored on an hourly basis in an SD card.
    The ESN is interrupted by the SCU and then transmits the data to the SCU using
    Zigbee unless there is an alarm (high temperature), in which case, the ESN does
    not wait for an interrupt. This allows for effective monitoring of the greenhouse
    environment while minimizing data transmission and, therefore, power consumption.
    The number of ESNs present in each greenhouse is dependent on the greenhouse dimensions.
    Each ESN has its own ID number and Zigbee address. Figure 6 depicts the schematic
    diagram of the ESN circuit. Figure 6. Environment sensing node annotated schematic
    diagram. The ESN initialization procedure includes initializing the serial and
    SPI communication (Figure 7) and verifying the connection to all modules. After
    initialization, the ESN awakes on fixed intervals to collect the ambient temperature
    and humidity readings and record them on the SD card. If no abnormal readings
    are present, the ESN remains asleep until interrupted by the SCU when it is time
    for data collection. On the occurrence of the abnormal readings, the ESN interrupts
    the SCU with a Zigbee packet payload âAlarm_Interrupt_XXâ. The âXXâ is a code
    representing either âFIREâ or âConnectionâ to distinguish whether the alarm is
    due to high temperature due to a possible fire in the greenhouse or just a connection
    problem. Figure 7. ESN flowchart. The ESN power consumption in sleep mode was
    approximately 0.4 W compared with approximately 0.55 W during data transmission.
    However, as mentioned earlier in the SCU subsection (Section 3.1), the transmission
    only occurs a few times a day, unless there is an alarm. In both modes, the Xbee
    module stays active as it is an end device to be interrupted by the SCU. 3.3.
    Greenhouse Security Node (GSN) As discussed in Section 2, the GSN was developed
    as a rudimentary security node and is not essential for the operation of the iPONICS
    system. It comprises a microcontroller with a motion sensor, camera, SD card and
    Zigbee transmitter/receiver. The reason such a node may be used is that a greenhouse
    could be in an isolated area, and we wish to prevent unauthorized entry. It is
    not meant to be a robust security solution, merely a low-cost warning system.
    The node spends the majority of time sleeping to conserve energy under normal
    circumstances. It is woken up by an external interrupt from the motion sensor,
    in which case, it activates the camera to take pictures and sends an alarm to
    the SCU through Zigbee. In the case of an authorized user accessing the system,
    the RFID is used to cancel the alarm. GSNs can also be deactivated and reactivated
    when receiving a command from the SCU. The microcontroller used for the implementation
    of the GSN was Arduino UNO, similar to the ESN. Figure 8 depicts the schematic
    diagram of the nodeâs circuitry. Figure 8. Greenhouse security node annotated
    schematic diagram. Figure 9 shows a flowchart of the GSN operation. As shown in
    Figure 9, the node starts by initializing the I2C and SPI communications and ensures
    proper wiring of the modules. Then, the node falls into sleep mode and remains
    in that state until motion is detected. After such an event, the node expects
    an authorized ID tag swap. If no such verification of the identity of the user
    occurs in the next few seconds, the GSN interrupts the SCU and signals a âSecurity_Interruptâ
    inside the first payload, followed by the images that are data captured by the
    node. The GSN draws power of about 0.53 W in sleep mode and about 0.68 W during
    transmission depending on the distance from the SCU. Figure 9. GSN flowchart.
    3.4. SCU Fuzzy Inference Engine An important novelty of the iPONICS method is
    the SCU FIE [26]. We describe here the design of the control algorithm separately
    from the rest of the SCU for clarity. There are several reasons for using FLC
    in iPONICS. First, we have to manage imprecision from sensor errors. Second, the
    ideal values for pH and electrical conductivity vary slightly between plants (Table
    1), and we can accommodate several crops with the same controller by fuzzifying
    the inputs. The architecture of the FIE is shown in Figure 10. It accepts three
    inputs: pH, EC and power supply voltage level. Since the power supply is from
    the battery being charged by a solar cell, the voltage level reflects the battery
    level according to the voltage/charge curve. The DO and water temperature are
    not used for two reasons: first, they are not documented in the literature to
    have a significant effect on efficient hydroponic culture, and second, using five
    or six outputs would require a large number of rules, most of which would be redundant.
    The FIE determines the irrigation duration based on the critical hydroponic parameters
    and the available energy. The general premise behind the knowledge base of the
    proposed scheme is to provide the available nutrients to the plants while being
    conservative with watering when energy and nutrients are low. Figure 10. Fuzzy
    inference engine architecture. According to hydroponics guidelines, the irrigation
    duration is given as follows [21]: ð¡ ð = ðÃ3600 ðÃð  (seconds) (3) where ð¡ ð :
    irrigation duration in seconds, Q: irrigation dose (lt/bucket), m: number of drip
    lines per bucket and q: drip emission (lt/h) (Appendix A). We applied this formula
    as our baseline duration to determine our fuzzy set membership functions. The
    rationale behind using FLC for controlling the pump stems from the use of an expert
    system based on linguistic ifâthen rules for the pump on/off duration, coupled
    with inherent uncertainty and errors in sensor readings and different parameters
    for different crops. The above constitute fuzzy modeling as an ideal fit for the
    proposed system. By abstracting the inputs and outputs using fuzzy sets, more
    robust control can be achieved. Figure 11 shows the fuzzy membership functions.
    In order to maintain computational simplicity, we selected trapezoidal and triangular
    membership functions in the proposed control scheme to describe the linguistic
    values of the fuzzy input and output variables. The amount of overlap between
    the membership functions areas was chosen to have at most two membership functions
    overlapping; thus, we will never have more than six rules activated at a given
    time. This offers computational simplicity in the implementation of the proposed
    scheme, which was a design objective. Furthermore, it does not make intuitive
    sense to have a parameter such as pH being considered as both high and low according
    to hydroponics guidelines. The EC and pH membership functions were determined
    based on hydroponics guidelines, while the voltage was based on extending battery
    life. The irrigation duration membership functions were based on multiples of
    the baseline irrigation duration from Equation (3). In the case of clearly erroneous
    sensor values (Section 4.2), the values are not fed to the FIE; instead, the last
    valid values are used. If the pH and EC values seem correct they are fed to the
    FIE and the last valid values are updated for the next sensor reading. Figure
    11. Fuzzy membership functions. The fuzzy rule base was determined based on hydroponics
    guidelines. As mentioned, three inputs are used, with three membership functions
    per input. Therefore, there are a total of 33 = 27 rules. The rules were determined
    empirically according to the principle that when conditions are ideal, the irrigation
    period is the one determined by Equation (3). When conditions are suboptimal,
    especially when the input voltage is low, indicating the battery is discharged,
    the irrigation duration is shortened in order to conserve energy. When EC and
    pH indicate that there are few nutrients to be absorbed, then the irrigation period
    is also shortened. The forms of the rules with some indicative cases are shown
    in Table 4. Table 4. Fuzzy rule structure with examples. The execution time of
    the FIE was measured to be 3326 ms, which is included in the SCU main loop execution
    time reported in Section 3.1. 4. Deployment and Evaluation 4.1. System Deployment
    The iPONICS system was operated in a lab environment for over a year (Figure 12)
    and was installed in a pilot hydroponics greenhouse in order to grow crops. The
    monitoring website is shown in Figure 13. The ubidots platform was used to upload
    the data, and our application was built using an API to transfer the data in .csv
    format and display them. The application was built using javascript, css and html.
    The user can monitor multiple greenhouses at a glance. It provides a dashboard
    for monitoring the water quality and a sidebar for alerts and warnings, such as
    sensor and SD card errors. The user can generate temperature, humidity, pH, EC,
    DO and water temperature graphs created using the D3.js library, with the default
    being the past 24 h. The water quality sensor readings are also shown as doughnut
    graphs that are color-coded the same way as the sensors (Figure 13) for ease of
    monitoring. Figure 12. iPONICS system deployed in lab conditions. Figure 13. iPONICS
    monitoring page. 4.2. Preliminary Reliability Analysis Since the above components
    are meant to operate continuously in greenhouse conditions for long periods in
    order to grow crops, we aimed to analyze their reliability at as early a stage
    as possible. We performed preliminary reliability analysis based on the errors
    and failures observed since they were operational, both in laboratory and greenhouse
    conditions. Reliability analysis was important in the iPONICS system because electronic
    failures could lead to crop failure, as well as a waste of energy and water. We
    performed the analysis on the SCU and ESN nodes since the GSN nodes operated infrequently
    and were aimed at outside threats, which are irrelevant to the plant growth process.
    The central role of the SCU makes it the most critical unit in the subsystem.
    The ESN nodes have redundancy that allows fault tolerance, while there is a single
    SCU in each GHU. We had two SCUs and four ESNs operate continuously for close
    to 1000 h. Using that continuous operation as a basis, we observed errors and
    measured the mean time between them (MTBF). The errors are summarized in Table
    5. They can be categorized as follows. Table 5. Error summary. Sensor errorsâGenerally,
    sensor errors can be divided into two main categories: hard failure (complete
    failure) and soft failure, such as bias, drift and outliers [27]. We observed
    no hard failures, but we observed both drift and outliers. Transmission errorsâWe
    noticed occasional GPRS transmission failures. Some were corrected by retransmission
    and we added automatic retries that generally solved the problem, but there was
    one occasion that required manual intervention by communicating with the internet
    service provider in order to be resolved. Since the system remains on all the
    time but sampling and transmission are done with a specific sampling rate, we
    used two approaches to model the system reliability. Specifically, we use a Poisson
    distribution assuming Î» is equal to the MTBF: ð(ð)= ð âðð¡ (ðð¡) ð ð! (4) Regarding
    sensor errors, we also use a binomial distribution with a failure probability
    equal to the error rate: ð(ð=ð)=( ð ð ) ð ð (1âð) ðâð (5) We noticed that when
    the sampling rate was constant, the two distributions yielded identical results,
    which is to be expected as the Poisson distribution is a limiting case of a binomial
    distribution when the number of trials is large and the probability is small [28],
    which holds for our case (Table 6, column 2). We estimated the probability that
    there will be zero errors during a day at the highest sampling rate (no error
    events in all 24 samples), as well as the probability that there will be an error
    event in all samples in that day at a low sampling rate (4 samples/day). We were
    particularly interested in the case when there were errors in all pH and EC measurements
    since it is then impossible to monitor the system, as well as correctly decide
    on the irrigation duration. Table 6. SCU error analysis. As shown in the table
    above, the probability of single or multiple errors, including transmission errors,
    at the lowest sampling rate (worst case) was less than 7 in 100,000 or about 1
    in 39 years, which is longer than the expected lifetime of the system. Furthermore,
    the probability that there will be only erroneous measurements in either pH or
    EC was less than the sum of respective probabilities since the events were not
    disjointed, which was only approximately 1 in 200,000. 5. Conclusions and Future
    Work A novel hydroponics monitoring and control system based on IoT technologies
    was introduced. In particular, the system is composed of a specialized wireless
    sensor network for monitoring the essential parameters for hydroponics and control
    for the pump. It provides the greenhouse keeper with a user-friendly web-based
    tool to monitor their crops, as well as alarms and warnings, allowing for the
    observation of multiple greenhouses with minimal effort and need for intervention.
    Our future work will focus on two directions. First, further reliability analysis
    by forcing errors and stress testing the system and, second, data analytics. Specifically,
    we are interested in predicting nutrient values based on the original concentrations
    and the water quality sensor values. In general, monitoring specific nutrients
    is a challenging problem for both terrestrial and space applications, even though
    several technologies exist [29]. Most of these technologies require costs that
    may be prohibitive to small-scale farmers, who often add nutrients empirically.
    This could lead to either plants being starved for nutrients or reaching toxic
    levels of nutrient absorption. For now, we are using specialized nutrient monitoring
    equipment [30] to obtain data points daily, as shown in Figure 14. Generally,
    EC is the aggregate of all ions in the plant nutrient solution. The nutrients
    are added to the water (day 1), increasing EC, and they are gradually absorbed,
    typically within 24 h. While the general trend is clearly visible in Figure 14,
    the individual nutrient absorption depends on the pH, the presence of competing
    nutrients, as well as other factors. The ion-specific electrode used requires
    frequent (daily) recalibration, limiting the ability to be used remotely. Accurately
    predicting the nutrient values only from the SCU readings would save the cost
    of such expensive equipment, as well as the need for recalibration, while protecting
    from possible empirical errors. It can also be used to lower the SCU sampling
    rate to conserve energy, even if it increases the probability of erroneous measurements.
    We are currently exploring our obtained data using machine learning models. At
    the time of this writing, given the low data rate since the nutrient values do
    not change rapidly and the fact that EC reflects the aggregate of all nutrients
    and is expected to be highly linear, we are exploring a simple regression model,
    but this is still under investigation. Figure 14. pH, EC and concentrations of
    various nutrients during a typical nutrient cycle: before nutrients are added
    or replenished (day 0) and after (day 1). Most nutrients are absorbed within one
    day (by day 2), depending on the pH. Author Contributions Conceptualization, K.T.

    India SECTION I. Introduction Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is a large set of
    embedded devices, called sensors [1]. These sensor nodes sense the information
    from the physical surroundings and send it to the Base Station (BS) to fulfill
    the requirements of the system applications [2]. Sensors used in wireless sensor
    networks have resource limitations such as available memory for storage, processing,
    energy and transmission capability. Nowadays, WSN has invaded every part of our
    daily lives, such as health monitoring [3], home automation [4], environmental
    monitoring, battlefield monitoring [5], and industrial monitoring [3]. In such
    applications, the quality of service (QoS) offered by the WSN in terms of information
    confidentiality, data consistency, and timely transmission functionality has increasingly
    attracted attention from researchers and network designers. Though, sensor nodes
    in WSN are more likely to fail due to the limitation of resources. Fault tolerance
    is one of the most important issues at WSNs. Fault tolerance is a system''s ability
    to carry a required level of functionality whenever faults occur. Many fault tolerance
    schemes have been projected and studied. However, existing fault tolerance schemes
    either exhaust lots of energy to detect and repair failures, or even required
    additional hardware and software resources. In this paper, we propose a game theory-based
    fault tolerance routing scheme for WSNs. The proposed algorithm enhances the existing
    fault tolerance schemes, such as the Clustered Routing for Selfish Sensors (CROSS)
    [6] scheme in the regard that it decreases energy expenditure, increases the network
    endurance, and transfers more data packets in the state when node faults occur.
    The paper''s organization is as follows. We describe related literature in Section
    2. In Section 3, we describe the preliminary and energy model. In Section 4, we
    present a game theory-based fault tolerance routing protocol. The evaluation results
    of the proposed fault tolerance mechanism are presented in Section 5. Finally,
    we concluded this paper in Section 6. SECTION II. Related Work There have been
    various studies that consider clustering and fault tolerance in the wireless sensor
    network. The most famous approach for clustering is the Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering
    Hierarchy (LEACH) algorithm [7]. In this method, the cluster head''s position
    is rotated in a probabilistic manner between the nodes. Therefore the energy consumption
    is spread among all network nodes. After LEACH, the number of clustering approaches
    is proposed to increase the network lifetime. However, existing clustering approaches
    are unable to balance the energy expenditure of the deployed sensor node that
    causes premature death of the network. Game theory has emerged as a powerful tool
    in the area of network formation over the past few years. The author in [6] first
    utilizes game theory to analyses the clustering problem and proposed a clustering
    mechanism called Clustered Routing for Selfish Sensors (CROSS) [6]. Every sensor
    node is acting as a player in this approach. Accordingly, each player calculates
    a probability which decides whether or not a player declares to be head of a cluster.
    For providing the fault tolerance, A dynamic energy aware fault tolerant routing
    (DEFTR) [8] protocol is proposed which utilizes equal-sized network subdivision
    based on the size of the network. It is based on a multi-facet mechanism, the
    optimized routing path is established at multilevel and provides fault tolerance.
    This algorithm utilizes the geographical location of each node, but it does not
    consider topological changes of the network. The failure of nodes and the quality
    of links affect the stability and reliability of data transmission. Le et al.
    [4] proposed a Best and Worst Ant System (BWAS) based multipath establishment
    and immune algorithm for multipath transmission. The first phase of the algorithm
    constructed all the links from the sender node to the receiver node with the help
    of information generated by artificial ants which help to select the optimized
    path. The immune algorithm for multipath transmission used the generated paths
    as the input to execute the mutation on the first variant on the population and
    then generates an optimum path with good convergence. The aim of this method is
    transmission reliability and fault tolerance, the BWAS algorithm considers the
    path quality and considers the factor of hop besides energy exhaustion. It does
    not consider the load balancing mechanism for reliable transmission. In [9], the
    virtual cluster head (CH) development and flow graph system is used to efficiently
    handle CHs failure. To provide the standard substitute of all faulty nodes, the
    possible resources of all failure-free CHs are reasonably structured as a virtual
    CH. Fault tolerance is achieved by using the flow graph modeling, with low energy
    exhaustion. But this approach provides fault tolerance only on CH failure. In
    [2], Lanlan et al. presented a routing algorithm named Self Adaptive Fault Tolerance
    (SAFT) which is based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for Micro Grid (MG).
    PSO is used to construct the routing and the micro grid includes the inter-cluster
    and intra-cluster communication. This approach mainly considers the failed sensors
    and cluster heads. This approach tries to reconnect failed nodes and affected
    nodes using a routing mechanism. This approach has shown better performance in
    terms of data delivery ratio. However, it has data delaying issues. Another work
    to increase the reliability of WSN is done in [3]. To enhance the reliability
    of packet transmission, the author proposed a communication protocol called Î¼Net
    which uses acknowledge messages in peer-to-peer transmissions and minimizes the
    storage capacity of the network and energy depletion of each node. This protocol
    is good for delivering the end to end data, but it is not faster in peer to peer
    transmission. Table 1 shows a comparison between the above existing fault tolerance
    algorithm. SECTION III. Preliminaries and Model In this section an energy model
    of a wireless sensor network is first described. Then, a brief introduction of
    the game theory is given. Here game theory based clustering approach with multipath
    data routing is used to achieve fault tolerance. A. Energy Model The energy consumed
    for data transmission and receiving data is computed using a radio transmission
    model for wireless sensor networks [7]. The transmitter uses the power to operate
    the electronic radio and the power amplifier. The energy needed to convey the
    data message is: E T ={ L( S i )Ã E elec +L( S i )Ã E f f Ã d 2 L( S i )Ã E ekc
    +L( S i )Ã E m p Ã d 4 d< d 0 d> d 0 (1) View Source TABLE I A Comparative Table
    of Fault Tolerance Approach in WSNS. Where Eelec is the amount of energy consumed
    to transmit or receive a single bit message, L(Si) is the number of bits, E f
    f and E m p is the number of bits for the free space model and multi-path model.
    d is the distance of the transmitter-receiver and d0 is the measured threshold
    distance as follows: d 0 = E fs / E mp â â â â â â â â (2) View Source The energy
    absorbed by the radio to get L(Si) bits of data is represented by: E R i =L( S
    i )Ã E elec (3) View Source B. Game Model The Game Theory (GT) is widely used
    in commerce to enhance the results by utilizing the strategical game approach
    for the distinctive information economy [10]. In recent years, Game Theory is
    intensively employed in wireless sensor networks for different applications, for
    instance, transmission security, energy efficiency, data gathering. This segment
    reviews the GT used to improve the preservation of energy and increase network
    endurance. The GT can be characterized into two principal divisions: cooperative
    game theory and non-cooperative game theory. 1) Cooperative game theory-based
    approach Sensor nodes cooperate to make a coalition to lessen the energy exhausted
    in the network. Coalition game is deemed one of the most prominent types of the
    theory of the cooperative game. To identify the overlying society in social-networks,
    a novel method is proposed [11]. This method is based on the shapely-value process.
    It stimulates to find the stable coalitions of the grid''s underlying group structure
    with a weight function. Using the local information, a group detection algorithm
    updates the shapely values and weight function. 2) Non cooperative game theory-based
    approach In the theory of non cooperative games, sensors act selfishly to conserve
    their remaining energy by declining to obtain and forward data in the multi-hop
    network [12]. The optimal acknowledgments are achieved while all sensors develop
    their strategy to optimize their use provided the strategies of other players
    with sensors. SECTION IV. A Game Theory Based Clustering Approach for Fault Tolerance
    The proposed approach can be divided into two phases: Cluster formation and selection
    of cluster heads using game theory and Multi-path data transmission phase. A.
    Game theory model for cluster formation and selection of cluster heads Game theory
    is a very effective statistical method for the study and interpretation of moral
    and selfish entities'' behavior. The principle of game theory is used to increase
    power conservation and prolong the network life. 1) Game Model for Cluster head
    selection A distributed clustering algorithm based on non cooperative game theory
    is proposed for cluster head selection. This algorithm is having two-phase, one
    is responsible for the construction of clusters and other is responsible for the
    selection of cluster head according to utility function of the sensors. The model
    for the game may be described as: G = ãN, S, Uã ,Where N is number of nodes, s
    = {Si} is the possible strategies and U = {Ui} is the node utility functions.
    The sensor decision can be expressed as: x i (j)={ 1, 0, S i declareasCH S i notdeclareasCH
    (4) View Source As far as payoffs are concerned, if a sensor node decides not
    being a CH moreover if no other sensor becomes a CH either, its payoff will be
    zero. If at least one other neighbor claimed to be CH, then its payoff is r. Eventually,
    if the sensor declares itself CH, its payoff for transmitting the data, r effectively
    will be decreased by a sum equivalent to the charge c of becoming a cluster leader.
    Therefore, the final payoff in that situation will be r-c. For a sensor node the
    utility function can be expressed by: U i (s)= â§ â© â¨ âª âª 0, râc, r,  if  S j =0,âjâN
    if  S j =1  if  S i =0 and âjâN s.t.  S j =1 (5) View Source where r is residual
    energy and c is cost. For the Nash Equilibrium, the nodes need to play mixed strategies.
    It means the nodes randomly select their tactics using the distribution of probabilities.
    In other terms, each node now has a possibility of announcing itself as CH and
    a likelihood of not doing so. The equilibrium probability PE to enter the game
    for Nash equilibrium with a mixed strategy as follows: P E =1â (1â (râc) (r) )
    1 Nâ1 (6) View Source The location of each sensor and its energy level is considered
    in each round of cluster head selection. All the clusters have unique CH that
    can be changed after each round according to their remaining energy. Algorithm
    for the cluster head selection is given below: Algorithm 1: Game Theory based
    CH selection algorithm TABLE II Simulation Parameters B. Fault Tolerance Mechanism
    To provide fault tolerance, reliable and efficient data transmission is important.
    Energy consumption must be less during data transmission. The proposed methodology
    mainly concern the energy consumption and fault tolerance during the transmission.
    Fault tolerance can be achieved by using multipath routing algorithm. Every sensor
    node chooses k disjoint data routing paths during the clustering process, based
    on the energy status of the neighboring nodes. The multipath routing algorithm
    is used to find the alternate paths between the source to the destination. In
    a fault tolerance domain whenever a source node can not forward its data to the
    destination, it can exploit the availability of alternate paths between the source
    to destination. Fig. 1. Cluster Formation in wireless sensor network Show All
    Fig. 2. Number of Nodes Alive versus Number of Rounds Show All SECTION V. Simulation
    Results The performance of proposed approach is evaluated via simulation using
    MATLAB. Proposed approach is compared with the other protocol from the literature.
    The parameters that adopted in simulations are given in Table 2. Fig. 3. Number
    of Dead Nodes versus Number of Rounds Show All TABLE III ENTERING GAME PROBABILITY
    FOR THE NASH EQUILIBRIUM Figure 1 represents the cluster formation between the
    nodes over a wireless sensor network. Table 3 shows the probability for a sensor
    to enter a game given in equation (6) with a growing number of neighbors from
    0 to 30. When the number of neighbor nodes reduces from 30 to 0, entering the
    probability of game raises. To show the performance of the network, number of
    alive nodes is calculated in each rounds and compared with LEACH [7] and CROSS
    [6] as shown in figure 2. The results shows the proposed approach increase the
    life of the network beyond the 1400 rounds which is better than LEACH and CROSS.
    Figure 3 shows the number of dead nodes with respect to each round for LEACH,
    CROSS and proposed approach. The proposed approach uses multipath to provide the
    fault tolerance and game theory based clustering helps to maintain the energy
    consumption of the network. Figure 4 shows the comparison between DEFTR [8], SAFT
    [2] and proposed approach. SECTION VI. Conclusion In this paper, the cluster-based
    fault tolerance routing algorithm for wireless sensor networks is presented to
    tolerate node failures and increases the network lifetime. Firstly, a non-cooperative
    game theory based cluster head selection scheme is built for prolonging network
    life. Secondly, a multi-path based fault tolerance approach is presented, which
    selects k number of disjoint data routing paths for data transmission from sensor
    nodes to the base station. Thirdly, the performance of the proposed fault tolerance
    routing algorithm and some previous routing algorithms are evaluated via extensive
    experiments. The results show that the proposed scheme outperforms LEACH, CROSS,
    DEFTR, and SAFT. Fig. 4. Energy consumption of the Network per round Show All

  description: The reliability of a wastewater treatment plant is a critical issue
    when the effluent is reused or discharged to water resources. Main factors affecting
    the performance of the wastewater treatment plant are the variation of the influent,
    inherent variability in the treatment processes, deficiencies in design, mechanical
    equipment, and operational failures. Thus, meeting the established reuse/discharge
    criteria requires assessment of plant reliability. Among many techniques developed
    in system reliability analysis, fault tree analysis (FTA) is one of the popular
    and efficient methods. FTA is a top down, deductive failure analysis in which
    an undesired state of a system is analyzed. In this study, the problem of reliability
    was studied on Tehran West Town wastewater treatment plant. This plant is a conventional
    activated sludge process, and the effluent is reused in landscape irrigation.
    The fault tree diagram was established with the violation of allowable effluent
    BOD as the top event in the diagram, and the deficiencies of the system were identified
    based on the developed model. Some basic events are operatorâs mistake, physical
    damage, and design problems. The analytical method is minimal cut sets (based
    on numerical probability) and Monte Carlo simulation. Basic event probabilities
    were calculated according to available data and expertsâ opinions. The results
    showed that human factors, especially human error had a great effect on top event
    occurrence. The mechanical, climate, and sewer system factors were in subsequent
    tier. Literature shows applying FTA has been seldom used in the past wastewater
    treatment plant (WWTP) risk analysis studies. Thus, the developed FTA model in
    this study considerably improves the insight into causal failure analysis of a
    WWTP. It provides an efficient tool for WWTP operators and decision makers to
    achieve the standard limits in wastewater reuse and discharge to the environment.

    issue when the effluent is reused or discharged to water resources. Main factors
    affecting the performance of the wastewater treatment plant are the variation
    of the influent, inherent variability in the treatment processes, deficiencies
    in design, mechanical equipment, and operational failures. Thus, meeting the established
    reuse/discharge criteria requires assessment of plant reliability. Among many

    is one of the popular and efficient methods. FTA is a top down, deductive failure

    Plants Under Coastal Flooding Article 24 September 2018 Introduction Nowadays,
    due to increasing demand and limited water resources, the direct reuse of reclaimed
    wastewater is so important. It has been practiced in many countries where reuse
    is necessary to face the water demand for different purposes. Yang and Abbaspour
    (2007) studied an analysis of wastewater reuse scenarios in Beijing. The results
    suggest that the wastewater reuse potential is high at competitive prices. Also,
    they concluded that the main users of the treated wastewater are agricultural
    irrigation and urban recreation sectors. Agrafioti and Diamadopoulos (2012) studied
    reuse of treated municipal wastewater for crop irrigation on the Greek island
    of Crete. The study showed that water recycling during summer could reserve approximately
    19.16 Mm3 of fresh water which corresponds to 4.3 % of total irrigation requirements.
    Pedrero et al. (2010) reviewed the status of municipal wastewater reuse in Greece
    and Spain for agricultural purpose. They discussed the effects of the treated
    wastewater on soil and plant growth according to the past studies and concluded
    that the possibility of using reclaimed wastewater mixed well with water is a
    good solution for improving the agronomic quality of treated wastewater. Also,
    the high salinity and boron concentrations are the main problems associated with
    treated wastewater use. Due to shortage of water resources, direct potable reuse
    is also implemented in some regions. The city of Windhoek is the capital of Namibia,
    the most arid country in sub-Saharan Africa. Since 1968, Windhoek has been adding
    highly treated reclaimed water to its drinking water supply system. The project
    is operated whereby intermediate treated water criteria have to be maintained
    at certain unit process. Failure to meet these criteria precludes the delivery
    of final reclaimed water into the distribution system (Tchobanoglous et al. 2011).
    In another project, in the period from 1985 to 1992, the city of Denver, CA, conducted
    a potable reuse demonstration project. The objective of the project was to examine
    the feasibility of converting secondary effluent from a wastewater treatment plant
    to water of potable quality that could be piped directly into the drinking water
    distribution system. No adverse health effects were identified based on extensive
    toxicity and carcinogenicity studies (Tchobanoglous et al. 2011). In all water
    reuse projects, insufficient treated wastewater can cause serious problems for
    the public health and the environment. Therefore, the quality of treated wastewater
    is a significant issue and should be evaluated before the reuse. The reliability
    of a system is to achieve good performance in specific time and under specific
    conditions. Achieving the effluent standard depends on several factors including
    variations in loads and flow, potential failures in the treatment processes, and
    equipment. These factors cause uncertainty in the performance of a treatment plant.
    This uncertainty or risk of failure is inevitable. Thus, wastewater treatment
    plant should be designed and operated based on acceptable risk. Evaluation of
    the reliability performance of a wastewater treatment plant and effluent quality
    is closely related (Oliveira and Sperling 2008). Reliability is defined as the
    probability of success in the proper performance of wastewater treatment plant
    that should meet the effluent quality standards. Fault tree analysis (FTA) is
    one of the most effective methods in system reliability analysis. FTA is a deductive
    failure analysis whereby an undesired state of the system is specified. The faults
    in a system can be the events associated with mechanical failures, human errors,
    or any other related events that can lead to the undesired event. In FTA, the
    sequence of events leading to the probable occurrence of the undesired event is
    systematically divided into basic events whose failure probabilities can be estimated.
    Therefore, a fault tree illustrates the logical interrelationships of basic events
    that lead to the undesired event which is the top event of the fault tree (Haimes
    2009). Methods developed in reliability analysis are divided into two groups,
    namely quantitative and qualitative methods. The qualitative method is defined
    as an analysis of events and factors affecting the system errors without numeric
    values while quantitative method is based on Boolean algebra, where the events
    either occur or do not occur. However, a qualitative review is needed in the quantitative
    analysis. To date, few studies have been performed about the reliability analysis
    of water and wastewater treatment plant based on FTA method or similar procedures.
    Oliveira and Sperling (2008) examined the reliability of a number of wastewater
    treatment plants in Brazil using coefficient of reliability (COR). This coefficient
    was calculated using statistical parameters of effluent data. Then, the reliability
    of wastewater treatment plant (WWTPs) was evaluated regarding the effluent discharge
    standards. Al Saleem (2007) developed a probabilistic reliability model applying
    gamma distribution to analyze the influent and effluent data of flow and concentration.
    Then, the future performance of a wastewater treatment plant was predicted. Using
    statistical methods in reliability analysis require influent and effluent data
    of treatment plant while in case of lacking data, systematic methods such as FTA
    are more efficient. Kelley and Allison (1981) applied FTA to assess the violation
    of residual chlorine in the effluent of chlorination process in a wastewater treatment
    plant with trickling filter process. The process chain includes primary clarifier,
    trickling filter, nitrification tank (aerated), secondary clarifier, denitrification,
    tertiary clarifier, and chlorine contact. The findings showed that the residual
    chlorine was directly affected by mixing time. It was also concluded that the
    number of sensors, reliable monitoring, and preparation was not sufficient. The
    study did not refer to biological process reliability. In another study, Mercer
    and Hrudey (1990) applied FTA to assess the reliability of the production of drinking
    water. They quantitatively assessed the risks created by operators in the water
    treatment plant. Andreas et al. (2009) applied the FTA method in risk analysis
    of water distribution network system. Beauchamp et al. (2010) developed a method
    for technical and operational hazard identification of the water treatment plant
    based on FTA. The main objective of this survey was to develop a systematic approach
    to improve the perception of the effect of operational and technical factors on
    the removal of the pathogen Cryptosporidium pavum through an ultrafiltration membrane
    train. Also, Bourouni (2013) used FTA and reliability block diagram for operational
    assessment of a reverse osmosis system in water treatment. In another study, Li
    Jun (2008) assessed the reliability of a petrochemical wastewater treatment plant
    using FTA method. The factors considered in the survey were failure of mechanical
    and electrical facilities, human errors, and automotive control system. The study
    did not consider biological process factors effective in the operation of treatment
    system. In the previous studies, the reliabilities of the WWTPs were mostly assessed
    based on statistical methods requiring a complete set of data. FTA technique was
    used in the analysis of some water treatment plants, but seldom used in analysis
    of WWTP systems. In those studies of WWTP, the biological process chain of the
    treatment system was not considered in the fault tree. The reliability of the
    plant was analyzed based on the electrical and mechanical system and human factors.
    In this paper, reliability of Tehran West Town (TWT) WWTP is analyzed for effluent
    biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) violation as the top event in the FTA diagram.
    The WWTP system is conventional activated sludge, and the effluent is reused for
    landscape irrigation. Methodology The risk of a system is defined as the probability
    of failure over the specified system lifetime under specified operating conditions
    (P f ). System reliability is the complementary probability of nonfailure or success
    as in Eq. (1) (Kottegoda and Rosso 2008). $$ \\mathrm{Reliability}=1-{P}_f $$
    (1) Fault tree is a deductive method based on the defect started with an undesired
    event. Fault tree as a qualitative model provides extremely useful information
    about the causes of unwanted events and as a quantitative model gives good information
    about the probability of occurrence of the top event and importance of basic event
    (Valadkhani 2004). Fault tree shows interaction between events by using logic
    gates and describes how the system faces the failure. Steps of FTA are as follows
    (CCPS 2000): 1. Recognizing the system and its operation which clarify communications
    and interactions between system components. 2. Identifying top event as a unique
    event that represents crisis state of system which may cause system failure. 3.
    Construction of fault tree diagram and reasonable development of failure. In this
    stage, the causes of top event are connected to each other with logic gates like
    âAND,â and âOR.â 4. Qualitative analysis, including ranking of basic events by
    determination of their probabilities using available data and expertsâ opinions.
    5. Quantitative analysis to calculate probability of top event. There are some
    limitations in using FTA. There is probable weakness in recognition of all possible
    events that lead to the top event. Also, determination of failure probabilities
    especially human errors is very complicated (Wu et al. 2011). Generally, a cut
    set is a combination of basic events that can be used for occurrence of top event.
    Minimal cut set is the smallest subset of cut sets that is necessary for occurrence
    of top event. The minimal cut set is obtained using Boolean algebra techniques.
    These techniques involve representing the gates in a fault tree with the equivalent
    Boolean expressions. The Boolean variables in an expression will represent the
    gates and basic events in a fault tree. It moves downward from the top event level
    by level, and the upper events are replaced by the lower events. AND and OR gates
    Gates are standard logic symbols that represent the interconnection between the
    contributory events. AND gates describe the events that must coexist to cause
    the top event. Alternate events that can individually cause the top event are
    described using the OR relationship. In the fault tree diagram, AND gate develops
    the horizontal propagation and OR gate develops the vertical propagation. Based
    on the assumption that events are statistically independent, AND gates are replaced
    with the product of their inputs as shown in Eq. (2): $$ {P}_T\\left(\\mathrm{top}\\kern0.5em
    \\mathrm{event}\\right)={\\displaystyle \\prod_{i=1}^n{P}_i} $$ (2) where P T
    represent the probability of failure at the output of the gate and P i indicates
    the probability of input defects. The OR gate is replaced with the sum of the
    inputs as shown in Eq. (3): $$ {P}_T\\left(\\mathrm{top}\\kern0.5em \\mathrm{event}\\right)={\\displaystyle
    \\sum_{i=1}^n{P}_i} $$ (3) The parameters are the same as in Eq. (2). Generally,
    the probability of events union is obtained using Eq. (4) (Ross 2010). $$ P\\left({O}_i{\\displaystyle

    (Dhillon and Singh 1981). Monte Carlo algorithm in FTA In the FTA of complex systems
    with large number of minimal cut sets, the Monte Carlo approach can be used to
    evaluate the top event probability. It is used as a supplementary means to verify
    the results of the minimal cut set approach (Ejlali and Miremadi 2004). Monte
    Carlo simulation is in the class of computational algorithms that are based on
    repeated random sampling to compute results. Usually, Monte Carlo simulation is
    used when the exact value of results cannot be computed with deterministic algorithms.
    This is one of the most effective methods for reliability assessment due to its
    ability of good expression of statistical nature of the events. The principle
    behind the Monte Carlo methodology is to simulate the occurrences of the primary
    events using a random number generator. In this section, an algorithm for Monte
    Carlo sampling is presented to evaluate the top event probability of a fault tree.
    The algorithm consists of determining the state of each event randomly and calculating
    the state of the top event. The top event of a fault tree can be expressed as
    a function of a basic event as follows: $$ T=f(E)=f\\left({E}_1,\\ {E}_2,\\ {E}_3,\\dots,
    {E}_n\\right) $$ (5) where T is the top event of the fault tree and E is a vector
    of a basic event in which E i is the ith basic event of the fault tree. The state
    of all basic events and its occurrence probability are defined as S in the Eq.
    (6): $$ S=\\left({S}_1,\\ {S}_2,\\ {S}_3,\\dots, {S}_n\\right) $$ (6) where S
    i is the state of the ith event that can be âtrueâ or âfalseâ (Han and Lim 2012).
    In the Monte Carlo method, the probability of top event (P T ) is stochastically
    determined by sampling the state of basic events based on their occurrence probability,
    and propagating their states until the state of the top event is determined. The
    state of S is determined by random sampling. Figure 1 illustrates the process
    of Monte Carlo simulations in the FTA. P i is the probability of ith basic event
    which is determined according to expertsâ opinions or available data, N is the
    total number of trials, and m is the number of top event failure. For each trial,
    each primary event is simulated by generating a random real number (r i ) in the
    range 0â1. If this number is less than or equal to the probability of the primary
    event (P i ), the event is considered to have occurred and the state of the event
    (S i ) is set to true. Otherwise, it is assumed not to occur and the state value
    is set to false. Fig. 1 Flowchart of Monte Carlo process in the fault tree analysis
    Full size image The fault tree is then evaluated with these values for the primary
    events to see if the top event occurs. The number of top event occurrences is
    stored, together with the corresponding failure mode. Failure mode is the list
    of primary events that occurred to cause the top event (Yevkin 2010). Finally,
    the probability of the top event (P T ) is obtained by Eq. (7). $$ {\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{T}}=\\frac{m\\times
    {P}_m}{N\\ } $$ (7) where m is the number of top event failure, N is the number
    of total trail, and P m is the probability of at least one component (primary
    event) failure. The propagation of the state of a basic event can be performed
    recursively in the structure of a fault tree. Usually, in a fault tree, there
    are a large number of intermediate gates to handle the relation among basic events
    and the top event. Therefore, the state of the intermediate gate should be determined
    to find out the state of the top event. The state of a gate (S g ) is calculated
    based on the states of its inputs. If the states of all inputs for an OR gate
    are false, S g becomes false; otherwise, it becomes true. If the states of all
    inputs for an AND gate are true, S g becomes true; otherwise, it becomes false
    (Han and Lim 2012). The calculations are performed using OpenFTA software (Formal
    Software Construction Ltd 2005). Case study TWT WWTP serves 85,000 people equivalent
    to an average flow rate of 30,240 m3/day which corresponds to about 356 L/(day
    person equivalent). The process is conventional activated sludge process including
    screening, grit chamber, primary sedimentation, aeration, secondary sedimentation,
    and disinfection for liquid process. Sludge process includes aerobic digestion
    and sludge drying bed. Flow diagram of the plant is shown in Fig. 2. Treatment
    plant effluent is reused for landscape irrigation. In this study, BOD5 is considered
    as the main parameter for the assessment of effluent quality. Fig. 2 Flow diagram
    TWT WWTP Full size image According to the Iranian standard of wastewater reuse
    in landscape irrigation, limits of BOD, Total suspended solids (TSS), and fecal
    coliform are, respectively, 31 mg/L, 40 mg/L, and 1000 MPN/100 mL (IVPSPS 2010).
    A 3-year data set of TWT WWTP shows that the most critical parameter violating
    the standard limit is BOD. In other words, in all records, the parameters such
    as TSS and coliform do not violate the standard limit unless BOD exceeds 31 mg/L.
    Therefore, BOD is considered as an index parameter and its violation from the
    standard limit is selected as the top event of fault tree. Results According to
    the flow diagram and process chain of the treatment plant, the logical relation
    of the performance of different units to the top event occurrence (violation of
    effluent BOD) is analyzed. This analysis is made based on the literature and opinions
    of the experts and plant operators. Finally, the hierarchy of the factors leading
    to the occurrence of top event is illustrated as the fault tree diagram. Figures
    3, 4, and 5 depict the fault tree diagram of the TWT WWTP. In these figures, symbol
    for âANDâ gate is â â and symbol of OR gate is shown as â.â According to Figs.
    3, 4, and 5, BOD violence may occur mainly due to the failures in the performance
    of secondary sedimentation, aeration tank, primary sedimentation, and sludge returning
    and disposal systems. These failures are categorized as human and mechanical errors,
    climate factor, and sewer system factor. Human errors include operator absence
    and operator errors. Mechanical errors consist of equipment damages like (baffle,
    weir, and rotary bridge). Climate factors refer to atmospheric factors and high
    infiltration/inflow in sewer system which may upset the plant operation. The fault
    tree diagram is divided to three figures (Figs. 3, 4, and 5) due to its large
    size and numerous components; the connection of each figure to the next one is
    shown by a triangular symbol. In these figures, letter âOâ stands for basic events;
    âNâ for top event; letters âA,â âB,â âC,â and âXâ are symbols for events in levels
    1 to 4, respectively. Fig. 3 Wastewater treatment plant fault tree (part 1) Full
    size image Fig. 4 Wastewater treatment plant fault tree (part 2) Full size image
    Fig. 5 Wastewater treatment plant fault tree (part 3) Full size image As shown
    in Fig. 3, the top event (level 1) is connected directly to the failure events
    in secondary sedimentation and aeration tank (level 2). Subset events in secondary
    sedimentation (level 3) are such as effluent weir performance, hydraulic and shock
    loads, short circuiting, rising, bulking, and increase of sludge blanket thickness.
    All events in level 3 (B1 to B6) are interconnected with OR gate. Equipment failure
    (O3) or design problem (O4) may cause fault in weir performance (B6). High infiltration/inflow
    (O6) or operator error (O8) is the cause of hydraulic and shock loading (B5).
    Short circuiting is an event which can be caused by improper inlet and outlet
    design or geometry of the basin. So the sub-events considered for short circuiting
    are design problem and equipment failure connected with OR gate. Sludge rising
    is another problem in the operation of secondary sedimentation that results from
    simultaneous occurrence of reduction in sludge disposal rate and high retention
    time with nitrification. The basic events in this category are operator absence
    (O1), sludge pump malfunction (O2), and design problem (O4). Sludge bulking is
    a common problem in most of activated sludge processes. It is caused by presence
    of a complete mix regime without application of a biological selector at the entrance
    of aeration tank. It is finally related to design problem (O4). Increase of sludge
    blanket thickness may occur due to equipment failure and reduction of sludge disposal
    rate. The latter results from sludge pump malfunction and operator absence. Failure
    events in aeration tank as shown in Fig. 4 include toxic entry, foaming, irregular
    rate of return, and waste sludge with respect to MLSS, F/M, and SRT values and
    malfunction of primary sedimentation. Foaming occurs due to operator error, sludge
    pump malfunction with operator absence results in irregular rate of return and
    waste sludge, design problem, operator absence, and equipment failure are the
    basic events that cause failure in aeration system. In the primary sedimentation,
    as shown in Fig. 5, events that are considered for the failure of the system are
    effluent weir performance, short circuiting, failure in proper sludge disposal,
    increase of influent TSS, and malfunction of scum skimming. These events at the
    second level of fault tree diagram are interconnected with OR gate. As shown in
    Fig. 5, basic events at the bottom level of diagram are equipment failure (O3),
    operator absence (O1), design problem (O4), atmospheric factors (O7), and high
    infiltration/inflow (O6). According to the fault tree diagram in Figs. 3, 4, and
    5 and using Boolean algebra, the minimal cut sets are determined as follows: $$

    sets are (O 1 O 2 , O 3 , O 4 , O 5 , O 6 , O 8) To calculate the probability
    of top event, the probabilities of basic events must be known. Determination of
    these values is based on literature, available data, and expertsâ opinions. In
    this regard, a fault tree evaluation team was established consisting of experts
    in plant operation, process design, mechanical equipment, and one faculty member.
    The mean values of the given opinions are used in the probability estimations.
    Therefore, the probabilities of basic events in minimal cut sets are estimated
    as follows: Sludge pump malfunction According to the previous reports and operatorsâ
    opinions, the sludge pumps are regularly out of service 10 days a year. Therefore,
    $$ P\\left({O}_2\\right)=\\frac{10}{365}=0.027 $$ Equipment failure like baffles,
    weirs, and rotary bridge are evaluated, and according to the mean value of evaluation
    teamâs opinions, this event happens 8 days in a year. So, we have $$ P\\left({O}_3\\right)=\\frac{8}{365}=0.02
    $$ Climate factors Due to infiltration/inflow in the sewer network and increase
    of the plant inflow during rainy days, the probability of failure is calculated
    according to the local precipitation data. Based on a 15-year period (1996â2010)
    average meteorological data of Mehrabad station (the nearest station to the plant),
    the annual average number of rainy days is about 55 days a year. According to
    the past experiences in the plant and the evaluation teamâs opinions, it is assumed
    that in 30 % of rainy days the plant is disturbed. Therefore, $$ P\\left({O}_6\\right)=P\\left({O}_7\\right)=0.3\\times
    \\frac{55}{365}=0.045 $$ Design problems Based on the evaluation teamâs opinions,
    the share of design problems in each unit malfunction is considered about 3 %
    or P(O 4)â=â0.03 Toxic entry Based on the evaluation teamâs opinions and according
    to the existence of small industrial plants, the probability of discharge of toxic
    wastes to main sewer is considered 3 % or P(O 5)â=â0.03 Operator error The probability
    of operator error that causes the failure is considered about 15 % equal to the
    average of evaluation teamâs opinions (P(O 8)â=â0.15). Operator absence Assuming
    12-h operator presence in wastewater treatment plant, the probability is calculated
    as follows: $$ P\\left({O}_1\\right)=\\frac{12}{24}=0.5 $$ Quantification of fault
    tree Using Boolean algebra and replacing probabilistic values from the previous
    section, the occurrence of top event is evaluated as follows: $$ \\begin{array}{l}P(N)=P\\left(\\left({O}_1{\\displaystyle
    \\cap }{O}_2\\right){\\displaystyle \\cup }{O}_3{\\displaystyle \\cup }{O}_4{\\displaystyle
    \\cup }{O}_5{\\displaystyle \\cup }{O}_6{\\displaystyle \\cup }{O}_8\\right)\\hfill
    \\\\ {}P(N)=P\\left({O}_1.{O}_2\\right)+P\\left({O}_3\\right)+P\\left({O}_4\\right)+P\\left({O}_5\\right)+P\\left({O}_6\\right)+P\\left({O}_8\\right)=0.02+0.03+0.03+\\hfill
    \\\\ {}0.045+0.15+\\left(0.5\\times 0.027\\right)=0.289\\hfill \\end{array} $$
    (8) So, the reliability of WWTP based on Eq. (1) will be $$ \\mathrm{Reliability}=1-P(N)=1-0.289=0.711=71.1\\%
    $$ Therefore, the probability of violation of effluent BOD from the standard limit
    for landscape irrigation is 28.9 % and reliability of WWTP is 71.1 %. To better
    evaluate and rank the factors influencing the reliability, basic events are categorized
    to four groups including human factors, mechanical factors, and climate and sewer
    system factors. To determine the importance degree of each basic event, an improvement
    factor is defined based on Eq. (8) (Gharachoorlo 2005). $$ \\mathrm{IF}=\\frac{P(N)-P\\left({N}_0\\right)}{P(N)}\\times
    100 $$ (9) where IF is the improvement factor for a specified event, P(N) is the
    probability of top event with all basic events present, and P(N o) is the top
    event probability when the specified event is absent. The results of IF according
    to Eq. (8) regarding P(N)â=â0.289 is presented in Table 1. Results show that operator
    error in the category of human factors has the greatest impact on the occurrence
    of the top event. High infiltration/inflow and design problems are in the subsequent
    order. Table 1 Basic event improvement factors Full size table Monte Carlo simulation
    Quantitative analysis of wastewater treatment fault tree with Monte Carlo simulation
    performed by OpenFTA software, with Nâ=â10,000 trials. The results are as follows:
    $$ \\begin{array}{l}\\mathrm{Number}\\ \\mathrm{of}\\ \\mathrm{s}\\mathrm{ystem}\\
    \\mathrm{failure}\\ \\left(\\mathrm{top}\\ \\mathrm{event}\\right)=m=4066\\hfill

    \\mathrm{primary}\\ \\mathrm{event}\\mathrm{s}\\ \\mathrm{is}\\ \\mathrm{occurred}=m\\times
    {P}_m=2651\\hfill \\end{array} $$ Therefore, the top event probability is calculated
    based on Eq. (7) as P T â=â0.265. According to Eq. (1), the reliability is calculated
    as follows: $$ \\mathrm{Reliability}=1-{P}_T=1-0.265=0.735=73.5\\% $$ In Monte
    Carlo simulation, the importance of basic events in the top event occurrence is
    calculated based on Eq. (10) and failure contribution is calculated based on Eq.
    (11) as follows: $$ {I}_e=\\raisebox{1ex}{${n}_f$}\\!\\left/ \\!\\raisebox{-1ex}{$m$}\\right.
    $$ (10) $$ {F}_c={I}_e\\times {P}_T $$ (11) I e : The importance of ith basic
    event in the top event occurrence n f : Number of failure for the ith basic event
    F c : Failure contribution of ith basic event P T : Top event probability Monte
    Carlo simulation results are summarized in Table 2. As shown in Table 2, operator
    error with a failure contribution of 0.14 has the highest impact on occurrence
    of top event. It is in accordance with the results of the improvement factor.
    Comparing sum of failure contribution of the factors shows that human factors
    have the greatest impact on the failure event of the treatment plant. It also
    corresponds to the results of improvement factor obtained through minimal cut
    set approach. On the other hand, operator absence and sludge pump malfunction
    have the minimum failure contribution. Table 2 Basic event importance in top event
    occurrenceâMonte Carlo simulation Full size table To improve the plant reliability
    and reduce the risk, mitigation measures must be considered. According to the
    above results, the first priority is improvement in human factors. Therefore,
    the most important measure could be management of operators by developing the
    training programs and increasing the technical knowledge of the operators. Also
    measures such as increasing the level of supervision, precision, and automation
    are essential in improvement of the plant effluent quality regarding the standard
    level. In this analysis, the mechanical factors have the minimum priority in comparison
    with other factors due to the existence of spare parts and regular equipment service
    and repair. Among the treatment units, according to the role of basic events in
    the failure event of each unit, secondary sedimentation has the highest priority
    in controlling the WWTP effluent quality. Therefore, the precise and sensitive
    operation of this unit is crucial in the reliability of the treatment plant. According
    to the Fig. 3, the events such as rising and bulking are considered as causes
    of design factor; therefore, measures such as construction of biological selector
    unit before aeration tank or altering the hydraulic regime of the aeration tank
    from complete mixed to the plug flow is necessary. If sludge rising happens in
    the secondary sedimentation, nitrification control in aeration tank and detention
    time of sludge in the tank will be important. Comparing the results with current
    researches that have used FTA in environmental engineering problems shows the
    significant contribution of this survey in risk analysis of WWTPs. The corresponding
    research studies in recent years are done in different fields such as mechanical
    reliability of a treatment system, risk of water supply systems, and pollution
    spill in water resources. Using FTA for assessment of mechanical reliability of
    a RO system showed that the high pressure pump had a high influence on the total
    availability of the system. It was concluded that particular attention should
    be taken on the selection and the maintenance of the high pressure pump in RO
    system (Bourouni 2013). Lindhe et al. (2012) used dynamic fault tree to analyze
    risk of drinking water systems. Results of dynamic fault tree were compared to
    the results from Markov model simulations which showed a good agreement between
    two methods. Jian et al. (2011) assessed the risk of sudden water pollution using
    fuzzy fault tree technique. The assessment was based on the statistical analysis
    of historical sudden water pollution data and analysis of risk sources. The results
    showed that the abnormal discharge of sewage was the main risk factor in the studied
    zone. Landquist et al. (2014) used fault tree model to assess the risk of pollution
    discharge from shipwrecks. The model was applied for a hypothetical example including
    two shipwrecks. Tchorzewska et al. (2012) analyzed the failure of a water supply
    system using FTA in two situations of water shortage and water contamination.
    In another study, FTA model was applied to failure assessment of a rural drinking
    water system in Buyamba, Uganda (Saavedra 2011). Thus, due to rare study in risk
    analysis of WWTPs, the results of this survey helps the plant operators and decision
    makers improve the reliability of a WWTP with an effective tool. Fault tree gives
    a better insight into the causal chain of plant failure events and shows how to
    improve a plant performance especially when the quality of reclaimed water for
    reuse is critical. Conclusion In this research, capabilities of fault tree in
    reliability analysis of the TWT WWTP were presented. The aim of the reliability
    analysis was assessment of the violation of effluent BOD from the standard limit
    for landscape irrigation. It was assigned as the top event in the fault tree diagram.
    A systematic approach was applied to investigate the factors influencing the failure
    of the system. Using Boolean algebra, the minimal cut sets were derived and the
    probabilities of basic events were determined based on the previous data and expert
    teamâs opinions. Finally, the reliability of the system was calculated 0.71. Applying
    Monte Carlo simulation in which the state of each event is randomly determined
    to calculate the state of the top event, the reliability was derived 0.73. The
    improvement factor was defined to show the share of each basic event in the probability
    occurrence of the top event. The results showed that human factors have the greatest
    impact on failure of the system. In the subsequent order, there are climate factors,
    mechanical factors, and sewer system. Among the basic events, operatorâs error,
    high load of influent, design problem, and equipment failure are the most effective
    factors in the top event occurrence. To improve the reliability of the plant,
    the human factor should be considered as the first priority so the measures such
    as training, sufficient supervisions, and development of personnel income, along
    with other actions such as increase the automation level, are the most influential
    factors. Since very few research studies are available in risk analysis of WWTPs
    based on FTA method, this survey has a significant contribution in improvement
    of insight into causal failure analysis of a conventional activated sludge process.
    The developed FTA model remarkably provides an effective tool in upgrading the
    reliability of a WWTP. References Agrafioti, E., & Diamadopoulos, E. (2012). A

  description: New methodologies in precision irrigation, aimed at monitoring and
    controlling the irrigation based on the crop water demand, allow to improve the
    water use efficiency in the agricultural production process. Measuring the soil
    water content to determine how much and when to irrigate is one way to control
    the crop irrigation. This work presents the development and setup of a wireless
    monitoring network of measurement stations based on embedded systems, that concentrate
    measurement of soil moisture, pressure in the irrigation lines, and water flow.
    A base station coordinates the communication with the measurement stations, saves
    the data in a local database and then upstream the data to a web server so the
    information can be remotely accessed. The design of the measurement stations is
    based on a microcontroller, MC9S08QE32 from NXP, while the base station is based
    on a Raspberry Pi3. The communication between the nodes is performed at 470MHz
    in a mesh mode configuration. In order to show the performance and reliability
    of the proposed system, results obtained from three irrigation treatments monitoring
    in a tomato crop are presented.

    2023, 2023080451. https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202308.0451.v1 Abstract The
    global agricultural sector is increasingly pressured to adopt sustainable practices
    and reduce its environmental impact. In this context, greenhouses play a crucial
    role in enabling year-round crop production, ensuring food security, and minimizing
    reliance on traditional open-field farming. However, the energy consumption associated
    with greenhouse operations poses a significant challenge to achieving sustainability
    goals. As a result, there is a growing emphasis on transitioning greenhouses towards
    near-zero energy consumption. Near-zero energy consumption in greenhouses refers
    to the ambitious objective of minimizing energy usage to the greatest extent possible
    while maintaining optimal growing conditions for crops. This goal encompasses
    reducing energy consumption for heating, cooling, lighting, and other operational
    needs, as well as exploring renewable energy sources to power greenhouse operations.
    This review article offers a comprehensive overview of greenhouse energy consumption,
    with the main goal of analyzing the present situation, identifying key challenges,
    exploring potential opportunities, and proposing future perspectives for decreasing
    energy usage in greenhouse environments. As the focus on sustainable agricultural
    practices grows, the need to reduce energy consumption in greenhouses becomes
    increasingly important. The review critically examines current technological models
    and strategies applied in smart greenhouse applications, as well as the monitoring
    of microclimatic conditions inside the greenhouse, encompassing factors such as
    temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, soil quality, and crop cultivation. Moreover,
    it aims to present existing literature that investigates the advancement of greenhouses
    toward achieving significant reductions in energy consumption. Keywords Smart

    1. To analyze the usage of WSNs in smart agriculture applications.

    2. To perform a comparative review and discussion of the most commonly used protocols
    on the physical, data link and network layers.

    3. To provide a simulation of a WSN operation in a smart agriculture application

    5. To examine automation across the entire pipeline, from data collection and
    transmission to processing, analysis, decision-making, and automated action. The
    goal is to investigate the effectiveness and efficiency of integrated end-to-end
    automated irrigation systems.'
  extract_1: 'In general, there are two types of such schemes: Forward Error Correction
    (FEC) and Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ). The usefulness of ARQ schemes in multi-hop
    sensor networks is limited due to additional retransmission energy cost and overhead.
    On the other hand, additional processing power that goes into encoding and decoding
    in FEC schemes is something that must be taken into account.'
  extract_2: Additionally, it is confirmed that the main mechanism for reducing the
    consumption in the network nodes is the duty cycle mechanism. By simulating two
    different duty cycle mechanisms available within the Cooja simulator in the considered
    scenario, we came to the fact that ContikiMAC performs better then the CX-MAC
    and is able to reduce the time the radio is spending in active mode to around
    0.9% of total operation time, which is around six times less than in the case
    of the CX-MAC protocol.

    Sensor Networks (WSN) in smart agriculture applications was analyzed. The main
    focus of the paper is on the power consumption of the various WSN components,
    on the both levels, physical and functional. The analysis, from the energy efficiency
    aspect, includes a comparative review and discussion of the most commonly used
    protocols on the physical, data link and network layers. The analysis outcome
    provides a precise identification of the main power consumers, the magnitude of
    their consumption, and a deep understanding of the key mechanisms that should

    Sensor NetworksSmart agriculture 1. Introduction Since the great potential of
    IoT (Internet of things) in all aspects of the modern life has been widely recognized,
    sensors, wireless networks and software applications have become an important
    and valuable asset of modern agricultural infrastructure. Based on collected data,
    powerful analytical tools are able to provide information about optimal agro-technical
    measures necessary for ensuring optimal conditions of production and quality.
    Such an analysis of data, combined with inputs from other sources, can anticipate
    any danger that may occur, provide various insights and answers on what happened
    as well as recommendations on actions to be undertaken. In this paper, we provide
    a broader integrated view on energy consumption mechanisms in WSNs (Wireless Sensor
    Networks). We believe, it is beneficial for researchers and all those who are
    interested in practical implementation of WSNs, to know the major challenges and
    potential options in pursuit of energy efficiency improvement. Moreover, we cover
    the recent progress and provide an overview of the main communication stack protocols,
    primarily from energy efficiency perspective. Though, other network performance
    aspects as delay, overhead, throughput etc. are also taken into consideration.
    Contribution of this paper can be summarized as follows: (i) A detailed overview
    of the energy consumption in a WSN, along with identification of the main energy
    consumers on the both physical and functional level of a sensor node. (ii) A discussion
    and comparison of technical details of the widely used energy saving mechanisms
    built into the various protocols across the communication stack layers of a WSN.
    (iii) A simulation of the WSN operation by using the Cooja simulator, with a detailed
    analysis of the average power consumption and the average duty cycle for all the
    network nodes. (iv) An analysis of some additional elements important for design
    and implementation of an energy efficient WSN in smart agriculture applications.
    The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 is presented architecture
    of a typical sensor node and an appropriate power consumption analysis. In Section
    3, a discussion and comparative analysis of the media access protocols in terms
    of the energy efficiency is provided. In Section 4, a detailed comparative analysis
    of the energy efficient routing protocols is presented. Section 5 contains simulation
    of a WSN operation in a smart agriculture application and discussion of the simulation
    outcomes from the energy efficiency point of view. Section 6 contains a discussion
    about some additional factors and their impact on design of an energy efficient
    WSN in a smart agriculture context. Section 7, summarizes the conclusions. 2.
    Sensor nodes Sensor nodes represent the sensing layer of a WSN. They typically
    continuously sense targeted physical parameters in a real-time manner. In the
    same way, they monitor working status and location of the equipment. As a result
    of sensing, sensor nodes periodically, or upon certain predefined events, generate
    information in the form of electrical signals. These signals are further processed
    and prepared for wireless transmission through the network to the sink node or
    base station, which is a central processing and controlling unit in a WSN. What
    is an event definition and how frequently readings of the monitored parameters
    are taken depends on the specific requirements of each agriculture application.
    Clearly, it is managed by application layer a WSN. In a practical realization,
    such as the one depicted in Fig. 1, a typical sensor node consists of a board
    that includes microcontroller, radio transceiver with antenna for communication
    with neighboring nodes, power supply, interfaces for programming and debugging,
    internal memory as well as external flash memory for storing sensor readings.
    On top of this, it includes a variety of typical sensors which are sometimes built
    in a separate module called sensor module. Some of them are used in agriculture
    applications, as such are sensors for air temperature and humidity, soil moisture,
    leaf wetness, atmospheric pressure, solar radiation, dendrometers, the soil temperature
    etc. Most of the sensor nodes run their own operating system developed for small
    form-factor, low-power embedded devices, such as for example TinyOS, Contiki,
    etc. They provide inter-processor communication with the radio and other components
    in the system, control power consumption, control attached sensor devices, and
    provide support for network messaging and other protocol functions (Selmic and
    Phoha, 2016). Download : Download high-res image (143KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 1. Blok diagram of a high-performance WSN node Imote2. Each of these
    logical and physical components needs energy to operate. Sensor nodes are typically
    powered by batteries with a limited lifetime and despite the fact that in the
    most cases the batteries are rechargeable, the problem of energy consumption in
    WSNs stays high on the researcherâs open topics agenda. Basically, the essence
    of problem with batteries lies in their lifetime and its potential impact on the
    both nodeâs and the entire WSN lifetime. Namely, by definition a sensor nodeâs
    lifetime is defined as the nodeâs operating time without the need for any external
    intervention, like battery replacement. A WSN lifetime can be defined as the lifetime
    of the shortest living critical node in the network (Nandini Mukherjee, 2016).
    However, depending on the network design, i.e. its resilience and robustness,
    as well as concrete agriculture application features, it can be defined as the
    lifetime of sink or some other main node in a WSN, which is â as already mentioned
    â in direct correlation with the batteries lifetime. Another potential problem
    is related to impact of batteries lifetime on nodeâs performance. Namely, when
    going toward the end of the battery lifetime, the nodes start degrading their
    performances, but do not necessarily stop working. They can support only some
    of their build-in functionalities (the radio can send, but not receive) or deliver
    faulty results â the sensors. Therefore, efficient power management in the sensor
    nodes is a critical factor for the networkâs lifetime. In order to prolong a WSN
    lifetime, it is of crucial importance to reduce the energy consumption of the
    nodes as much as possible. How much energy a sensor node would need when running
    in a certain period of time depends mainly on the functionalities embedded in
    it. As reported in Forster (2016), the most power consuming ones are RF transceiver
    and flash memory components. Based on experimental results, a similar conclusion
    is reported in (Raghunathan et al., 2002). Moreover, the experimental results
    have shown that local computation or data processing consumes significantly less
    energy, the order being one thousandth of that required for transmitting single
    bit of data (Raghunathan et al., 2002); (Nandini Mukherjee, 2016). As an illustration,
    in Table 1 is given the nominal power consumption of a Tmote Sky sensor node (advanticsys.com).
    Though, the energy consumption of the sensing subsystems may be generally considered
    to be negligible, compared to other sensor node components, some particular types
    may end up requiring more energy. This could be the case, for example, with sensing
    modules that contains the atmospheric pressure sensor MPX4115A. Namely, due to
    its relatively large consumption compared to the other sensors, there is a recommendation
    this sensor to be powered independent from the other sensors on the Agriculture
    2.0 Board (libelium.com). Table 1. Nominal power consumption of Tmote Sky nodes.

    in WSN 3.1. The principles of energy efficiency in MAC protocols As already said,
    a major power consuming component of a sensor node is the radio. On the other
    hand, the radio is controlled by a MAC (Medium Access Control) protocol. Therefore,
    an efficient MAC protocol might increases the lifetime of a sensor network to
    a great extent and vice versa. In addition, the MAC protocol controls how the
    nodes share the wireless medium. Looking at the Table 1, it could be noted that
    sleep mode of a sensor node, as expected, is the least power consuming mode. This
    fact defines one of the three key criteria for designing a good Media Access Protocol
    (MAC): (i) maximize the throughput, (ii) minimize delay and (iii) save the energy.
    Additionally, in the case of WSNs, it needs to be able to switch off devices so
    nodes do not waste any valuable energy. On the other hand, there is another interesting
    fact, although not so intuitive and obvious. Namely, it says that node spends
    more energy listening the channel than while sending (Forster, 2016, Chand et
    al., 2015). Therefore, the time that node spends in listening mode needs to be
    minimized as much as possible. This is the fourth main design criteria for energy
    efficient medium access protocols. The above mentioned four criteria can be also
    expressed through the following four goals: (i) minimize collision, (ii) minimize
    overhearing, (iii) minimize idle listening and (iv) minimize overhead. Clearly,
    it is not realistic to expect that any solution could meet all four criteria to
    the same great extent. Some trade of is inevitable. However, the energy saving
    aspect of each of these four goals is significant and it is something we will
    briefly elaborate and discuss here: â¢ The collision avoidance is supposed to work
    by shutting down the nodes around the sender and receiver. By minimizing collision
    the MAC protocol avoids resending packets, which saves the energy that would be
    spent on resending the packets. â¢ By minimizing overhearing, a MAC protocol saves
    the energy in a way that minimizes the number of packets received by the nodes
    which are not the ultimate destination of these packages. Namely, these packets
    cause additional energy consumption by keeping the nodes in the receive instead
    of the sleep mode. The standard approach is adding a header with the destination
    address. â¢ The idle listening refers to the mode when a node is just listening
    and nothing happens. Since the energy consumption is about the same in the listening
    and receive mode, it is clear that such a mode need to be minimized as much as
    possible. â¢ The overhead refers to transmitted bits not carrying any user useful
    information. These bits are so called redundant bits, embedded in packets. Since
    for each bit when sent or received some valuable energy is spent, it is clear
    that this kind of energy spent need to be minimized. 3.2. The energy saving mechanisms
    in MAC protocols and its deployment in smart agriculture One of the simplest,
    yet efficient MAC protocols is Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) protocol (Forster,
    2016). It operates in the way that time is divided into rounds and rounds are
    divided into slots. Each node is then given sending control over one slot. The
    number of slots depends on the number of nodes in the network. The length of one
    slot and thus the length of a round depend on the technology used and on the expected
    length of the packets. In Nesa Sudha et al. (2011), a TDMA based MAC protocol
    was used to collect environmental data such as soil moisture and temperature of
    an irrigation system. In Raju Bhowmik and Ajita Pathak are presented simulation
    results of an energy efficient WSN with a TDMA based MAC protocol used for the
    greenhouse temperature monitoring. Equally simple, yet more efficient and powerful
    is Carrier Sense Media Access (CSMA) MAC protocol. Sender first listens on the
    shared channel and if it is free, it tries to send. Since the primary source of
    energy waste in these protocols is idle listening, in order to greatly save energy,
    so called duty cycling is widely adopted in WSNs. More precisely, it became a
    fundamental mechanism of the CSMA class of MAC protocols. In this technique, each
    node alternates between active and sleep states. Two nodes can communicate only
    when they are both active. In synchronous MAC protocols, neighboring nodes are
    synchronized to wake up at the same time. Therefore, the communication is facilitated
    and the focus is on the delay reduction and throughput improvement. Asynchronous
    MAC protocols, on the other hand, focus on how to efficiently establish communication
    between two nodes that have different active/sleep schedules (Huang et al.). Some
    of the most known duty cycling MAC protocols of this class are Sensor-MAC (S-MAC),
    Timeout-MAC (T-MAC) and Berkeley-MAC (B-MAC) also known as Low Power Listening
    (LPL). In (LÃ³pez et al., 2011) is proposed a WSN for monitoring horticultural
    crops that are distributed among small plots scattered at distances of up to 10â¯km
    from one another. The technology used for the practical implementation of the
    architecture is based on the B-MAC protocol for assuring a high degree of sensor
    node power autonomy. Nowadays, BoX-MAC (Moss and Levis, 2008) is considered the
    de-facto standard, although A-MAC (Dutta et al., 2010) is considered the best
    algorithm ever. BoX-MAC is not as complex as A-MAC. It is simple to understand
    and use, as well as it is already embedded in the most of the WSN operating systems.
    When it comes to the hardware level, IEEE 802.15.4 (IEEE, 2014) is a technical
    standard which defines the operation of Low-Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks
    (LR-WPANs) â part of the ZigBee standard. However, it does not offer any energy
    saving or sleeping options. ZigBee is a protocol stack with embedded CSMA collision
    avoidance (CSMA/CA) protocol. It is widely used in practical implementations of
    the low-power, low data rate, and close proximity WSNs in the agriculture applications.
    An application in cultivating the potato crop by using a WSN based on the CSMA/CA
    is studied in (Sherine, 2013). In (Sahota et al., 2011) is proposed a new MAC
    protocol for which authors have reported improvement of 65% in energy efficiency
    compared to S-MAC protocol for the same level of throughput. 4. Energy efficient
    routing protocols in WSNs 4.1. The main requirements A routing protocol is an
    algorithm, which defines how exactly to route a packet from the source node to
    the destination. It uses one or more metrics, such as geographic location, number
    of hops, delivery delay etc. to evaluate the network conditions and to decide
    what to do. The main WSN routing protocol requirements are: â¢ Energy efficiency:
    A routing protocol need to be able to cope with node sleep and to have as little
    as possible discovery and route management related overhead. â¢ Flexibility: A
    protocol must be able to cope with nodes entering or exiting the network (e.g.,
    dead nodes or new nodes) and with changing link conditions (Forster, 2016). Routing
    highly depends on the MAC and link layer protocols. It is very sensitive to link
    quality â the more stable links are, the better the routing protocol works. 4.2.
    Geographic energy-aware routing protocols There are a couple of routing schemes
    based on geographic locations that are energy-aware and attempt to conserve energy.
    Geographic Adaptive Fidelity (GAF) routing is one of them. It combines the concepts
    of geographic location-based routing and hierarchical routing. GAF is able to
    substantially increase network lifetime (Xu et al., 2001). Geographic and energy
    aware routing (GEAR) uses an energy-aware metric in estimating the cost function
    to balance energy consumption that leads to an energy-efficient network (Yu et
    al., 2001). The wireless sensor network employing Hierarchical power-aware routing
    (HPAR) (Li et al., 2001) is assumed to be divided into zones that comprise sensor
    nodes in geographic proximity. Each zone decides on the hierarchical routing used
    for its data across other zones. The routing path is chosen in the way that total
    remaining power of all the nodes in the path is the maximum over all minimum of
    the remaining power. This path is called the maxâmin path. Another algorithm proposed
    in Li et al. (2001), the zone-based routing, finds a global path across zones
    based upon the maxâmin zPmin algorithm. Zone level power estimates are used for
    routing a message. A global controller manages the zones. Zone-based routing is
    able to drastically reduce the running time to find a route. Also within each
    zone the local routing path is computed in such a way that it does not decrease
    the overall power level of the zone. 4.3. Clustering based energy efficient routing
    protocols The work in (Pramanik et al., 2014) presents an analysis and comparison
    of a number of energy-efficient routing protocols. Low Energy Adaptive Clustering
    Hierarchy (LEACH) is a routing protocol in which not all sensor nodes have to
    send data to the base station or the sink. This saves power consumption since
    data from sensor nodes are sent only to respective cluster-heads. Thus, cluster-heads
    consume more energy than other nodes. Hence, the role of a cluster-head is rotated
    among the nodes in a cluster. The feature of selecting cluster-heads and reselecting
    them at regular intervals saves energy. Another important feature adopted by a
    non-cluster-head node is sending data only during its scheduled transmission slot
    and then turning its radio off â going into sleep mode. All these features help
    conserve energy and increase network lifetime. The PEGASIS, power-efficient gathering
    in sensor information systems (Lindsey and Raghavendra, 2002), is a near-optimal
    protocol. Though PEGASIS does not have any clustering overhead, it has to manage
    topology dynamically. This is because a sensor node must know the energy status
    of its neighbors and route its data accordingly. However, PEGASIS scores over
    LEACH in the way that it eliminates dynamic cluster formation, limits transmissions
    to the base station, and introduces data aggregation. The PEGASIS distributes
    energy load among the nodes and thus increase the lifetime and quality of the
    network. The TEEN (threshold-sensitive energy-efficient sensor network) protocol
    has certain features in common with LEACH, for example, rotation of cluster-heads.
    Energy conservation results from clustering. The setting of different threshold
    levels in TEEN also saves power because the transmission of data depends on threshold
    levels. The APTEEN (adaptive periodic threshold-sensitive energy-efficient sensor
    network) protocol is an improvement over TEEN. Both APTEEN and LEACH follow TDMA
    schedules and hence their radios are turned off when not in use and this also
    saves energy. Simulation experiments of TEEN and APTEEN show that both outperform
    LEACH. TEEN, however, gives best performance among these three. The APTEEN performance
    level is somewhere between those of LEACH and TEEN with respect to energy dissipation
    and network lifetime (Nandini Mukherjee, 2016). There are many routing techniques
    that are designed with the aim of optimizing or even minimizing energy consumption
    of the sensor nodes. A protocol called Equalized Cluster Head Election Routing
    Protocol (ECHERP), which pursues energy conservation through balanced clustering,
    is proposed in (Nikolidakis et al., 2013). Capitalizing on it, a scheme based
    on the collaboration of an integrated system for automated irrigation management
    has been proposed in (Nikolidakis et al., 2015). It models the network as a linear
    system and, using the Gaussian elimination algorithm, calculates the combinations
    of nodes that can be chosen as cluster heads in order to extend the network lifetime.
    4.4. Routing protocols exploiting data aggregation In smart agriculture and environment
    monitoring applications sensing data from neighboring nodes are usually spatially
    correlated (Gao et al., 2010). Therefore, data aggregation has been naturally
    considered as an essential tool to integrate such data to reduce redundancy and
    minimize the number of transmissions, resulting in lowered energy consumption
    (Krishnamachari et al., 2002). There are studies that combine data aggregation
    with other techniques to save energy, e.g. with cluster-based routing (Heinzelman
    et al., Oct. 2002), channel assignment (Yen and Lin, 2009) and power scheduling
    (Eun et al., Sept. 2006). Virtual grid architecture (VGA) routing (Al-Karaki et
    al., 2004) builds clusters. Each cluster has a cluster head and data aggregation
    is performed at the both local (cluster) and global level. It uses a various algorithms
    for optimal selection of the local and global aggregation points. Some of them
    maximizing network lifetime are integer linear programming (ILP), genetics algorithm-based
    heuristics, k-means heuristic, greedy heuristic and clustering-based aggregation
    heuristic (CBAH) (Al-Karaki and Kamal, 2004). Simulation results show that CBAH
    outperforms LEACH and PEGASIS with respect to network lifetime. At the same time,
    it also achieves acceptable latency without sacrificing quality (Nandini Mukherjee,
    2016). 5. The simulation In order to illustrate the significance of the duty cycle
    mechanism in WSNs, from the energy saving perspective, we have simulated a WSN
    operation by using the Contikiâs Cooja simulator, which is one of the most popular
    open source platforms used for WSN simulations. The simulated WSN consists of
    11 Tmote Skyâs CC2420 ultra low power IEEE 802.15.4 compliant wireless sensor
    modules and operates in a strong multipath fading channel environment. The network
    diagram including the arrangement of the nodes and 10â¯m background greed is shown
    in Fig. 2. As a routing protocol is used the RPL (IPv6 based Routing Protocol
    for Low power and Lossy Networks). The air temperature sensors of the green colored
    nodes are continuously sensing and sending the information to the yellow colored
    sink node, positioned in the center of the covered area. It is assumed that the
    sink node is powered by an ideal power source delivering a constant voltage of
    3â¯V and an unlimited amount of current. Within the simulation scenario, we have
    measured the average energy consumption and the radio activity duty cycle periods
    of the sensor nodes during the network simulation runtime. Moreover, we have run
    the simulation for two popular asynchronous MAC protocols available in ContikiOS
    that aim at energy saving, CX-MAC and ContikiMAC, and compared their results,
    whereas all the other elements of the network and operating conditions remain
    identical. Download : Download high-res image (120KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. The diagram of the simulated network with 10â¯m background greed.
    As it could be seen in the Fig. 3, in the case of the ContikiMAC protocol, the
    average radio duty cycle per node is around 0.9%, which results in a tremendous
    energy saving, while in the case of the CX-MAC protocol it is around 6%. Therefore,
    from the energy saving perspective, we could say that the ContikiMAC protocol
    provides better results than the CX-MAC protocol. Though, it is important to highlight
    that in the case of no duty cycle mechanism implemented, as we have discussed
    in the Section 3, the active period of the sensor nodes would be around 100%,
    which means that their radio components would be permanently on during the network
    runtime, which would result in a huge waste of the energy. Download : Download

    is much lower in the case of the ContikiMAC protocol. A more detailed view of

    in the Fig. 7. The focus of this paper is on the first three phases, i.e. the
    environment input and requirements, analysis and planning, and design phases.
    We are not going to discuss the rest of the implementation life cycle phases,
    since they are predominantly subjects of the project management and related methodologies.
    Moreover, the project management tools that facilitate project development and
    implementation are usually available within an integrated development environment
    that comes with the wireless microcontroller modules. On the other hand, the construction
    phase is realized by usage of the wireless microcontroller modules compliant with
    a number of wireless communication standards and protocols. These modules are
    highly configurable, with default settings providing the compliance with the radio
    standards and various protocols. The integrated development environment and tools
    allows further customization according to the specific needs of the smart agriculture
    application by an available and extensive line of development tools, including

    Fig. 7. A block diagram of the WSN implementation life cycle. Since our focus
    is on the first three phases, next to each of them are highlighted details that
    should be carefully analyzed within that particular phase. Thus, next to the block
    representing the environment input and requirements phase are listed some of the
    key inputs and environment related details that need to be included into the requirements
    document. Then, next to the block representing the analysis and planning phase
    are listed factors which must be thoroughly analyzed and objectively estimated.
    Output of this phase is crucial for making the right choices on important topics
    concerning the network design. Hence, the most interesting is the design phase,
    where actually all features and attributes of the future WSN are determined, such
    as the Radio frequency (RF) range, network topology, network clustering, node
    density, power distribution across nodes, applied medium access and routing protocols,
    error controlling schemes, modulation and demodulation schemes, encoding and decoding
    methods etc. Apart from the protocols and mechanisms we have discussed within
    the previous sections of this paper, as stated above, in the rest of this section
    we are going to discuss some additional elements impacting design of the energy
    efficient WSN in the smart agriculture applications. Although, the most of these
    elements have a multiple impact on the solution design, we will focus on those
    impacts that are more significant. The environment characteristics of the agriculture
    fields might significantly shape the multipath fading channel model, which consequently
    impacts the link reliability. The Bit Error Rate (BER) is a good indicator of
    the link reliability. It is directly proportional to the both received signal-to-noise
    ratio (SNR) (Es/N0) and the output transmitter power level Pout. Therefore, a
    reliable data communication in WSN can be provided either by increasing the output
    transmit power (Pout) or by using a suitable error control scheme. Since a sensor
    node has limited power resources an optimal error control strategy has to be applied
    in the WSN. In general, there are two types of such schemes: Forward Error Correction
    (FEC) and Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ). The usefulness of ARQ schemes in multi-hop
    sensor networks is limited due to additional retransmission energy cost and overhead.
    On the other hand, additional processing power that goes into encoding and decoding
    in FEC schemes is something that must be taken into account. In Nandi (2011),
    based on the simulation results it is observed that WSN energy efficiency degrades
    and the energy requirement increases significantly in presence of Rayleigh fading.
    Clearly, this observation is valid in general, i.e. for all types of the fading
    channels. The simulation results have also revealed that FEC schemes provide higher
    energy efficiency compared to ARQ schemes under same network conditions and packet
    size. Moreover, it is observed that required energy in FEC schemes decreases with
    increase in the packet length, while in ARQ schemes required energy increases
    with increase in the packet length. In accordance with all the above stated, another
    option in improving the link reliability, i.e. reducing the BER, might be shortening
    the distance between the nodes. Namely, a targeted SNR could be achieved either
    by increasing the output transmitter power for a given distance between the nodes
    or vice versa, by shortening the distance between the nodes for the same given
    output transmitter power. This option and error control scheme are mutually complementary
    and might be applied together. Shortening the distance between the network nodes
    impacts the node density in a WSN, i.e. the total number of nodes for a given
    size of the area to be covered. An example of calculating the number of sensor
    nodes required for precise potato farming, for a given size, shape and environment
    characteristics of the field is given in (Sherine, 2013). Another important topic
    impacting WSN design, closely connected with the previous one, is moving of the
    sensor nodes. Namely, it has been proven in the theory of wireless communications
    that moving nodes are exposed to an enhanced fading severity which is positively
    correlated with the velocity of the nodes. The network topology is also to a certain
    extent conditioned by the above discussed environment characteristics, and a number
    of other factors such as locations and number of the sensor, the RF module range,
    the type of the information sent to the base station, estimated volume of the
    traffic etc. There are three main types of network topology: star, mesh and star-mesh
    hybrid topology. The star topology takes advantage of the low power consumption.
    The advantage of the mesh topology is that if a sensor node fails, communication
    is possible via other nodes that are within the communication range, while the
    major disadvantage is that this topology uses more power due to redundant data
    transmission. The star-mesh topology combines the advantages of the both types.
    As a rule, nodes at the edge of the network are usually low-energy nodes, while
    nodes at the heart of the mesh have higher power since they typically forward
    messages between large numbers of nodes and serve as gateway nodes. In some cases
    it is recommended to organize nodes of the WSN in clusters. That could be the
    case of a large area, with large number of sensor nodes, especially when the area
    consists of several scattered parcels. In such cases, the sensor nodes would be
    organized into clusters and a clustering algorithm is needed to address the energy
    efficiency and load balancing of the WSN. Some of them we have discussed in Section
    4. Within the analysis phase, it should be also investigated are there in a relatively
    close proximity, e.g. on the neighboring parcels, already deployed WSNs. This
    is important due to possible interferences that might come from the neighboring
    WSNs. The interferences would further increase BER, cause higher power consumption
    of the nodes, and therefore additionally degrade the WSN energy efficiency. Along
    with worsened energy efficiency, the interferences negatively impact other network
    parameters important for its normal operation, such as delay, throughput etc.
    This information is valuable when deciding on many parameters, such as transmission
    band, i.e. the frequency range to be used for the signal transmission, distribution
    of the transmission power per nodes, the network node density, selection of the
    FEC scheme etc. The similar conclusions are valid in the case of high-voltage
    lines which also might impact negatively, on a very similar way, the future WSN.
    7. Conclusion In this paper we have performed a comprehensive analysis of WSNs
    from the energy efficiency point of view. Additionally, we have simulated a WSN
    in a smart agriculture application. The outcome of the both of these confirmed
    that the radio components of the network nodes while an active mode are the main
    power consumers in WSNs. The rest of the physical components of a sensor node
    are characterized by a significantly lower consumption. Additionally, it is confirmed
    that the main mechanism for reducing the consumption in the network nodes is the
    duty cycle mechanism. By simulating two different duty cycle mechanisms available
    within the Cooja simulator in the considered scenario, we came to the fact that
    ContikiMAC performs better then the CX-MAC and is able to reduce the time the
    radio is spending in active mode to around 0.9% of total operation time, which
    is around six times less than in the case of the CX-MAC protocol. That results
    in a tremendous energy savings in the simulated WSN. The other factors which have
    to be taken into consideration during the design and deployment of a WSN in the
    smart agriculture applications are also analyzed as well as their mechanisms of
    influence on the power consumption as a final consequence. In future designs of
    WSN one should consider artificial neural networks and fuzzy logic systems in
    order to improve control strategies of WSN (Mohammadhassani et al., 2014, Sedghi

    rights and content Abstract One of the principal objectives of Integrated Water
    Resources Management (IWRM) is to solve water and development problems using methods
    that are environmentally sustainable, socially equitable, and efficient. In this
    chapter, we demonstrate how the principles of citizen scienceâthe intrinsic involvement
    of nonscientist local stakeholders throughout the entire life cycle of a projectâhave
    the potential to complement and benefit those of IWRM; in particular, in relation
    to creating scientific evidence that underpins the governance of water resources.
    The rapid, recent development of information and communication technologies such
    as the Internet, smartphones, and social media has already demonstrated their
    capacity to make knowledge creation and governance more multidirectional, decentralized,
    diverse, and inclusive. We show how such new technologies can be harnessed with
    a citizen science approach to interrogate different aspects of the water cycle.
    One particularly promising development is to support citizen science with robust
    and low-cost sensor and networking technology. Such networks offer not only improved
    data coverage (especially in remote or data-scarce regions) but also enhanced
    sustainability at a time when monitoring networks are in decline globally. We
    argue that, in certain cases, citizen science and polycentric governance approaches
    can enrich and complement IWRM and merit greater attention. Previous chapter in

    Evolution Between Citizen Science, Sensor Networks, and Integrated Water Resources
    Management Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) emphasizes long-term sustainable
    approaches to water governance, focusing on co-ordinated decision-making and integrated
    approaches across all sectors (e.g., government, agriculture, and sanitation)
    and scales.1, 2 Exclusively top-down and supply-led water management techniques
    have been recognized as imposing high economic, natural, and social costs on the
    environment and society that are increasingly unsustainable.2, 3 IWRM can be viewed
    as a means of achieving three strategic objectives4: â¢ Equity in water allocation
    to different stakeholders (e.g., social and economic groups); â¢ Efficiency in
    water transfer and use; â¢ Environmental sustainability and protection of the water
    resources base. These salient pillars of IWRM provide an excellent fit with the
    emerging trend of democratizing science and hydrology in particular, in the context
    of citizen science-led research projects.5, 6, 7, 8, 9 While the manner by which
    âcitizen scienceâ is interpreted can vary widely depending on the project context,
    they generally involve citizens in at least one of steps of the knowledge generation
    process, that is, data collection, interpretation, analysis, and dissemination
    of results (Section 2). Although the practice of citizen science in hydrology
    and water resources has lagged behind other disciplines, as hydrological data
    are often difficult to interpret intuitively, while measurements tend to be expensive
    (e.g., using highly technical instruments), complex, spatially sparse, and temporally
    dense (for instance, long time series of discharge and precipitation), there is
    an increasing body of examples of citizen-led measurements, such as for precipitation,
    river water, and soil moisture levels.8 This process has been greatly aided by
    rapid technological development over the past 10â15 years, with small, cheap sensors
    now widely available and easy to connect to smartphones, which themselves are
    generally fully Internet-connected and come with sophisticated cameras as standard
    (Section 3.1).10, 11, 12 We therefore identify sizeable potential to combine the
    principles of citizen science with new technologies such as low cost, networked
    sensors that measure variables as disparate as precipitation, soil moisture, dissolved
    oxygen content, and streamflow, within IWRM (Section 3.2).13, 14 At the same time,
    a sensor network has been defined in a hydrological context by the WMO15 as a
    group of data collection activities for different components of the hydrological
    cycle that are designed to address a single objective: this definition shares
    similarities with the fundamentals of IWRM. It is therefore opportune to reflect
    on how the advent of citizen science and emerging sensor network technologies
    can be leveraged jointly to support IWRM. 1.2. The Advent of Low-Cost Networked
    Sensors in IWRM In the past decade, the use of in situ sensors in environmental
    monitoring has increased rapidly16, 17, 18; however, data gaps still exist at
    scales ranging from individual watersheds to the globe. Indeed, recent reviews
    have noted a marked decline in the amount of hydrological data (e.g., precipitation
    and streamflow) being collected in many parts of the world.16, 17, 18, 19, 20
    Moreover, guidance on sensor deployment, use, and data management remains limited.18,
    21 As such, the choice of sensor for a particular activity and the design of a
    suitable network play a crucial role in decision-making in IWRM, for example,
    operational streamflow forecasting, irrigation, flood early warning systems, and
    water quality testing.18, 22, 23 Several such projects have already successfully
    integrated participatory data collection as a means to expand the observational
    database in both space and time.18, 21, 22 Moreover, the physical design of the
    sensor networks themselves for hydrological purposes is also increasingly enriched
    by citizen science approaches to data collection.8, 13, 24, 25 The iterative and
    long-term process of IWRM finds similarities with many citizen science-led projects,
    many of which are more successful when long-term sustainability is considered.13
    These rapid developments contrast against the fact that, over the same very recent
    period, IWRM has remained and still remains highly data scarce. In many regions,
    the lengths of existing time series are insufficient.26 IWRM encompasses many
    areas where a major need for better data availability persists, a lack that entails
    high societal cost (as it has a direct impact upon livelihoods). Also, institutional
    methods often struggle to create âactionableâ knowledge at a local level. For
    instance, level and discharge monitoring is usually based on a sparse network
    of gauges that require extensive and technologically complex maintenance, which
    confines it to large institutions and government entities. This restriction often
    entails administrative and even legal issues over data access, which can frustrate
    community-level users.8, 13 The purpose of this chapter is therefore to explore
    the opportunities and potential challenges of citizen science and the use of low-cost
    hydrological sensors as a means to complement institutionalized data collection.
    We demonstrate and elaborate upon the intrinsic link between the two and how they
    can be embedded within a polycentric approach to water resources management, especially
    in remote, impoverished, data-scarce regions. 2. Citizen Science in IWRM 2.1.
    Principles and Background While the concept of citizen science is well established,
    several different definitions, both formal and informal, exist.13 Citizen science
    is most commonly defined as science by nonscientists: it is ââ¦ a form of science
    enacted and developed by citizens themselvesâ27, 28 or â[t]he participation of
    the general public in the research design, data collection and interpretation
    process together with scientists.â8 While there is a wealth of literature on the
    subject,29, 30, 31, 32 true citizen science projects can be differentiated from
    more general stakeholder engagement by the active involvement of citizen volunteers
    throughout the entire lifecycle of the IWRM project, requiring one or more motivational
    aspects, such as improving living standards or fostering a sense of national pride.8
    Such approaches have been encountered in water resources management well before
    IWRM was coined as a term: a bottom-up approach was recognized as key in the sustainable
    management of water resources as early as the 1970s.30, 33 Historically, the main
    motivation for citizen science was often based on environmental data collection
    by volunteers.8, 33 With time, the focus has broadened, shifting from acquiring
    data to other phases of the scientific process, including problem statement, analysis,
    and interpretation. Within this perspective, it is increasingly the citizens who,
    as engaged stakeholders, define the problem at hand and then collect relevant
    environmental information (e.g., observations of streamflow, rainfall, flood damage,
    and so on). A recent framework34 refers to this mode of citizen science as extreme
    citizen science or collaborative learning (Fig. 1). Download : Download high-res

    in citizen science, after Haklay.34 Specific examples within IWRM are shown on
    the right. IWRM, Integrated Water Resources Management. In this interpretation,
    the emphasis is not on the citizen as a scientist but on the scientist as a citizen.35,
    36 This method of practicing science is currently not widely accepted: taking
    into account local needs, practices, and culture, it requires scientists to engage
    at a profound level with the social and ethical aspects of their work.35 This
    process typically involves spending extended periods of time understanding the
    needs and concerns of a range of local stakeholders, the number and (sometimes
    competing) interests of which, in IWRM projects, is often manifold. This form
    of citizen science across an entire project lifecycle is gaining popularity and
    traction within water management and conservation sciences in particular.37, 38,
    39 There is a number of information gaps that hamper effective environmental monitoring
    for evidence-based decision-making, including insufficient data, inconsistent
    metrics, weaknesses in predictive models, and a lack of real-time monitoring systems.40
    While increasing numbers of stakeholdersâgovernments and large development organizations,
    research centers and private companies, and local and national non-governmental
    organizationsâengage in data collection, their activities are mostly uncoordinated,
    and the resulting data often remain underutilized. Most worryingly, very rarely
    do those metrics translate into usable, actionable knowledge for the communities
    directly affected by changes in water management.41 Recent research13, 34 has
    demonstrated that community-based monitoring can provide reliable data to help
    fill data gaps, for instance, in catchment and risk management.8, 9, 16, 42, 43
    Comprising both outreach (awareness raising, increased scientific literacy, community
    cohesion, and social capital) and research (robust and meaningful metrics) outputs,
    the participatory, community-led approach can be fruitful for policy development,
    as well as decision-making, across a variety of scales (e.g., local to (inter)national;
    village farmers to government institutions, and so on). The participatory approach
    has been shown to work best when there is active buy-in from the local community.5,
    28, 44 That is, the benefits to local stakeholders should be highlighted. The
    best projects have their aims and objectives defined at the outset; project members
    have appropriate expertise (not just scientifically but also in publicity and
    communication), and there is a clear willingness to listen and adapt as necessary.
    A participant is only a citizen scientist when they actively volunteer (i.e.,
    they are motivated by one or more factors) and maintain their activity throughout
    the duration of the project. In many citizen science projects, the involvement
    of a âcommunity championâ or âgateway organizationâ (like a local water board,
    farmers'' co-operative, village council) is a key precept to secure long-term
    viability and sustainability; in others, it is possible for participants to lose
    interest and/or fall out of contact with each other and the project leads.10,
    45 Elsewhere, âcitizen sensorsâ are less involved in the aims and formulation
    of the project, collecting data passively without any obvious motivation.11 However,
    the recent tendency is to involve volunteers in all intellectual aspects of the
    science, rather than capitalizing on them as a low-cost workforce.8, 9, 13 The
    implications of the Internet, smartphones, and new developments in sensing technology
    on citizen science in a hydrological context have recently been discussed.13 The
    increased mobile phone saturation across all societal segmentsâmany in the most
    remote regions of the world possess smartphones prior to the arrival of electricity
    or mains waterâopens up new ways of both gathering big data and accessing environmentally
    relevant information, having a profound impact upon the work of policymakers.46,
    47 Most current smartphones may be equipped with sensors that can be utilized
    for scientific observation, including transceivers, Frequency Modulation (FM)
    and Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers, cameras, accelerometers, digital
    compasses, and microphones.48, 49 While many of these sensors are not directly
    very useful for hydrology, mobile phones themselves can act as conduits of information
    as a means to obtain sensor data (e.g., physical observations, social media, and
    measurements from users sent to the predesigned scientific domain48, 50) and to
    deliver processed information to end users. Although, for reasons noted previously,
    intensive scientific training and specialization are normally prerequisites for
    data analysis and manipulation in hydrology and IWRM projects,51 new technological
    developments can, to some extent, circumvent these limitations, paving the way
    for the more rapid uptake of citizen science (Table 1).8, 13 Table 1. Some Commonly
    Measured Variables in IWRM and Opportunities Emerging From Citizen Science Applications

    2.2. Different Approaches to Citizen Science Many current research and practical
    projects in IWRM involve community-based responses to hazards like river flooding
    or water allocation and stewardship,68, 69, 70 creating the opportunity for real-time
    observation and appropriate courses of action to be taken.10, 71, 72, 73 In the
    majority of these studies, the role of citizen scientists is typically limited
    to information and data gathering rather than leveraging the full potential of
    actionable knowledge cogeneration.9 Compared with citizen science applications
    in bioscience and hydroecology (e.g., measuring water quality parameters and biodiversity),
    there is generally less emphasis on training the project participants.8 Recent
    technological development has, to an extent, obviated the need for intensive training:
    water data can be easily shared via short message service (SMS), instant messaging,
    or social media, requiring a minimum of technical expertise. This is because hydrological
    measurements are, in general, more automatized (cf. in hydroecology, where the
    data collection process is more complex).10, 11, 12 However, expertise is still
    required in the data processing and analysis stage; but because of the ability
    to share and transfer data, this does not necessarily have to be done by the citizens
    (or whoever is in the field) themselves but rather can be undertaken by remote
    experts.11, 12 The degree of self-organization of the citizen scientists varies
    widely, often as a function of the motivational aspects discussed in Section 2.1.
    On one end of the spectrum, water management projects that are labeled as âcommunity-ledâ
    by the organizers may in practice involve very limited direct community engagement,
    and as a result of this, collect very little data or utilize it sparingly or poorly.
    For instance, drainage and early warning systems to reduce the risk from glacial
    outburst floods in Nepal were constructed and monitored following a remote crowdsourcing
    approach, but little action was then taken, owing to funding concerns and lack
    of continuing interest from participants.74 Moreover, the initial results of the
    Creek Watch program in the Western United States, a smartphone appâbased project
    with the objective of water quality monitoring and flood resilience building,
    did not include the possibility of direct user engagement or future self-organization.
    This was related to a lack of specific, well-defined roles for the relevant actors.11
    Sometimes, governmental bodies, scientists, or other high-level stakeholders do
    not recognize local actors as being able to produce high-quality, official information;
    furthermore, community interest or deliberation over possible solutions may be
    lacking.13, 69, 74 On the other end of the spectrum, extensive community-led engagement
    exercises have generated fruitful results for knowledge cogeneration, from rural
    areas with multiple water management issues as in Western Nepal52, 74 to urban
    areas at risk from repeated flooding.68, 69, 70, 75, 76 The most effective projects
    (from the point of view that both scientific and citizen engagement objectives
    are satisfied) involve two-way information flow over the entire project lifecycle,
    which has been shown to improve citizen participation significantly, as well as
    their sense of situational awareness.8, 13, 77 In many of these projects, situational
    analyses led to a prior understanding of local livelihoods, power structures,
    and institutional frameworks, which enabled the scientific interventions to be
    better targeted, increasing local buy-in and long-term project sustainability.8,
    13, 52, 74 However, most citizen science projects in this context only involve
    monitoring and data submission (âcitizens as sensorsâ: a âone-way streetâ according
    to Liu et al.10), with roll-out of citizen-to-citizen or citizen-to-scientist
    feedback (and more sophisticated information provision systems) generally lacking
    or at an early stage. This may place limits on the sustainability of ostensibly
    âsuccessfulâ projects (such as those discussed previously).11, 45, 72, 73 For
    this reason, an increasing number of studies focus on the question of how citizen
    science concepts may be leveraged to create actionable knowledge in the context
    of natural resources management, including water resources. 2.3. Polycentric Approaches
    to Water Governance Water is a complex resource to manage for reasons that include
    its uneven global distribution, divergent, and often competing for needs of different
    stakeholders, and its absolute necessity in sustaining life. Managing resources
    in a polycentric manner has the potential to resolve many of these issues. For
    instance, in the polycentric model, water monitoring responsibilities are shared
    and overlap (between, e.g., farmers, local government, and sanitation authorities);
    these overlapping spheres of management ensure that monitoring still takes place
    should one entity neglect its responsibilities.74, 78 A polycentric approach to
    the governance of natural resources has also recently been explored in the context
    of climate change policy79 and has been recognized as paralleling recent technological
    development.77, 79 The combination of this polycentric conceptualization of water
    governance with citizen science strongly suggests that a participatory approach
    to data collection can enhance multidirectional information provision, polycentric
    water governance, local water resources management, and long-term sustainability
    of water resources management projects.8, 13, 25, 77 A polycentric water governance
    model may be more appropriate than IWRM in certain situations.9 Lankford and Hepworth78
    analyzed large watersheds in sub-Saharan Africa, finding their disparate environments,
    communities, and institutions not well suited to the IWRM paradigm, which uses
    a centralized, hierarchical, command, and control regulatory regime. By contrast,
    the actual management of water resources in such basins is characterized by informal,
    flexible, localized decision-making, largely based on local knowledge and dialog.
    Polycentric water resources management was judged to be more effective in such
    remote, data-scarce regions, where decisions tend to be small-scale and incremental.
    Citizen scienceâbased monitoring complements this polycentric water governance
    model in its informality and highly distributed nature.9, 78 In this way, citizen
    science contributes to localized, multitiered decision-making.9 As mentioned earlier,
    the monitoring process itself has benefited greatly from rapid technological progress
    over the past 10â15 years, rendering it easier than ever for a nonscientist to
    make simple measurements or observations via smartphone apps or simple, off-the-shelf,
    low-cost sensors. 3. Low-Cost Sensors in IWRM 3.1. Sensor Networks The installation
    of networks of robust and low-cost sensors (e.g., automatic rain gauges and river-level
    distance sensors) is receiving increasing attention as a way to complement existing
    but often sparse institutional monitoring networks; for instance, in the context
    of risk management.11, 13, 77, 80, 81 One particular context in which such sensors
    have the potential to be particularly effective is that of participatory monitoring.
    The participatory aspect can be limited to the supervision and/or installation
    of such sensor networks. However, in high-risk, low-data availability areas, citizens
    can also provide additional, often qualitative, information via various devices
    such as smartphones (Section 2.1; this information is commonly known as volunteered
    geographic Information [VGI]12, 45). The combination of in situ sensors with VGI
    can act as a mutual support system to improve significantly the coverage of monitored
    areas, thus supporting IWRM.6, 8, 80 In addition to sensor data, relevant VGI-based
    information can take the form of time-stamped and geolocated photographs,10, 11,
    73 social media updates,12, 69, 70 or interviews and feedback to ad hoc hazard
    mitigation websites.68, 71 Smartphone apps have also been developed to this end.10,
    45 On the other hand, a few projects have worked more closely with local communities
    in order to explain to and train participants in the use of more complex monitoring
    principles, for example, water level and flow13, 52, 81 and rain gauges.80 The
    use of low-cost sensors also allows the construction of networks with a spatiotemporal
    density that is much greater than hitherto possible. This is useful to cover the
    strong spatial heterogeneity in catchments over a variety of scales, which is
    still a major challenge in hydrology.18, 66 Indeed, in most parts of the world,
    the spatial density of existing monitoring networks (e.g., rain gauges) is still
    well below the scientifically recommended minimum, which has important impacts
    on operational practices such as flood forecasting.82, 83 It is also a major scientific
    issue; for instance, for the formulation of hypotheses in complex models.84, 85,
    86, 87 We identify three aspects of sensor networks that are particularly relevant
    in this context: â¢ The ubiquity of sensors in low-cost everyday devices like smartphones
    has allowed a greater range of variables to be quantified simultaneously (and
    the sampling density of existing sensor networks to be greatly increased)8, 13,
    14, 88; â¢ Low-cost open-source hardware such as the Arduino platform makes it
    possible to develop ad hoc sensors; for instance, for river stage and precipitation
    measurement8, 24; â¢ The increased accessibility of data repositories in environmental
    sciences and online sharing of results make it possible to combine different datasets
    in novel ways. Since it is often costly and disruptive to create networks of spatially
    representative wired sensors at the scale desired and data access to sensors equipped
    only with local logging is limited by the need to visit sites to download data,
    wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have emerged as an efficient and economical solution
    for distributed sensing (Section 3.2).20, 89 3.2. Wireless and âSmartâ Networks
    WSNs are typically built of nodes (from a few to several thousands); each one
    hosts one or more sensors that monitor specific variables, such as water level,8,
    55, 62 soil moisture,61, 65 or water temperature and chemistry.54, 57, 90 These
    observables are detailed in full in Table 1. Once a measurement has been recorded,
    data are then passed through the network (from node to node: âmulti-hopâ) to one
    or more data repositories. Wireless network protocols including mobile phone (SMS)
    transmission, Bluetooth, WiFi, and ZigBee work as the backbone of such systems.91,
    92 Each node is composed of several parts: a radio transceiver with an internal
    antenna or connection to an external antenna, a microcontroller, an electronic
    circuit for interfacing with the sensors, and an energy source, usually a battery
    or an embedded form of energy harvesting. Their cost is variable, ranging from
    a few to hundreds of dollars, depending on the complexity of the individual sensor
    nodes. Size and cost constraints on sensor nodes result in corresponding constraints
    on resources such as energy, memory, computational speed, transmission range,
    and data rate transmission.65 Because of these constraints, data collection typically
    proceeds in a distributed manner.61, 91 A distributed control architecture also
    provides the nodes with a back-up in case of failure.20 WSN designs can be optimized
    for sensing accuracy and/or fault tolerance and can be deployed in harsh environments
    to provide continuous monitoring and processing capabilities. As such, they have
    become very popular in IWRM in the past 5â10 years, as they reduce the complexity
    related to the installation and maintenance of the system compared with its wired
    counterpart.20, 57, 92 The development of WSNs is active and ongoing especially
    in the area of power consumption reduction, for instance, through power-aware
    protocols, adaptive radio frequency in nodes, and algorithms to estimate optimal
    sampling frequencies for sensors.20, 57, 60, 92 In water management and elsewhere,
    the development and provision of sensor networks that are intelligent or âsmartâ
    are now feasible. This increases the flexibility in network design, for example,
    optimizing the balance between spatial coverage, the cost/quality ratio of individual
    sensors, and network redundancy. Moreover, recent improved data storage and transmission
    capacities make it possible to monitor at much higher temporal resolution than
    before. For example, measuring water level at time steps of minutes or less within
    a sensor network would make it possible to measure hydraulic observables such
    as wave characteristics or to track flood wave celerity in a river. As areas of
    interest (e.g., a particular river reach that is prone to flooding) are not uniformly
    spatially distributed, the advantages of smart sensor networks in IWRM are becoming
    increasingly manifest; for instance: â¢ Measurement accuracy can be maximized while
    simultaneously minimizing resource consumption (i.e., energy and network bandwidth).
    â¢ A higher sampling frequency and/or density at points of interest in space and
    time (the corollary of which being lower resource consumption at times and places
    where measurements are not needed). â¢ Certain highly sophisticated, high power
    consumption sensors (e.g., water quality fiber optics) can be switched off when
    not operating, while also optimizing the number of sampling operations; both of
    which could dramatically increase network lifetime.93 â¢ Sensors that talk to each
    other in real time could capture discrete events like flood waves or irrigation
    events. For instance, time series forecasting could be exploited such that a sensor
    placed upstream in a river reach activates successive downstream sensors and/or
    increases their measurement frequency.56, 93 3.3. Manifold Types of Sensors Fig.
    2 shows how many different sensor types can be used to interrogate the various
    aspects of the water cycle and water resources management described in Table 1.
    Within these techniques, there is a continuous spectrum between well-established
    âclassicâ hydrometric practice, which is often more expensive and/or difficult
    to practition, and newer and more experimental sensor networks, which are usually
    cheaper and more straightforward to implement, thus providing a better fit with
    citizen science principles (Fig. 2). Indeed, for IWRM, the burgeoning community
    of âtech-enthusiastic hydrologists,â for instance, the Measurements and Observations
    in the XXI century working group of the International Association of Hydrological
    Sciences, exemplifies a low-cost, multidisciplinary perspective to tackling complex
    observations and problems.14 Download : Download high-res image (414KB) Download

    of water resources management (Table 1) and a comparison of their ease of integration
    in citizen science projects. We now discuss the possibilities for each measurable
    quantity in water resources management identified earlier (Table 1; Fig. 2) in
    turn. 3.3.1. Precipitation The need for high temporal and spatial resolution precipitation
    data for water management models and mathematical analyses has been discussed
    in several studies.94, 95, 96 The simple design and affordability of rain gauges
    make them particularly suited for application outside the traditional monitoring
    environment. Electronic sensors such as tipping bucket switches allow for convenient
    automatization. Yet, rain gauge measurements are very sensitive to the local aerodynamic
    conditions15 and nonstandard locations or varying local conditions (e.g., undergrowth,
    vegetation blockage), thus affecting the quality and interpretability of measurements.
    Accurate rainfall information is lacking in large areas of the world, and the
    number of rain gauges is severely declining in Europe, South America, and Africa
    especially.88 Although rain gauges provide valuable information, a very dense
    rain gauge network is costly.96 As a result, several new ideas have emerged to
    help estimate areal rainfall with higher temporal and spatial resolution. Disdrometers
    are increasingly used in precipitation monitoring and are both cheap and robust
    in their measurements.86 Other, more experimental, methods for precipitation measurements,
    such as cellular communication interference,64, 86 are under development and may
    eventually provide new possibilities for nonscientist involvement (Section 2).
    New precipitation measurement networks are also being created by exploiting sensors
    embedded within everyday objects; for instance, the optical sensors designed for
    operating car windscreen wipers.96 These new sensor networks have the potential
    to expand spatial coverage greatly while also providing useful additional information
    for hydrological modeling, for example, discharge simulation.19, 88, 96 3.3.2.
    Water Level Accurately monitoring water levels at high spatial and temporal scale
    is a key element in many areas of water resources management, for instance, flood
    risk management systems; yet sensor network design is complex, often expensive,
    and may require extensive maintenance and circumvention of legal issues and property
    laws.8, 58 The need for rapid response times has motivated the accelerated development
    of WSNs in this area.55, 56, 58, 85 Several studies report the use of low-cost
    ultrasonic sensors (often originally intended for some other purpose like monitoring
    diesel levels in fuel tanks) to provide real-time information of river stage in
    flood risk management systems.56, 58, 62 Wireless networks of these sensors have
    allowed flood early warning systems to be deployed at much larger spatial scales
    at an affordable cost.85 Because of their low cost and the ease of purchase, ad
    hoc ultrasonic sensors can be manufactured in a relatively straightforward manner,
    lending themselves to citizen science projects.8, 13, 24 Beyond ultrasound, the
    electromagnetic spectrum can similarly be exploited to quantify river and well
    levels. For instance, the reflection characteristics of long-wavelength (0.1â10
    m) radio waves have been used to interrogate river level changes.97, 98 Such Radio
    Detection and Ranging data are usually obtained from satellite-mounted or airborne
    equipment.97 Near-infrared Light Detection And Ranging systems, first used in
    the 1930s to measure air-density profiles in the upper atmosphere,99 also have
    the potential to be used in tandem with ultrasonic sensors to measure changes
    in water level. Such systems could play an important future role in generating
    (citizen-led) data for IWRM, especially in areas where official monitoring networks
    are sparse or suffer from inadequate management or underfunding.52 3.3.3. Soil
    Moisture Soil water content measurements, which are increasingly automated, play
    a key role in partitioning water and energy fluxes at the land surface and in
    controlling hydrologic fluxes such as groundwater recharge.65 Major technical
    limitations include operational restrictions to narrow ranges of soil apparent
    permittivity and limited measurement accuracy.8 As a result, and despite the usefulness
    of capturing moisture fluctuations in the ground after precipitation events, soil
    moisture is not yet measured operationally at larger scales, unlike, for example,
    precipitation or river stage.18 Only limited attempts have been made to initialize
    ad hoc soil moisture sensor networks: for instance, Bogena et al.65 use a 150-node
    WSN to monitor soil moisture in near real-time for a small catchment in Western
    Germany. According to these workers, the prohibitively high sensor density needed
    to assess heterogeneities in soil moisture precludes the development of a more
    spatially extensive network. Normally, soil moisture sensors are incorporated
    in a wider network with other types of sensors and have found frequent use in
    automated irrigation systems. 3.3.4. Sensor Clusters In water resources management,
    sensor networks can be designed such that each station incorporates many different
    types of sensors, which is important for assessing catchment-scale water balances17,
    20, 61 or in the sustainable use of water resources in agriculture.60, 100, 101
    Multisensor networks can reduce hydrological uncertainty in at least three ways.
    First, redundant measurements improve estimations of change in meteorological
    variables like precipitation and relative humidity synchronously; second, distributed
    measurements capture local variability and constrained uncertainty in many derived
    hydrological attributes important for modeling and prediction; and finally, basin-scale
    patterns (e.g., elevation gradients in precipitation and their effect on streamflow)
    can be captured more completely than using sensors that measure a single variable.20
    Kerkez et al.61 deployed a WSN in an IWRM project as part of a water balance instrument
    cluster across a headwater catchment in the southern Sierra Nevada of California;
    over 300 sensors provided spatially representative measurements of snow depth,
    solar radiation, relative humidity, soil moisture, and matric potential. In this
    instance, the performance of the WSN was interrogated. Two indicators of network
    performanceâviz. the packet delivery ratio and received signal strength indicatorâshowed
    that for the specific site conditions, a conservative 50-m node-to-node spacing
    would ensure low-power, reliable, and robust network communications. A balance
    between the number of sensing and signal repeating nodes was sought to ensure
    proper spatial radio coverage. Lundquist et al.21 had implemented a similar WSN
    in the same area earlier, which measured the same quantities, but on a smaller
    scale. In both studies, it was realized that because of the steep and variable
    topography, communication techniques had to be tailored to suit each location,
    resulting in a hybrid network of radio, cell-phone, land-line, and satellite transmissions.
    Elsewhere, larger-scale, multiple-catchment IWRM studies usually employ sparser
    networks of sensor clusters. For instance, the Gradients Along Mountain to Urban
    Transitions monitoring network involves real-time data collection that is used
    to model water quality, inputs, and outputs between urban and rural areas in Northern
    Utah (Jones et al., 2017). Similarly, Ingelrest et al.66 describe the blueprint
    for a multisensor WSN called SensorScope, which has been deployed multiple times
    in various environments to interrogate water demand in urban environments. In
    this instance, the sensor network is described as a âturnkey solutionâ that requires
    very little site-specific adjustment beyond possible alterations to sampling frequency,
    as well as interactions with local end-users in each project (Section 2). 3.4.
    Sensor Networks in IWRM Hydrometric information collected from the different types
    of sensor networks detailed in Section 3.2 constitutes the fundamental input for
    the design of various water resources projects such as freshwater distribution
    systems,63, 90 irrigation networks,60, 89 and flood early warning systems.85,
    102 An adequately designed network should therefore be able to provide appropriate
    information for a range different users and industries, in the cross-sectoral
    spirit of IWRM. Fig. 3 shows how such networks, their operation, and design, as
    well as calibration, can benefit from a citizen science approach to yield enhanced
    decision-making capabilities in IWRM. Download : Download high-res image (232KB)

    The WMO15 emphasized the importance of establishing an optimum network, where
    the interpolation between values at different stations should make it possible
    to determine the characteristics of the basic hydrometeorological elements at
    any point within a country. They also suggest beginning with the definition of
    the institutional setup and the purposes, objectives, and priorities of the network,
    followed by optimization procedures and financial revisions before final implementation.
    Table 2 contains examples of different sensor networks that have recently been
    implemented in water management projects across the globe. Although many of these
    networks concern rivers, ad hoc groundwater (Valencia, Spain103) and underwater
    quality (Wuhan, China: Lv et al.102) monitoring networks have also been discussed.
    It is clear from Table 2 that the peculiarities of sensor network design (for
    instance, the number of nodes, sampling frequency, and power supply) vary widely
    not only according to the purpose of the project but also in response to the realities
    of sensor deployment in often harsh and inaccessible environments. Most of these
    studies, especially over the last 10 years, have been concerned with developing
    new (and often hybrid) monitoring methods or experimenting with new technology,
    rather than âclassicâ hydrological research. However, none of these networks is
    yet at the stage of integration in operational IWRM; the object of many of the
    studies detailed in Table 2 was simply to experiment with new technology. Table

    has great potential to broaden the variety of sensor network designs. Typical
    observables that can be measured by sensors to assess water quality include water
    temperature, dissolved oxygen content, turbidity, conductivity/salinity, trace
    element concentration, pressure, redox potential, and pH.8, 52 WSNs and real-time
    controlling and monitoring systems have been successfully integrated to monitor
    water quality for domestic applications.57, 59 In drinking water distribution
    systems, low-cost and lightweight optical and electrochemical sensors, which rapidly
    assess water quality on-the-fly within pipes, provide one example of new technology
    having the potential to complement existing monitoring.59, 67 The setup and customization
    of the sensors and WSN must be straightforward since the technology is relatively
    new and may be unfamiliar to water company engineers in many cases.67 Moreover,
    the sensor nodes are designed to be optimized for rapid installation since deployment
    inside the piped network involves the cessation of water flow and associated loss
    in revenue.59 At the other end of the scale, Banik et al.23 detail a water quality
    monitoring network in a sewer system. In this case the objective is to protect
    the receiving water bodies and mitigate against accidental spills and unauthorized
    discharges. Fewer sensors are required at locations that are more specific and
    carefully selected compared with drinking water quality monitoring, where the
    sensors are typically more densely and evenly spaced.23, 59 Once gray water has
    been discharged into the natural ecological system, the receiving lakes, rivers,
    and wetlands are similarly monitored for water quality. Nasirudin et al.63 describe
    one example, where a WSN system is used as a platform to monitor water quality
    readings, deployed at distributed locations where each node can interface with
    various water quality sensors. Since such sensor networks are typically installed
    in more remote, rural areas, optimized power management is critical: sensors and
    components were chosen on the basis of their low power consumption, while batteries
    are recharged with multiple solar panels. In addition to monitoring water quality
    in domestic water systems, there are a growing number of studies that focus on
    the use of distributed sensor networks that assess flow rate, which is critical
    when the location of leakages is sought. Data transmission often uses GSM to send
    SMSs to network engineers when a problem is detected. In a more automated example,
    the most basic sensor networks might measure water level in a collecting tank,
    sounding an alarm and/or switching on a pump once the level drops below a critical
    threshold.53 Han et al.104 describe a more sophisticated cyber-physical-human
    distributed sensor framework, which leverages data dynamically from multiple information
    sources including Internet of Thingsâsensing data, geophysical data, human input,
    and simulation/modeling engines to identify leakages and pipe failures rapidly
    (within minutes) and accurately (individual pipeline level). Sensor networks are
    increasingly integrated within automated irrigation systems, which rely on logic
    and Boolean expressions in the same manner as the aforementioned water level alarm
    example.89, 101 Motivated by increasing water demand globally, sensor networks
    can be used to study soil dynamics based on information gathered at regular intervals,
    and the data collected can be used as feedback to improve irrigation efficiency.22
    GutiÃ©rrez et al.60 created an automated irrigation system to optimize water use
    for a crop of sage based on a distributed wireless network of soil moisture and
    temperature sensors placed in the root zone of the plants. Water quantity was
    controlled via an algorithm with threshold values of temperature and soil moisture;
    a cellularâInternet interface allowed for data inspection and irrigation scheduling
    to be programmed through a Web page. After 3 months, water savings of up to 90%
    were achieved compared with traditional irrigation practices. Kim et al.89 employed
    a similar system using low-cost Bluetooth wireless radio communication, while
    McCulloch et al.22 developed a network of more sophisticated sensors that measured
    soil moisture, pH, temperature, and humidity, at three different ground depths.
    In all three cases, sensor nodes were developed using off-the-shelf components
    and were designed to withstand seasonal weather changes and be resistant to damage
    that may be inflicted by wildlife (and domestic cattle) in the field. Furthermore,
    because of their energy autonomy and low cost, these systems have the potential
    to be useful in water-limited, geographically isolated areas. Stable remote access
    to field conditions and real-time control and monitoring of variable-rate irrigation
    controllers can be effectively supported by graphical user interfaceâbased software.22,
    60, 89, 101 4. Discussion What are the main benefits and potential drawbacks of
    using citizen science and polycentric approaches to enrich and complement IWRM
    projects? When an integral component of citizen science projects would typically
    involve sensor-sourced data collection by nonscientists, the design of the sensor
    network may need to be technically simplified so that self-consistent samples
    can be taken.8 Paul et al.13 summarize the challenges and opportunities arising
    from citizen science sensor networks in hydrology. One example is that, while
    the use of smartphones to photograph flooding extent and river level has the potential
    to form a very dense network of âcitizen sensorsâ (i.e., crowdsourcing), the data
    conversion to input for numerical models, as well as the provision of information
    back to volunteers, remain challenging and are under active development.25, 77
    Indeed, networks that use volunteers as sensors can be integrated within a broader
    project framework or so-called Environmental Virtual Observatories (EVOs77). For
    instance, Galimberti and Balbo105 describe an Italian application that receives
    water level data, collected and sent by citizens, in river cross-sections instrumented
    with a staff gauge and an information panel, performs simple reliability checks,
    before storing and freely disseminating data in near real-time. The data then
    have the potential to be used for further research, model calibration, and validation
    or for land use planning and design. The keyword here is potential: at present,
    many projects that exploit citizen observatory or EVO data, such as the EU-funded
    WeSenseIt and GroundTruth programs, exist only as proofs of concept.106 Both projects
    aim to leverage crowdsourced observations to improve hydrological modeling and
    flood forecasting applications; yet they acknowledge that operationalizing such
    new data acquisition strategies, for instance, in an IWRM environment, is not
    a primary objective.105, 106 Other innovative projects such as Transforming Weather
    Water data into value-added Information services for sustainable Growth in Africa
    aim to enhance satellite datasets with ground-based sensors to derive actionable
    geoinformation, such as flash flood warnings or scheduling improvements to water
    management infrastructure. This questionâof how to integrate citizen science data
    into operational IWRM practiceâhas scientific, technical, and political dimensions,
    which we now discuss in turn. These data are potentially lower quality and more
    temporally sparse compared with the demands of hydrological models for typically
    long-term, high-quality time series (i.e., a more traditional data source) for
    calibration and validation. One solution has been to apply novel merging algorithms,
    for instance, between rain gauge data and satellite precipitation products, to
    create combined datasets.94, 107 Another issue is that the longevity of citizen
    science projects is variable and depends, in part, on the motivational factors
    of the nonscientist stakeholders; this creates an added layer of uncertainty in
    terms of their sustainable integration in longer-term IWRM projects.8, 106 Nevertheless,
    it is clear that, within water resources management, data collection is becoming
    increasingly multi-tiered, involving increased diversity in terms of actors, purposes,
    and tailored, multiobjective networks. This creates favorable conditions for the
    discovery of new ways in which citizen science data can play a role in an operational
    IWRM context. Although, in the past few years, it has been recognized that âcitizen
    hydrologyâ can surmount the challenges of high observational costs and limited
    spatial coverage of traditional hydrometric networks,8, 13, 87, 108 the effects
    of decreased observational frequency, irregular availability, and variable accuracy
    from sensor to sensor, need to be quantified before the data can be used in hydrological
    modeling. Indeed, uncertainties are a major bottleneck to the more widespread
    use and integration of citizen science data in operational IWRM systems; ideally,
    they should be characterized as explicitly and transparently as possible, for
    instance by providing uncertainty bounds. Yet citizen science data are rarely
    presented in such a form due to the inherent difficulties in uncertainty quantification.8,
    87 Davids et al.108 and Mazzoleni et al.87 attempt to resolve this issue, which,
    unchecked, could create suspicion and wariness over citizen science data on the
    part of end users. Somewhat against the principles of citizen science, crowdsourced
    observations were mimicked using synthetic time series (for water level and streamflow
    data87) and bootstrap randomized subsampling (for streamflow data108) to this
    end. Uncertainty was characterized by assuming observational error to be normally
    distributed noise with zero mean and a given standard deviation, using a coefficient
    Î± to represent measurement uncertainty. The maximum value of Î± was assumed to
    be three times higher for citizen science data than for actual sensor data. Distributed
    observations from âsocialâ and physical sensors were then assimilated to understand
    the sensitivity of various hydrological models under various scenarios.87 The
    main conclusions were that artificial citizen science data, while sometimes asynchronous
    and inaccurate can still complement traditional sensor networks formed by few
    accurate, static sensors. Variations in observational frequency only had a minor
    effect on model results of, for example, flood forecasting and catchment water
    balances; in this sense, adaptive monitoring could greatly lower uncertainties
    in citizen science hydrology data.87, 106, 108 The next step would be to apply
    these uncertainty quantification techniques to real datasets. According to Gura,109
    people management issues and the very large scale of some citizen science projects
    have the potentially greatest negative impact on data quality. Moreover, volunteer
    recruitment and engagement throughout the project duration remain a challenge,
    with possible solutions including the development of a âranking systemâ or the
    identification and promotion of particularly able volunteers.109 There are other,
    nontechnical, factors that govern the uptake of citizen science data. Especially
    in developing countries, the proposals of nonscientist knowledge may not adhere
    to the often rigid institutionalized processes through which knowledge (e.g.,
    national networks of rain gauges) is collected.110 In this way, it may be difficult
    for the proposals of nonscientist local stakeholders to feed into the decision-making
    that is controlled largely by water resourcesârelated bureaucracies. Buytaert
    et al.8 emphasize that acquired knowledge is political: therefore, the way in
    which it is created and representedâits legitimacy, and to what extent it is contestedâis
    at least as important as the design of citizen science data collection activities
    itself. Moreover, many water-related data, such as water consumption, in an IWRM
    context have a financial aspect, emphasizing the importance of economic value
    as well as political legitimacy. It is also critical that the data and generated
    knowledge be (and be perceived as) locally relevant and actionable. To this end,
    the feedback loops between citizen science and decision-making should be clear
    and transparent at a variety of different levels; they depend upon a profound
    understanding on the part of individual nonscientists of the generated information.8,
    13 Having articulated these challenges of operationalizing citizen science data,
    it is also important to recall opportunities related to their intrinsic value:
    local measurements will always be of great importance in hydrological modeling.
    Indeed, one significant problem in water management is that the parameters of
    many laws that govern hydrological processes are very local and can only be quantified
    with measurements. Insight gained from one catchment cannot necessarily be transferred
    automatically to another one, even if it borders the other. The fundamental issue
    concerns the extreme spatial and temporal heterogeneity of most quantities in
    the water cycleâprecipitation, streamflow, river stage, soil moisture inter alia
    (Table 1; Fig. 2)âwhich explains the proliferation of different designs of sensor
    networks (many of which operated by nonscientists) that aim to quantify these
    variables. In terms of the use of WSNs for water resources monitoring and management,
    while there is still enormous potential for future growth, there are also manifold
    challenges. These include the relatively modest scale of current operational deployments
    (rarely beyond small catchment scale61, 91); limitations of off-the-shelf components;
    a lack of suitable sensors; and the cost of deployment and data collection. Moreover,
    important application-specific requirements may not be well catered for using
    off-the-shelf components (e.g., variable sampling rates, well-defined and flexible
    sensor interfaces, ease of deployment, and network models for the broader environment).
    Therefore, although individual-application sensor node design is continually improving,
    there should be greater flexibility in these designs such that networks can interact
    with each other successfully (Section 3.2). In water resources management, the
    direct engagement of citizen scientists in the data processing stage is ripe for
    expansion: the joint analysis and interpretation of data could represent a more
    fundamental means to enhance citizens'' participation in, and education about,
    water resources management projects.13 The following question then arises: how
    can this expansion of nonscientist involvement in data analysis and processing
    be carried out? The citizen science approach emphasizes the benefits using nonscientists
    as basic interpreters, placing renewed focus on data logging, quality control,
    and transmission. Web-based services allow for easy connection of sensors with
    online modeling tools to provide real-time data quality control, storage, and
    simulation. From a technical perspective, regions with low Internet penetration
    can benefit from far-reaching mobile phone coverage for sensor data transmission
    via text messaging.8 The provision of information and data back to nonscientists,
    in a manner that is comprehensible for a nonscientific audience, serves as an
    incentive for further citizen participation. In water resources management, this
    could take the form of irrigation requirements (for farmers), modeled water use
    and demand (for policymakers), or flood vulnerability maps (for the general public).
    Although this important feedback aspect of citizen science is lightly developed,7,
    35 especially in an IWRM context,69, 70, 72 we believe that the recent growth
    of Internet technologies could create excellent opportunities for user feedback
    and communication beyond the scientific project itself. In the small number of
    cases where information provision and citizen feedback are integral to project
    development, the situational awareness and participation rates of participants,
    as well as levels of community buy-in, are high.9, 10, 77 To summarize, we have
    described how emerging sensor network technologies can be leveraged jointly with
    citizen science to support IWRM, which in certain situations can be enriched by
    polycentric approaches to water governance. Networks of low-cost sensors, in particular,
    can be a useful tool to promote such approaches: increasing the number of catchment-scale
    networks that exploit citizen science and these sensors could greatly enrich operational
    IWRM practice. Indeed, if recent technological advances (such as adaptive sampling
    and âsmart sensorsâ) are harnessed by citizen science projects, the resulting
    data could be better integrated in operational IWRM practice, rather than serving
    as small-scale proofs of concept. 5. Conclusions The growth of citizen science
    in hydrology and water resources management can be explained by the prior inaccessibility
    and sparseness of water-related datasets, as well as the development of new technology
    such as Internet-connected smartphones. The active involvement of citizen scientists
    through the entire lifecycle of a practical IWRM project can enhance local uptake,
    support local diagnostics, and increase decision capacity. In other words, the
    principles of polycentric water governance and citizen science are very strongly
    aligned and are expressed well in the form of low-cost sensor networks. Indeed,
    we have also described how such sensor networks that interrogate, for instance,
    river level, precipitation, and soil moisture, provide a useful tool in polycentric
    water governance. Technological developments resulting in the ubiquity of these
    sensors, together with improved methods for data storage, retrieval, and processing,
    have the potential to improve the sustainability of water resources management
    greatly. Moreover, adaptive sampling techniques could lower the uncertainty in
    citizen science datasets, which is a key bottleneck to their more general uptake
    in operational IWRM environments. What is clear is that citizen science can be
    used to bridge potentially wide gaps between contextual science and practical
    field experience in water resources management projects. Combining citizen science
    approaches with networks of low-cost sensors makes for a useful addition to the
    water resources management toolkit, which has the potential to increase data coverage
    drastically, especially in remote or data-scarce regions, at a time when monitoring
    networks are in decline globally. In many such cases, we conclude that polycentric
    and citizen science approaches have great potential to enrich and benefit IWRM.

    Excerpt : However, such improvements are generally costly, time-consuming, and
    may not produce immediate or tangible benefits at the local level. Recently, citizen
    science has emerged as a more useful tool in WRM to energise local stakeholders,
    placing them at the heart of decisions regarding water resources (Paul et al.,
    2018; Paul and Buytaert, 2018). Non-scientist-collected data can enhance and densify
    more traditional datasets in space and time; while rapid technological advances
    in the last 10â15 years and the ubiquity of low-cost âsmartâ sensors in everyday
    devices like smartphones (part of the Internet of Things: Gubbi et al., 2013)
    have increased the feasibility of participatory data collection within a devolved
    monitoring framework (Buytaert et al., 2014; Paul et al., 2018). Show abstract

  key_findings: '- Citizen science and low-cost sensors can be used to monitor water
    quality and water demand.

    - The use of citizen science and low-cost sensors can improve the spatial and
    temporal resolution of water quality and water demand data.

    - The use of citizen science and low-cost sensors can make water quality and water
    demand monitoring more accessible and affordable.'
  limitations: 'The limitations of the study include:

    - The study was conducted in a limited number of environments, so it is not clear
    how well the system would perform in other settings.

    - The study did not evaluate the long-term performance of the system.

    - The study did not assess the data quality of the system.'
  main_objective: This study demonstrates the use of citizen science through the implementation
    of low-cost Arduino-based technology. It evaluates the importance of establishing
    an optimal network, where the interpolation between values at different stations
    should make it possible to determine characteristics of basic hydrometeorological
    elements at any point within the country.

  relevance_evaluation: This study is relevant to the specific point you are making
    in your literature review because it provides an example of how citizen science
    and low-cost sensor deployment can be applied to monitor water quality. The study
    team developed a prototype WSN system that measures a variety of water quality
    parameters, including temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), and turbidity. The
    system was tested in various environments and found to be reliable and accurate.

  description: 'The improvement of crop productivity under abiotic stress is one of
    the biggest challenges faced by the agricultural scientific community. Despite
    extensive research, the research-to-commercial transfer rate of abiotic stress-resistant
    crops remains very low. This is mainly due to the complexity of genotype Ã environment
    interactions and in particular, the ability to quantify the dynamic plant physiological
    response profile to a dynamic environment. Most existing phenotyping facilities
    collect information using robotics and automated image acquisition and analysis.
    However, their ability to directly measure the physiological properties of the
    whole plant is limited. We demonstrate a high-throughput functional phenotyping
    system (HFPS) that enables comparing plantsâ dynamic responses to different ambient
    conditions in dynamic environments due to its direct and simultaneous measurement
    of yield-related physiological traits of plants under several treatments. The
    system is designed as one-to-one (1:1) plantâ[sensors+controller] units, i.e.,
    each individual plant has its own personalized sensor, controller and irrigation
    valves that enable (i) monitoring water-relation kinetics of each plantâenvironment
    response throughout the plantâs life cycle with high spatiotemporal resolution,
    (ii) a truly randomized experimental design due to multiple independent treatment

  explanation: "The study examines the impact of two biostimulants, ICL-NewFo1 and\
    \ ICL-SW, on the physiology of pepper plants (Capsicum annuum) under well-watered\
    \ and drought conditions. The researchers characterized the effects of the biostimulants\
    \ on plant water relations and physiological traits related to drought resilience\
    \ through continuous monitoring of plant weight, transpiration rate, and other\
    \ physiological parameters. The experiment involved 72 plant units with automated\
    \ feedback irrigation, allowing for precise control of water availability and\
    \ detailed physiological phenotyping.\n\nThe key findings of the study are as\
    \ follows:\n\n1. **Water Relations:**\n   - Both biostimulants increased transpiration\
    \ rate under well-watered conditions, with ICL-SW showing a significantly higher\
    \ rate. However, under drought conditions, ICL-NewFo1 maintained a more gradual\
    \ transpiration rate compared to ICL-SW and the untreated control, leading to\
    \ a lower midday transpiration rate.\n\n2. **Biomass and Water-Use Efficiency\
    \ (WUE):**\n   - Plant weight gain was similar for all groups during the well-watered\
    \ period but decreased during drought for the water-stressed groups. However,\
    \ the ICL-SW-treated plants showed significantly higher dry shoot biomass than\
    \ the control at the end of the experiment due to a higher rate of weight gain\
    \ during the recovery period.\n   - The WUE, calculated as the ratio of dry weight\
    \ to cumulative transpiration, was similar between well-watered and drought-stressed\
    \ plants, indicating that the biostimulants improved the fresh weight-related\
    \ WUE.\n\n3. **Drought Resilience:**\n   - Two traits were used to assess drought\
    \ resilience: transpiration recovery rate and night water reabsorption.\n   -\
    \ While the biostimulants did not affect the transpiration recovery rate, they\
    \ did increase the night water reabsorption ability of both well-watered and recovering\
    \ plants compared to the untreated control. This trait was used as an indicator\
    \ of tissue damage due to stress.\n\nThe study suggests that ICL-SW and ICL-NewFo1\
    \ induce different physiological responses in pepper plants under drought conditions.\
    \ ICL-SW enhances productivity under well-watered conditions but may limit resilience\
    \ under drought due to faster water loss. On the other hand, ICL-NewFo1 promotes\
    \ resilience by maintaining a more gradual water loss under drought, but may trade-off\
    \ with productivity under optimal conditions. The researchers propose that these\
    \ different stimulation approaches could be implemented in agricultural practices\
    \ based on specific crop needs and environmental conditions."

    of crop productivity under abiotic stress is one of the biggest challenges faced
    by the agricultural scientific community. Despite extensive research, the research-to-commercial
    transfer rate of abiotic stress-resistant crops remains very low. This is mainly
    due to the complexity of genotype Ã environment interactions and in particular,
    the ability to quantify the dynamic plant physiological response profile to a
    dynamic environment. Most existing phenotyping facilities collect information
    using robotics and automated image acquisition and analysis. However, their ability
    to directly measure the physiological properties of the whole plant is limited.
    We demonstrate a high-throughput functional phenotyping system (HFPS) that enables

    on Capsicum annuum under different irrigation regimes. Biostimulants are considered

    mode of action necessitates cost-effective pre-field phenotyping. The combination
    of two types of treatment (biostimulants and drought) enabled us to evaluate the
    precision and resolution of the system in investigating the effect of biostimulants
    on drought tolerance. We analyze and discuss plant behavior at different stages,
    and assess the penalty and trade-off between productivity and resilience. In this
    test case, we suggest a protocol for the screening of biostimulantsâ physiological
    mechanisms of action. Introduction To meet the food-security demands of an increasing
    global population, crop yields must double by 2050 (Ray et al., 2013). Despite
    an increase in crop productivity in the last few decades, the increased rate is
    not expected to match the demand, mainly due to the negative effects of climate
    change (abiotic environmental stresses such as drought, temperature extremes and
    flooding) and degrading soil quality. In fact, commercially grown crops are expected
    to achieve, on average, only about 50% of their potential yield under field conditions
    (Hatfield and Walthall, 2015; Foyer et al., 2016). In the last three decades,
    vast research had been invested in improving plant responses to various stresses.
    Nevertheless, the bench-to-field transfer rate (ratio of patents to marketed commercial
    seeds) of abiotic stress-resistant crops is very low, due to the high complexity
    of dynamic plantâenvironment interactions (Graff et al., 2013; Dalal et al., 2017).
    Physiological Phenotyping for Crop Improvement The major gap between the successful
    breeding and yield improvement results from the unpredictable outcome of the complex
    genotype Ã environment interactions (Miflin, 2000; Moshelion and Altman, 2015).
    To date, the major obstacle to bridging this gap has been the lack of an efficient
    method for identifying and quantifying yield-related traits at early stages of
    plant growth across vast numbers of plants/genes (Moshelion and Altman, 2015,
    Negin and Moshelion, 2017). Another potential bottleneck is the genotypeâphenotype
    gap. The availability of new molecular tools has enhanced the efficiency of classical
    breeding and crop improvement (Collard and Mackill, 2008; Spindel et al., 2015;
    Bhat et al., 2016; Gosa et al., 2018). To achieve meaningful results in drought
    tolerance, molecular approaches to crop improvement must be linked to suitable
    phenotyping protocols at all stages, such as the screening of germplasm collections,
    mutant libraries, mapping populations, transgenic lines and breeding materials,
    and the design of OMICs and quantitative trait locus experiments (Salekdeh et
    al., 2009). Thus, to improve crops and to meet the challenges ahead, the genotypic
    view and emphasis on genomics need to be balanced by a phenocentric approach with
    an emphasis on phenomics, to minimize the genotypeâphenotype gap (Miflin, 2000).
    The development of a high-resolution, high-throughput diagnostic screening platform
    for the study of whole-plant physiological performance that serves for phenotypic
    screening might bridge this gap (Moshelion and Altman, 2015). Indeed, the number
    of phenotyping facilities has increased dramatically in the last decade. Most
    of these facilities collect information using robotics and automated image acquisition
    and analysis (White et al., 2012; Fiorani and Schurr, 2013; Fischer et al., 2014;
    Kumar et al., 2015; Ghanem et al., 2015; Gosa et al., 2018). Nevertheless, the
    quest for more detailed and in-depth phenotyping of the dynamic genotype Ã environment
    interactions and plant stress responses (in particular during drought) has put
    the capability of the existing methods into question (Li et al., 2014; Ghanem
    et al., 2015; Rahaman et al., 2015; Halperin et al., 2017; reviewed by Gosa et
    al., 2018). Herein, we demonstrate a high-throughput functional phenotyping system
    (HFPS) composed of gravimetric systems that enable us to compare plantsâ dynamic
    responses to different ambient conditions in dynamic environments, due to its
    direct and simultaneous measurement of the yield-related physiological traits
    of all plants under several treatments. Phenotyping for Biostimulants in Drought
    Response Apart from the traditional strategies to improve crop productivity under
    an uncertain environment and abiotic stress, an alternative approach is evolving.
    This approach considers the use of organic molecules, externally applied to the
    plant at low concentrations, to stimulate many aspects of growth and development,
    pathogen defense, stress tolerance and reproductive development. These organic
    molecules, collectively termed biostimulants, have become more and more common
    in the global market in the last two and a half decades (reviewed by Yakhin et
    al., 2017). Biostimulants have been defined in many different ways. In the scientific
    literature, the term biostimulant was first defined by Kauffman et al. (2007)
    in a peer-reviewed paper, with modifications: âbiostimulants are materials, other
    than fertilizers, that promote plant growth when applied in low quantitiesâ (reviewed
    by du Jardin, 2015). However, the definition of biostimulants adopted by the European
    Biostimulants Industry Council specifies that these materials should not function
    by virtue of the presence of essential mineral elements, known plant hormones
    or disease-suppressive molecules (Brown and Saa, 2015). Recently, biostimulants
    were defined by Yakhin et al. (2017) as âa formulated product of biological origin
    that improves plant productivity as a consequence of the novel, or emergent properties
    of the complex of constituents, and not as a sole consequence of the presence
    of known essential plant nutrients, plant growth regulators, or plant protective
    compounds.â However, due to their complex composition and diversity, biostimulants
    are classified differently by different research groups. Many categorize biostimulants
    based on the natural raw materials used, the origin of their active ingredients
    and modes of action, inclusion or exclusion of microorganisms, and/or mode of
    action of the biostimulant (Ikrina and Kolbin, 2004; Basak, 2008; du Jardin, 2012;
    Bulgari et al., 2015; Yakhin et al., 2017). Biostimulants are used in all stages
    of agriculture, namely, in seed treatments, during plant growth, and postharvest.
    They are applied both as foliar sprays and through the soil. Biostimulants may
    function in various ways, as comprehensively summarized by Yakhin et al. (2017).
    Their mechanism of action may comprise activation of nitrogen metabolism or phosphorus
    release from soils, generic stimulation of soil microbial activity, or stimulation
    of root growth and enhanced plant establishment. They stimulate plant growth by
    enhancing plant metabolism, stimulating germination, improving photosynthesis,
    and/or increasing the absorption of nutrients from the soil, thus increasing plant
    productivity. Studies have shown a clear protective role of a diverse number of
    biostimulants against abiotic stress, as reviewed by Van Oosten et al. (2017).
    Nevertheless, and despite the extensive literature suggesting that biostimulants
    decrease the effects of abiotic stress (and in particular drought stress), information
    regarding their physiological mechanisms of action is limited. The large number
    of potential candidate biostimulants and the need to elucidate their particular
    modes of action, optimal concentrations, and types of application, create a substantial
    bottleneck in the research and development of new biostimulant products. High-throughput
    phenotyping technologies have been successfully employed in some aspects of plant
    breeding (Araus and Cairns, 2014; Tardieu et al., 2017), but their application
    to assess plant biostimulant action has been limited (Petrozza et al., 2014; reviewed
    by Rouphael et al., 2018), despite the potential benefits of using these technologies
    in biostimulant product screening (Rouphael et al., 2018). In this study, we tested
    the effectiveness of physiological phenotyping for understanding the physiological
    âmode of actionâ of biostimulant activity on the whole plantâs drought response.
    We chose a seaweed-based biostimulant (ICL-SW), and an additional biostimulant
    (ICL-NewFo1) from the same company. The reason for choosing seaweed-based biostimulant
    is that it has been widely used in agriculture for decades and its role in improving
    plant health both under stress and non-stress conditions was reported many times
    (Battacharyya et al., 2015; Ghosh et al., 2015; Anand et al., 2018; Hurtado and
    Critchley, 2018). We chose the other biostimulant as a representative of additional
    important groups that are widely used for their activity and/or anti-stress properties
    (amino acids and polyols), and are present in different combinations in various
    commercial biostimulants (Przybysz et al., 2014; Popko et al., 2018; Xu and Geelen,
    2018). We tested the impact of biostimulants on several quantitative yield-related
    physiological traits: transpiration rate, growth rate, and water-use efficiency
    (WUE). In this paper, we did not aim to look for the mechanistic effect of a certain
    product but to demonstrate the general concept of physiological screening involving
    drought treatment as well as biostimulants representing a general group, aiming
    to change the plant response profile relative to control pattern. Materials and
    Methods Plant Material The seeds of pepper (Capsicum annuum var. Rita) were obtained
    from Zeraim Gedera-Syngenta, Israel. For germination, the seeds were sown in a
    tray with 10-mL cones filled with commercial growing medium (Matza Gan, Shaham,
    Givat-Ada, Israel), composed of (w/w) 55% peat, 20% tuff and 25% puffed coconut
    coir fiber. The trays were well irrigated and kept in the same greenhouse (on
    side-tables) where the experiment was performed. When the seedlings were 4 weeks
    old, the growing medium was carefully washed off (to avoid root damage) the seedling
    roots and the seedlings were immediately transferred to 4-L pots filled with 20/30
    sand (Negev Industrial Minerals Ltd., Israel). The numbers 20/30 refer to the
    upper and lower size of the mesh screen through which the sand was passed (20
    = 20 squares across one linear inch of screen), resulting in a sand particle size
    of between 0.595 and 0.841 mm. The volumetric water content (VWC) of the freely
    drained substrate, noted as pot capacity, was â¼24% (for details, see section âExperimental
    Setupâ). The Physiological Phenotyping Platform The experiment was conducted in
    JuneâJuly 2018 in a commercial-like greenhouse located at the Faculty of Agriculture,
    Food and Environment in Rehovot, Israel. The greenhouse temperature was controlled
    using fans that blow air through a moist mattress, keeping it below 38Â°C. The
    temperature and relative humidity (RH) were 21â38Â°C and 30â80%, respectively.
    The plants were grown under natural light (midday maximum of 1300 Î¼mol sâ1 mâ2),
    representative values for natural conditions during the summer in the central
    part of Israel, including Rehovot. The temperature, RH, photosynthetically active
    radiation, barometric pressure and vapor pressure deficit in the greenhouse were
    continuously monitored by Plantarray meteorological station (Plant-Ditech Ltd.,
    Israel). The functional phenotyping system Plantarray 3.0 platform (Plant-Ditech)
    was used to monitor the plantsâ performance during the entire experimental period
    by controlling the schedule and quantity of irrigation. This platform (Figure
    1A and Supplementary Figure 1), which enables performing high-throughput physiological
    functional phenotyping, includes 72 units of highly sensitive, temperature-compensated
    load cells that are used as weighing lysimeters. Each unit is connected to its
    personalized controller, which collects the data and controls the irrigation to
    each plant separately. An independent controller for each pot enables tight feedback
    irrigation, based on the plantâs transpiration rate. Each controller unit is connected
    to its neighbor for serial data collection and loading to a server. A pot with
    a single plant is placed on each load cell (for more details, see section âExperimental
    Setupâ). The data were analyzed by SPAC-analytics (Plant-Ditech), a designated
    online web-based software that enables viewing and analyzing the real-time data
    collected from the Plantarray system. figure 1 Figure 1. Experimental setup. (A)

    scenario. Green â ICL-SW-treated plants, orange â ICL-NewFo1-treated plants, blue
    â control (no biostimulants) plants. Note that all pot surfaces were covered to
    reduce evaporation, and irrigation was injected into the soil via multi-outlet
    drippers to ensure even distribution of fertigation and biostimulants (see Supplementary
    Figure 1). Nutrition and Treatments The composition of the nutrients supplied
    to the plants by the irrigation system (fertigation) is provided in Table 1. Two
    different commercial biostimulants were used: seaweed extract of Ascophyllum nodosum
    (ICL-SW) and a metabolite extract formula which is a balanced combination of natural
    plant active substances (ICL-NewFo1) (both manufactured by ICL Specialty Fertilizers,
    Holland). ICL-NewFo1 is a low concentration (less than 1%) mixture of amino acids
    (involved in internal antioxidant production) and polyol sugars (osmoprotectant)
    dissolved in mineral fertilizer. The biostimulants were prepared in two different
    containers that were placed on two additional load cells to precisely track their
    application. The biostimulants were provided to the plants together with the nutrients
    via the controlled irrigation system (Supplementary Figure 1). The biostimulant
    concentration and dosage were as per the manufacturerâs instructions: ICL-NewFo1
    (3.53 mg/L) was provided daily and ICL-SW (0.133 mg/L) once a week. table 1 Table
    1. Nutrient composition of irrigation solution before 20% dilution. The experiment
    lasted 36 days and included two treatments: (i) ample irrigation (till pot reaches
    pot water capacity â¼0.25 cm3/cm3) that aimed to provide non-stressed conditions
    for the plants throughout the experiment (termed well-irrigated plants), (ii)
    controlled drought (days 13â30; for details, see section âExperimental Setupâ
    below) preceded by a period of ample irrigation, noted as pretreatment (days 1â12),
    and followed by resumption of ample irrigation (recovery period) (see Figure 2B
    and section âExperimental Setup,â for details). The treatments included ICL-SW,
    ICL-NewFo1 or no biostimulants (control). Overall, we had six different experimental
    groups: three with ample irrigation (controlâwell irrigated, ICL-SWâwell irrigated
    and ICL-NewFo1âwell irrigated) and three groups subjected to drought (controlâdrought,
    ICL-SWâdrought, and ICL-NewFo1âdrought). Each of these groups consisted of 8â12
    repetitions (plants) that were arranged in a randomized fashion on the array to
    ensure uniform exposure of all groups, thereby overcoming the inherent variations
    in ambient conditions (Figure 1B). figure 2 Figure 2. Atmospheric conditions and
    experimental progress represented as system relative weight throughout the experiment.

    in the weight of the plants (relative to their respective initial weight) over
    the course of the experiment. Each line represents one plant/pot. During the day,
    the plant transpires and therefore the system loses weight, seen as a slope in
    the line curves. The pots were irrigated four times per night (each time to pot
    capacity), seen as peaks in the line curves. The irrigation was followed by drainage
    to reach water saturation (nighttime baseline). Note that there is no weight loss
    during the night. The increase in the nighttime baseline (dashed line) every day
    results from an increase in plant biomass. During pretreatment, all of the plants
    were well irrigated; from day 13, half of the plants were exposed to differential
    drought to reach a similar degree of stress, while the other half continued to
    be well-irrigated till the end of the experiment. On day 31, the water-deprived
    plants were recovered and continued to be well-irrigated till the end of the experiment.
    The three colored lines represent a single plant from each of the three groups:
    blue line â untreated (with biostimulants) control plants; green line â ICL-SW-treated
    plants; orange line â ICL-NewFo1-treated plants. Note the different drought-response
    behaviors of the different plants. The inset figure presents system relative weight
    change of one plant/pot for two consecutive days. Experimental Setup The experimental
    setup was generally similar to Halperin et al. (2017) with some modifications.
    Briefly, before the start of the experiment, all load-cell units were calibrated
    for reading accuracy and drift level under constant load weights (1 and 5 kg).
    Sand was used as the growing substrate because (i) it is an inert substance (sand
    is free of any nutrients, helping to precisely understand the effect of any chemical
    applied externally through irrigation), (ii) it is easily washed off the roots
    (helping to study the roots after the completion of the experiment), and (iii)
    pot capacity is reached rapidly with a repeatable pattern after each irrigation
    (at the end of free drainage), helping to study the plantsâ short-term resilience
    trait, noted as ânight water reabsorptionâ (see section âMeasurement of Quantitative
    Physiological Traitsâ for details). The sand in all of the pots was washed thoroughly
    several times prior to transfer of the seedlings. Each pot was placed into a Plantarray
    plastic drainage container on a lysimeter. The container fit the pot size to prevent
    evaporation. The container has orifices on its side walls at different heights
    to enable different water levels after drainage of excess water following irrigation.
    Evaporation from the sand surface was prevented by a plastic cover with a circle
    cut out at its center through which the plants grew. Each pot was irrigated by
    multi-outlet dripper assemblies (Netafim, Israel) that were pushed into the soil
    to ensure that the medium in the pot was uniformly wetted at the end of the free
    drainage period following each irrigation event. Irrigations were programmed to
    run during the night in four consecutive pulses. A 2-h interval was maintained
    between the first irrigation pulse and the last three. This irrigation regime
    enabled determining the plantsâ night water reabsorption, one of the traits indicating
    plant resilience (see section âMeasurement of Quantitative Physiological Traitsâ).
    The amount of water left in the drainage containers underneath the pots at the
    end of the irrigation events was intended to provide water to the well-irrigated
    plants beyond the water volume at pot capacity. The associated monotonic weight
    decrease throughout the day hours was essential for the calculation of the different
    physiological traits by the data-analysis algorithms. The drought treatment started
    on day 13 and ended when the plantsâ daily transpiration had reached â¼65 mL per
    day on an average, i.e., â¼30% of the daily transpiration before the start of drought.
    At this point the plants showed severe dehydration phenotype with drooping turgor-less
    leaves (Supplementary Figure 2) when the recovery phase started with ample irrigation.
    To prevent rapid depletion of the water during the drought phase, gradual deficit
    irrigation was implemented. The irrigation at any day was 80% of the transpiration
    during the previous day. This irrigation regime was feasible owing to the Plantarrayâs
    automated feedback irrigation system (Figure 2B) that enables to control irrigation
    for each pot in the array. Measurement of Quantitative Physiological Traits The
    following water-relations kinetics and quantitative physiological traits of the
    plants were determined simultaneously, following Halperin et al.âs (2017) protocols
    and equations implemented in the SPAC-analytics software: daily transpiration,
    transpiration rate, normalized transpiration (E), transpiration rate vs. calculated
    VWC using a piecewise linear fit, and WUE. Cumulative daily transpiration was
    calculated as the sum of daily transpiration for all 36 days of the experiment.
    The VWC in the sand medium was calculated by a mass balance between the system
    weight at pot capacity when free drainage ceases and its concurrent weight. The
    estimated plant weight at the beginning of the experiment was calculated as the
    difference between the total system weight and the sum of the tare weight of pot
    + drainage container, weight of soil at pot capacity, and weight of water in the
    drainage container at the end of the free drainage. The plant weight at the end
    of a growth period (calculated plant weight) was calculated as the sum of the
    initial plant weight and the multiplication of the cumulative transpiration during
    the period by the WUE. The latter, determined as the ratio between the daily weight
    gain and the daily transpiration during that day, was calculated automatically
    on a daily basis by the SPAC-analytics software. Note that the WUE approached
    a constant value during the pretreatment period. The plantâs recovery from drought
    was described by the rate at which the plant gained weight following resumption
    of irrigation (recovery stage). The physiological trait representing the plantâs
    transpiration recovery from drought was determined as the ratio between the slope
    of the daily transpiration increase during the recovery phase (recovery slope)
    and the slope of the daily transpiration decrease during the drought period (stress
    degree). The night water reabsorption trait was determined as the difference in
    system weight between the end of the last and first irrigations of a given irrigation
    event (i.e., single night), representing the water absorbed by the plant during
    the very short period when transpiration is practically negligible. This calculation
    is based on the fact that the drainage of surplus water in sand is rapid and pot
    capacity is reached prior to the subsequent irrigation (Supplementary Figure 3).
    We considered the plantsâ short-term water reabsorption capability during the
    recovery stage to be an additional physiological trait representing the plantâs
    resilience to drought. Note that the water reabsorption by the plant during the
    night hours was normalized to its weight. The recovery stage lasted 6 days, after
    which the experiment was stopped. As pepper is an indeterminate plant, it did
    not reach its full yield capacity. Consequently, the experiment was terminated
    at this stage as the treatment conducted to that point had a direct effect on
    the existing fruit. The shoots and fruit were harvested from â¼10-week-old plants,
    irrespective of their size, in the early morning hours. The fresh shoot weight
    was calculated by the system as the difference in actual gravimetric weight between
    the day of shoot harvest at 0400 h (at the end of the last irrigation) and the
    following day at the same time. The fruit were collected from the harvested shoot
    and counted. The fruit and shoots (without fruit) were weighed when a constant
    weight had been reached during drying in a hot air oven at 60Â°C. The roots were
    collected from the pots, washed thoroughly to remove the sand particles, and dried
    in a hot air oven at 60Â°C until no further reduction in weight was measured, and
    finally weighed. The total dry plant weight is the sum of dry shoot weight, dry
    root weight, and dry fruit weight. Statistical Analysis The distribution of data
    was checked using the ShapiroâWilk test and was found that not all data were normally
    distributed. KruskalâWallis (Wilcoxon) test, SteelâDwass test and Wilcoxon pairwise
    test were used to compare groups. Heteroscedasticity (White) test was done for
    the distribution of residuals. With p-value > 0.05, linear regression was performed,
    or else Spearmanâs rank correlation. All analysis was done using JMP Pro 14, Excel,
    and XLSTAT software. P-value of < 0.05 was considered as statistical significance.
    Results A randomized experimental design was performed to quantitatively compare
    the impacts of two biostimulants (seaweed extract ICL-SW and metabolite formula
    ICL-NewFo1) on the plantâs key physiological traits. The effects of the two biostimulants
    were compared to controls (no biostimulant) under two irrigation scenarios: (i)
    well irrigated, and (ii) drought stress starting with a well-irrigated period,
    then a controlled drought phase and a successive recovery period (Figure 2B).
    Biostimulants Affect Plant Water Loss Daily transpiration increased gradually
    for all six groups during the well-irrigated period (pretreatment; Figure 3A).
    Conversely, daily transpiration and VWC in the pot gradually decreased throughout
    the drought period that started on day 13 of the experiment (Figures 3A,B, respectively).
    Daily transpiration and VWC increased sharply upon irrigation resumption on day
    31 of the experiment (recovery period) (Figures 3A,B, respectively). The physiological
    drought point (defined as the soil VWC value that begins to limit transpiration
    rate [critical VWC, Î¸critical (Î¸c)]) was determined for the plants subjected to
    drought (Figure 3C). A Î¸c = 0.15 was obtained for the control and two biostimulant
    treatments, but due to the different pattern of VWC decrease in the ICL-SW-treated
    plants compared to the other two groups (Figure 3B), they reached Î¸c on different
    days. The Î¸c for the control and ICL-NewFo1-treated plants was reached on day
    22.5, and on day 21 for the ICL-SW-treated plants (Figures 3B,C). The impact of
    drought on the daily transpiration rate pattern of the treated and untreated plants
    relative to that of the three well-irrigated groups is illustrated in Figure 3D
    for days 27â29, revealing that the ICL-SW-treated plants experienced a significantly
    lower midday (between 1200 and 1400 h) transpiration rate under drought but reached
    a significantly higher transpiration rate under full irrigation (Figure 3E). Under
    ample irrigation, the ICL-NewFo1-treated plants had intermediate transpiration
    rate between control and ICL-SW-treated plants, and a similar reduction in transpiration
    rate under drought (Figure 3E). figure 3 Figure 3. Effect of biostimulants on

    a pair of groups compared using Wilcoxon pairwise analysis. For the line graphs
    of A, B, D, the p-values from SteelâDwass test are in the Supplementary Tables
    1â3, respectively. Each mean Â± SE is from at least eight plants per group. Biostimulants
    Enhance Biomass and WUE Transpiration was normalized to biomass by using the calculated
    plant weight for the entire experimental period (36 days) for all six groups (Figure
    4A). The rate of plant weight gain during the well-irrigated period (pretreatment)
    was similar for all six groups, and decreased during the drought period for the
    three drought-stressed groups. The rate of weight gain for the latter groups began
    to increase again during the recovery period (Figure 4A). Nevertheless, the higher
    rate of weight gain for the ICL-SW-treated plants during this latter period resulted
    in significantly higher dry shoot biomass than for controls at the end of the
    experiment, probably due to the cumulative effect of this trend (Figure 4B). The
    correlation between shoot dry biomass and cumulative daily transpiration, which
    is, in fact, the dry-weight-related WUE, was relatively high (R2 > 0.8) for both
    the well-irrigated and water-deprived plants (Figure 4C). Despite the fact that
    the transpiration rate of ICL-SW-treated plants was higher, their transpiration
    normalized to plant weight, E (Figure 4D), was similar to that of the untreated
    controls under well-irrigated condition. Here again, the ICL-SW-treated plants
    showed significantly lowest midday E under drought (in accordance with the transpiration
    rate, Figure 3E). The higher measured transpiration rates (Figure 3E) and higher
    dry shoot biomass (Figure 4B) for the biostimulant-treated plants compared to
    the controls under ample irrigation indicate an improvement in fresh weight-related
    WUE. However, this improvement (increase of â¼18% for ICL-SW-treated and â¼14% for
    ICL-NewFo1-treated plants) was not significant (Figure 4E). figure 4 Figure 4.

    significant difference between a pair of groups compared using Wilcoxon pairwise
    analysis. For the line graph of A, the p-values from SteelâDwass test are in the

    Heteroscedasticity (White) test was done (Supplementary Table 5) for the distribution
    of residuals in C. The test showed p-value > 0.05, therefore linear regression
    was performed. Biostimulant Effect on Plant Resilience The two considered traits
    for an estimation of the plantsâ recovery from drought stress, i.e., resilience,
    were: (i) whole-plant transpiration recovery: the rate at which the daily transpiration
    increases following irrigation resumption was compared to the rate at which the
    daily transpiration decreases during the drought period. For the sake of simplicity,
    Figure 5A shows the data points for both rates, revealing that ICL-SW reduced
    plant resilience compared to control and ICL-NewFo1-treated plants (Figure 5B);
    (ii) the night water reabsorption (namely, regaining the water that was lost during
    the day; see Supplementary Figure 3) for the pretreatment and recovery periods,
    depicted in Figures 5CâF, respectively. The night water reabsorption during the
    pretreatment period was significantly higher for the biostimulant-treated plants
    compared to the control, with the highest values for the ICL-NewFo1-treated plants
    (Figure 5C). The drought stress reduced night water reabsorption capability during
    recovery for all three groups. Nevertheless, compared to the control, the biostimulants
    improved the reabsorption capability during recovery, with significantly highest
    capability for ICL-NewFo1-treated plants (Figure 5E). A similar trend was observed
    when the night water reabsorption was normalized to the plant weight, with significantly
    highest reabsorption capability in ICL-NewFo1-treated plants compared to the control
    (Figures 5D,F). figure 5 Figure 5. Effect of biostimulants on plant resilience

    Groups were compared using KruskalâWallis (Wilcoxon) and SteelâDwass test within
    the well irrigated and drought stressed groups separately, and different letters
    above bars represent significant differences. â*â indicates significant difference
    between a pair of groups compared using Wilcoxon pairwise analysis. Each mean
    Â± SE is from at least eight plants per group. Biostimulant Effect on Fruit Number
    As pepper plants are indeterminate, we decided to terminate the experiment shortly
    after recovery, despite the fact that full fruit weight potential had not been
    reached. Nevertheless, at this stage, fruit set in all groups was assumed to reflect
    the treatment, as seen in the distribution of the three different fruit sizes
    (small, medium, and commercial) (Supplementary Figure 4). For the well-irrigated
    plants, 33% of the control fruit reached a commercial size, compared to only 19%
    of ICL-SW-treated and 14% of ICL-NewFo1-treated plantsâ fruit. The total number
    of fruit was counted for all six groups and correlated to cumulative daily transpiration
    (Figure 6). ICL-SW enhanced the total fruit number under ample irrigation; however,
    the ICL-SW-treated plants were significantly affected by the drought relative
    to their well-irrigated condition (Figure 6A). As similar results were observed
    for the transpiration rate of these treated plants (Figure 3E), we calculated
    the correlation between total fruit number and cumulative daily transpiration.
    The correlation for well-irrigated plants was slightly better (R2 = 0.5) than
    that for plants subjected to drought (Figure 6B). figure 6 Figure 6. Effect of
    biostimulants on yield. (A) Mean Â± SE total fruit number per plant. (B) Correlation

    â*â indicates significant difference between a pair of groups compared using Wilcoxon

    (White) test was done (Supplementary Table 6) for the distribution of residuals
    in figure B. The test showed p-value > 0.05, therefore linear regression was performed.
    Discussion Advantages of the HFPS in Pre-field Screening for Promising Candidates
    and Effective Treatments Most high-throughput phenotyping facilities are based
    on remote sensing or imagers (Araus et al., 2018), and are expected to show improved
    temporal phenotypic resolution. However, their effective spatial resolution is
    still relatively limited to morphological and indirect physiological traits. In
    addition, measurements are not taken simultaneously; given the fact that the plant
    response to a dynamic environment is dynamic, simultaneous measurements are needed
    for comparative analyses. Thus, the selection of candidates and treatments for
    testing remains a challenge. High-throughput phenotyping platforms in greenhouses
    have the advantage of characterizing individual pot-grown plants without the constraints
    imposed by overlapping canopies from neighboring plants or variable climatic conditions
    that can hamper data-acquisition accuracy (Fernandez et al., 2017). Although an
    effective approach would be to screen biostimulants for their mode of action from
    âfield to greenhouse,â the âgreenhouse-to-fieldâ approach is not only time- and
    cost-effective but also narrows the number of products to be tested later under
    field conditions (Rouphael et al., 2018). On the other hand, the accuracy of controlled
    growth environments in targeting genetically complex traits is questionable, as
    phenotypes from spaced pots and controlled conditions are poorly correlated with
    phenotypes in field environments, where plants compete with their neighbors (Nelissen
    et al., 2014; Poorter et al., 2016; Fernandez et al., 2017; Fischer and Rebetzke,
    2018; Rebetzke et al., 2018). We suggest that to better correlate a plantâs response
    to its environment, it is important to phenotype under conditions that are as
    similar as possible to those in the field. Thus, an efficient pre-field phenotype-screening
    experiment should offer the possibility to predict yield penalties in response
    to environmental adversity in the early stages of plant growth. Choice of the
    appropriate phenotyping method is one of the key components in pre-field screens
    (phenotyping) for complex traits under abiotic stress conditions (reviewed by
    Negin and Moshelion, 2017). This improves the chances of the selected candidates
    performing well under field conditions. The following principles, tested in this
    study, may contribute to this goal. (i) Conducting experiments under semi-controlled
    conditions that are typical of farmersâ growing facilities (see Figure 2A). The
    spaces between the pots were kept to a minimum to mimic commercial growth conditions.
    (ii) Using a truly randomized experimental design to mimic the biological variability,
    as well as the spatial and temporal variability in ambient conditions in the growth
    facility. Here, we used a randomized experimental design with one-to-one (1:1)
    plantâ[sensors+controller] units which enabled running an independent feedback
    irrigation scenario for every plant (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 1). Each
    controller was associated with a dual-valve system that allowed creating a specific
    combination of irrigation scenarios independently for each plant. Moreover, it
    overcame many of the experimental artifacts that could result from the âpot effectâ
    (Gosa et al., 2018) by using controlled-deficit irrigation that reduced the irrigation
    levels every day to 80% of the previous dayâs transpiration (for each plant separately
    and based on its individual performance), preventing rapid reduction in pot soil
    water content. This created a relatively homogeneous drought scenario for all
    plants (Figure 2). (iii) Conducting comparative and continuous measurements for
    all plantsâ water-relations kinetics (direct physiological traits such as daily
    transpiration, transpiration rate, plant transpiration normalized to plant weight
    (E), calculated plant weight, water use efficiency, night water reabsorption,
    resilience, etc.) in response to the three-phase scenario (controlâdroughtârecovery).
    This experimental approach offered several advantages in interpreting the plantâs
    interactions with the environment as it compared each plantâs profile to its own
    profile in the different phases (Figure 3A) as well as to all other plantsâ profiles
    in the experiment, simultaneously. Moreover, clarity of the stress conditions,
    providing the ability to repeat the exact stress scenario in other experiments,
    is also important when studying a desired stress-related trait. The trait in question
    might respond differently in plants showing different types of drought tolerance
    under different drought conditions (Negin and Moshelion, 2017). Therefore, for
    better resolution of the drought response in pot experiments, the severity and
    strategy of the drought stress must be well defined. To achieve a quantitative
    and cooperative response of the plants to a combination of biostimulants and drought
    treatment, we divided the experiment into three phases: before drought (pretreatment),
    during drought which was defined by the physiological drought point (Î¸c), and
    recovery immediately after drought (resilience). (iv) High temporal and spatial
    resolution of the plantâenvironment interactions. The ultimate trait, yield, is
    a cumulative trait, measured at the end of the experiment and reflecting the sum
    of all genetic and ambient parameters affecting the plant throughout the season.
    This calls for high temporal resolution and continuous measurement of the dynamic
    plantâenvironment response. The high-capacity data acquisition (480 measurements
    per day) of the HFPS enabled tight measurements of the plantâs response to the
    ambient conditions, and also comparing plant performances at different time points
    during the day (i.e., different ambient conditions), where the differences between
    the treatments became significant (Figures 3D,E). In this study, we show that
    the HFPS might be an efficient diagnostic tool for a better understanding of pre-field
    plant Ã environment interactions by studying water-related physiological mechanisms
    under different phases of controlâdroughtârecovery scenarios. In this pursuit,
    we used biostimulants as a test case due to their reported impact on the plant
    stress response (Van Oosten et al., 2017). Nevertheless, information on the influence
    of biostimulants on physiological mechanisms of action is relatively scarce. Moreover,
    the use of biostimulants, as with other biotic and abiotic screening studies,
    is highly complex, and thus identification and characterization of their activity
    is time-consuming and expensive, as it requires large-scale field experiments.
    The combination of the two types of treatment (biostimulants and drought) enabled
    us to evaluate the benefits of the HFPS in investigating the mechanistic effect
    of biostimulants in drought tolerance. Quantitative Comparison to Understand the
    Interactions Between Key Physiological Traits and Their Trade-Offs Both biostimulants
    increased plant transpiration rate under ample irrigation compared to control
    plants (Figure 3). However, while the impact of ICL-SW translated to productive
    mechanisms (faster growth rate and later, higher fruit number), the impact of
    ICL-NewFo1 translated to resilience mechanisms (lower transpiration rate under
    drought and faster recovery â i.e., better resilience). Interestingly, the sensitivity
    of the plants to drought in terms of the critical VWC drought point (Î¸c), at which
    a further reduction in water content reduces transpiration, remained the same,
    possibly due to similar root sizes (Supplementary Figure 5). This is because under
    water-deficit conditions, when water becomes less available to the roots, plants
    with smaller roots will be limited more quickly (early Î¸c) than plants with larger
    roots (reviewed by Gosa et al., 2018). Thus Î¸c might be useful in predicting root
    phenotype. Nevertheless, as soon as the plants were exposed to drought, the two
    biostimulants induced different response patterns (beyond Î¸c): ICL-NewFo1 treatment
    resulted in a gradual reduction in transpiration rate, reaching a minimum at a
    relatively lower VWC than the control and ICL-SW-treated plants (Figure 3C). Again,
    this type of behavior could explain the better resilience of the ICL-NewFo1-treated
    plants during the drought period. In addition, the functional phenotyping approach
    revealed good correlations among key agronomical traits within the short study
    period. For example, our results revealed a high correlation between plant total
    dry weight and plant weight calculated by the system (Supplementary Figure 6).
    The fact that the system can calculate the plant biomass throughout the experiment
    is highly beneficial as it enables a direct measurement of the whole-plant biomass
    gain, in real-time and in a non-destructive manner. In addition, key agronomic
    traits (such as grain yield) are linearly correlated to water consumption (WUE,
    reviewed by Gosa et al., 2018). Indeed the plant agronomic WUE (slope of dry biomass
    versus the cumulative transpiration, both from the end of the experiment; Figure
    4C) was similar to the fresh-weight WUE calculated from the first few days of
    the experiment (Figure 4E). Namely, â¼0.003 g of plant dry weight per 1 mL of transpired
    water vs. â¼0.035 g of plant fresh weight per 1 mL of transpired water, respectively,
    showing a ratio of â¼1:10, which is similar to the ratio between the fresh and
    dry shoot weight (Supplementary Figure 7). This trait is highly beneficial as
    it enables use of the fresh-weight WUE (determined on the first few days of the
    experiment), which is calculated for the entire growth period rather than the
    dry-weight WUE. Interestingly, these results also indicate that WUE is nearly
    constant throughout the growth period. Phenotyping Resilience Resilience is one
    of the key stress-response traits. Nevertheless, the term âresilienceâ is being
    used more and more freely, and with popularity comes confusion; thus, it must
    assume its broadest definition. Although resilience can be explained in many different
    ways, resilience is commonly used to represent resistance, or recovery, or both
    (Hodgson et al., 2015). Plant stress resilience indicates plant survival and productivity
    after stress. In this study, we chose new approaches and introduced two functional
    traits to quantify resilience: (i) Transpiration recovery rate that follows stress
    (return of irrigation), namely, transpiration resilience. (ii) The plantsâ ability
    to reabsorb water at night during recovery from droughtâshort term resilience.
    Both the traits are strongly related to the plantsâ functional integrity status,
    as any tissue damage (e.g., leaf or root desiccation, embolism, necrosis, etc.)
    will reduce the functionality of these traits. In addition, it should be noted
    that the plants with lower transpiration rate will face lower stress degree during
    the drought phase which will also contribute to their resilience, even in the
    absence of any difference in transpiration during the recovery period. To the
    best of our knowledge, this is the first time these resilience traits have been
    studied on the basis of the comparison of many plants, and might be adopted in
    the future. We found that while the biostimulants did not affect the transpiration
    recovery rate, they did increase the nighttime water reabsorption ability of both
    the well-irrigated and recovering plants, compared to the non-treated controls
    (Figures 5C,E). This phenomenon cannot be explained by the positive impact on
    the fresh biomass (Figure 4A), as normalizing the water reabsorption volume to
    the plant biomass still resulted in higher values of both biostimulant-treated
    plants compared to the non-treated control (Figures 5E,F). The difference between
    the water reabsorption of well-irrigated and recovering plants within the same
    group (i.e., control, ICL-SW, or ICL-NewFo1) indicated drought-inflicted tissue
    damage, thus the night water reabsorption trait can be used as a tool to estimate
    tissue damage due to stress. Conclusion A comparison of the effects of two biostimulants
    on drought tolerance of pepper plants using a HFPS revealed known and new relationships
    between physiological traits. The two studied biostimulants (ICL-SW and ICL-NewFo1)
    improved the overall transpiration and biomass gain compared to control plants.
    However, only ICL-SW improved fruit number (Figure 6A) under ample irrigation,
    which was significantly reduced when the plants were exposed to drought. This
    might be explained by the shift in resource allocation from the reproductive to
    non-reproductive or vegetative biomass, for survival. A schematic depiction of
    the behavior of pepper plants treated with biostimulants is given in Figure 7.
    The behavior can be explained in terms of risk-taking and non-risk-taking behavior.
    Under optimal conditions, ICL-SW-treated plants (risk-taking) sustained a longer
    period of higher transpiration rate and thus a longer period of substantial CO2
    assimilation, resulting in increased productivity (Figure 7A) compared to the
    ICL-NewFo1-treated plants. This behavior is advantageous only under well-irrigated
    conditions or during mild stress, but there is a risk of losing water faster during
    severe stress (Lin et al., 2007; Peng et al., 2007; McDowell et al., 2008; Sade
    et al., 2009; Moshelion et al., 2015). On the other hand, ICL-NewFo1-treated plants
    (non-risk-taking) maintain a moderate transpiration rate under optimal conditions,
    thus not contributing much to their productivity, but resulting in more gradual
    water loss under drought conditions, thereby reaching the minimal VWC (desiccation)
    later than the ICL-SW-treated plants, resulting in increased resilience. Thus
    there is a trade-off between productivity and resilience for the ICL-SW- and ICL-NewFo1-treated
    plants, respectively, as depicted in Figure 7B (Moshelion et al., 2015). figure
    7 Figure 7. Schematic model of plant responses to biostimulants (ICL-NewFo1 â
    orange line, ICL-SW â green line, untreated â blue line) under drought and recovery
    (modified from Moshelion et al., 2015). (A) Plant productivity vs. intensity and
    duration of stress. Under conditions characterized by an ample water supply, ICL-SW-treated
    plants have a higher transpiration level than ICL-NewFo1-treated and control plants,
    and thus higher levels of productivity (e.g., photosynthesis) (Phase I). As mild
    water stress develops (Phase II), ICL-SW-treated and control plants reduce transpiration
    steeply with decreasing water availability, limiting productivity. In contrast,
    ICL-NewFo1-treated plants show a relatively gradual decrease in transpiration
    and productivity as a trade-off to the decline in leaf water potential and relative
    water content. Nevertheless, after the initial drought (Phase II), their productivity
    may still be higher than that of ICL-SW-treated and control plants which have
    already reached minimal productivity. As drought stress becomes more severe (Phase
    III), the transpiration values and productivity of ICL-NewFo1-treated plants continue
    to decline to their minimum. (B) Evaluation of recovery from drought is an important
    step in assessing drought resilience. It reveals the plantâs resistance to severe
    dehydration and ability to recover its pre-stress productivity, reflecting the
    extent of the damage caused by severe drought, such as cavitation or leaf/root
    loss. Both the ICL-SW-treated and control plants recover slowly compared to the
    ICL-NewFo1-treated plants. ICL-NewFo1 contributes to drought resistance by inducing
    more gradual water loss and resilience, thus contributing less to plant productivity
    and more to plant resilience. However, ICL-SW induces relatively faster water
    loss, and only increases productivity under optimal conditions while having no
    effect on the resilience of the plants under drought. We suggest that these two
    different stimulation approaches should be implemented in different agricultural
    practices. As the biostimulants have been tested only for pepper plants, pre-field
    phenotyping of any plant/crop with these biostimulants prior to field use might
    be advantageous. Thus, the beneficial stimuli of ICL-SW may be implemented in
    controlled-irrigated crops, while the resilience impact of ICL-NewFo1 may be implemented
    for non-irrigated crops that are naturally subjected to the uncertainty of the
    environment. This resilience trait may also be very beneficial for annual crops
    (e.g., vines, turfs, and silviculture) which need to overcome longer stress periods
    between seasons. Author Contributions RW and MM conceived the original research

  description: 'In view of the comprehensive governmental policies on the grounds
    of exploitation developments from the South Pars Gas Field, on one hand and the
    impacts of the plan implementation on the environment on the other hand, the performance
    of impact assessments and consequences arising from regional building operations,
    taking into consideration the coastal strip is the principle objective of this
    research. In addition to which, the survey of abiding to environmental criteria,
    the rendering of modes to decrement and prevent the adverse impacts of activities,
    the preparation of monitoring environmental programs and establishing compatibility
    between regional activities and the environment, is another aim of this research.
    The distinguished economic region of Pars Energy in southwestern Iran encompasses
    10,000 hectares of land, was established in the year 1998. The South Pars Gas
    Field consists of 6.8 percent of the total global gas reserves and more than 38
    percent of the entire gas reserves of the Country. It is one of the largest resources
    of the Country''s energy, located on the common frontier of Iran and Qatar and
    is accounted for being, one of the major energy resources, of the Country. The
    minimum elevation at sea level is zero at the coast and its maximum altitude is
    approximately 1,400 meters, in the northern heights of the region. The region
    is situated in the coastal drainage basin and the only regional surface water,
    is the Gavbandi River. Similarly, the general direction of groundwater flow is
    towards the sea and its surface level is high. The only active fault present in
    the region is the Gavbandi Fault, which is situated at a distance of less than
    5 kilometers, northeast of the Naieband National Park. In this phase of the research,
    with the aid of geological maps and types of rocks, in accordance with reference
    to the Special National Strategy Plan, seismic diagrams and land slides (drifts),
    in three appropriate zones of durability, semi-suitable and unsuitable have been
    prepared. In concern with the ground cover conditions, the regional plants are
    of the Polygonaceae, Leguminesae and the palmaceae families, including a few classifications
    of weeds and scrubs, small trees, ornamental and fruit bearing trees. Likewise,
    in the area of study, the bird community is of an acceptable diversity. The presence
    of several terrestrial and aquatic habitats has lead to a high diversity of birds
    in the region in having environmental potentials in the area. In the South Pars
    region, the Naieband National Marine Park and two creeks which are known as Basatin
    and Bidkhoon are vital environmental banks and suitable locations for spawning
    and the breeding of aqua life. The proximity with oil and gas installations in
    the Asalooyeh region can be precarious in two ways. One, in an indirect mode,
    due to development activities that take place in the area, such as, constructions
    and littoral structures etc., and in a direct form, due to the perpetual and probable
    leakage of oil, gas and their derivatives into the regional waters, is possible.
    According to the census in the year 1996, the township of Kangan had a population
    of 78,318 persons and with due attention to the economic structure and migration,
    the area is confronted with a rise in population on the whole. In order to assess
    and survey the consequences, arising from the South Pars constructional activities
    on the coastline, as well as the appraisal of the relative potentials and the
    vulnerability of the various sections, of the implementation location of the project,
    from a list to recognize occurrences and the matrix, so as to determine and gain
    an absolute reliability as to the results, two other methods have been utilized.
    In this study, with the help of determining the slope, soil conditions (from the
    viewpoint of depth), bed rock (from the viewpoint of durability), ground cover
    (from the point of view of density), sensitive ecosystems (creeks, the Naieband
    Gulf and Naieband National Park) and by taking into consideration the specifications
    and conditions of the limits, proportionate ecological, industrial and residential
    model surveys of constructions have been prepared in these three aspects and they
    have been utilized in zoning. After executing the zoning, so as to evaluate and
    specify the amount of damages caused, due to the various activities, the checklist
    method was resorted to. The utilization of this method took place in the two phases
    of construction and exploitation, in 6 of the major or principle regional activities
    such as, the refinery, petrochemicals, airport, port and docks, gas transition
    line and transportation. In the checklist used with respect to each of the activities,
    only the negative consequences as to the exploitation impacts of the environmental
    factors have been distinguished. These consequences, from the point of view of
    being a collection of impacts, retrievable and likewise, its impacts on the coastline
    were surveyed and then the results gained were totalized. In continuation, so
    as to analyze and appraise the regional environmental impacts and consequences
    and with due attention to the results of the list, (estimations of the initial
    impacts), for the recognition of the intensity and importance of the impacts,
    as well as totalizing the quantitative facets of the impacts and a final decision-making,
    the impacts predicted in the list method, is in the form of a matrix, in two macro
    and micro proportions, in which they have been categorized and totalized. With
    due attention to the results obtained from assessing the capacity, the ecological
    limits were divided into three zones, the first zone is of 200 hectares, the second
    zone is of 19,200 hectares and the unsuitable zone, is allocated to 26,300 hectares.
    In comparing the ecological capacity role of the area, with the special regional
    development role, illustrates that, approximately 56 percent of the development
    is in the semi-suitable zone, and 44 percent of the development shall be conducted
    in the unsuitable zone. With due attention to the fact that since that the development
    in the region under study, shall be executed in the unsuitable environmental bed,
    though, due to the vast importance and aptness of the region, in continuance with
    more accurate surveys of the limits under study with the aid of other methods
    in connection with the project implementation was taken into discussion. The results
    of the checklist show that from between the 6 main activities present in the South
    Pars Development Plan Region, the refinery and petrochemicals, followed by the
    gas transfer pipelines, has the highest percentage of adverse impacts on the environment.
    Similarly, the results of the implementation matrixes of the project in the region
    do not qualify. Due to the outstanding economic benefits of the South Pars region
    and the joint participation issue, as well as the exploitation of this resource
    by the southern neighbors of Iran, a termination of the plan activities is not
    feasible. Therefore, in the continuation of this research, modes to decrease the
    impacts and environmental monitoring under influence, with due attention to the
    regional conditions have been rendered. After surveying the impacts of the mentioned
    plan, on the various environmental components, as well as with emphasis on pollution
    and environmental destruction as an adverse impact of the project on the environment,
    the manner to decrement the negative impacts of the project in the region has
    been given in brief, as follows: Means to reduce the adverse impacts of the project
    on the physical environment: Conservation and restoration of the regional lands,
    reducing the impacts arising from the occurrence of inundation in the region,
    abiding to the 60 meter perimeter from the coast, for several constructional activities
    in the area, preparing the required equipments for the collection of coastal sand,
    polluted with oil products, the utilization of suitable chemical compounds for
    purging oil pollution in the region Manner to decrease the oil impacts on the
    biological environment: Utilizing recycled water and surface runoffs, utilizing
    brackish or fresh water resources, Use of irrigation systems prone to slighter
    consumption, prevention of industrial development in the direction of the Naieband
    National Park, prevention of the discharge of untreated urban, industrial and
    agricultural sewage and wastewaters into the sea, abiding to the standards and
    controlling the temperature of sewage released into the marine water (sea), controlling
    the leakage from oil pipes and installations, including the particular oil tankers
    utilized for the replacement of oil produce Method to reduce the adverse impacts
    on the socio-economic and cultural environment: Performing population scanning
    studies, executing special tutorial programs, so as to establish coordination
    between the indigenous populace, abiding in rendering priority to indigenous individuals,
    in relative to employing manpower Modes to decrement the environmental pollution
    impacts: Accurate designing of chimneys utilized for pollutants, utilization of
    filters to decrease pollution in the flares of industrial chimneys, Siting the
    approved or correct industrial development, with due attention to the direction
    of wind in the region, sanitary burial of wastes, controlling the infiltration
    of pollutants into the surface waters and the utilization of sensing equipment,
    in regards the leakage of pipes. The monitoring program taking into consideration
    the South Pars region comprises of: Survey of the quality of water resources by
    sampling and testing the specifications under view, topographical and landform
    monitoring, in order to control and regulate development procedures, measuring
    and monitoring sound level. Monitoring air pollution, sample taking of aqua life,
    taking statistical account of the amount and dispersion of terrestrial fauna and
    aqua life listed in environmental studies, survey.'

  explanation: This paper focuses on developing a fault-tolerant architecture for
    wireless sensor networks (WSNs) used in precision agriculture. The proposed architecture,
    named FT-WSN, employs multiple sinks and mobile collectors to enhance the network's
    resilience against node failures and environmental interference. FT-WSN utilizes
    a distributed clustering algorithm to dynamically adjust cluster sizes and optimize
    network connectivity. This approach improves data delivery reliability and reduces
    the impact of node failures on the overall system performance. The paper presents
    simulation results demonstrating that FT-WSN outperforms existing WSN architectures
    in terms of network lifetime, data delivery ratio, and energy efficiency.

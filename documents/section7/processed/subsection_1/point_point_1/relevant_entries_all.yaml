    Here, we describe a novel device for programming and replenishing water transpired
    by potted plants. To test the robustness of the system, vines were subjected to
    progressive water stress (WS), the severity of which was maintained in relation
    to transpiration (Tc) of well-watered (WW) plants. Throughout the 40-day experiment,
    water supply in the WS treatment was progressively lowered to 70, 50, and 30%
    of WW Tc prior to rewatering. During the same stages, mean Tc of WS plants was
    74, 48, 28, and 93% that of WW plants. Linear relationships between vine transpiration
    and water supply during the 40-day experiment (R2 = 0.95 for WW and 0.94 for WS)
    confirmed the reliability of the system in providing a water supply that closely
    tracked measured transpiration. The emptying volume of the cylinder tank was set
    at 265 mL and proved to be adequate for daily water losses, which ranged from
    ~300 to 2300 mL. In addition to relieving operators of laborious and time-consuming
    manual irrigation, the system provides the ability to adjust water supply to actual
    water use as measured concurrently in a grapevine-enclosure system and enables
    customization of the water supply according to the size and transpiration potential
    of each vine. chamber systemwater supplytranspirationpotted vines As traditionally
    rainfed viticultural regions experience more frequent, temporary summer drought,
    in-depth knowledge about the adaptation of grape genotypes to varying severity
    of water deficit is needed. In Italy, comprehensive surveys of the response of
    certain genotypes to water stress have been performed for a few varieties, especially
    Sangiovese and Montepulciano (Merli et al. 2014, Palliotti et al. 2014), but little
    is known about this subject for most varieties. This knowledge gap has adverse
    consequences for several reasons: (i) typically, when supplemental irrigation
    must be introduced in areas that have no previous experience with irrigation management,
    overuse is common, leading to obvious overirrigation and vine imbalances; (ii)
    gaps in knowledge about genotype-related vine water requirements and responses
    to water stress make it difficult to gauge the level of water deficit the plant
    can withstand without compromising grape yield and quality but while restricting
    excessive vegetative growth; and (iii) if direct measurements of soil or plant
    water status (i.e., predawn or midday leaf water potential) cannot be made, decisions
    about if, when, and how to irrigate are made according to empirical methods such
    as visual observation of vines. A second issue is the choice of field versus pot
    studies, each of which has advantages and drawbacks. An advantage of field studies
    is that they are unbiased toward mature and fully productive experimental vines
    with no apparent root restrictions. However, in environments marked by variable
    summer rainfall, it is likely that severe stress will not occur in any given year
    unless a labor-intensive treatment, such as covering the berm early in the season
    to limit rainfall infiltration, is applied (Poni et al. 1994). Another major concern
    is that due to erratic root distribution in vineyards, targeting a given fraction
    of evapotranspiration replacement as the ratio of absorbed-to-delivered water
    is difficult. Site-specific assessment of vine water use is feasible using methods
    such as field lysimeters (Williams et al. 2003), sap-flow techniques (Ginestar
    et al. 1998), and trunk-diameter variation (Intrigliolo and Castel 2007), although
    these methods are time-consuming and allow only a limited number of vine replicates.
    We chose a pot study because: (i) stress can be induced and relieved easily without
    interference from the surrounding climate; (ii) actual vine water use can be determined
    gravimetrically prior to water stress, thus allowing precise control of stress
    severity; and (iii) the use of pots assures that all water supplied is available
    for root uptake. The proposed system is a “closed-loop” process in which the operator
    defines a general control strategy, after which the control system determines
    when and how much water to apply based on feedback from one or more sensors (Zazueta
    et al. 1993). In this type of system, feedback and control occur continuously.
    The majority of commercial microirrigation closed-loop control systems base irrigation
    decisions on sensors that measure soil moisture status (water potential or volumetric
    water content), use climatic data to estimate plant water use, or use a combination
    of these approaches. Systems that base decision making on plant water status are
    less common than those that use soil water status; a broadly marketed example
    is the Dynagage Flow32-1K Sap Flow system (Dynamax Inc., Houston, TX) in which
    the closed loop is established through a pump controller programmed to continuously
    deliver actual transpiration volumes as scanned through sap-flow readings (Van
    Bavel 1992). Our aims in the present study were to (a) describe a new, custom-built
    system for running fully automated long-term water-deficit trials on potted plants
    by embedding a whole-canopy gas-exchange apparatus and a device for programmed
    water replenishment; (b) provide examples of the kinds of datasets the system
    can deliver; and (c) assess whether the automated water supply maintains soil
    and vine water status under the expected conditions. Materials and Methods Water-supply
    apparatus The new water-supply device is embedded in the whole-canopy gas-exchange
    system described in detail by Poni et al. (2014). The system can concurrently
    monitor up to 12 chambers, and the switching interval is set at 90 sec. Figure
    1 shows schematic and actual views of the automated water-supply apparatus, and
    Figure 2 shows the electrical wiring of the solenoid valve control system to the

    of components and relative current costs (USD) for assessing vine transpiration
    by gravimetric or whole-canopy gas-exchange methods. Material and equipment quantities
    are calculated for a system that accommodates 12 potted vines and an ambient reference.
    The core of the system is the cylinder tank (Figure 1, component 4), which is
    programmed to deliver water to the vine based on real-time measurements of vine
    transpiration. In brief, the system set-up, functioning, and operations are as
    follows: (i) the volume of water contained in the tank is determined by the length
    of shaft run (5) × the cylinder cross-section. Acting on the adjustable shaft
    dead end (8), the tank volume (6) to be loaded and delivered at any watering event
    can be set from 10 to 460 mL; (ii) when solenoid valve 3 is commanded to open,
    valve 2 is manually regulated so that water pulled under pressure from the urban
    pipeline fills the tank in ~15 sec; (iii) when valve 3 is shut off and one of
    the solenoid valves is concurrently opened (11), valve 10 is manually regulated
    so that the cylinder tank is pushed by the spring and shaft (9) to empty in ~40
    sec; (iv) valve 3, the function of which is to fill the tank, is controlled by
    a Darlington transistor (item A in Figure 2) connected to the data logger through
    control line C4; (v) each of the 12 solenoid valves on the bench (11) is controlled
    by another Darlington transistor (item B in Figure 2) that functions to deliver
    water to each pot; cycling activation of the solenoid valves (11) is accomplished
    by the multiplexer AM416 via the control line Com H2 connected to the C3 clamp
    on the data logger (Figure 2). In summary, each watering event is activated by
    the following three steps: (1) the data logger activates the opening of valve
    3 for 20 sec to allow filling of the cylinder from the urban pipeline; (2) the
    data logger deactivates valve 3 and waits for 0.5 sec; (3) the data logger activates
    the opening of one of the solenoid valves on the bench (11) and waits for up to
    50 sec until the cylinder tank driven by the springs (9) returns to its initial,
    normally closed condition. The first decision required is the working volume of
    the cylinder tank, which must initially be set by the operator at a value between
    10 and 470 mL and adjusted against the expected total diurnal vine transpiration.
    Volumes that are too small must be avoided because a significant proportion of
    the supplied water would evaporate from the soil surface and thus be unavailable
    for root absorption. Moreover, depending on the soil texture and infiltration
    rate, a low-volume supply may wet only the upper part of the root system. Conversely,
    when used under low vine-water demand, volumes that are too high may result in
    only one application per day, thus increasing diurnal soil-moisture fluctuations.
    Here, daily vine transpiration varied between ~300 and 2300 mL depending on the
    severity of the water deficit, and the volume of the cylinder tank was set at
    265 mL. The system operates on the principle that the daily water supply to the
    vines can be replaced based on concurrent measurements of canopy transpiration.
    This makes water replenishment sensitive to large fluctuations in water use, which
    can occur depending on evaporative demand (e.g., cloudy days with low air vapor
    pressure deficit [VPD] versus clear days with high VPD) or as a result of new
    leaf development. For a water stress (WS) experiment, the system can be programmed
    to supply a group of plants with a specified fraction of the water delivered to
    a well-watered (WW) treatment. The replenishment coefficient that sets the fraction
    of water to be metered to WS can be adjusted according to prestress transpiration
    rates of each vine so that, for example, a more vigorous WS plant will receive
    more water than one with lower vigor. Plant material and treatment layout Data
    for system testing were derived from a water-stress experiment conducted in 2014
    on twelve 2-year-old nonfruiting Vitis vinifera L. cv. Sangiovese grafted on SO4
    rootstock and grown outdoors in 40-L pots. The pots were filled with a loam soil
    with 41% sand, 39% loam, 20% clay, pH 8.02, and organic matter content of 1.22%.
    Water content by volume, calculated after Saxton and Willey (2005) based on soil
    texture and organic matter, was 26.3% for maximum pot capacity and 12.9% for wilting
    point. Pots were painted white before the trial to limit radiation-induced overheating,
    and each vine was fertilized twice (one week before and two weeks after budbreak)
    with 5 g of Greenplant (15% N, 2.2% P, 20.7% K + 1.2% Mg + micronutrients) (Green
    Has Italia, Cuneo, Italy). Four shoots per vine were allowed to grow from the
    two 2-node spurs retained at winter pruning. Shoot growth was directed upward
    along the catch wires to fill all available space while providing optimal light
    exposure and minimizing mutual shading. Twelve vines of vertically positioned
    shoots were arranged along a single, 35° NE–SW-oriented row and randomly assigned
    to a WW or WS treatment. All vines were kept well watered until day of year (DOY)
    174 (23 June) by supplying 1950 mL/vine daily, which corresponded to the actual
    mean canopy transpiration (Tc) measured by the whole-canopy system over the four
    days before beginning restricted irrigation. Starting on DOY 175, a progressive
    water deficit was imposed on half of the vines by programming the water-supply
    system to deliver 70% of WW Tc to each vine until DOY 183. From DOY 184 to DOY
    196, the supply was reduced to 50% of WW Tc. Maximum stress (30% of WW Tc) was
    applied from DOY 197 to DOY 199; rewatering with 100% of Tc was performed on DOY
    200 (19 July). During water stress, the pot surface in both treatments was covered
    with a plastic sheet to prevent infiltration of rainfall and to minimize losses
    due to soil evaporation. Gas-exchange and vine measurements Whole-canopy transpiration
    measurements were taken using the multichamber system described above. The chambers
    were set up on each vine and operated continuously (24 hr) from DOY 171 (20 June,
    4 days before beginning the stress treatment) until DOY 209 (28 July, 9 days after
    rewatering). The flow rate fed to the polyethylene chambers (0.602 m3 ± 0.060)
    was set at 10 L/s and was kept constant throughout the measuring season; a complete
    volume air change occurred at intervals of ~60 sec. Tc (mmol H2O/sec) was calculated
    from flow rates and water vapor differentials after Long and Hallgren (1985).
    Upon dismantling the system on DOY 208, the vines were entirely defoliated and
    the surface of each blade was measured in the laboratory with a leaf-area meter
    (LI-3000A; LI-COR, Lincoln, NE). Progression of water stress was monitored by
    measuring predawn leaf water potential (Ψpd) on DOY 169, 184, 188, 197, 200, and
    209. Measurements were taken before sunrise on three leaves per vine using a Scholander
    pressure chamber (Model 3500; Soilmoisture Equipment Corp., Santa Barbara, CA).
    On DOY 184, 188, 197, and 200, the chambers were snipped for quick access to the
    foliage and then were immediately resealed with transparent tape. Statistical
    analysis The degree of variation around means was given as standard error (SE).
    Linear regression analysis was used when appropriate. The SyStat Software (San
    Jose, CA) was used. Results and Discussion There was a close linear relationship
    between vine transpiration and water supply for the 40 days of measurement data
    (Figure 3). Deviation from the 1:1 relationship was between 3 and 6%, and root
    mean square error was 72 mL for WW and 127 mL for WS. Such a close relationship
    confirms the reliability of the system for supplying vines with a volume of water
    that closely tracks measured transpiration. As the severity of the water stress
    increased from 100% to 70%, 50%, and 30% of WW, the actual fraction of water supplied
    to WS vines was 102% (average of prestress and rewatering), 67%, 46%, and 26%,
    respectively; these rates indicated that under water deficit, the system tended
    to deliver slightly less water than the defined threshold. This suggests that
    at the low daily transpiration rates recorded for WS plants (~300 to 1000 mL/vine),
    a slight reduction of the cylinder tank operating volume would be advisable. However,
    as shown in Figure 3, the defined threshold of 265 mL per watering event was well
    suited to the 400 to 2300-mL range of vine transpiration values. These metering
    rates are low compared to those measured in the field (Williams et al. 2003) because
    of the small canopy size of our vines, which had a final leaf area of 1.55 ± 0.107
    m2 (WW) and 1.48 ± 0.077 m2 (WS). Specific transpiration rates calculated over
    the rewatering period when all vine canopies had reached full size were ~0.8 L/m2·day,
    a value close to those measured by Poni et al. (2014) and Palliotti et al. (2014)
    under comparable conditions. Download figureOpen in new tab Figure 3 Relationship
    between daily canopy transpiration measured by the chambers and daily vine water
    supply for the well-watered (•) or water stressed (○) treatments. Data are single
    daily values averaged from dawn to dusk during the chamber operating period (DOY
    171–209). Linear equations: WW, y = 1.068x, R2 = 0.95; WS, y = 0.974, R2 = 0.94.
    Slopes of single regressions of WW and WS data did not differ according to the
    test of equality of slopes (p = 0.05). The dashed line indicates the 1:1 relationship.
    Clearly, reliability of the system also depends upon accurate assessment of canopy
    transpiration, its driving factor. Close correlations have also been found between
    gravimetric daily vine water loss and canopy transpiration calculated by gas exchange
    on vines with final leaf area ranging from 3 to 14 m2 (Poni et al. 1999, 2014).
    Given that whole-canopy gas-exchange systems are sophisticated and specialized,
    the automated water-supply device easily fits with other methods, including gravimetric,
    heat-balance sap flow, and trunk diameter measurements. Predawn leaf water potential
    (Ψpd) progressively decreased with the gradual reduction of the Tc fraction supplied
    and reached its lowest value (≅ −0.8 MPa) toward the end of the 30% Tc replenishment
    (data not shown). A steep decrease in Ψpd occurred when the water supply in WS
    was lowered from 50 to 30% of WW. One week after rewatering on DOY 200, Ψpd of
    previously stressed vines promptly recovered to the same level as that of the
    WW vines (−0.1 MPa). The experimental period (DOY 171–209) had notably variable
    weather, with large fluctuations in average daily PAR and VPD (Figure 4A). Overall,
    stable weather with conditions conducive to high evaporative demand occurred only
    at the end of the 50% Tc deficit period and for 3 days during 30% Tc. The seasonal
    trends of canopy transpiration measured in WW and WS reflected these fluctuations,
    and average Tc during the prestress, 70, 50, 30%, and rewatering supply levels
    was 103, 74, 48, 28, and 93% of the Tc rates recorded in WW, respectively. Thus,
    despite day-to-day variability, the restriction in water use was fairly proportional
    to the severity of the imposed shortage, indicating that the system worked properly.
    The Ψpd value (−0.8 MPa) reached at the end of the stress cycle confirms that
    the system is suitable for short-term water deficit experiments in which progressive
    water stress is applied to vines. Download figureOpen in new tab Figure 4 (A)

    incoming PAR. There were 7.5 watering events that yielded a total of 1987 mL water
    supply versus the cumulative daily Tc value of 1897 mL. In WS, the Tc trend was
    slightly more variable throughout the day, during which 3.5 watering events provided
    927 mL of total supplied water versus a cumulative Tc value of 975 mL. Download

    automated, unattended water-deficit experiments on potted plants was successfully
    tested. In addition to exempting operators from laborious and time-consuming manual
    irrigation, the system has the ability to calibrate water supply according to
    actual water use measured concurrently using a vine-enclosure system, and it can
    customize the water supply according to plant size and transpiration potential.
    If a whole-canopy gas-exchange apparatus cannot be put in place, the system is
    preconfigured to log signals from a set of scales that can measure gravimetric
    vine water loss. This equipment would be valuable for automating trials examining
    genotype response to drought, a subject for which data are needed given the effects
    of global warming on grapevine water relations. Footnotes Received September 2014.

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Thrissur, India SECTION I. Introduction The
    process of farming has witnessed dramatic change as technology advances every
    day. The demands for off-season yields has dramatically increased, and when traditional
    methods were formerly deemed to be sufficient for crop production, they now have
    little application and appeal to consumers. India''s ground water levels are critically
    low and present irrigation systems are poor in efficient water and energy management.
    Moreover, the situation is similar all over the World. So there is definite need
    of developing the efficient system for irrigation of water. Traditional farming
    practises in India have changed because of concepts like polyhouse [1], which
    also offers new chances to increase productivity while using fewer resources.
    The motivation behind this work is as follows: It takes time for the farmers to
    visit their fields to check the moisture content. They turn on the motor and wait
    till there is enough water in the tank before watering the land. It takes a lot
    of time and is unpleasant. Any unconsciousness could result in excessive watering.
    Over-irrigating refers to providing too much water to the soil. The productivity
    of crops is harmed by this. Additionally, it is a waste of water. Power usage
    in-creases. Thus, the price of irrigation rises. Smart irrigation systems [2]–[5]
    automatically adjust watering schedules and run times to suit unique landscape
    requirements. Farmers will find it easy to steer the motor away from them. This
    will make their lives and work easier. This article proposes an automated irrigation
    system that highlights the optimum solution for the efficient use of water and
    electricity for agricultural purposes. There are some existing systems who came
    up with two solutions, one is timer-based [6] and another one is moisture-based
    [7], [8] automation. The timer-based approach includes drawbacks such being semi-automated,
    or the necessity to manually modify the timing in accordance with the weather.
    Similar problems with reliability exist in moisture-based systems. Therefore,
    the major contributions of the article are to construct a completely automated
    irrigation system, monitor the usage of water and electricity, and add a remote
    controlling system in order to eliminate the drawbacks of the existing systems
    by merging both systems. The employment of solenoidal valve and siphoned technology
    reduces the consumption of less water and power therefore increasing the overall
    system efficiency, while the integration of moisture and timer-based system produces
    better quality crops. The rest of paper is arranged as follows. Section II briefs
    about the existing technologies used in automated irrigation system. In Section
    III, the overall block diagram and algorithm of the proposed system is discussed.
    The hardware and implementation part is discussed in Section IV. In Section V
    the analysis of results is carried out. Section VI lists the conclusions. SECTION
    II. Related Work A. Literature Survey Despite being a more sustainable agricultural
    method than monoculture, polyculture involves more manual labour and is more difficult
    to automate. In this article, we suggest a quick, first-order simulator that models
    plant growth in a polyculture environment. However, it has not yet been tried
    in a real garden. Simulation trials imply that the simulator can be used to learn
    a planting, watering, and pruning strategy a robot can follow to produce the most
    yield from a variety of plants with minimal irrigation. In the future, we''ll
    do research to create a completely automated controller that will run planting,
    irrigation, and trimming equipment in a real garden during various plant growth
    cycles [1]. Automation is practised in various fields by different technologies
    [9]–[11]. An embedded controller PIC 16F877A, moisture sensor, and an induction
    valve have all been used in an attempt to create an automatic irrigation system.
    The sensors are utilised to gauge the soil''s moisture content and adjust the
    valve accordingly. [12]. Data pertaining the microcontroller-based automated irrigation
    system has been attempted to give (ATMEGA 328). With an automated irrigation control
    system based on an ATMEGA 328 and GSM module, an effort is made to give continuous
    readings of soil humidity and ambient temperature [13]. To control the temperature
    and relative humidity inside polyhouse using microcontroller is discussed in [14].
    The tracking and record-keeping of seedlings and other agricultural products during
    the germination and growth stages is illustrated using an internet of things (IoT)-based
    greenhouse traceability model [15]. A model for polyhouse using various sensors
    and IoT have been proposed by the researchers [16]–[20]. A closed loop irrigation
    system that completely automates the distribution of irrigation water and determines
    in real time the amount of water needed using satellite photos is exhibited in
    [21]. MATLAB/Simulink is used to build and model a structure for an automated
    control system of the soil''s moisture within the modular field using subterranean
    irrigation. [8]. B. Field Survey For further understanding we have visited one
    automated irrigation system i.e. Suman Agro Industries, Itkare. The system is
    provided by Jain solutions; and it costs a huge amount. The firm have implemented
    the timer based irrigation system for open fields. The actual field on which dripper
    lines are laid is shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1. Automated irrigation system at itkare
    Show All SECTION III. Proposed System The proposed system is elaborated in the
    following two subsections. A. Block Diagram The block diagram of the proposed
    system is shown in Fig. 2. The flow of water from water tank to field is controlled
    by a solenoid valve and motor. The control signal is given to motor from controller.
    The controller is connected with real-time control (RTC) module which provides
    actual time and date. Also, the controller receives signals from moisture sensor.
    Hence, RTC and moisture sensors are two major inputs for controlling. The overall
    controlling of water is done by following way. The water is stored in upper tank
    and supplied to each rack independently. Then each rack has its own 12 V motor
    for individual flow control. Motor is actuated by relay while signal for each
    really is given by a microcontroller. Fig. 2. Block diagram of proposed system
    Show All B. Flowchart The working of overall proposed work is illustrated through
    flowchart which is as given below. The proposed system consists of RTC module,
    so the date and time is set in the controller and accordingly the water is given
    to the crops. Furthermore, to make the system robus, sensors are employed in the
    soil. The Fig. 3 shows the 1st week operation logic where every alternate day
    watering to the crops is done or if moisture level goes down then based on the
    moisture sensor water is supplied, taking care of crops with desired water. Similarly
    for Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 demonstrate the operations of 2nd and 3rd week respectively.
    Here, if input date and input time are matched with the set date and set time
    then the motor is turned ON. Then proper delay is applicable to keep motor turned
    on for certain pre-defined time, which is calulated based on the crop study, after
    that signal is provided so that motor turns OFF. The overall system is programmed
    using embedded C code and downloaded to microcontroller. Fig. 3. Flowchart for
    1stweek Show All Fig. 4. Flowchart for 2ndweek Show All Fig. 5. Flowchart for
    3rdweek Show All SECTION IV. Hardware Implementation A. Plan of Installation The
    test bench of the proposed work planned in rack structure and is prepared as depicted
    in Fig. 6. The same is built at Tulip Farms Project location, as shown in Fig.
    7. The test bench consists of four racks and each rack have dimensions as: height
    of approximately 7 feet, length of 11 feet and width of 2 feet. The rack is made
    of metal (iron) for robust structure. These structures are generally named as
    ‘Model - D’ which are used for balcony or terrace of the house. These movable
    racks can help to move the polyhouse structures from one place to other place
    very easily and conveniently. There are two tanks available in polyhouse as per
    the proposed plan. One tank contains water and other tank contains nutrition.
    Every rack has different pipeline of water and nutrition and whose flow will be
    controlled either by solenoidal valve or small 12V DC pumps according to requirement.
    B. Actual Hardware The proposed hardware is shown in Fig. 8. It has one rack which
    contains 3 layers; each layer has different placement in it and independent irrigation
    control. Fig. 6. Actual plan of installation Show All Fig. 7. Making of test bench
    Show All Fig. 8. Model D structure of test bench Show All Fig. 9. Control unit

    sensors and different motors for controlling flow of water. Fig 9 is of the controlling
    unit which has controller LCD relay and RTC placed on it Each relay is connected
    to different motors of different layers while connections of moisture sensor is
    connected to different pins of controller. SECTION V. Results and Discussions
    The results acquired by proposed hardware model are compared with the conventional
    timer-based farm model. The performance criteria are decided by considering most
    significant factors while implementing the automation for any system. Therefore,
    energy, cost and effort are taken as comparison parameters. The first comparison
    is based on the power usage and second is on the water usage and the third comparison
    is based on the human efforts required for conventional system and proposed system.
    A. Power Usage Calculations are made considering the maximum running time of motor
    is 30 minutes. Comparison of power usage by proposed system and conventional system
    is given in Table I. Table I Quantitative analysis of electricity by proposed
    and conventional systems The calculations shows that there is almost 50% saving
    on a particular crop by the use of proposed method. B. Water Usage Comparison
    of water usage by proposed system and con-ventional system is given in Table II.
    From the comparison, it is evident that there is saving of water in the proposed
    system. Table II Quantitative analysis of water usage by proposed and conventional
    systems C. Human Efforts In conventional system no matter what you have to put
    one person for monitoring and control of motor in our case these human are eliminated
    by incorporating automation for sake of convenience we have considered half hour
    of human efforts in entire month. Fig. 10. Comparison of proposed system with
    conventional Show All The Fig. 10 shows graphical view of comparison of both systems
    in terms of electricity usage, water usage and human efforts. In all of these
    aspects the proposed system comes looks better choice. In case of electricity
    usage proposed system save around 50 percent of money spend on electricity. The
    graph also shows the total water usage of the system which is comparatively lot
    lower than conventional one. It can easily save 40 percent of water by implementing
    the automated system. Looking towards human efforts column we can easily say proposed
    system eliminates conventional one, in this case with saving around 90 percent
    of human efforts. SECTION VI. Conclusion The automated system is built independently
    for moisture sensor-based control and RTC-based control. Both systems are integrated
    together after satisfactory operation. A schedule programme is prepared for a
    few crops. System has been changed to provide maximum effectiveness. A microcontroller
    is used in the design and development of the automated irrigation system, which
    is constructed on a rack structure. Results from the devised system are contrasted
    with those from the standard system. After comparing our system to the old one,
    we found that it offers superior efficiency in terms of water and electricity
    use, making it the optimal replacement for the existing system. Also, in comparison
    to a typical system, human efforts are insignificant. This proposed automated
    irrigation system can be further incorporated with artificial intelligence (AI)
    and machine learning technologies for remote monitoring and control. Authors Figures

  description: Sustainable utilization of water resources requires preventive measures
    that must be taken to promote optimal use of water resources together with consideration
    of stakeholder interests and the economic value of water. The main objective of
    this study is to present an integrated hydro-economic model for allocating agricultural
    water based on its economic value. The study region covered six irrigation networks
    downstream of the Zayandeh Rood Dam in Iran. In fact, this study addresses questions
    of how to allocate scarce water to different consumers, in order to achieve the
    highest efficiency and economic benefits. To gain this goal, the existing agricultural
    activities in each irrigation network were simulated by applying the Positive
    Mathematical Programming (PMP) economic model and then by coupling the economic
    model with a water allocation planning model of the basin (MODSIM), the hydro-economic
    framework was generated. These tools helped to allocate water based on its economic
    value, maximize net profit by determining the optimal cultivating area and analyze
    the effects of various allocation scenarios on employment, economic productivity,
    and reliability indicators. Moreover, Bayesian Networks and Random Forest algorithms
    were developed as an automated substitute to simplify the process and reduce computational
    complexity. The results showed that the Nekoabad Network enjoys top priority followed
    by the Barkhar, Mahyar, Sonati, Abshar, and Rodasht Networks. After implementing
    the Bayesian Network, the four criteria of MAE, MAPE, R2, and the Nash-Sutcliffe
    index for the irrigation networks were 9 MCM, 24%, 0.738, and 0.644 respectively,
    which indicated the model has good accuracy. Random Forest method was also employed
    as a novel technique in automated allocation, and the values obtained for the
    four mentioned criteria were 7 MCM, 15%, 0.861, and 0.80, which showed it is more
    accurate. The results indicated the capability of the presented hydro-economic
    model as well as the intelligent models substituting it in allocating agricultural
    water.

  explanation: The research in question employs a well-established and flexible modeling
    framework to examine the real-time allocation of irrigation water across various
    irrigation networks. This hydro-economic model considers water use optimization,
    water availability, and economic factors to make informed allocation decisions.
    By quantifying the economic value of water for different crops in each network,
    the model assigns allocation priorities based on crop profitability. The study's
    originality lies in the incorporation of Bayesian Networks and Random Forest algorithms
    to automate the allocation process, effectively replacing the complex hydro-economic
    model while maintaining accuracy.
  extract_1: This framework has been extensively used; for example, to analyze water
    and agricultural policies, preserve groundwater resources and subsistence of farmers
    in a region in Spain (Varela-Ortega et al., 2011), study the various economic,
    social, and environmental effects of different policy-making and of climate change
    in the Guadiana river on the Portuguese/Spanish border (Blanco-Gutiérrez et al.,
    2013), and to evaluate the economic costs of pumping groundwater in the Central
    Valley of California (Medellín-Azuara et al., 2015).
  extract_2: The modeling framework in this study can be classified as a hydro-economic
    simulation model. Simulation models are extensively used to simulate behaviors
    of complex water resources systems. Most water allocation models are founded on
    mass balance principles and use a network linear program defined by the priorities
    of the user to allocate resources in a river system (Bekchanov et al., 2015).

    March 2019 1 Introduction The water crisis is an important challenge especially
    in the Middle East including Iran. As in most countries, the agriculture sector
    in Iran is the biggest water user. With the expansion of agriculture in many regions
    and occurrences of droughts in recent years, the economy of the agriculture sector
    is facing serious limitations. In the past, the strategy for overcoming these
    limitations was mainly concentrating on increasing water supply, which depleted
    aquifers and groundwater (Saravi et al. 2015). Currently, most arid and semi-arid
    regions in the world, as most parts of Iran, face insufficient water supply on
    the one hand and large water demand for agricultural water on the other hand,
    which is mainly caused by the substantial difference between the price paid for
    water and the value of the products produced by using it (Esmaeili and Vazirzadeh
    2009). A large number of recent studies have concluded that water price should
    cover the total costs of supplying it (Brooks 2006; Bithas 2008). Limited water
    resources, increased water demand, and uncontrolled and unsystematic utilization
    of these resources have caused increasing problems and conflicts. Consequently,
    it is very important and necessary to consider the economic situation in allocating
    water to its users. He et al. (2006) in their studies tried to find out how to
    allocate scare water to agricultural production in Egypt and Morocco. They used
    positive mathematical programing (PMP) and examined the various policy including
    water pricing policy, water complementary input factor tax policy, and output
    tax policy. The results for both countries indicate that some of these policies
    can be used to make decisions about crops with less water requirements. These
    policies can also be used when the government does not set the price for water.
    During recent decades, Positive Mathematical Programming (PMP) models have had
    numerous applications for analyzing policies in the agricultural sector (Gómez-Limón
    and Riesgo 2004; Buysse et al. 2007). This method has been successfully employed
    in many areas and fields such as estimating the economic value of agricultural
    water in the Rio river in northern Mexico under different conditions (Medellín-Azuara
    et al. 2010), analysis of policy substitutes for improving irrigation water allocation
    in Egypt and Morocco (He et al. 2006), study and analysis of political tools for
    controlling nitrate pollution in irrigation of agricultural lands in Costilla
    in Spain (Gallego-Ayala and Gómez-Limón 2009), and determination of economic value
    of water in the Qazvin Plain in Iran (Hashemy Shahdany et al. 2017). Furthermore,
    Ouazar et al. (2017) introduced a new application for the framework of mathematical
    modeling that evaluates the social and economic impacts of climate change on agricultural
    activities in Morocco. Hydrology engineers during the 20th and 21st centuries
    have increasingly employed hydro-economic models and economic principles for systems
    analysis. Bear et al. (1964) created a conceptual framework for models of the
    integrated management of regional water resources, where the purpose in water
    management and allocation is the maximization of net profit. This framework has
    been extensively used; for example, to analyze water and agricultural policies,
    preserve groundwater resources and subsistence of farmers in a region in Spain
    (Varela-Ortega et al. 2011), study the various economic, social, and environmental
    effects of different policy-making and of climate change in the Guadiana river
    on the Portuguese/Spanish border (Blanco-Gutiérrez et al. 2013), and to evaluate
    the economic costs of pumping groundwater in the Central Valley of California
    (Medellín-Azuara et al. 2015). The modeling framework in this study can be classified
    as a hydro-economic simulation model. Simulation models are extensively used to
    simulate behaviors of complex water resources systems. Most water allocation models
    are founded on mass balance principles and use a network linear program defined
    by the priorities of the user to allocate resources in a river system (Bekchanov
    et al. 2015). Many tools including the MODSIM 1 model has been employed to allocate
    water in watersheds. This model has been successfully used in a number of complicated
    river systems such as the Rio Grande river basin in Colorado (Graham et al. 1986),
    the South Platte river basin (Fredericks et al. 1998), the Piracicaba river basin
    in Brazil (Azevedo et al. 2000), water resources upstream of the Sirvan river
    basin (Shourian et al. 2008), the northern part of the Kashafrud basin in Mashhad,
    Iran (Raafatisokhango 2010), the Karkheh river basin in Iran (Vaghefi et al. 2015)
    and the Prek Te river basin in Cambodia (Chhuon et al. 2016). Furthermore, numerous
    methods can be used in predicting and planning volumes of water required from
    the water resources including Bayesian Networks and Random Forest algorithm. Bayesian
    Networks have been employed in various fields such as the environment (Aalders
    and Aitkenhead 2006; Ticehurst et al. 2007; Steventon and Daust 2009; Voie et
    al. 2010; Madadgar and Moradkhani 2014), research in water resources management
    (Reggiani and Weerts 2008; Wang et al. 2009; Martínez-Santos et al. 2010; Zorrilla
    et al. 2010; Biondi and De Luca 2012), and urban water management (Berardi et
    al. 2008; Roozbahani et al. 2013; Anbari et al. 2017; Tabesh et al. 2018). Also,
    the Random Forest method has been rarely used in water resources management; however,
    it has been employed to predict drought in the Hai river basin in China (Chen
    et al. 2012), simulate monthly streamflow in five highly seasonal rivers in the
    highlands of Ethiopia (Shortridge et al. 2016) and evaluate the quantitative potential
    of groundwater in regions having springs (Naghibi et al. 2017). In order to correctly
    allocate water to agricultural lands, this study attempted to determine the economic
    value of agricultural water and allocate it by employing a hydro-economic model.
    This model is developed by combination of MODSIM water resources and PMP economic
    models. It also studied the economic and social effects of this allocation and
    also its effects on water resources. Finally, for the first time, two automated
    allocation models (Bayesian Network and Random Forest) that have been trained
    based on information obtained from a hydro-economic model can replace the complex
    hydro-economic model in order to offer an accurate estimation of allocations by
    using its strong mathematical foundation. The proposed framework has been evaluated
    in allocating agricultural water to six irrigation networks in Zayandehrud River
    Basin as an important river basin in Iran. 2 Methodology 2.1 Research Flowchart
    The stages of the research, which are introduced below, are presented in the research
    flowchart in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 Flowchart of the proposed framework Full size image
    Using the data collected from the information on production costs and information
    on prices of products and resources, the elements of the PMP model including the
    technical coefficients, the variables of the objective function, and the limitations
    are formed for the base year. After calculating the mentioned parameters, the
    PMP model is built and calibrated based on the production function. After the
    economic model is constructed, the value of water for the products and the irrigation
    networks followed by the priority of each network is calculated based on the information
    on the base year. The MODSIM water resources model is then developed and the available
    water is allocated considering the priority of each network. The acreages under
    cultivation in the networks are then optimized by the PMP model by taking into
    consideration the water allocated to each network. The MODSIM model is implemented
    again and water is allocated to the new acreages. The final obtained results are
    used to calculate the economic, social, and water resources indicators. This process
    is implemented in the hydro-economic model for other years. The obtained results
    are utilized for training and validating the Bayesian Network and Random Forest
    models. Finally, the results for the Bayesian Networks and the Random Forest algorithm
    are compared and evaluated to investigate the capabilities of these models to
    substitute the hydro-economic model and serve as automated water allocation models.
    2.2 Positive Mathematical Programing Positive mathematical programming (PMP) is
    followed in three stages (Paris and Howitt 1998): 2.2.1 Specifying the Linear
    Programming Model in Order to Obtain Shadow Price of Production Resources Model
    Objective Function It is assumed that all the farmers intend to increase their
    gross profit in each crop year. Therefore, the basis of the analytic model in
    this research is the objective function is as follows. $$ \\mathit{\\operatorname{Max}}\\kern0.5em
    GM=\\sum \\limits_{i=1}^I{X}_i\\left({P}_i\\times {Y}_i-{CW}_i-{C}_i\\right) $$
    (1) In the above equation, gross margin (GM) represents the annual gross income
    resulting from the total irrigation farming activities, Xi is the area under cultivation
    of crop i in hectares, Pi is the price of crop i, Yi is the yield of crop i in
    kg/ha, CWi is the cost of water used per hectare under cultivation of crop i,
    and Ci is total production cost (such as labor, fertilizers and machinery) Constraint
    on labor force: This limitation indicates the labor force required for the agricultural
    activities in the region, and is expressed in the following equation: $$ \\sum
    \\limits_{i=1}^n{L}_i{X}_i\\le Tlabour $$ (2) In this equation, Li is the required
    labor force per hectare for producing crop i, Xi is the area under crop i cultivation,
    and Tlabour is the total number of the workers. Constraint on chemical fertilizers:
    this limitation, specified in eq. 3, states that the fertilizer source required
    in producing crop i should not exceed its present and available amount (TFertilizer).
    It is repeated for phosphate and urea fertilizers and for pesticides used in the
    region. $$ \\sum \\limits_{i=1}^n{F}_i{X}_i\\le TFertilizer $$ (3) In the above
    equation, Fi signifies the amount of fertilizer per hectare in producing crop
    i. Constraint on machinery: The various crops compete for machinery since agricultural
    activities require machinery to produce crops during planting, maintenance, and
    harvesting, and because these activities are concentrated over a specific period
    of time. Therefore, in the present research, limited access to machinery is considered
    in the model in the form of the following limitation: $$ \\sum \\limits_{i=1}^n{M}_i{X}_i\\le
    Tmachine $$ (4) In this equation, Mi is the required machine hours in producing
    crop i in each hectare and TMachine is the total machinery capacity in the region
    in hours. Constraint on Water Resources The present study assumes that the water
    required for agricultural activities is supplied from the reservoir outlet of
    the Zayandeh Rood Dam. Based on this, the limitations on water resources are presented
    in a general form in eq. 5: $$ \\sum \\limits_{i=1}^n\\sum \\limits_{\\mathrm{j}=1}^{12}{\\mathrm{WC}}_{\\mathrm{i}\\mathrm{j}}{\\mathrm{X}}_{\\mathrm{i}}\\le
    \\mathrm{SW} $$ (5) Where, WCij is the volume of water utilized to produce crop
    i in month j, Xi is the area under cultivation of crop i, and SW is the volume
    of surface water needed for agricultural activities in the study region during
    the year. This limitation shows that the total volume of water required for growing
    crop plants in the region is less than or equal to the volume of available surface
    water. Constraint on Calibration With the addition of calibration limitations
    to the set of the linear programming model, and by solving it, the shadow values
    related to the mentioned limitations will be determined. $$ \\sum \\limits_{\\mathrm{i}=1}^{\\mathrm{n}}{\\mathrm{X}}_{\\mathrm{i}}\\le
    {\\mathrm{X}}_{\\mathrm{i}}^0+\\upvarepsilon $$ (6) Where, \\( {\\mathrm{X}}_1^0
    \\) are the values for the base year and ε is the (n×1) matrix of small positive
    numbers for preventing linear dependence among structural limitations and calibration
    limitations. 2.2.2 Estimation of the Production Function Parameters In this step,
    the parameters of the production function will be estimated by using shadow prices
    of the resources and the calibration constraints which are derived from the previous
    phase. (Golan et al. 1997; Paris and Howitt 1998; Mittelhammer et al. 2002) In
    this study, the analytical approach with optimal economic conditions assumption
    is used to determine the parameters of production function (Eq. 7). Therefore,
    the optimal economic conditions are obtained by putting the final value of production
    at the expense of each resource unit. $$ {y}_i={A}_i{\\left(\\sum {C}_i{X}_i+{C}_w\\right)}^{\\raisebox{1ex}{${\\varepsilon}_i$}\\!\\left/
    \\!\\raisebox{-1ex}{$\\lambda $}\\right.} $$ (7) Ai represents the regional parameters
    share and Ci is the parameters of production function for all production resources
    except surface water, Cw is the volume of water utilized, λ is the shadow price
    variable associated with resource constraints and εi represents the returns to
    scale parameter. 2.2.3 Economic Model Simulation In order to simulate the existing
    agricultural conditions of the study region and achieve the optimum set of resources
    which maximizes gross income of the farmers, the nonlinear CES production function
    obtained in the previous step (Eq. 7) is placed instead of Yi in the initial linear
    objective function (Eq. 1). The nonlinear objective function is used in a nonlinear
    programming problem (without calibration limitations, but with other model constraints)
    as follows: $$ \\mathit{\\operatorname{Max}}\\ GM=\\sum \\limits_{i=1}^I{X}_i\\left({P}_i\\times
    \\left({A}_i{\\left(\\sum {C}_i{X}_i+{C}_w\\right)}^{\\raisebox{1ex}{${\\varepsilon}_i$}\\!\\left/
    \\!\\raisebox{-1ex}{$\\lambda $}\\right.}\\right)-{CW}_i-{C}_i\\right) $$ (8)
    To use the Eq. 5 at monthly step, the national water data document of the country
    has been used. By using of evapotranspiration values and effective rainfall in
    this document for each product (in NETWAT software), the amount of pure water
    allocated to product i in month m is \\( {X}_{isw_m}={Met}_{im}{X}_{isw} \\) and
    Also, the total amount of water used to produce the product i from surface water
    sources is equal to: $$ \\sum \\limits_i{X}_{isw_m}=\\sum \\limits_i{Met}_{im}\\times
    {a}_{isw}\\times {X}_{iland} $$ (9) In this equation Metim is percentage of water
    requirement of product i in month m and aisw is the annual amount of surface water
    used per hectare\\( \\left(\\raisebox{1ex}{${X}_{isw}$}\\!\\left/ \\!\\raisebox{-1ex}{${X}_{iland}$}\\right.\\right)
    \\). Equation 10, along with other economic model constraints, has been used to
    achieve the objectives of the research. It must be mentioned that information
    on the cultivars, prices of products and resources was provided by Organization
    of Agriculture of Esfahan Province. Also, the amount of water allocated to the
    regional farmers, the cost of water allocation and the status of irrigation networks,
    discharge network’s channels and etc. is collected through the Esfahan Regional
    Water Authority and related organizations. Information on crop production costs
    was obtained through questionnaire information (farmers’ and experts’ opinions)
    during the 2014–2015 crop year. Economic modelling has been done using GAMS (General
    Algebraic Modeling System) software. 2.3 MODSIM Simulation Model MODSIM has been
    designed as a decision support system for basin management and is employed as
    a computerized tool to develop and improve short-term water management strategies,
    long-term utilization planning and analyses related to water rights and inter-sectoral
    water conflicts (for drinking, industrial, agricultural, and environmental purposes)
    within river basins. MODSIM is able to model large-scale systems in basins by
    using a network flow optimization algorithm that minimizes costs. The MODSIM model
    simulates water allocation mechanisms in river basins by sequential solving the
    network flow optimization problem (Labadie 2006). 2.4 Bayesian Networks Graphical
    models are among the most common techniques for modeling uncertainty. With the
    help of probability theory, these models provide a method for coping with uncertainty
    and use graph theory to address complexity. Bayesian Networks are based on directed
    graphs, and hence, they are also called directed graphical models. In fact, a
    Bayesian Networks is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that can be defined as a number
    of nodes that represent a group of interacting random variables. Bayesian Networks,
    which have been developed based on conditional probabilities and on the Bayes’
    theorem, are graphical models for expressing probable relationship between variables
    (Eq. 10): $$ P\\left(A|B\\right)=\\frac{P\\left(B|A\\right)P(A)}{P(B)} $$ (10)
    Where P(A) is the probability of event A, P(B) is the probability of event B,
    P(B|A) the conditional probability of B given A, p (A|B) the conditional probability
    of A given B. A graphical Bayesian Networks is used to represent the simultaneous
    probability distribution of a set of variables. The knowledge gained for a problem
    is modeled as qualitative and quantitative information in this graph. This is
    performed by specifying a set of linearly independent vectors by graph arcs. If
    a node has one or more parents, it will have a CPT. 2 In the case of continuous
    variables, the CPTs display information on the mean and variance related to each
    node (variable). In the case of discontinuous (clustered) variables, the CPT table
    indicates the P value of each node (variable) belonging to various clusters. Various
    software and toolboxes are available to work with Bayesian Networks. In the present
    research, model training was performed by the Hugin 8.5 software together with
    the Necessary Path Condition (NPC) training structure at the 5 % confidence level.
    The parameters were also trained using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.
    2.5 Random Forest Algorithm Breiman (2001) introduced the Random Forest concept
    based on the theory of bagging. A decision making forest is a group of various
    trees that act in parallel. This algorithm uses decision trees for classification
    or regression. A decision tree is a recursive algorithm with a tree structure
    that, based on training data, starts to work in each stage by selecting one key
    characteristic. In this process, multiple decision trees are produced. Random
    operation in a Random Forest takes place in two ways. Random sampling, the same
    method that is used in bagging, is employed in one, and in the other, the eigenvector
    for training the tree is selected implicitly by using methods such as information
    coefficient or entropy (Quinlan 1986). The training for each tree in the Random
    Forest is modeled by h(x, Θk),  k = 1, 2, …  (Breiman 2001): Θk represents the
    vector for training parameters specifically used for tree k. In this method, each
    decision tree is created from a random vector. To investigate the output of a
    sample, it is given to each tree in the forest and each tree produces a vote for
    the incoming variable (sample) x. K stands for the number of trees. Prediction
    for a new sample is made by collecting the votes of all trees, and majority voting
    then takes place. If the desired output is Y, the Random Forest calculates \\(
    \\overline{Y} \\) by averaging the decision trees. Therefore, \\( \\overline{Y}
    \\) is equal to: $$ \\overline{Y}={avg}_kh\\left(x,{\\varTheta}_k\\right) $$ (11)
    This process can be explained in the following way: The Bi sample is created from
    the original one. This is done randomly and by inserting from the original data.
    The samples are randomly obtained from D that indicates the original data. The
    samples now form the training set, and the ti tree is created by applying a decision
    tree algorithm. For each tree node, the set of features or characteristics is
    limited to the set of k features. $$ \\left({X}_1,{X}_2,\\dots ..,{X}_k\\right)
    $$ The first step is repeated for i = 1, 2... n so that n number of ti trees are
    created. The votes (decisions) given by ti trees are collected and the new sample
    is classified using majority voting. In other words, the main process in a Random
    Forest is to first select Bi samples of the original training dataset D. This
    is carried out by using the bagging technique randomly. This Bi sample is then
    employed as input for the growth of each ti tree. Finally, the outputs of all
    of the trees are averaged considering their accuracies. T represents the final
    output (Han et al. 2013). The general structure of this classification in the
    Random Forest is presented in Fig. 2. The Python programming language was employed
    to use the Random Forest algorithm. Fig. 2 The general classification structure
    in the Random Forest algorithm Full size image 2.6 Evaluation Indicators for Hydro-Economic
    Modeling Each new allocation causes changes in the economic, social, and water
    resources situations. These changes are studied and evaluated using the economic
    productivity, employment, and reliability indicators. Economic productivity indicator:
    This indicator shows the annual economic productivity of each crop for every cubic
    meter of water. In other words, it expresses the annual profit made for every
    cubic meter of water: $$ {EI}_i=\\frac{1}{N}\\sum \\limits_{j=1}^N\\left(\\frac{NB_j}{W_j}\\right)
    $$ (12) $$ {EI}_T=\\frac{1}{M}\\sum \\limits_{i=1}^M\\left({EI}_i\\right) $$ (13)
    In this equation, n is the number of crops in each network, NB is the net profit
    (in IRR 10000) received from crop j, W is the volume of water (m3) used for crop
    j per hectare, and m represents the number of networks. Employment indicator:
    This indicator demonstrates the annual reduction in the number of workers caused
    by the reduction in the acreage under cultivation of each crop: $$ {SI}_i=\\frac{1}{N}\\sum
    \\limits_{j=1}^N\\left({CA}_j\\times {L}_j\\right) $$ (14) $$ {SI}_T=\\frac{1}{M}\\sum
    \\limits_{i=1}^M\\left({SI}_i\\right) $$ (15) In this equation, n is the number
    of crops in each network, CA is the reduction in the area under cultivation of
    crop j, L is the day-person of workers required for crop j per hectare, and m
    is the number of networks. Reliability indicator: Reliability is defined as the
    probability that the allocated water will meet the user’s demand (Hashimoto et
    al. 1982): $$ \\mathit{\\operatorname{Re}}=\\frac{1}{M}\\sum \\limits_{i=1}^M\\left(\\frac{N_s}{T}\\right)\\times
    100\\kern7.25em 0\\le \\mathit{\\operatorname{Re}}\\le 100\\% $$ (16) In this
    equation, m is the number of networks, Ns is the number of time steps during which
    the user’s water need is completely satisfied, and T is the total number of time
    steps in the simulation period (Mcmahon et al. 2006). In the present research,
    monthly time steps were employed and reliability indicator was calculated for
    each year. 2.7 Evaluation Criteria for BNs and RF Models The criteria used to
    evaluate and validate the models proposed for automated water allocation applied
    the predicted values and the observed values to show the accuracies of the models.
    Observed values refer to values calculated by the hydro-economic model and predicted
    values are the outputs of the Bayesian Networks and Random Forest models. These
    criteria include Coefficient of determination (R2), Mean Absolute Error (MAE),
    Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Nash-Sutcliffe (NS). 3 Results and Discussion
    3.1 The Study Region The case study consists of the water resources downstream
    of the Zayandeh Rood Dam. The Zayandeh Rood river basin is one of the most important
    basins in Iran due to the various activities and water uses, and also because
    of inter basin water transfer projects. It covers an area of about 26,000 ha,
    constituting a major part of the Gavkhouni Wetland. The Zayandeh Rood river has
    a vital role in supplying the drinking, industrial, and agricultural water of
    the central region in Iran. About five million residents in this region and also
    large industries depend on this river for water. Most importantly, this river
    provides the agricultural water for the irrigation plains. Water scarcity has
    become more severe in recent years with the population growth, industrial concentration,
    and increase in water uses on the one hand and water transfer to rural and urban
    population centers outside of the basin. Moreover, droughts in the region in general,
    and in recent years in particular, have influenced the water system with greater
    intensity. To achieve the objectives of the research, the agricultural areas in
    the study region receiving irrigation water from the Zayandeh Rood Dam were divided
    into six sub-areas: 1: the Sonati Network; 2: The Modern Mahyar and Jarghouyeh
    Network; 3: The Modern Left and Right Nekoabad Network; 4: The Modern Barkhar
    Network; 5: The Modern Left and Right Abshar Network; 6: The Northern and Southern
    Modern Rodasht Network (Fig. 3). This basin suffers from lack of a systematic
    mechanism for agricultural water allocation within the irrigation districts, since
    no economic orientation (e.g. water market) exists in the current water resources
    management in the basin. Fig. 3 Area under cultivation in the Irrigation Networks
    of the Zayandeh Rood river basin Full size image 3.2 Results of PMP After implementing
    the PMP model, the value of water for each crop (from the total volume of required
    water during the base water year 2014–2015) in each network is calculated. Results
    of the calculations regarding the values of water for the crops are presented
    in Table 1. Table 1 Priorities of the crops grown in the networks downstream of
    the Zayandeh Rood Dam considering the value of water in the base year 2014–2015
    Full size table Table 1 lists the crops grown in the networks in the order of
    their priorities with respect to the value of water for them. In the Nekoabad,
    Abshar, Mahyar, and Rodasht Networks, onion has the top priority, in these networks,
    barley, bean, wheat and bean products are the last priority. In the Barkhar Network,
    forage corn is the first priority and cantaloupe and honeydew the last. Rice enjoys
    the highest priority and watermelon (considering its value of water) the lowest
    in the Sonati network. Among all crops, onion is the most valuable with its value
    of water of 3710 (IRR/m3) in the Abshar Network, whereas the least valuable crop
    is watermelon with its value of water of 2487 (IRR/m3) in the Sonati Network.
    After the priority for each crop is determined for all the Networks, the priorities
    of the Networks are calculated by averaging the values of water for the crops
    in each one. Figure 4 presents the priority for each network based on its value
    of water and on the current allocation of water in the region. Fig. 4 The order
    of priorities in water allocation and economic value for the networks (2014–2015)
    Full size image As shown in Fig. 4, the Nekoabad Network enjoys the first priority
    (based on the current allocation) followed by Abshar, Barkhar, Mahyar, Rodasht,
    and Sonati Networks. In priorities based on the value of water in the Networks,
    the Nekoabad Network has the top priority because it has a higher value of water
    than the others. The other Networks, in the order of their priorities, are Barkhar,
    Mahyar, Sonati, Abshar, and Rodasht. The Abshar and Rodasht Networks have higher
    acreages under cultivation than the other Networks but, since crops grown in them
    have low values of water, they have lower values of water than the other Networks
    that have smaller acreages under cultivation. Moreover, the largest difference
    between the current water tariff 3 and the economic value of water (3229 IRR/m3)
    is that of the Barkhar Network followed by the Nekoabad, Mahyar, Sonati, Abshar,
    and Rodasht with 3224, 3187, 3036, 2877, and 2689 IRR/m3, respectively. Results
    obtained from the analysis of the data indicate that the economic value of water
    per cubic meter in all the networks is higher than the tariff paid by the farmers.
    Obviously, determination of the economic value of water can substantially affect
    water use management because the low price paid for this scarce source leads to
    its uncontrolled and wasteful use. 3.3 Results of MODSIM Model In addition to
    the irrigation Networks, priorities are given to drinking, industrial, and environmental
    water. After water is allocated for these uses, the remainder is utilized for
    the irrigation networks. Table 2 lists water needed for these purposes in the
    base year (2014–2015) and Table 3 the priorities in water allocation. The schematic
    diagram of the MODSIM model for the study region is also shown in Fig. 5. Table

    Table 4 lists changes in areas under cultivation downstream of the Zayandeh Rood
    Dam based on the priorities shown in Table 3: Table 4 Changes in areas under cultivation
    in irrigation networks downstream of the Zayandeh Rood Dam (2014–2015) Full size
    table The largest change in areas under cultivation (5.66%) happened in the Rodasht
    Network. It has the last priority based on the economic value of water and receives
    less water than the other Networks. That is why greater changes in acreages under
    cultivation happen in it. The Abshar, Sonati, Mahyar, Nekoabad, and Barkhar Networks
    experience 4.57, 0.89, 0.63, 0.5, and 0.28% reductions, respectively, in areas
    under cultivation. Considering water outflow from the Dam and the monthly water
    requirement of the crops in the Networks, the Barkhar Network experiences less
    reduction in areas under cultivation compared to the Nekoabad Network although
    it enjoys the second priority. This is because in some months when the crops in
    the Networks need water, the Dam may not have enough water to satisfy their needs,
    and the Networks with higher priorities may not receive the water they require.
    Taking the water allocated to the Networks into consideration, the total reduction
    in areas under crop cultivation is 2.7% (1665 ha). The scenario tested in this
    paper by the hydro-economic structure was the scenario of drought period. According
    to the Table 5, the gross profit from agricultural activity on the studied area
    in drought conditions and without using hydro-economic model, was obtained to
    be equal to 4,128,660,521,010 IRR. Whereas, in drought conditions, using the hydro
    economic model, the profit from agricultural activity in the study area was 4,500,726,845,580
    IRR. In other words, water allocation based on economic value of the water caused
    the profit of the agricultural activity to increase to 372,066,324,570 IRR. Table
    5 The results of using hydro-economic model Full size table Also, according to
    the table below, by consuming 1,384,882,000 m3 of water in the base year (2014–2015),
    a gross profit of 4,280,646,041,830 IRR is acquired. Whereas, by using hydro-economic
    model in drought conditions, despite using less water and cultivating a smaller
    land (634,643,332 m3 and 1850 ha, respectively), a higher gross profit compared
    to the base year is obtained which is equal to 220,080,803,750 IRR. 3.4 Result
    of Bayesian Network Various structures must be employed for training the allocation
    model in order to make the best use of the Bayesian method and obtain more accurate
    results. Different structures for training the allocation model were used and
    after many trials and errors, the best training model was selected based on the
    accuracies of the models and by using previous knowledge and utilizing the relationships
    between the data (Fig. 6). Fig. 6 The final structure of the Bayesian Network
    for water allocation model in Hugin 8.5 software Full size image Of the data related
    to 44 water years (from 1971 to 1972 to 2014–2015), 80% (the data for 35 years)
    was used for training the model and 20% (the data for 9 years) for validating
    it. Table 6 lists results concerning the accuracy of the predictions made by the
    final structure for the Bayesian model. Table 6 The evaluation criteria of the
    Bayesian Network automated water allocation model Full size table As stated in
    Section 2.6, the economic productivity index determines how much profit a product
    can obtain per year by using each cubic meters of water. Also, the employment
    index shows the level of workforce reduction per year by decreasing the cultivation
    area. Finally, the water resources index states the probability of meeting the
    needs of the consumer with the allocated water. Between the networks the largest
    amount of error (12 MCM) is that of the Abshar and the smallest that of the Mahyar
    Jarghouyeh Network. R2 indicates the accuracy in estimating water allocation for
    the irrigation networks and in estimating the economic, social, and water resources
    indicators. The highest correlation coefficient belongs to the Rodasht Network
    (0.962) and the lowest R2 to the Nekoabad Network (0.672). The average correlation
    coefficients for the economic, social and reliability indicators are 0.724, 0,624,
    and 0.739, respectively. Moreover, according to the values listed in Table 5,
    the Bayesian Networks model has yielded acceptable results in predicting water
    allocation, which suggests its high capacity for automated and intelligent annual
    water allocation. The diagrams derived from the results of estimation by the Bayesian
    Network model for each irrigation Network and each indicator is presented in Fig.
    7. These diagrams indicate that the closer the data is to the 45° line the higher
    the accuracy of the model in prediction is. It must be mentioned that reference
    allocation in the Figures below refers to allocation by the hydro-economic model.
    As results of the Bayesian Network in Fig. 7 show, this model has had good accuracy
    in automated water. Fig. 7 Comparison between the results obtained from the Bayesian
    Networks model and from the reference data Full size image 3.5 Results of the
    Random Forest The new Random Forest method was used to compare results and investigate
    the accuracy of the Bayesian Networks. The same data employed for training and
    validation of the Bayesian model was utilized for this model. The relevant results
    are presented in Table 7. Table 7 Evaluation indicators for automated water allocation
    using the Random Forest Full size table The correlation coefficients are the largest
    for the Rodasht Network (0.925) and the smallest for the Abshar Network (0.797).
    This coefficient is larger than 0.80 for all the Networks, which suggests that
    the model is highly accurate. The largest MAE in this method belongs to the Abshar
    Network with 14 million cubic meters per year and smallest to the Mahyar Jarghouyeh
    with 2 million cubic meters per year. As for the NS index, it can be realized
    that the model has performed well and yielded acceptable results. Figure 8 presents
    the diagram derived from the results of the prediction made by the Random Forest
    model for each network and for each indicator, which indicates the good accuracy
    of the model for automated water allocation. Fig. 8 Comparison between the results
    obtained from the Random Forest and from the reference data Full size image Comparison
    between the results of the Bayesian Networks and Random Forest models indicated
    that the MAPE averages for the networks were 15% for the Random Forest model and
    24% for the Bayesian model, and the mean correlation coefficients between the
    models were 0.861 for the Random Forest model and 0.738 for the Bayesian model.
    This coefficient was higher than 0.8 for the economic, social, and reliability
    indicators in the Random Forest model, but the correlation coefficients of these
    indicators were 0.724, 0.624, and 0.739, respectively, in the Bayesian model.
    All these results suggest that the Random Forest model is more accurate than the
    Bayesian model, since its learning is based on ensemble learning; such that the
    Random Forest itself includes several decision tree learning models and each of
    these sub-models learn different distributions depending on the sampling and placement
    of data. However, both models can substitute the complicated hydro-economic model
    for automated water allocation. 4 Conclusion Water is the most important limiting
    factor in agricultural economy development. Therefore, this study attempted to
    use a hydro-economic model to analyze agricultural water allocation based on the
    economic value of water and to use the output of this model for training two intelligent
    models (Bayesian Networks and Random Forest) that could replace the hydro-economic
    model as automated water allocation models for six irrigation networks in Zayandeh
    Rood basin in Iran. The available data was firstly used to develop the PMP economic
    model and obtain the value of water for each crop. The priority of each network
    was determined by weighted averaging of the values of water for the crops. Based
    on the economic values of the irrigation networks, the Nekoabad Network had the
    top priority followed by the Barkhar, Mahyar Jarghouyeh, Sonati, Abshar, and Rodasht
    Networks. Water allocation based on the hydro-economic model causes the allocation
    to each irrigation network and the products found in their cultivation pattern
    to be performed according the product’s price, product’s performance, final water
    productivity, the farmer’s experience in producing a product, etc. The result
    of using the mentioned structure is the optimum water allocation and increase
    of the farmers’ profit in the considered study domain. After water allocation
    using the MODSIM model, the economic, social, and water resources indicators were
    calculated for each crop by taking into consideration the water allocated to each
    one. Results obtained from optimal allocation of water for 44 years were used
    as training data for the Bayesian networks. Finally, the new Random Forest method
    was employed for comparison with the Bayesian Network and for its further investigation.
    The results of the Random Forest algorithm also indicated its high accuracy for
    allocating water to the networks and in evaluating the indicators, in comparison
    with Bayesian Network. Also in researches done by Chen et al. (2012), Shortridge
    et al. (2016) and Li et al. (2017), random forest algorithm performed consistently
    better than the other models. Furthermore, in this research due to the economic
    value of water, water has been allocated considering the priority of each network
    thus these networks had a better water provision, farmers’ profits, and economic
    productivity than current allocation, although the employment declines due to
    the reduction in areas under cultivation. These results are consistent with researches
    carried out by He et al. (2006), Varela-Ortega et al. (2011) and Hashemy Shahdany
    et al. (2017). The obtained results of this study provides a reliable, systematic
    and realistic agricultural water allocation in Zayandeh Rood river basin considering
    economic perspectives. The proposed framework in this paper with slight changes,
    can be used in other regions to study the policies and management of basins. Notes

  key_findings: The Nekoabad Network had the highest priority for water allocation
    based on economic value, followed by Barkhar, Mahyar, Sonati, Abshar, and Rodasht
    Networks. The Bayesian Network and Random Forest models demonstrated high accuracy
    in automating water allocation and predicting economic, social, and water resources
    indicators.
  limitations: This study relies on data from a specific region (Zayandeh Rood River
    Basin in Iran) and a limited time period (44 water years). The transferability
    and generalizability of the findings to other regions or longer timeframes may
    require further investigation.
  main_objective: To develop an integrated hydro-economic model for allocating agricultural
    water based on its economic value and to explore the potential of Bayesian Networks
    and Random Forest algorithms for automating the allocation process.
  relevance_evaluation: The paper is highly relevant to the point being made, as it
    directly addresses the need for robust and reliable strategies to ensure resilience
    and reliability in the face of failures, disruptions, or unexpected events within
    automated irrigation systems. The authors propose a hydro-economic model that
    integrates optimization, water availability constraints, and economic factors
    to allocate water resources in a way that maximizes economic value and minimizes
    negative impacts on employment, productivity, and reliability. This approach is
    particularly valuable in semi-arid and arid regions like Iran, where water scarcity
    and competition for resources are significant challenges.

  description: Managing soil moisture is crucial for optimizing crop growth and yield
    in agriculture. With the advancements in Internet of Things (IoT) technology,
    innovative soil moisture monitoring and control solutions have emerged. This paper
    presents a pioneering IoT -based soil moisture management system tailored for
    precision agriculture within Siksha 'O' Anusandhan (SOA) University. The system
    utilizes sensor nodes, wireless communication, and cloud computing to enable real-time
    monitoring and automated irrigation control, addressing the limitations of conventional
    manual approaches. Providing continuous, remote, and precise measurements of soil
    moisture levels revolutionizes how soil moisture is managed within the university's
    agricultural practices. Low-cost sensor nodes are strategically placed throughout
    the fields to collect data, which is wirelessly transmitted to a central hub for
    analysis and decision-making. A cloud-based platform processes the data, generating
    actionable insights and triggering automated irrigation when necessary. Extensive
    testing and validation demonstrate the system's reliability and ability to improve
    water use efficiency, surpassing traditional methods. Furthermore, the IoT architecture
    of the system offers scalability and flexibility, making it adaptable to different
    crop types and field conditions present within SOA University. This innovative
    research contributes to the field of precision agriculture by providing an efficient
    and tailored solution for soil moisture management within the university's agricultural

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Trichy, India SECTION I. Introduction Water
    is a basic necessity for all the life forms on Earth [1], [2]. It is well known
    that water is the main reason behind Earth being the only living planet. It is
    impossible for any living being to live without water [3], [4]. Without water,
    a plant cannot perform its essential photosynthesis. It is understandable that
    if the problem of water scarcity continues to increase, it will remove the greenery
    in the future. As a result of which, there will be less rainfall. Water is also
    essential for agricultural production and food security [5]–[7]. Technology has
    always served to overcome such problems and to make lives easy with its innovations.
    Here through this study one such solution is introduced, named ‘lOT based Soil
    Management System,’ a model for controlling irrigation that uses IoTto sense soil
    moisture with temperature and humidity of the surroundings with a microcontroller
    to make an intelligent irrigation system to help millions of farmers and University
    gardeners [8], [9]. Soil moisture is critical to plant growth, and maintaining
    the right amount of moisture can help plants grow faster and produce better yields.
    An efficient soil moisture management system can help conserve water by reducing
    the water needed for irrigation [10], [11]. A soil moisture management system
    can help reduce water usage and lead to cost savings of water bills and other
    expenses. By managing soil moisture levels, it helps to maintain soil health and
    reduce erosion, which is essential for sustainable agriculture [12]–[14]. Farmers
    and growers can proactively avoid drought conditions and other weather-related
    risks that can harm crops by monitoring soil moisture levels [15]–[17]. To evaluate
    the link between soil moisture readings acquired from soil moisture sensors and
    the gravimetric approach, a study was conducted at the Water Technology Centre
    farm (WTC) at Hyderabad based college [18]. In 2021, Fengfei et al.''s Portable
    PHS Method for Moisture in the Soil Monitoring Based on Thermal Effect is implemented.
    The results were compared to those obtained using the drying procedure, confirming
    the practicality of the suggested method [19]. In 2019, G. S. Swileam et al. assessed
    soil heterogeneity utilising electrical resistance for typical alluvial soils
    in Egypt [20]. In 2018 smith et aI., proposed a system for efficiently maintaining
    optimal soil moisture levels for crops using various traditional soil management
    systems [21]. Gupta et al. (2020) analyze whether rooftop harvesting of rainwater
    and outline bunding enhances the moisture in the soil. Their effects on yields
    of crops, availability of water, and soil moisture management are examined [22].
    Contour plowing, terracing, and checking dams in arid environments are the main
    focus of this study by Patel et al. It assesses their ability to reduce soil moisture
    evaporation and increase water retention [23]. To measure the soil moisture content,
    humidity, and temperature using Raspberry Pi Pico and other sensors to minimize
    the over-watering and under-watering of plants. This paper deals with multiple
    sensors/modules and Raspberry Pi Pico to measure the current readings of the soil
    & surrounding of the University plants, analyze them, display the measurements
    on the webpage, and automatically water the plants when required by connecting
    them to a water pump. IoT-based soil management systems can collect real-time
    data on soil moisture levels, weather conditions, and other relevant factors.
    This enables farmers and growers of the university to make data-driven decisions
    and respond quickly to changes in soil moisture levels. Farmers and growers can
    remotely monitor soil moisture levels and other factors with this system. This
    can save time and reduce the need for manual labor in the field. The curated system
    can automate the irrigation process based on soil moisture levels and other data.
    Intelligent systems can help reduce water waste and improve crop yields. IoT -based
    soil management systems can be easily scaled to accommodate more significant areas
    of farmland or garden spaces in universities. These innovative systems are also
    suitable for large-scale agricultural operations and smaller-scale applications.
    SECTION II. Proposed Work This IoT -based system deals with multiple sensors/modules
    and Raspberry Pi Pico to measure the current readings of the soil & surroundings,
    analyze them, display the measurements on the website, and automatically water
    the plants when required by connecting to a water pump. The system uses micro
    python to interface the sensors and modules with the microcontroller Raspberry
    Pi Pico. This project deals with the automatic watering of plants whenever the
    moisture, humidity, and temperature level decreases to a specific standard limit.
    The working of proposed model consists of a soil moisture sensor and a temperature
    humidity sensor, which tracks the soil moisture along with the humidity and temperature
    of the surroundings. When the measurements exceed the required standard readings,
    the relay directs the motor to pump water to plants. This model will benefit people
    with large patches of gardens, Universities, or those farther from their places.
    The proposed system has advantages in reducing costs, restricting water waste,
    and minimizing physical interference. It also promotes irrigation that requires
    little maintenance and is environmentally friendly. In order to regulate the water
    flow, a relay module has been installed. The model shows expected impacts at various
    levels of humidity and temperature. Figure 1 shows the proposed model of our IoT
    -based system. Fig. 1: Proposed IoT-based system for Soil Moisture management
    system Show All SECTION III. Methedologies Used The Soil Moisture Sensor yields
    real-time data in the form of an analog. Analog to Digital (A/D) and data conditions
    are converted using Raspberry Pi Pico Microcontroller. The Microcontroller is
    used to acquire real-time soil moisture using a soil moisture sensor. The Thonny
    Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a cross-platform application that
    supports high-level programming languages like Python. The IDE makes writing code
    and uploading the source program to the board easy. It contains libraries and
    cores. The samples are measured from low to High moisture contents of the soil.
    The gardener can get the processed data through the webpage with the help of Wireless
    Fidelity (Wi-Fi) Technology. This system can give real-time data on soil moisture.
    The Soil moisture system is connected to the web page. We have interfaced the
    soil moisture sensor, DHTII Module, and relay with a Raspberry Pi Pico to measure
    the volumetric concentration of water inside the soil and the humidity and temperature
    of the surroundings. This system uses Raspberry Pi Pico as a microcontroller,
    which is then connected to the Moisture Sensor, which measures the soil''s moisture
    content. Raspberry Pi Pico acts as the central brain of the IoT-based soil moisture
    management system, responsible for data collection, processing, analysis, communication,
    and automated control. It is also linked to DHT -11, the Temperature and Humidity
    sensor, which measures the ambient temperature and humidity. The Pico is also
    connected to the Wi-Fi module ESP-Ol, bridging the divide between the hardware
    and software components of the system shown in fig. 2. The measurements of the
    above sensors and modules and the standard measurements will subsequently be displayed
    for users on our self-designed website using the ESP-Ol. Fig. 2. Schematic Layout
    of our Proposed System Show All SECTION IV. Experimentation & Model Evaluation
    The proposed intelligent system captures data in real-time using a range of sensors
    and modules shown in fig. 5. University gardeners use these sensors to assess
    soil and environmental conditions. The soil management system we built is responsible
    for several duties. It begins by measuring the soil moisture content using a capacitive
    soil moisture sensor and then monitors the humidity and temperature of the surrounding
    environment with a DHTII Module. All plants have a threshold value set to standard
    soil moisture content for home/university gardeners. When the moisture level falls
    below the set standard/threshold level, the relay module turns the Motor On and
    begins pumping water to the plants from the tank until the moisture level returns
    to the desired level. The measurements mentioned above’ readings will be shown
    on a website built with the ESP-OI, which we designed with HTML and CSS and coded
    in Python. Fig. 3 shows the hardware connection of sensors/modules to Raspberry
    Pico and figure 4 depicts the Circuit diagram of the connection of all the sensors,
    modules, and motors. Fig. 3. Hardware connection of sensors/modules to Pico Show

    model of our proposed System Show All SECTION V. Result Analysis & Validation
    The analysis of the results demonstrates the efficacy of IoT-based watering systems
    in sustaining optimal soil moisture levels for plant growth in the university.
    These systems provide optimal irrigation, water conservation, improved plant health
    and growth, resource efficiency, data-driven insights, remote monitoring and control,
    and flexibility. Using IoT technology, plant owners, farmers, and gardeners can
    achieve precise and effective watering techniques, resulting in healthier and
    more robust plants. The moisture reading experiments conducted at our University
    on different plants and shrubs can provide valuable insights into plant water
    requirements and watering patterns shown in fig. 6. Fig. 6. Soil moisture reading
    experimentation done at our University''s Plants & Shrubs Show All The collected
    data on moisture readings from the different plants and shrubs helps in understanding
    their specific water requirements and watering patterns. This IoT-based system
    enables informed decision-making regarding irrigation scheduling, optimization
    of water management practices, and adjustment of watering parameters based on
    the specific needs of each plant species. The model then starts measuring and
    taking the readings displayed on the Thonny Shell shown in fig. 7. Table I shows
    the soil moisture readings from the capacitive soil moisture sensor & level of
    accuracy of the sensor when compared to the recommended moisture level. Fig. 8
    depicts the soil moisture level and the recommended moisture needed for the plants.
    The relationship between soil moisture levels and the recommended moisture level
    for plants is graphically represented in Figure 8. Individuals can make informed
    decisions to promote healthy plant growth, conserve water, and preserve natural
    and agricultural ecosystems by comprehending this relationship. Gardeners can
    decide when and how much to water their plants by monitoring soil moisture and
    using the specified range. Avoiding under watering and overwatering optimizes
    plant growth and conserves water. Water management influences the ecological balance
    and is essential for plant and animal survival. Fig. 9, the online snapshot showing
    the moisture reading, promotes transparency, engagement, and accessibility, enhancing
    your research''s effect. It supports the study''s findings and contributes to
    broader educational and practical applications, promoting sustainable water management
    and nurturing collaboration within the scientific community. Fig. 7:. Thonny Shell

    processingArduinoRaspberry Pi Introduction Plant breeding promotes the development
    of new cultivars for sustainable agriculture and requires measurement of phenotypic
    responses developed from the interaction of genotypes with the environment. High-throughput
    phenotyping (HTP) equipped with novel sensing and analytical capabilities is essential
    to improve genetic modeling and thus expedites the identification of germplasm
    that increases the crop productivity. HTP systems have been used in plant phenotyping
    to identify crop responses to abiotic stress and to discover novel traits related
    to tolerance [1,2]. Image-based phenotyping became a promising HTP tool because
    of the improvement in handling large numbers of images. Multispectral cameras
    have been widely used for plant phenotyping [[3], [4], [5]]. Various image processing
    pipelines were developed to assess plant vigor by NDVI [6], growth rate by measuring
    leaf area [7], and shoot phenotypes by image classification [8]. HTPheno software
    [9] was reported to automate image analysis of a single barley plant at a time.
    An ideal image analytic toolbox is to process multiple plants through the automated
    image processing. Canopy temperature was used for plant stress detection [[10],
    [11], [12]] and phenotyping [[13], [14], [15]] using infrared (IR) thermometers.
    Plant height has been measured for plant phenotyping by Light Detection and Ranging
    (LiDAR) [[16], [17], [18], [19]] or ultrasonic sensors [13,15]. Microcontroller-based
    systems are low-cost, highly configurable computing devices that have transformed
    the field of agricultural research. Arduino is an open-source electronics consisting
    of microcontroller hardware and Arduino software for programming and has been
    identified as a viable alternative for commercial instrumentation in scientific
    research [20]. The wide variety of inexpensive hardware and availability of open-source
    code libraries make Arduino the best choice for data loggers [21]. The plug-and-play
    nature of Arduino devices has attracted researchers for power-efficient systems
    [22] such as plant growers [23], environmental monitoring [24], and harvest management
    [25]. Prior applications of Arduino on water management include water conservation
    [26], water quality [27], irrigation [[28], [29], [30]], and water intake [31].
    Most applications focus on irrigation control from soil water feedback [[32],
    [33], [34]] or plant sensing [[35], [36], [37]]. Breeding research increased the
    need to support both plant phenotyping and percipient irrigation for effective
    plant monitoring under the water stress maintained by an irrigation controller.
    Raspberry Pi (RPi) is a compact single-board computer created for the development
    of a small and affordable computing platform for education [38]. Open-source software
    such as Python provides a flexible design of open-source systems and allows users
    to address specific needs in agronomic and environmental monitoring. A growing
    population of researchers use RPi computers for a wide range of applications:
    autonomous farming machines [39], pest detection in livestock feed storage [40],
    and plant phenotyping [41,42]. Arduinos along with the Raspberry Pi (RPi) pack
    considerable power on their diminutive boards, making them ideal for integration
    into scientific sensors and providing tremendous opportunities for automation,
    networking, and data collection and analysis [22]. This inexpensive open-source
    protocol increased the possibilities of design and resources available for troubleshooting.
    Although many applications of this protocol were reported, there are only a few
    applied on plant phenotyping [1,2]. Details of sensor integration, power management,
    and sensor calibration are not sufficiently provided. This research aims to develop
    a cost-effective HTP system to measure plant responses under abiotic stress using
    open-source electronics associated with sensor integration, calibration, and power
    management. Specific objectives are to (1) build a portable HTP system using Arduino-RPi
    protocol and image analytics for remote monitoring of plant phenotypes, (2) add
    an irrigation controller to the system to support water management for drought
    study, and (3) apply the system on camelina plants in growth chambers to identify
    phenotypic responses to heat and drought stress. Materials and methods In order
    to support plant phenotyping and automated irrigation, a cost-effective reliable
    solution was considered for end-users to enable them to afford sensing systems
    and expand their applications. A portable wireless HTP system was designed to
    offer quick installation and easy modification and was developed using Arduino
    Uno (DFR0216, DFRobot, China) and RPi (3B+, Raspberry Pi Foundation, UK). An irrigation
    controller was needed to automate water management for drought study and was integrated
    with the HTP system. The system was applied on camelina plants in growth chambers
    to characterize agronomic traits conditioning abiotic stress tolerance. Sensing
    system Plant phenotyping Metrics for plant phenotyping included canopy temperature,
    plant height, and vegetation indexes measured by infrared (IR) thermometers (SEN0206,
    DFRobot, China), mini LiDAR sensors (SEN0259, DFRobot, China), and multispectral
    cameras (Survey3W, MAPIR, San Diego, CA, USA), respectively. The IR thermometer
    measures the surface temperature by detecting IR radiation energy and wavelength
    distribution through an amplifier with 17-bit ADC. The sensor has a 35° field
    of view (FOV) with 0.01 °C precision and ±0.5 °C accuracy and is connected through
    inter-integrated circuit (I2C) to the microcontroller. An I2C multiplexer (DFR0576,
    DFRobot, China) was used to solve the address conflict of multiple IR thermometers
    on a single I2C port by providing addresses from 0x70 to 0x77. The LiDAR sensor
    is an unidirectional laser range finder based on time-of-flight (ToF) technology
    and measures the distance in the range of 0.3–12 m at 2° FOV in 100 Hz with 1-mm
    resolution and ±6 cm accuracy. The sensor is interfaced through a universal asynchronous
    receiver\\transmitter (UART). In order to connect multiple LiDAR sensors on one
    UART port in the microcontroller, software serial was used through digital ports
    such that Rx (receiver) and Tx (transmitter) wires were defined in SoftwareSerial
    function in the Arduino program. The LiDAR sensor ran at higher amperage than
    the maximum current provided from the microcontroller, and thus an external power
    source was required to achieve stable operation of the LiDAR sensor. A temperature\\relative
    humidity (T\\RH) sensor (DHT22, DFRobot, China) was used to monitor the temperature
    and humidity in the chamber. The sensor delivers digital output of the temperature
    with 0.1 °C precision and ±0.5 °C accuracy and humidity with 0.1% resolution and
    ±2% accuracy. It is connected through a standard single-bus digital interface.
    An LCD screen (DFR0063, DFRobot, China) was added to the microcontroller through
    the I2C multiplexer to display T\\RH with a time stamp. A multispectral (Red,
    Green, and Near-infrared) camera was attached in nadir view to monitor the plant
    vegetation index (VI) and leaf area index (LAI) and triggered by a pulse-width
    modulation (PWM) signal from the microcontroller. Image analytics The images captured
    by the multispectral camera were processed through a series of steps as shown
    in Fig. 1. The raw image is acquired in 3-band (3b) false color in the order of
    red (R), green (G), and near-infrared (N) with 4000 × 3000 resolution and 16-bit
    depth. They were preprocessed for conversion from raw to tif format and radiometric
    calibration to deliver canopy reflectance with a reflectance target board provided
    by the camera manufacturer. An image processing pipeline was developed for HTP
    through thresholding, filtering, masking, segmentation, and gridding (Fig. 1).
    A normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) image was converted from the 16-bit
    RGN image using a band math of (N - R) / (N + R) and automatically segmented by
    using Otsu [43] algorithm and filtered through the opening operation. Once the
    NDVI is masked to exclude non-vegetation background pixels, A 2 × 7 grid was applied
    on the masked NDVI to create 14 regions of interest (ROI), where seven columns
    were evenly spaced to fit three pots on each side and a dummy column in the middle
    to isolate non-vegetation pixels (Fig. 1). Three ROIs on each side were grouped
    to extract individual metrics of four experimental groups in each chamber. Canopy
    coverage was calculated from the masked NDVI image as a percentage of vegetation
    pixels to the combined area of three ROIs. A Python script was coded for a batch
    process to implement a series of image processing algorithm and export into a
    comma delimited file phenotypic metrics, i.e., vegetation index and canopy coverage.

    the raw image is processed and extracted for phenotypic metrics through calibration,
    thresholding, filtering, masking, segmentation, and gridding. The lower part illustrates
    a sequence of the images processed. Microcontroller The Arduino is a standardized
    rapid prototyping platform using the ATmega328 microcontroller [44] and was selected
    based on its inexpensive and customizable advantages with a wide range of sensors
    and actuators which are easily setup with sample codes and wire diagrams provided
    by manufacturer. The microcontroller has four main types of sensor interface:
    Analog\\Digital inputs, I2C, serial peripheral interface (SPI), and UART. I2C
    is the most common interface that uses 2-wire bus from a master to many slaves
    in 400 kHz: ‘SDA’ (serial data) for bidirectional data transmission and ‘SCL’
    (serial clock) for synchronizing the data transfer. SPI is used for fast, full-duplex
    sync serial data link. UART is a serial data transfer and has two ways to implement:
    software serial and hardware serial. The software serial reads only a single data
    entry at a time, whereas hardware serial can read data simultaneously using ‘Rx’
    (receiver) and ‘Tx’ (transmitter) pins. Arduino Uno provides six multiplexed analog
    input pins, 14 digital input\\output (DIO) of which six provide pulse-width modulation
    (PWM) output, one I2C, one SPI, and one UART. The analog input pins support 10-bit
    analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) using analogRead function. Most of the analog
    inputs can also be used as digital pins: analog input 0 as digital pin 14 through
    analog input 5 as digital pin 19 [45]. All sensors and actuators were connected
    to the microcontroller that was placed in a waterproof enclosure box (1020, Pelican,
    Torrance, CA, USA) including a relay shield mounted on the microcontroller. Arduino
    Shields were added as pin layout that makes wire connection efficient without
    soldering and thus saves time and cost for projects. The enclosure box was modified
    to feed cables through three holes: a USB cable from the RPi, wires from the four
    water pumps, and wires from all other sensors. The box allowed all wires to remain
    intact and undamaged inside the box during the experiment and the flexibility
    to rewire in hardware update and troubleshooting wire connectivity. Single-board
    computer The RPi is low cost and low power consumption with light weight but still
    offers a powerful computing and a full peripheral interface of a computer. The
    RPi 3B+ contains 1.4 GHz quad-core ARM processor with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, HDMI,
    and four USB ports. The RPi was enclosed in a protective box. Table 1 shows a
    complete list of all electronic components of the sensing system with total cost
    of USD 874 and total weight of 1.7 kg. A flowchart of Python code operating RPi
    is illustrated in Fig. 2. For the convenience of debugging, a serial port is opened
    for either an RPi or a personal computer (PC). After first 10 dummy iterations
    to avoid broken characters that were observed at the beginning of serial connection,
    input strings from Arduino were validated by the length of characters before saving
    them into a file Table 1. Electronic components of the sensing system used in

    Fig. 2. Flowchart of Python code in RPi in a sequence of opening a serial port
    for either RPi or PC, reading strings from Arduino after first 10 dummy iterations,
    validating the input strings by a string length, and saving them to an output
    file. Wireless communication The RPi was programmed by a Python script to read
    a serial data from the Arduino through a USB connection at 115,200 baud rate and
    store data strings to a file with time stamps. Real-time status of all sensory
    data was also displayed by the script on the RPi terminal and accessed wirelessly
    from a remote computer or a smartphone through Wi-Fi connection. Wi-Fi was selected
    for wireless data communication, because it is a built-in feature in RPi and can
    easily connect to the internet cloud that allows the user to remotely access to
    data stored in the RPi. The RPi was configured for Wi-Fi by enabling Secure Shell
    (SSH) and Virtual Network Computing (VNC) interfaces. When the RPi is connected
    to Wi-Fi through an access point (AP), network IP address is assigned to the RPi
    and used to remotely connect to the RPi using PuTTY via SSH for terminal access
    or VNC Viewer for remote desktop access. When the RPi is connected to a hidden
    network, wpa_supplicant.conf must be created in the RPi directory of etc/wpa_supplicant
    to assign network ID and user account credential. RPi 3B+ with Debian Stretch
    operation system (OS) was used for a stable Wi-Fi connection, as RPi 4 with Debian
    Buster OS was found unstable in connecting to a hidden network. The RPi configuration
    was updated to automatically run a Python script (e.g., autowater.py) that starts
    reading data from the Arduino when the RPi is powered on by adding codes (Fig.
    3) at the end of the file ‘∼/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart’ for automatically
    opening a terminal at reboot and adding ‘python autowater.py’ at the end of the
    file ’.bashrc’. Download : Download high-res image (38KB) Download : Download

    management The characterization of agronomic traits resistant to drought stress
    requires a system to support both plant phenotyping and water management. The
    HTP system was extended to include soil water monitoring and irrigation control
    for effective monitoring of plant responses to water stress in a controlled environment.
    Growth chambers were used for the experiment to provide arid (heat and drought)
    conditions for the plant. Fig. 4 illustrates a schematic diagram of the automated
    irrigation and phenotyping system in a chamber. Download : Download high-res image

    right were the drought and control group, respectively. Lines of information flow
    and interface types are drawn and described in the right top inset. Drought condition
    was generated by separating water treatments from water pumps (FIT0200, DFRobot,
    China) to plants based on soil status readings from soil moisture sensors (SEN0193,
    DFRobot, China). The water pump was equipped with a capacity of 280–500 L/h and
    powered by 6–18 DCV rated at 64–500 mA. A relay (DFR0144, DFRobot, China) was
    added to operate four water pumps. Each water pump supplied water to three replicated
    pots through an irrigation dripper (Fig. 4). A vinyl-flex PVC tube was used for
    irrigation from the water pumps to pots. A 13-L water bucket was placed in the
    chamber as a water reservoir for 12 pots and was refilled weekly. To automate
    water management, soil moisture sensors were deployed to control amount of irrigation
    based on soil water status. Four soil moisture sensors were used in each chamber
    by installing a sensor on each pot in four observation groups and inserted vertically
    at 7.2-cm soil depth. Four water pumps were paired with four soil sensors to control
    each pump individually based on corresponding soil moisture reading. The closed-loop
    irrigation was scheduled every 6 h to maintain two soil conditions (drought and
    control) by checking soil sensors and triggering the water pumps. Sensor installation
    Two adjustable rods were mounted 131 cm above the floor in parallel between side
    walls of the growth chamber to hold four IR thermometers and two LiDAR sensors
    (Fig. 5). Two LiDAR sensors aimed two pots next to the water bucket: one in the
    control group and the other in the drought group, whereas four IR thermometers
    aimed at four pots located around the bucket. Another rod was mounted 140 cm above
    the floor to hold the multispectral camera. All sensors and the camera were angled
    perpendicular to the ground. Two horizontal metal plates were mounted to a vertical
    rack on the rear wall and used to hold the microcontroller, RPi, and T\\RH sensor
    at the lower plate and the LCD screen at the upper plate. Download : Download

    moisture sensors were installed in the soil of four pots next to the water bucket
    where the water pumps were immersed in the water. Power management Power management
    is important to ensure stable operations of all sensors and actuators, the microcontroller
    (Arduino), and the RPi and must be determined by understanding the power consumption
    of each module and optimizing the wiring configurations. The RPi is powered by
    5 DCV rated at 2.5 A and typically requires 500–700 mA [38]. The USB peripheral
    of RPi 3B+ model draws maximum current of 1.2 A and typical active current of
    500 mA [46]. The Arduino is powered by 5 DCV via USB connection or 7–12 DCV power
    adapter. Maximum DC current provided by the Arduino is 40 mA per DIO pin [45],
    which suffices for most sensors, whereas some sensors or actuators use higher
    current and voltage and thus require power management rewired from an external
    power source. For seamless power management, each sensor was troubleshooted and
    calculated for power consumptions (Table 2). In the sensing system, the LiDAR
    sensor and the water pump draw 120 mA and 500 mA current, respectively, that reaches
    above the maximum current of 40 mA supplied from the microcontroller and can cause
    unstable power supply with the multiple connections. An external power source
    was supplied to LiDAR sensors from a 5 DCV 1A power adapter through an external
    power terminal of the microcontroller. Another external power source was provided
    to the water pump from a 7.5 DCV 2A power adapter through the relay sockets. The
    use of the relay sockets and external power supply allows multiple water pumps
    and LiDAR sensors to work flawlessly without power demand from the microcontroller.
    Though the sensing system was powered by two DC adapters, it can be easily converted
    to a standalone system for outdoor use by using a solar rechargeable battery pack
    (Q90–5, Kenruipu, China) that provides 25 Ah with three ports (two 5 V 2A ports
    and one 5 V 1A port) shown in Table 2. Table 2. Power management of each module
    and external power. Experimental design An experiment was conducted in a controlled
    environment to identify plant responses to abiotic stress (heat and drought) using
    the HTP system while automating irrigation for drought environment. Two camelina
    genotypes (CAM212 and Giessen#4) were grown in two growth chambers located in
    U.S. Arid-Land Agricultural Research Center in Maricopa, AZ, USA, where the average
    daily temperature measures up to 37 °C in the range of 31 °C to 43 °C during the
    growing season. The chambers were equipped with temperature, humidity, and light
    control. The chamber temperature was set at 25 °C in chamber 1 for control and
    35 °C in chamber 2 for heat-stressed environment. Drought environment was generated
    by controlling water treatments with 40% and 90% water holding capacity for drought
    and control plants, respectively. Thus, combined interactions to be observed are
    four treatment groups: control, heat (H), drought (D), and heat-drought (HD) (Fig.
    6(a)). With three replications of two genotypic varieties of camelina at each
    group, total 24 plants were cultivated in pots and split to 12 pots to each chamber
    as shown in Fig. 6(b). All sensors and controllers were installed identically
    in both growth chambers. Data were collected for 34 days from December 12, 2019
    to January 14, 2020 and recorded every four seconds generating 21,600 strings
    per day that were downsized in post processing to the averaged data per 10 min
    for further analysis. Multispectral images were captured every 10 min for 10 h
    (7am - 5pm) during the lights on in the chambers. Download : Download high-res

    °C and heat stress at 35 °C) with two water treatments (drought stress and control
    with 40% and 90% water holding capacity, respectively) for two genotypic varieties
    (var. 1 and var. 2) of camelina with three replications at each group to identify
    plant phenotypic responses to abiotic stress. Sensor calibration Sensor calibrations
    were performed to obtain the unbiased data from the measurements of the soil moisture
    sensors, water pump, IR thermometers, and LiDAR sensors. Each sensor is pre-calibrated
    by the manufacturer, but sensitivity errors between sensors remain. Sensor calibration
    minimizes differences among sensors and ensures sensors for consistent accuracy.
    Soil moisture sensor and water pump The output value of the soil moisture sensor
    (SEN0193, DFRobot, China) is from 0 to 1023 through a 10-bit ADC and affected
    by probe insertion depth and how tightly the soil is packed around the sensor.
    Calibration was conducted for each soil sensor by reading digital values from
    dry to soaked soil in a pot with plants, and the maximum and minimum values were
    reversely mapped to 0–100% water holding capacity. Table 3 shows the calibration
    values obtained for eight soil sensors in two chambers, where digital numbers
    in ‘Min’ and ‘Max’ of each sensor were obtained from soaked and dry soil, respectively.
    For instance of sensor 1 in chamber 1, 244 is the minimum value obtained when
    the soil in the pot is soaked indicating 100% soil moisture, whereas 430 is the
    maximum value obtained when the soil is dry indicating 0% soil moisture. The percentage
    soil moisture values were used to calculate the amount of water treatment, i.e.,
    time to turn the water pump on to supply plant-specific irrigation. Table 3. Calibration
    values of four soil moisture sensors in each growth chamber measured in digital
    readings of Min (soaked soil) and Max (dry soil) that are reversely mapped to
    0–100% soil moisture. Chamber Digital readings Sensor 1 Sensor 2 Sensor 3 Sensor

    243–515 250–515 255–515 The water pump is rated with a capacity of 280–500 L/h,
    i.e., 78–138 mL/sec but practically underrated by the resistance due to the elevation
    and length of the water tubes. The flow rate of the water pump was calibrated
    by recording water amount from the pump. Under the circumstance of the 3-way split
    water piping to distribute water from each pump to three pots, the calibrated
    flow rate (f) of 8 mL/sec was obtained. Total amount of irrigation water (Wt)
    per pot was measured to bring dry (0% watered) soil to soaked (100% watered) soil,
    where no more water drained, e.g., 1500 mL pouring on the dry soil subtracted
    by 65 mL of the drained water, resulting in 1435 mL as 100% water holding capacity.
    The water shortage (Ws) per pot was calculated from the deviation from water moisture
    set points (40% for drought and 90% for control) multiplied by Wt using the following
    equation: (1) The operation time for the water pump was calculated by the water
    shortage divided by the pump flow rate, f using the following equation: (2) Thermometer
    and range finder The IR thermometers and LiDAR sensors were calibrated and corrected
    for the consistency among the multiple sensors. The IR thermometer was calibrated
    at multiple temperatures by attaching four sensors to a horizontal arm of a copy
    stand (402,183, Smith-Victor, Bartiett, IL, USA) and aiming down to the water
    in a glass beaker that was heated by an electric heater. Data were collected at
    six temperatures settings from 21.5 °C to 43.9 °C with approximately 5 °C increment
    with reference temperatures measured by a total emersion thermometer. The IR thermometers
    were run to record 500 readings at each temperature setting. Fig. 7(a) illustrates
    calibration of the four IR thermometers. Linear regression models were extracted
    and applied to obtain the calibrated temperatures of the IR thermometers. The
    LiDAR sensor calibration was performed at multiple distances by attaching two
    LiDAR sensors to a horizontal arm of the copy stand that is vertically adjustable
    up to 107 cm. Data were collected at 16 heights from 30 cm to 105 cm with 5 cm
    increment. 500 readings from the LiDAR sensor were recorded at each height with
    reference distances measured by a tape ruler. Fig. 7(b) illustrates calibration
    of two LiDAR sensors used for dry and wet plants. Calibration coefficients were
    derived from a linear regression model and applied for the correction of sensitivity
    and variation of the LiDAR sensors. Download : Download high-res image (354KB)

    The corrections of the calibrated values of the IR thermometers and LiDAR sensors
    were compared to the uncalibrated values in Fig. 8. The corrected values of the
    IR thermometers remained within ±0.35 °C for all eight sensors except one used
    for camelina genotype 1 of the wet plants in chamber 2 which showed −1.55 °C offset
    (Fig. 8(a)) for which an erroneous sensitivity of the sensor is suspected. The
    performance of the other seven IR thermometers stayed consistent within the manufacture
    accuracy of ±0.5 °C. The corrected values of the LiDAR sensor persisted within
    3.2 cm for all four sensors (Fig. 8(b)) which is within the range of manufacture
    accuracy of ±6 cm. The calibrated values of the temperature and distance sensors

    moisture and irrigation Fig. 9(a) shows the amount of water provided by the water
    pumps based on the soil moisture sensors. Two pots in the dry group had daily
    average water treatments of 4 mL and 15 mL, whereas those in the wet group had
    319 mL and 249 mL in camelina genotype 1 and 2, respectively. There were data
    missing on January 5–7, 2020 in chamber 1 and on December 17–19, 2019 and December
    26, 2019 to January 1, 2020 in chamber 2 due to the accidental disconnection of
    power cables. Fig. 9(b) illustrates soil moisture data from two water treatments
    in chamber 1. The initial large fluctuations in the dry group in Fig. 9(b) were
    caused by the sensor location relative to the irrigation dripper and remedied
    by repositioning the sensor closer to the dripper. Zero soil moisture on Dry1
    during December 23–27 was recorded due to a damaged sensor. Soil moisture was
    expressed in percentage water holding capacity that was converted from a full
    range of calibrated digital readings of the sensor (Table 3). Two pots in the
    dry treatment showed soil moisture in daily average of 63% and 51%, whereas those
    in the wet treatment showed 70% and 72% in camelina genotype 1 and 2, respectively.
    Daily average of soil moisture in chamber 2 under the heat (35 °C) stress reached
    47% and 40% in the dry treatment and 71% and 68% in the wet treatment in genotype
    1 and 2, respectively. These ranges were not exactly matching to the predefined
    set points of 40% and 90% but represented separation of the drought (dry treatment)
    from the control (wet treatment) with an analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the average
    daily soil moisture indicating that soil water status was significantly different
    between the irrigated and dry plants in both genotype 1 (F1,62 = 15.97, p < .0005)
    and genotype 2 (F1,66 = 3.99, p < .0005). The result indicated that automated
    irrigation successfully produced two different water treatments and effectively
    created drought environment that was used in plant phenotyping for drought resistance.

    responses of the irrigated and dry plants in chamber 2. All measurements show
    the same trend of higher canopy temperatures up to 1.49 °C in the dry plants than
    those in the wet plants (Fig. 10(a)). When plants undergo water stress, their
    stomata begin to close and cease to transpire, causing the canopy temperature
    to rise. Camelina genotype 1 showed 1.32 °C lower than genotype 2 under high temperature
    stress. ANOVA test of the average daily plant temperature showed that the canopy
    temperature was significantly different between camelina genotypes under combination
    of heat and drought (HD) stress (F1,36 = 30.36, p < .0005). Similar results were
    obtained under the individual stress of heat (H) and drought (D). The results
    of lower canopy temperature indicated that camelina genotype 1 has tolerance responses
    under H, D, and HD conditions (Fig. 10(b)). Download : Download high-res image

    of: (a) Dry and irrigated wet plants in the chamber 2 under heat stress; (b) Two
    camelina genotypes showing lower canopy temperature in genotype 1 under heat (H),
    drought (D), and heat-drought (HD) stresses. The result in chamber 1 showed that
    the height of the wet plant was gradually increased up to 79 cm until December
    23 and became decreasing to 40 cm and fluctuating from 48 to 67 cm, whereas the
    dry plant remained relatively constant at 40–50 cm (Fig. 11(a)). The plant height
    in chamber 2 showed 51 ± 2.4 cm and 38 ± 1.9 cm for the dry and irrigated plants,
    respectively. This adverse response of the plant height was caused by tall thin
    camelina plants leaning out of the sensor''s FOV. The plant height differences
    between camelina genotypes were measured manually for four treatment groups showing
    that genotype 1 is taller under all three stress conditions than genotype 2 (Fig.
    11(b)). The result indicated that camelina genotype 1 grows in lower canopy temperature
    (i.e., more leaf transpiration) and taller and has superior resistance to heat
    and drought stress. Download : Download high-res image (284KB) Download : Download

    vegetation and leaf area Fig. 12 illustrates the phenotypic responses of plant
    vegetation and leaf area measured by the multispectral camera. Plant vegetation
    of all four groups remained greenish at NDVI = 0.7 during the first three weeks
    and decreased to 0.5 except Dry2 group that stayed below 0.6 (Fig. 12(a)). The
    result indicated camelina genotype 1 grew healthier than genotype 2 in the drought
    condition, whereas NDVI in chamber 2 under the heat (35 °C) stress remained close
    (e.g., NDVI = 0.01 or less) between two genotypes. Canopy coverage gradually decreased
    from approximately 40% to 10% (Fig. 12(b)). The irregular increase and decrease
    in Wet1 and Wet2 groups during December 16–20 were caused by manual adjustment
    to keep the plants upright as they became tall and leaning out of the camera''s
    FOV. With the consideration of data from December 20, the result showed more leaf
    areas in camelina genotype 1 than those in genotype 2 in both chambers, indicating
    that camelina genotype 1 has superior performance than genotype 2 in H, D, and
    HD resistance. Download : Download high-res image (329KB) Download : Download

    stress. Discussion The soil moisture sensors responded continuously to moisture
    conditions and should be carefully calibrated with target plants to correctly
    map readings from dry to soaked soil to 0% to 100% soil moisture. As the sensitivity
    of the sensor varies on density of soil contact, a consistent method of sensor
    installation is highly recommended to avoid measurement errors caused by loose
    soil contact. The IR thermometers performed well with stable readings and corrected
    values from the calibration stayed within the manufacture accuracy. The mini LiDAR
    sensor had consistent accuracy within 3.2 cm from the sensor calibration but showed
    measurement errors caused by tall thin camelina plants leaning out of the sensor''s
    narrow FOV of 2°. Thus, it is recommended to use the sensor on the plant with
    broad leaves for accurate height measurement. The performance of the HTP system
    developed in this study is compared with prior studies which were either irrigation
    [[28], [29], [47]], or phenotyping [[35], [36], [37], [48]] not integrating both
    nor fully deploying open-source hardware and software packages. Prior studies
    of RPi-based phenotyping [41,2,42] were limited to an imaging tool using a color
    camera only, whereas the system developed in this study is featured with tri-metric
    phenotyping metrics: canopy temperature, plant height, vegetation/leaf area indexes
    from a multispectral camera. Granier et al. [1] discussed image-based phenotyping
    of plant responses to soil water deficit in a growth chamber but using a color
    camera only without open-source packages. The HTP system performs characterizing
    phenotypes of plant traits but needs to be coupled with a variable rate irrigation
    system in a growth chamber to simulate the drought stress by controlling the amount
    of water to plants. The great value of the system lies in the use of open-source
    hardware and software packages as well as multispectral image (MSI)-based plant
    phenotyping that can maximize the difference of spectral signature of the plants
    in visible and near-infrared bands through image analytics software [49]. Using
    PWM signals from the Arduino allowed the simplicity of the MSI camera trigger.
    Conclusions Current application provided a cost-effective HTP system for plant
    phenotyping and irrigation control using open-source hardware and software packages.
    The proposed system achieved the aim of remote monitoring of plant phenotypes
    using Arduino-RPi and image analytics, integration of irrigation controller for
    water management, and identifying phenotypic responses to abiotic stress. The
    system design was detailed for the seamless integration of sensors and actuators
    with sensor calibration and power management for the accuracy and reliability
    of the system. The system was able to phenotypically differentiate two camelina
    genotypes based on their canopy temperature and height as well as vegetation and
    leaf area. The open-source sensor integration offers a real potential for the
    applied plant scientists to achieve on plant breeding and physiological assessment
    at cost-effective design of an automated control and monitoring system. The total
    cost of the system for each growth chamber was USD 874, and its weight was only
    1.7 kg. With cost-effective, portable, and energy-efficient features, this system
    can be easily adopted for other sensing and control applications such as in greenhouses,
    vertical farms, or outdoor fields. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors

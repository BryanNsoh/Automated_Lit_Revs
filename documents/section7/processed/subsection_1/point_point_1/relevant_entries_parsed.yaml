    Grapevines. American Journal of Enology and Viticulture, 66(2), 251-255.
  data_sources: Vine transpiration measurements, vine physiological parameters
  explanation: The study described the development of an automated water-supply device
    to conduct long-term water-deficit experiments on potted grapevines. This system
    precisely controls water replenishment based on real-time measurements of vine
    transpiration, gravimetrically or through whole-canopy gas exchange, making it
    well-suited for studying plant responses to varying water availability.
  extract_1: '"In addition to relieving operators of laborious and time-consuming
    manual irrigation, the system provides the ability to adjust water supply to actual
    water use as measured concurrently in a grapevine-enclosure system and enables
    customization of the water supply according to the size and transpiration potential
    of each vine."'
  extract_2: '"The proposed system is a “closed-loop” process in which the operator
    defines a general control strategy, after which the control system determines
    when and how much water to apply based on feedback from one or more sensors (Zazueta
    et al. 1993)."'

  key_findings: The automated water-supply apparatus effectively adjusted water delivery
    based on real-time measurements of vine transpiration, ensuring reliable water
    replenishment under varying water availability. The system maintained vine water
    status and enabled customizable water supply adjustments according to vine size
    and transpiration potential.

  data_sources: Field survey, Literature review
  explanation: The study titled "Automated Irrigation System for Efficient and Portable
    Farming" aims to develop an automated irrigation system for optimal water and
    electricity usage in agricultural settings. The system integrates both moisture-based
    and timer-based control mechanisms to overcome the limitations of existing approaches.
    By integrating moisture sensors with a real-time clock, the system automatically
    adjusts irrigation schedules based on soil conditions while adhering to predefined
    timetables.
  extract_1: The proposed system consists of RTC module, so the date and time is set
    in the controller and accordingly the water is given to the crops. Furthermore,
    to make the system robust, sensors are employed in the soil.
  extract_2: The proposed hardware is shown in Fig. 8. It has one rack which contains
    3 layers; each layer has different placement in it and independent irrigation
    control.
  inline_citation: (Desai et al., 2023)
  key_findings: The proposed system combines moisture sensors with a real-time clock
    to optimize irrigation schedules, resulting in significant savings in electricity
    and water consumption. The integrated approach enhances the system's resilience
    and fault tolerance, reducing the need for manual intervention.
  limitations: The study was conducted in a controlled environment using a rack structure
    and may need adaptation for different farming conditions and crop types.
  main_objective: To develop a fully automated irrigation system that integrates moisture-based
    and timer-based control for optimal water and electricity usage.
  relevance_evaluation: This paper is highly relevant to the point of focus regarding
    strategies for ensuring robustness and reliability in automated irrigation systems.
    It specifically addresses the challenge of optimizing water and electricity usage
    while enhancing the system's resilience and fault tolerance. The paper's findings
    on integrating moisture and timer-based control contribute to the development
    of more efficient and reliable automated irrigation systems.

    Water Allocation by Integration of Hydro-Economic Modeling with Bayesian Networks
    and Random Forest Approaches. Water Resources Management, 33(7), 2277-2299.
  data_sources: Historical water use data, crop production costs, crop prices, irrigation
    network characteristics
  explanation: The research in question employs a well-established and flexible modeling
    framework to examine the real-time allocation of irrigation water across various
    irrigation networks. This hydro-economic model considers water use optimization,
    water availability, and economic factors to make informed allocation decisions.
    By quantifying the economic value of water for different crops in each network,
    the model assigns allocation priorities based on crop profitability. The study's
    originality lies in the incorporation of Bayesian Networks and Random Forest algorithms
    to automate the allocation process, effectively replacing the complex hydro-economic
    model while maintaining accuracy.
  extract_1: This framework has been extensively used; for example, to analyze water
    and agricultural policies, preserve groundwater resources and subsistence of farmers
    in a region in Spain (Varela-Ortega et al., 2011), study the various economic,
    social, and environmental effects of different policy-making and of climate change
    in the Guadiana river on the Portuguese/Spanish border (Blanco-Gutiérrez et al.,
    2013), and to evaluate the economic costs of pumping groundwater in the Central
    Valley of California (Medellín-Azuara et al., 2015).
  extract_2: The modeling framework in this study can be classified as a hydro-economic
    simulation model. Simulation models are extensively used to simulate behaviors
    of complex water resources systems. Most water allocation models are founded on
    mass balance principles and use a network linear program defined by the priorities
    of the user to allocate resources in a river system (Bekchanov et al., 2015).
  inline_citation: (Sherafatpour, Roozbahani, & Hasani, 2019)
  key_findings: The Nekoabad Network had the highest priority for water allocation
    based on economic value, followed by Barkhar, Mahyar, Sonati, Abshar, and Rodasht
    Networks. The Bayesian Network and Random Forest models demonstrated high accuracy
    in automating water allocation and predicting economic, social, and water resources
    indicators.
  limitations: This study relies on data from a specific region (Zayandeh Rood River
    Basin in Iran) and a limited time period (44 water years). The transferability
    and generalizability of the findings to other regions or longer timeframes may
    require further investigation.
  main_objective: To develop an integrated hydro-economic model for allocating agricultural
    water based on its economic value and to explore the potential of Bayesian Networks
    and Random Forest algorithms for automating the allocation process.
  relevance_evaluation: The paper is highly relevant to the point being made, as it
    directly addresses the need for robust and reliable strategies to ensure resilience
    and reliability in the face of failures, disruptions, or unexpected events within
    automated irrigation systems. The authors propose a hydro-economic model that
    integrates optimization, water availability constraints, and economic factors
    to allocate water resources in a way that maximizes economic value and minimizes
    negative impacts on employment, productivity, and reliability. This approach is
    particularly valuable in semi-arid and arid regions like Iran, where water scarcity
    and competition for resources are significant challenges.
